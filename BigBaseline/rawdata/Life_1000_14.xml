==Impact on Music==

Jordana's work has influenced other artists such as well known [[dubstep]] producer [[Bassnectar]] who heavily sampled ''5 A.M. Rinse (feat. MC Sphinx)'', the last song on her first album ''When Worlds Collide'' for his song ''Here We Go'' off of his 2010 EP and single ''[[Timestretch (album)|Timestretch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=iphoneunclockseattle|title=Bassnectar's Here We Go sample of 1.8.7 feat.

In 1999 Drum &amp; Bass/Hip Hop producer and label owner Hive approached Jordana to remix her song ''Defcon-1'' also off of ''When Worlds Collide''. Hive's remix appears on his 2001 album ''The Raw Uncut''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hive – The Raw Uncut EP|url=http://www.discogs.com/Hive-The-Raw-Uncut-EP/release/70304|work=Discogs|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordana collaborated with [[Lady Sovereign]] on a song early in Sov's career after the two met through an internet chat room for StrikeFM.co.uk, an online radio station which Jordana had a show, and the now defunct UKGargageWorldwide.com forums. The two would later team up when Jordana under her Lady J alias, had Lady Sovereign MC for her radio show on Flex 103.6FM London.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Https:_December_21_2015c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flexfm.net/site/index.php |title=: : Welcome to the FLEX FM NETWORK - Home of FLEX 103.6 FM - LONDON : : |newspaper=Https: |date= |author= |accessdate=December 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020601214235/http://www.flexfm.net/site/index.php |archivedate=June 1, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand based Dubstep and Drum &amp; Bass producer Alexis K/Unsub has also cited Jordana as an influence and the two are collaborating on music and a possible tour.

==History==

Jordana first came to the attention of the music industry when she was asked to remix Blondie's "Atomic." Her "Beautiful Drum &amp; Bass Remix" appeared along with Armand Van Helden and Diddy's remixes on the single.&lt;ref name="Group1999"/&gt; A little over a year following that release Mac McFarlane, the promoter of the well established and legendary New York City Drum'n'Bass club night, Konkrete Jungle, contacted Jordana to create a Konkrete Jungle themed song for a CD compilation/mix-CD. Jordana created the song "Konkrete Jungle" for that purpose. Described by CMJ as containing "menacing hardstep attacks"&lt;ref name="Inc.1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=CMJ Network, Inc.|title=CMJ New Music Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ikEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62|date=October 1998|publisher=CMJ Network, Inc.|pages=62–|issn=1074-6978}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was released on the Ultra Records compilation, "Konkrete Jungle - Maximum Drum &amp; Bass," mixed by BBC Radio 1 Drum'n'Bass show regular host Jumping Jack Frost. Following extensive touring throughout North America and abroad as a live Drum &amp; Bass artist, Liquid Sky Music, an indie label distributed by Caroline Distribution signed her to a three-album contract in late 1996.

==Hate Crime in Ohio==

On the night of February 22, 2000 in Kent, Ohio Jordana was attacked and brutally beaten in a transphobic hate crime by a group of men including Matthew Gostlin of Akron, Ohio.&lt;ref name="Maximum Rocknroll"&gt;{{cite book|title=Maximum Rocknroll|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SHVbAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%221.8.7%22+bass&amp;dq=%221.8.7%22+bass|year=2000|publisher=Maximum Rock 'n' Roll}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gostlin and other assailants jumped her in the parking lot outside of "The Robin Hood" nightclub where she had just performed on the Cities Collection tour. The attack took place while she was escorted from the event with the event promoter to the promoters car. The group of men attacked suddenly and Jordana lost consciousness almost immediately after being struck in the face. She suffered nerve damage to the lower part of her face from her lower lip down as a result. 
She was quoted as saying in the May issue of CMJ New Music Monthly that in the seconds just prior to the attack: "I saw his face. I remember the look on his face. It was this look of utter hate, like 'I'm going to kill you.'"&lt;ref name="Inc.2000.4"&gt;{{cite book|author=CMJ Network, Inc.|title=CMJ New Music Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GioEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13|date=May 2000|publisher=CMJ Network, Inc.|pages=13|issn=1074-6978}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Meesig of Cleveland, Ohio shoved one of the men away and helped Jordana.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Villagevoice.com_December_21_2015c.1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/music-6395337 |title=Music |newspaper=Villagevoice.com |date= |author= |accessdate= December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the Village Voice following the attack, Meesig stated that Gostlin had "misgendered" her.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Other reports from people on the message board for Breakbeat Science (a NYC based Drum'n'Bass record store) mentioned transphobic slurs being shouted during the attack.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Villagevoice.com_December_21_2015c.1"/&gt; Jordana subsequently cancelled the tour to recover.&lt;ref name="Maximum Rocknroll"/&gt; Gostlin, while charged, was never arrested nor spent any time in court. Jordana's family was told by the Portage County (Ohio) prosecutor's office that attempts had been made to serve the warrant but Gostlin's whereabouts were unknown. As a result of no movement on the case by the authorities, Jordana felt that justice would not be served. They{{clarify|reason=Who is "they"?|date=June 2016}} left the U.S. for England because of their concerns about personal safety and well-being.

==Additional Work in Music Industry==

In addition to production Jordana has also been a DJ, musician and singer. In 2001–2002 Jordana worked at Flex FM in London, England as Lady J with [[Lady Sovereign]] MCing for her during Jordana's radio show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ukmusic.com/forum/chit-chat/lock-in-to-flex-fm-2nite-10911.html|title = Lock in to FLex FM 2nite|last = Sovereign|first = Lady|date = May 18, 2002|work = ukmusic.com/|accessdate = May 30, 2013|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140810062924/http://www.ukmusic.com/forum/chit-chat/lock-in-to-flex-fm-2nite-10911.html|archive-date = August 10, 2014|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 she held a club residency spinning [[UK Garage]], [[2-Step Garage]] and [[House Music]] at legendary club night Trinity in London's Vauxhall neighborhood.

'''Justin David Blau''' (born January 9, 1991),&lt;ref name="ablau"/&gt; better known by his stage name '''3LAU''' (pronounced "Blau"),&lt;ref name="gblau"/&gt; is an American DJ and [[electronic dance music]] producer. Based in [[Las Vegas]], he has released three mixtapes since 2011 and several singles, and has performed at festivals such as [[Electric Zoo]] in New York and EDC Vegas.&lt;ref name="bblau"/&gt; In 2014 he released the track "Vikings" with Botnek on [[Dim Mak Records]].&lt;ref name="jblauallmusicbio"/&gt;

==Early life==
Justin David Blau was born in [[Syosset]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States on {{birth date and age|1991|01|09}}.&lt;ref name="ablau"/&gt; Blau grew up around an artistic family, and was soon playing piano, playing guitar and singing. At thirteen, he moved with his family to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he spent the rest of his youth.&lt;ref name="bblau"/&gt; He attended [[The Meadows School]] for high school and [[Washington University in St. Louis]] for college.&lt;ref name="bblau"/&gt;

== Background ==
Much of 3LAU's music incorporates [[electro house]], [[dubstep]], [[deep house]], and [[progressive house]].&lt;ref name="dblau" /&gt; He is known for his melodic take on dance music and live sets that incorporate [[sampling (music)|sampling]]. He is also known for using [[Ableton]].

==Music career==

===2011–12: First releases===
In 2011, at the age of 20, he vacationed in Sweden, where he discovered electronic dance music. After returning to college he started producing mashups, "mainly because [he] didn't think anyone was doing a good job."&lt;ref name="cblau"/&gt; He soon began mixing under the professional name 3LAU, and by June of that year was uploading mashups to YouTube.&lt;ref name="jblauallmusicbio"/&gt;

3LAU gained recognition in the [[electronic music]] world in 2011 with his two bootlegs, "Girls Who Save the World" and "All Night Long". He also won a remix competition for his remix of [[Tiesto]]'s "Work Hard, Play Hard".

Before 2012, 3LAU spent his days studying at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and DJing at night. He has had remixes charts in the top 10 on both [[Beatport]] and [[Hype Machine]].&lt;ref name="dblau"/&gt;

===2012–15: Singles, touring===
In 2012, he focused on DJing and launched his 3LAU Your Mind tour. That same year, he released his second bootleg album, ''Dance Floor Filth''.&lt;ref name="dblau"/&gt; In 2012, the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' described him as "one of America's fastest-rising DJ-producers."&lt;ref name="bblau"/&gt; In 2012 he released ''Dance Floor Filth 2'', an album featuring his production.&lt;ref name="iblau"/&gt;

In late 2013, he went on a short tour with Carnage called the Night Riot tour.&lt;ref name="eblauboston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hblau"/&gt; Wrote Jonah Ollman of ''Sound of Boston'' about 3LAU's live performances in late 2013, "A nice balance of mashups, electro-house, poppy vocal samples, and a 90’s throwback here and there keep the young 20-something crowd going and constantly entertained."&lt;ref name="eblauboston"/&gt;

In the summer of 2015, 3LAU did his first European tour visiting Barcelona, Germany and Ibiza. Later that fall, he went on his first Asian tour which included Bangkok, Jakarta, Tokyo and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tour|url = http://www.3lau.com/tour|website = Tour|access-date = 2016-01-11|language = en-US|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160117071736/http://www.3lau.com/tour|archive-date = 2016-01-17|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A-Lin''' ({{zh|c=阿玲|p=Ā Líng}}), also known by her birth name '''Huang Li-ling''' and her [[Amis people|Amis]] name '''Lisang Pacidal Koyouan''', is an [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal]] [[Music of Taiwan|Taiwanese]] [[pop music|pop]] [[singer]], [[lyricist]], and occasional [[composer]] of [[Amis people|Amis]] descent.

==Career==
In 1999, when A-Lin was 16 years old and taught children to sing the hymn “[[Amazing Grace]]” after the [[921 earthquake]] in [[Nantou County]], she was discovered by her former agent. However, he was not available when she wanted to give him contact information. Fortunately, four years later, A-Lin met him again in a bar where she sang regularly. She was officially offered a singing contract.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woNRarO0ZZU Little Swallows Night 2011-11-25 pt.2/3 Dingdang A-Lin]&lt;/ref&gt;

A-Lin made her debut in the world of music at the end of 2006, achieving rapid commercial success. She has been called the next [[A-Mei]], who is an aboriginal singer of [[Puyuma people|Puyuma]] descent. She also got the nickname 天生歌姬, meaning "A Born Diva". A-Lin was often quoted as saying that A-Mei is highly influential to her music and often covers A-Mei's songs in music shows and concerts. A-Lin has won numerous music awards and is extremely popular within Mandarin-speaking world.

A-Lin has performed internationally and at a sold-out concert with [[Xiao Yu (singer)|Xiao Yu]] and [[Shin (singer)|Shin]] in 2012 at the [[Sydney Town Hall]]. It was her first visit to Sydney and people flew in from different cities just to see her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://corporate.valentlau.com.au/blog/a-lin-sydney-live-concert/ | title = Sydney Live Concert with Xiaoyu and Shin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, with [[Avex Taiwan]] exiting the market due to overall poor sales from the records, all singers under [[Avex]] like Huang Li-ling were allowed to terminate their contracts early.

After terminating her contract, A-Lin signed with her new label Sony Music. In December 2014, she released her first album after leaving Avex. This album was nominated for Best Mandarin Female Singer, making her fourth nomination without any win.

In 2015, she participated in the third season of [[I Am a Singer (Chinese TV series)|I Am a Singer]] and came in sixth on the finale held in March 2015. As a result, her singing ability was recognized by more people and provided a boost to her career.

==Style==
While A-Lin considers herself as an [[Contralto]], she has been noted to have an extremely wide vocal range closely identical to that of [[Amanda Seyfried]], as noted in many of her songs to have over two octaves or more, and in the concert in Auckland, New Zealand, she was suffering from illnesses that made her unable to hit her falsetto range.  She has also notably performed "Remember", by [[A-Mei]], in [[infantile speech]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZzouYGKGjE A-Lin's "Remember" in infantile speech]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
A-Lin is the youngest in her family, her parents are [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]s and love music.
A-Lin's older sister is Taiwanese model Lea Huang,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y66wKo3Mow A-Lin's sister appeared in her autograph session]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=506240312729213 Lea Huang on Facebook - Lea &amp; A-Lin - Someone Like You (by Adele)]&lt;/ref&gt; who herself entered the Super Star competition in Taiwan in July 2013 as an aspiring singer in her own right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_jpXNEu0dE Lea Huang-Remember (by A-Mei）]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, after A-Lin entered I Am A Singer, Lea became a contestant for ‘The most beautiful harmonies’ (最美和聲). They also have an older brother, and A-Lin's cousin-in-law is her fitness coach and also a guitarist.  A-Lin was extremely popular as a student and the confidence she gained from this led to her decision to compete in a 'Singing Strength Elite Rivalry Competition' [歌唱實力精英角逐比賽]. She chose the hit song 'At least you are still there' [至少還有你], by [[Sandy Lam]], and the competition allowed A-Lin to believe she had a future as a professional singer. In reference to talent shows being readily accessible to young people these days, A-Lin commented, "I am impressed that there is now a ''[[Million Star]]''-type of singing platform, which allows both everyone who enjoys singing and those who are talented singers a tough but realistic chance - an accomplished dream." They also have a brother.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWRI9Swjpos A-Lin released the third album "In the past, in the future" and received their good wishes from relatives and friends VCR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=def2XWeRiXg SS Little Swallows Night 2013-01-14 A-Lin、Lea and her mother part 1 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1 July 2007, A-Lin married [[Huang Kan-lin]], a well-known Taiwanese baseball player. They have a daughter, Huang Qiaoyu. (A-Lin said: "At the first time Huang Kan-lin requested a song "How Do I Live" &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr4kbVNB5rk Live LeAnn Rimes - How Do I Live]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[LeAnn Rimes]] in her Tainan Pub Session.  However, at that time because of his poor English, he wrote “Good Do A-Lin " on a piece of paper and then spelled the song in homophonic Mandarin. The implication was that he wanted to chase after A-Lin because of her rich lips.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXCpR6_OUU0 Little Swallow Night 2011-11-25 pt.1/3 Dingdang A-Lin ]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Huang Kan-lin proposed to A-Lin successfully by a new recorded song " 愛情問怎麼走 (How Love Will Go)".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vORYmdlbJjM I love Heisehui-A Taiwanese variety show_1_(2007 Jul 5)]&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Early life==
Born into a family of six as the last child, A-Q real name Gilbert Bani was raised in Surulere where he has lived for most of his life.

A-Q attended Kings College Lagos, and had his tertiary education at the University of Lagos. At a young age he started collecting hip-hop tracks, learning the lyrics and miming them. It didn’t take long before he started writing his own lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9jaolofofo.com.ng/super-sunday-9jaolofofo-meets-rapper-aq-exclusive-interview/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130714002417/http://9jaolofofo.com.ng/super-sunday-9jaolofofo-meets-rapper-aq-exclusive-interview/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-14 |title=9jaolofofo Meets Rapper ‘A-Q’ (Exclusive Interview) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
A-Q signed his first record deal in 2001 with Big Leaf Records where he was for two years before he started working on his own in 2003. His first single "(W)rap Nigeria", produced by kraftmatics, debuted in 2004 followed by a music video. He subsequently released a full compilation album ''Listen and Understand'' in 2005 followed by another single, "Things That We Do", which got him an international online distribution deal. In 2006 A-Q put out a mixtape titled ''Maga Must Pay vol 1.''

A-Q took a break from music to finish his education in [[University of Lagos]] but still managed to release a single, "Make Money", and accompanying video in 2008 produced by Laylow and featuring Morachi and Xtrim off an online mixtape titled ''Love and Money.''

A-Q graduated in 2010 and returned to the entertainment industry, this time co-floating a record label, Hustle Inc, on whose platform he started Black Friday Twitter Freestyles, a weekly free download release. This got him online acknowledgement including from producer Don Jazzy who styled him “one of the sickest rappers alive”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.underdarock.com/blog/don-jazzy-calls-a-q-one-of-the-sickest-rapper-alive/|title= one of the sickest rappers alive (Don Jazzy calls A-Q one of the sickest rapper alive)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded and released ''The Past Present and Future'' album in December 2010 which had the singles "Names" and "Champagne and Rum". He released more music including "Distractions" featuring Vector in 2012, "Machine Gun Flow", "555 (5beats 5verses and 5blessings)", and "Why" featuring Pamela.

He released an EP in December 2012 titled ''Make Your Best Rapper Look Stupid.'' He is currently working on his sophomore album titled ''G.I.L.B.E.R.T (Grace and Glory).''

'''A Mít''' (born 1997) is a [[Vietnam]]ese [[association football|footballer]] of ethnic [[Degar]] descent who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[V-League (Vietnam)]] club [[SHB Đà Nẵng F.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{soccerway|mit-a/435760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
A Mít was born one of eight children to a poor [[Degar]] family of melon farmers in [[Kon Tum]]. At the age of just 12 A Mít traveled to [[Pleiku]] to join the [[Hoang Anh Gia Lai – Arsenal JMG Academy|HAGL – Arsenal JMG Academy]]. However A Mít's small size and frequent injuries and sicknesses caused him to quit and go back to his families farm. A couple years latter a scout from [[SHB Đà Nẵng F.C.|SHB Đà Nẵng]] took notice and invited A Mít to the club's academy. A Mít showed impressive improvement and in 2016 made his league debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tiền vệ A Mít (SHB Đà Nẵng): Người con núi rừng làm dậy sóng sông Hàn|url=http://bongdaplus.vn/tin-tuc/viet-nam/v-league/tien-ve-a-mit-shb-da-nang-nguoi-con-nui-rung-lam-day-song-song-han-1511161604.html|author=Ngọc Anh|website=Bong Da Plus|date=20 April 2016|accessdate=12 May 2016|language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''agent-based model''' ('''ABM''') is a class of [[computational models]] for [[computer simulation|simulating]] the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole. It combines elements of [[game theory]], [[complex systems]], [[emergence]], [[computational sociology]], [[multi-agent system]]s, and [[evolutionary programming]]. [[Monte Carlo method]]s are used to introduce randomness.  Particularly within ecology, ABMs are also called '''individual-based models''' ('''IBMs'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grimm |first1=Volker |first2=Steven F. |last2=Railsback |title=Individual-based Modeling and Ecology |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2005 |pages=485 |isbn=978-0-691-09666-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals within IBMs may be simpler than fully autonomous agents within ABMs. A review of recent literature on individual-based models, agent-based models, and multiagent systems shows that ABMs are used on non-computing related scientific domains including [[biology]], ecology and [[social science]].&lt;ref name="Niazi-Hussain"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Amir |last2=Hussain |year=2011 |title=Agent-based Computing from Multi-agent Systems to Agent-Based Models: A Visual Survey |journal=Scientometrics |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=479–499 |doi=10.1007/s11192-011-0468-9 |url=http://cecosm.yolasite.com/resources/Accepted_Scientometrics_ABM_Website.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012005027/http://cecosm.yolasite.com/resources/Accepted_Scientometrics_ABM_Website.pdf |archivedate=October 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes|arxiv=1708.05872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agent-based modeling is related to, but distinct from, the concept of '''[[multi-agent system]]s''' or '''multi-agent simulation''' in that the goal of ABM is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents obeying simple rules, typically in natural systems, rather than in designing agents or solving specific practical or engineering problems.&lt;ref name="Niazi-Hussain"/&gt;

Agent-based models are a kind of [[Microscale and macroscale models|microscale model]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Leif |last1=Gustafsson |first2=Mikael |last2=Sternad |year=2010 |title=Consistent micro, macro, and state-based population modelling |journal=Mathematical Biosciences |volume=225 |issue=2 |pages=94–107 |doi=10.1016/j.mbs.2010.02.003 |pmid=20171974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple agents in an attempt to re-create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena. The process is one of [[emergence]] from the lower (micro) level of systems to a higher (macro) level. As such, a key notion is that simple behavioral rules generate complex behavior. This principle, known as [[KISS principle|K.I.S.S.]] ("Keep it simple, stupid"), is extensively adopted in the modeling community. Another central tenet is that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  Individual agents are typically characterized as boundedly rational, presumed to be acting in what they perceive as their own interests, such as reproduction, economic benefit, or social status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://policy.rutgers.edu/andrews/projects/abm/abmarticle.htm |title=Agent-Based Models of Industrial Ecosystems |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |date=October 6, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720041914/http://policy.rutgers.edu/andrews/projects/abm/abmarticle.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; using heuristics or simple decision-making rules. ABM agents may experience "learning", adaptation, and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/suppl_3/7280 |title=Agent-based modeling: Methods and techniques for simulating human systems |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=99 |pages=7280–7 |date=May 14, 2002 |doi=10.1073/pnas.082080899 |pmid=12011407 |pmc=128598 |last1=Bonabeau |first1=E. |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.7280B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most agent-based models are composed of: (1) numerous agents specified at various scales (typically referred to as agent-granularity); (2) decision-making heuristics; (3) learning rules or adaptive processes; (4) an interaction topology; and (5) an environment. ABMs are typically implemented as [[computer simulation]]s, either as custom software, or via ABM toolkits, and this software can be then used to test how changes in individual behaviors will affect the system's emerging overall behavior.

==History==
The idea of agent-based modeling was developed as a relatively simple concept in the late 1940s. Since it requires computation-intensive procedures, it did not become widespread until the 1990s.

===Early developments===
The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the [[Von Neumann universal constructor|Von Neumann machine]], a theoretical machine capable of reproduction. The device [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then built upon by von Neumann's friend [[Stanislaw Ulam]], also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up—creating the first of the devices later termed [[cellular automata]].
Another advance was introduced by the mathematician [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]].  He constructed the well-known [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]. Unlike von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by tremendously simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional [[checkerboard]].

===1970s and 1980s: the first models===

One of the earliest agent-based models in concept was [[Thomas Schelling]]'s segregation model,&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schelling |first=Thomas C. |title=Dynamic Models of Segregation |year=1971 |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=143–186 |url=http://zolaist.org/wiki/images/c/cf/Models_of_Segregation.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1080/0022250x.1971.9989794}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was discussed in his paper "Dynamic Models of Segregation" in 1971.  Though Schelling originally used coins and graph paper rather than computers, his models embodied the basic concept of agent-based models as autonomous agents interacting in a shared environment with an observed aggregate, emergent outcome.

In the early 1980s, [[Robert Axelrod]] hosted a tournament of [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] strategies and had them interact in an agent-based manner to determine a winner.  Axelrod would go on to develop many other agent-based models in the field of political science that examine phenomena from [[ethnocentrism]] to the dissemination of culture.&lt;ref name="Axelrod_1997"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Axelrod |given=Robert |authorlink=Robert Axelrod |year=1997 |title=The Complexity of Cooperation: Agent-Based Models of Competition and Collaboration |publisher=Princeton: Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-01567-5 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the late 1980s, [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]]' work on [[flocking behavior|flocking]] models contributed to the development of some of the first biological agent-based models that contained social characteristics. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as [[artificial life]], a term coined by [[Christopher Langton]].

The first use of the word "agent" and a definition as it is currently used today is hard to track down.  One candidate appears to be [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]] and John H. Miller's 1991 paper "Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory",&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holland |first1=J.H. |last2=Miller |first2=J.H. |title=Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory |year=1991 |journal=American Economic Review |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=365–71 |url=http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/papers/aaa.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027152415/http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/papers/aaa.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-10-27 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on an earlier conference presentation of theirs.

At the same time, during the 1980s, social scientists, mathematicians, operations researchers, and a scattering of people from other disciplines developed Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory (CMOT).  This field grew as a special interest group of The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS) and its sister society, the Operations Research Society of America (ORSA).

===1990s: expansion===
With the appearance of StarLogo in 1990, [[Swarm (simulation)|Swarm]] and [[NetLogo]] in the mid-1990s and [[Repast (modeling toolkit)|RePast]] and [[AnyLogic]] in 2000, or GAMA&lt;ref&gt;[http://gama-platform.org/ GAMA]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 as well as some custom-designed code, modelling software became widely available and the range of domains that ABM was applied to, grew.  Bonabeau (2002) is a good survey of the potential of agent-based modeling as of the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bonabeau |first=Eric |title=Agent-based modeling: methods and techniques for simulating human systems |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=7280–7287 |year=2002 |doi=10.1073/pnas.082080899 |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.7280B |pmid=12011407 |pmc=128598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s were especially notable for the expansion of ABM within the social sciences, one notable effort was the large-scale ABM, [[Sugarscape]], developed by
[[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, and transmission of disease and even culture.&lt;ref name="GAS"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Joshua M. |last1=Epstein |authorlink1=Joshua M. Epstein |first2=Robert |last2=Axtell |authorlink2=Robert Axtell |title=Growing artificial societies: social science from the bottom up |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |date=October 11, 1996 |pages=224 |isbn=978-0-262-55025-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable 1990s developments included [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s [[Kathleen Carley]] ABM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/construct/index.php |title=Construct |publisher=Computational Analysis of Social Organizational Systems |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explore the co-evolution of social networks and culture.
During this 1990s timeframe [[Nigel Gilbert]] published the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the social scientist (1999) and established a journal from the perspective of social sciences: the ''[[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]]'' (JASSS). Other than JASSS, agent-based models of any discipline are within scope of SpringerOpen journal ''[[Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling]]'' (CASM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casmodeling.com Springer Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling Journal (CASM)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the mid-1990s, the social sciences thread of ABM began to focus on such issues as designing effective teams, understanding the communication required for organizational effectiveness, and the behavior of social networks.  CMOT—later renamed Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)—incorporated more and more agent-based modeling.  Samuelson (2000) is a good brief overview of the early history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Douglas A. |title=Designing Organizations |journal=OR/MS Today |date=December 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Samuelson (2005) and Samuelson and Macal (2006) trace the more recent developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Douglas A. |title=Agents of Change |journal=OR/MS Today |date=February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.orms-today.org/orms-8-06/fragent.html |last1=Samuelson |first1=Douglas A. |last2=Macal |first2=Charles M. |title=Agent-Based Modeling Comes of Age |journal=OR/MS Today |date=August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the merger of TIMS and ORSA to form [[INFORMS]], and the move by INFORMS from two meetings each year to one, helped to spur the CMOT group to form a separate society, the North American Association for Computational Social and Organizational Sciences (NAACSOS).  Kathleen Carley was a major contributor, especially to models of social networks, obtaining [[National Science Foundation]] funding for the annual conference and serving as the first President of NAACSOS.  She was succeeded by David Sallach of the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Argonne National Laboratory]], and then by Michael Prietula&lt;ref&gt;[http://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/academic_areas/isom/prietula_michael.html Michael Prietula]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Emory University]]. At about the same time NAACSOS began, the [[European Social Simulation Association]] (ESSA) and the Pacific Asian Association for Agent-Based Approach in Social Systems Science (PAAA), counterparts of NAACSOS, were organized.  As of 2013, these three organizations collaborate internationally.  The First World Congress on Social Simulation was held under their joint sponsorship in Kyoto, Japan, in August 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The Second World Congress was held in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., in July 2008, with [[George Mason University]] taking the lead role in local arrangements.

===2000s and later===

More recently, [[Ron Sun]] developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as [[cognitive social simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sun |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Sun |title=Cognition and Multi-Agent Interaction: From Cognitive Modeling to Social Simulation |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2006 |url=http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0-521-83964-5 |isbn=978-0-521-83964-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill McKelvey, Suzanne Lohmann, Dario Nardi, Dwight Read and others at [[UCLA]] have also made significant contributions in organizational behavior and decision-making.  Since 2001, UCLA has arranged a conference at Lake Arrowhead, California, that has become another major gathering point for practitioners in this field.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In 2014, Sadegh Asgari from [[Columbia University]] and his colleagues developed an agent-based model of the construction competitive bidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Developing a Virtual Laboratory for Construction Bidding Environment Using Agent-Based Modeling |journal=Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering |date=2014-10-06 |pages=04014105 |volume=29 |issue=6 |doi=10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000440 |first=R. |last=Awwad |first2=S. |last2=Asgari |first3=A. |last3=Kandil}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his model was used to analyze the low-bid lump-sum construction bids, it could be applied to other bidding methods with little modifications to the model.

==Theory==
Most computational modeling research describes systems in [[Steady state|equilibrium]] or as moving between equilibria. Agent-based modeling, however, using simple rules, can result in different sorts of complex and interesting behavior.  The three ideas central to agent-based models are agents as objects, [[emergence]], and [[complexity]].

Agent-based models consist of dynamically interacting rule-based agents. The systems within which they interact can create real-world-like complexity.  Typically agents are
[[situated]] in space and time and reside in networks or in lattice-like neighborhoods. The location of the agents and their responsive behavior are encoded in [[algorithm]]ic form in computer programs.  In some cases, though not always, the agents may be considered as intelligent and purposeful.  In ecological ABM (often referred to as "individual-based models" in ecology), agents may, for example, be trees in forest, and would not be considered intelligent, although they may be "purposeful" in the sense of optimizing access to a resource (such as water).
The modeling process is best described as [[inductive reasoning|inductive]]. The modeler makes those assumptions thought most relevant to the situation at hand and then watches phenomena emerge from the agents' interactions. Sometimes that result is an equilibrium. Sometimes it is an emergent pattern. Sometimes, however, it is an unintelligible mangle.

In some ways, agent-based models complement traditional analytic methods. Where analytic methods enable humans to characterize the equilibria of a system, agent-based models allow the possibility of generating those equilibria. This generative contribution may be the most mainstream of the potential benefits of agent-based modeling. Agent-based models can explain the emergence of higher-order patterns—network structures of terrorist organizations and the Internet, [[power-law distributions]] in the sizes of traffic jams, wars, and stock-market crashes, and social segregation that persists despite populations of tolerant people. Agent-based models also can be used to identify lever points, defined as moments in time in which interventions have extreme consequences, and to distinguish among types of path dependency.

Rather than focusing on stable states, many models consider a system's robustness—the ways that complex systems adapt to internal and external pressures so as to maintain their functionalities. The task of harnessing that complexity requires consideration of the agents themselves—their diversity, connectedness, and level of interactions.

Recent work on the Modeling and simulation of Complex Adaptive Systems has demonstrated the need for combining agent-based and complex network based models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aditya Kurve |author2=Khashayar Kotobi |author3=George Kesidis |title=An agent-based framework for performance modeling of an optimistic parallel discrete event simulator |journal=Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling |volume=1 |pages=12 |doi=10.1186/2194-3206-1-12 |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Muaz A.

# Complex Network Modeling Level for developing models using interaction data of various system components.
# Exploratory Agent-based Modeling Level for developing agent-based models for assessing the feasibility of further research. This can e.g. be useful for developing proof-of-concept models such as for funding applications without requiring an extensive learning curve for the researchers.
# Descriptive Agent-based Modeling (DREAM) for developing descriptions of agent-based models by means of using templates and complex network-based models. Building DREAM models allows model comparison across scientific disciplines.

Since the beginning of the 21st century ABMs have been deployed in architecture and urban planning to evaluate design and to simulate pedestrian flow in the urban environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G.D.P.A |last2=Wullschleger |first2=Tobias |last3=Müller |first3=Hanspeter |last4=Schmitt |first4=Gerhard |last1=Aschwanden |year=2009 |title=Evaluation of 3D city models using automatic placed urban agents |journal=Automation in Construction |volume=22 |pages=81–89 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580511001415 |doi=10.1016/j.autcon.2011.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a growing field of socio-economic analysis of infrastructure investment impact using ABM's ability to discern systemic impacts upon a socio-economic network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first1=Paul |last2=Stiff |first2=David |last1=Smetanin |year=2015 |title=Investing in Ontario's Public Infrastructure: A Prosperity at Risk Perspective, with an analysis of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area |journal=The Canadian Centre for Economic Analysis |url=http://www.cancea.ca/sites/economic-analysis.ca/files/reports/CANCEA%20Report%20-%20Investing%20in%20Ontario%27s%20Infrastructure%20FINAL%20Oct%202015%20Web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational ABM: agent-directed simulation===

The agent-directed simulation (ADS) metaphor distinguishes between two categories, namely "Systems for Agents" and "Agents for Systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~yilmaz/ADS.html |title=Agent-Directed Simulation |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems for Agents (sometimes referred to as agents systems) are systems implementing agents for the use in engineering, human and social dynamics, military applications, and others. Agents for Systems are divided in two subcategories. Agent-supported systems deal with the use of agents as a support facility to enable computer assistance in problem solving or enhancing cognitive capabilities. Agent-based systems focus on the use of agents for the generation of model behavior in a system evaluation (system studies and analyses).

==Implementation==

Many agent-based modeling software are designed for serial [[Von Neumann architecture|von-Neumann computer architectures]]. This limits the speed and scalability of these systems. A recent development is the use of data-parallel algorithms on Graphics Processing Units [[GPU]]s for ABM simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Isaac Rudomin |url=https://sites.google.com/site/rudominisaac/shader-agents |title=Large Crowds in the GPU |year=2006 |publisher=[[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] |accessdate=|display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111054342/https://sites.google.com/site/rudominisaac/shader-agents |archivedate=January 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roshan M. |last=D'Souza |url=http://www.me.mtu.edu/~rmdsouza/ABM_GPU.html |title=Mega-Scale Interactive Agent-Based Model Simulations on the GPU |publisher=[[Michigan Technological University]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul |last1=Richmond |first2=Daniela M. |last2=Romano |url=http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~daniela/Paul_abgpu_IWSV_2008.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090115220835/http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~daniela/Paul_abgpu_IWSV_2008.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 15, 2009 |format=PDF |title=Agent Based GPU, a Real-time 3D Simulation and Interactive Visualisation Framework for Massive Agent Based Modelling on the GPU |journal=Proceedings International Workshop on Super Visualisation (IWSV08) |year=2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme memory bandwidth combined with the sheer number crunching power of multi-processor GPUs has enabled simulation of millions of agents at tens of frames per second.

==Verification and validation==
[[Verification and validation]] (V&amp;V) of simulation models is extremely important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Sargent |first1=R.

As an example of V&amp;V technique, consider VOMAS (virtual overlay multi-agent system),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Amir |last2=Hussain |first3=Mario |last3=Kolberg |title=Verification and Validation of Agent-Based Simulations using the VOMAS approach |journal=Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Multi-Agent Systems and Simulation '09 (MASS '09), as Part of MALLOW 09, Sep 7–11, 2009, Torino, Italy |url=http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/VOMAS_CRV_aug_05_09_Muazv2.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614052017/http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/VOMAS_CRV_aug_05_09_Muazv2.pdf |archivedate=June 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a software engineering based approach, where a virtual overlay multi-agent system is developed alongside the agent-based model. The agents in the multi-agent system are able to gather data by generation of logs as well as provide run-time validation and verification support by watch agents and also agents to check any violation of invariants at run-time. These are set by the Simulation Specialist with help from the SME ([[subject-matter expert]]). Muazi et al. also provide an example of using VOMAS for verification and validation of a forest fire simulation model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Qasim |last2=Siddique |first3=Amir |last3=Hussain |first4=Mario |last4=Kolberg |title=Verification &amp; Validation of an Agent-Based Forest Fire Simulation Model |journal=Proceedings of the Agent Directed Simulation Symposium 2010, as Part of the ACM SCS Spring Simulation Multiconference |pages=142–149 |date=April 11–15, 2010 |url=http://cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/2_ADS_09_Final_Paper.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725083937/http://cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/2_ADS_09_Final_Paper.pdf |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VOMAS provides a formal way of validation and verification. To develop a VOMAS, one must design VOMAS agents along with the agents in the actual simulation, preferably from the start. In essence, by the time the simulation model is complete, one can essentially consider it to be one model containing two models:
# An agent-based model of the intended system
# An agent-based model of the VOMAS

Unlike all previous work on verification and validation, VOMAS agents ensure that the simulations are validated in-simulation i.e. even during execution. In case of any exceptional situations, which are programmed on the directive of the Simulation Specialist (SS), the VOMAS agents can report them. In addition, the VOMAS agents can be used to log key events for the sake of debugging and subsequent analysis of simulations. In other words, VOMAS allows for a flexible use of any given technique for the sake of verification and validation of an agent-based model in any domain.

Details of validated agent-based modeling using VOMAS along with several case studies are given in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Muaz A. K. |last=Niazi |title=Towards A Novel Unified Framework for Developing Formal, Network and Validated Agent-Based Simulation Models of Complex Adaptive Systems |date=June 11, 2011 |publisher=[[University of Stirling]]|hdl=1893/3365 }} PhD Thesis&lt;/ref&gt; This thesis also gives details of "exploratory agent-based modeling", "descriptive agent-based modeling" and "validated agent-based modeling", using several worked case study examples.

===Complex systems modelling===

Mathematical models of complex systems are of three types: [[black-box]] (phenomenological), [[White box (software engineering)|white-box]] (mechanistic, based on the [[first principles]]) and [[Grey box model|grey-box]] (mixtures of phenomenological and mechanistic models).&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In black-box models, the individual-based (mechanistic) mechanisms of a complex dynamic system remain hidden. [[File:Mathematical models for complex systems.jpg|thumb|Mathematical models for complex systems]] Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. They are phenomenological and ignore a composition and internal structure of a complex system. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such a non-transparent model. A white-box model of complex dynamic system has ‘transparent walls’ and directly shows underlying mechanisms. All events at micro-, meso- and macro-levels of a dynamic system are directly visible at all stages of its white-box model evolution. In most cases mathematical modelers use the heavy black-box mathematical methods, which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems. Grey-box models are intermediate and combine black-box and white-box approaches. [[File:Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth.gif|thumb|Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth]] Creation of a white-box model of complex system is associated with the problem of the necessity of an a priori basic knowledge of the modeling subject. The deterministic logical [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]] are necessary but not sufficient condition of a white-box model. The second necessary prerequisite of a white-box model is the presence of the physical [[ontology]] of the object under study. The white-box modeling represents an automatic hyper-logical inference from the [[first principle]]s because it is completely based on the deterministic logic and axiomatic theory of the subject. The purpose of the white-box modeling is to derive from the basic axioms a more detailed, more concrete mechanistic knowledge about the dynamics of the object under study. The necessity to formulate an intrinsic [[axiomatic system]] of the subject before creating its white-box model distinguishes the cellular automata models of white-box type from cellular automata models based on arbitrary logical rules. If cellular automata rules have not been formulated from the first principles of the subject, then such a model may have a weak relevance to the real problem.&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L. White-box model" /&gt;

'''Anisogamy''' (also called [[heterogamy]]) is the form of [[sexual reproduction]] that involves the union or fusion of two [[gamete]]s, which differ in size and/or form. (The related adjectives are ''anisogamous'' and  ''anisogamic'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/anisogamy | title=Anisogamy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller gamete is considered to be male ([[sperm|sperm cell]]), whereas the larger gamete is regarded as female ([[egg cell]]).

There are several types of anisogamy. Both gametes may be [[flagellum|flagellated]] and therefore [[motility|motile]]. Alternatively, both of the gametes may be non-flagellated. The latter situation occurs in some algae and plants. In the [[red algae|red alga]] ''[[Polysiphonia]]'', non-motile eggs are fertilized by non-motile sperm. In [[flowering plant]]s, the gametes are non-motile cells within [[gametophyte]]s.

The form of anisogamy that occurs in [[animal]]s, including [[human]]s, is [[oogamy]], where a large, non-motile egg ([[ovum]]) is fertilized by a small, motile sperm ([[spermatozoon]]). The egg is optimized for longevity, whereas the small sperm is optimized for motility and speed. The size and resources of the egg cell allow for the production of [[pheromone]]s, which attract the swimming sperm cells.&lt;ref Name=Dusenbery&gt;{{Cite book |last= Dusenbery |first=David B. |year=2009 |title= Living at Micro Scale |chapter=Chapter 20 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |isbn=978-0-674-03116-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anisogamy and sexual dimorphism==
Anisogamy is a fundamental concept of [[sexual dimorphism]] that helps explain phenotypic differences between sexes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;De Lisle SP, Rowe L. Independent evolution of the sexes promotes amphibian diversification. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences''. 2015;282(1803):20142213. {{DOI|10.1098/rspb.2014.2213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most species a male and female sex exist, both of which are optimized for reproductive potential.  Due to their differently sized and shaped gametes, both males and females have developed physiological and behavioral differences that optimize the individual’s [[fecundity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since most egg laying females typically must bear the offspring and have a more limited reproductive cycle, this typically makes females a [[limiting factor]] in the reproductive success rate of males in a species. This process is also true for females selecting males, and assuming that males and females are selecting for different traits in partners, would result in phenotypic differences between the sexes over many generations. This hypothesis, known as the [[Bateman's principle|Bateman’s Principle]], is used to understand the evolutionary pressures put on males and females due to anisogamy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fritzsche K, Arnqvis G. HOMAGE TO BATEMAN: SEX ROLES PREDICT SEX DIFFERENCES IN SEXUAL SELECTION. ''Evolution'' [serial online]. July 2013;67(7):1926-1936. Available from: Academic Search Alumni Edition, Ipswich, MA. Accessed October 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Although this assumption has criticism, it is a generally accepted model for sexual selection within anisogamous species. The selection for different traits depending on sex within the same species is known as sex-specific selection, and accounts for the differing phenotypes found between the sexes of the same species. This sex-specific selection between sexes over time also lead to the development of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, which assist males and females in reproductive success.

In most species, both sexes choose mates based on the available phenotypes of potential mates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  These phenotypes are species specific, resulting in varying strategies for successful sexual reproduction. For example, large males are sexually selected for in elephant seals for their large size helps the male fight off other males, but small males are sexually selected for in spiders for they can mate with the female more quickly while avoiding [[sexual cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Anne Danielson-François, Chueh Hou, Nina Cole, I-Min Tso, Scramble competition for moulting females as a driving force for extreme male dwarfism in spiders, Animal Behaviour, Volume 84, Issue 4, October 2012, Pages 937-945, {{ISSN|0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the large range of sexually selected phenotypes, most anisogamous species follow a set of predictable desirable traits and selective behaviors based on general reproductive success models.

===Female phenotypes===

For [[Internal fertilization|internal fertilizers]], female investment is high in reproduction since they typically expend more energy throughout a single reproductive event.  This can be seen as early as [[oogenesis]], for the female sacrifices gamete number for gamete size to better increase the survival chances of the potential zygote; a process more energetically demanding than [[spermatogenesis]] in males.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Keyne Monro, Dustin J. Marshall Unravelling anisogamy: egg size and ejaculate size mediate selection on morphology in free-swimming sperm&lt;/ref&gt;  Oogenesis occurs in the [[ovary]], a female specific organ that also produces hormones to prepare other female-specific organs for the changes necessary in the reproductive organs to facilitate egg delivery in external fertilizers, and zygote development in internal fertilizers. The egg cell produced is not only large, but sometimes even immobile, requiring contact with the more mobile sperm to instigate fertilization.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Since this process is very energy-demanding and time consuming for the female, [[mate choice]] is often integrated into the female’s behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Females will often be very selective of the males they choose to reproduce with, for the phenotype of the male can be indicative of the male’s physical health and heritable traits.  Females employ mate choice to pressure males into displaying their desirable traits to females through [[Courtship display|courtship]], and if successful, the male gets to reproduce. This encourages males and females of specific species to invest in courtship behaviors as well as traits that can display physical health to a potential mate.  This process, known as [[sexual selection]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; results in the development of traits to ease reproductive success rather than individual survival, such as the inflated size of a termite queen. It is also important for females to select against potential mates that may have a [[sexually transmitted infection]], for the disease could not only hurt the female’s reproductive ability, but also damage the resulting offspring.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Davies, N. B., Krebs, J. R., &amp; West, S. A. (2012). ''An introduction to behavioural ecology''. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not uncommon in males, females are more associated with [[parental care]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;'''Formhage, L., &amp; Jennions, M. (n.d.). Coevolution of parental investment and sexually selected'''&lt;/ref&gt; Since females are on a more limited reproductive schedule than males, a female often invests more in protecting the offspring to sexual maturity than the male. Like mate choice, the level of parental care varies greatly between species, and is often dependent on the number of offspring produced per sexual encounter.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In most species such as ''Drosophila melanogaster,'' females can utilize [[Female sperm storage|sperm storage]],&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nakadera | first1 = Y. | last2 = Koene | first2 = J. M. | year = 2013 | title = Reproductive strategies in hermaphroditic gastropods: Conceptual and empirical approaches | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 91 | issue = 6| pages = 367–381 | doi = 10.1139/cjz-2012-0272 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a process by which the female can store excess sperm from a mate, and fertilize her eggs long after the reproductive event if mating opportunities drop or quality of mates decreases.  By being able to save sperm from more desirable mates, the female gains more control over its own reproductive success, thus allowing for the female to be more selective of males as well as making the timing of fertilization potentially more frequent if males are scarce.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Male phenotypes===

For males of all species, the sperm cells they produce are optimized for ensuring [[Fertilisation|fertilization]] of the female egg. These sperm cells are created through spermatogenesis, a form of [[gametogenesis]] that focuses on developing the most possible gametes per sexual encounter.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Spermatogenesis occurs in the [[Testicle|testes]], a male specific organ that is also produces hormones that trigger the development of secondary sex characteristics. Since the male’s gametes are energetically cheap and abundant in every ejaculation, a male can greatly increase his sexual success by mating far more frequently than the female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Sperm, unlike egg cells, are also mobile, allowing for the sperm to swim towards the egg through the female’s sexual organs.  [[Sperm competition]] is also a major factor in the development of sperm cells.  Only one sperm can fertilize an egg, and since females can potentially reproduce with more than one male before fertilization occurs, producing sperm cells that are faster, more abundant, and more viable than that produced by other males can give a male reproductive advantage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Since females are often the limiting factor in a species reproductive success, males are often expected by the females to search and compete for the female, known as [[intraspecific competition]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This can be seen in organisms such as bean beetles, as the male that searches for females more frequently is often more successful at finding mates and reproducing.  In species undergoing this form of selection, a fit male would be one that is fast, has more refined sensory organs, and spatial awareness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some secondary sex characteristics are not only meant for attracting mates, but also for competing with other males for copulation opportunities.  Some structures, such as antlers in deer, can provide benefits to the male’s reproductive success by providing a weapon to prevent rival males from achieving reproductive success.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, other structures such as the large colorful tail feathers found in male peacocks, are a result of [[Fisherian runaway|Fisherian Runaway]] as well as several more species specific factors.  Due to females selecting for specific traits in males, over time, these traits are exaggerated to the point where they could hinder the male’s survivability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  However, since these traits greatly benefit sexual selection, their usefulness in providing more mating opportunities overrides the possibility that the trait could lead to a shortening of its lifespan through predation or starvation.  These desirable traits extend beyond physical body parts, and often extend into courtship behavior and [[nuptial gift]]s as well.

Although some behaviors in males are meant to work within the parameters of cryptic female choice, some male traits work against it.  Strong enough males, in some cases, can force themselves upon a female, forcing fertilization and overriding female choice.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friesen | first1 = C. R. | last2 = Uhrig | first2 = E. J. | last3 = Mason | first3 = R. T. | last4 = Brennan | first4 = P. L. R. | year = 2016 | title = Female behaviour and the interaction of male and female genital traits mediate sperm transfer during mating | url = | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 952–964 | doi = 10.1111/jeb.12836 | pmid = 26809830 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since this can often be dangerous for the female, an [[Evolutionary arms race|Evolutionary Arms Race]] between the sexes is often an outcome.

==Evolution==
Anisogamy is the phenomenon of [[fertilization]] of large gametes ([[egg cells]], ova) by (or with) small [[gametes]] ([[sperm]] cells: spermatozoa or spermatia). Gamete size difference is the fundamental difference between [[female]]s and [[male]]s. Anisogamy first evolved in multicellular [[haploid]] species after the differentiation of different [[mating type]]s had already been established.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanschen|first=Erik R.|last2=Herron|first2=Matthew D.|last3=Wiens|first3=John J.|last4=Nozaki|first4=Hisayoshi|last5=Michod|first5=Richard E.|date=2018|title=Multicellularity Drives the Evolution of Sexual Traits|journal=The American Naturalist|language=en|volume=192|issue=3|pages=E93–E105|doi=10.1086/698301|pmid=30125231|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[Ascomycetes]], anisogamy evolved from isogamy before mating types.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Beukeboom, L. &amp; Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Oxford University Press, p. 25 [https://books.google.com/books?id=d4cLBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false].

Need to find right page, if exists}}

The three main theories for the evolution of anisogamy are gamete competition, gamete limitation, and intracellular conflicts, but the last of these three is not well supported by current evidence.&lt;ref name="Lessels09"&gt;Lessells C.M., Snook R.R., Hosken D.J. 2009 The evolutionary origin and maintenance of sperm: selection for a small, motile gamete mating type. In Sperm biology: An evolutionary perspective (eds. Birkhead T.R., Hosken D.J., Pitnick S.), pp. 43-67. London, Academic press.&lt;/ref&gt; Both gamete competition and gamete limitation assume that anisogamy originated through disruptive selection acting on an ancestral isogamous population with external fertilization, due to a trade-off between larger gamete number and gamete size (which in turn affects zygote survival), because the total resource one individual can invest in reproduction is assumed to be fixed.&lt;ref name="LehtonenParker14"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lehtonen | first1 = J. | last2 = Parker | first2 = G.A. | year = 2014 | title = Gamete competition, gamete limitation, and the evolution of the two sexes | url = | journal = Molecular Human Reproduction | volume = 20 | issue = 12| pages = 1161–1168 | doi = 10.1093/molehr/gau068 | pmid = 25323972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first formal, mathematical theory proposed to explain the evolution of anisogamy was based on gamete limitation:&lt;ref name="Kalmus32"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kalmus | first1 = H | year = 1932 | title = Über den Erhaltungswert der phänotypischen (morphologischen) Anisogamie und die Entstehung der ersten Geschlechtsunterschiede | url = | journal = Biol Zentralbl | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 716–736 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this model assumed that natural selection would lead to gamete sizes that result in the largest population-wide number of successful fertilizations.&lt;ref name="Kalmus32"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scudo | first1 = F.M. | year = 1967 | title = Adaptive value of sexual dimorphism - I, anisogamy | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 285–291 | doi=10.2307/2406676| pmid = 28556138 | jstor = 2406676 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dusenbery | first1 = D.B. | year = 2000 | title = Selection for high gamete encounter rates explains the success of male and female mating types | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 202 | issue = 1| pages = 1–10 | doi=10.1006/jtbi.1999.1017| pmid = 10623494 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.408.1475 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If it is assumed that a certain amount of resources provided by the gametes are needed for the survival of the resulting zygote, and that there is a trade-off between the size and number of gametes, then this optimum was shown to be one where both small (male) and large (female) gametes are produced. However, these early models assume that natural selection acts mainly at the population level, something that is today known to be a very problematic assumption.&lt;ref&gt;Williams G.C., 1966, "Adaptation and natural selection: a critique of some current evolutionary thoughts". Princeton, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mathematical model to explain the evolution of anisogamy via individual level selection, and one that became widely accepted was the theory of gamete or sperm competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = G.A. | last2 = Baker | first2 = R.R. | last3 = Smith | first3 = V.G.F. | year = 1972 | title = The origin and evolution of gamete dimorphism and the male-female phenomenon | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 36 | issue = 3| pages = 529–553 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(72)90007-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = G.A. | year = 1978 | title = Selection on non-random fusion of gametes during evolution of anisogamy | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 73 | issue = 1| pages = 1–28 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(78)90177-7| pmid = 567721 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = G.A. | year = 1982 | title = Why are there so many tiny sperm? Sperm competition and the maintenance of two sexes | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 96 | issue = 2| pages = 281–294 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(82)90225-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, selection happens at the individual level: those individuals that produce more (but smaller) gametes also gain a larger proportion of fertilizations simply because they produce a larger number of gametes that 'seek out' those of the larger type. However, because zygotes formed from larger gametes have better survival prospects, this process can again lead to the divergence of gametes sizes into large and small (female and male) gametes. The end result is one where it seems that the numerous, small gametes compete for the large gametes that are tasked with providing maximal resources for the offspring.

Some recent theoretical work has challenged the gamete competition theory, by showing that gamete limitation by itself can lead to the divergence of gamete sizes even under selection at the individual level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cox | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Sethian | first2 = J.A. | year = 1985 | title = Gamete motion, search, and the evolution of anisogamy, oogamy, and chemotaxis | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/1fw153sc| journal = American Naturalist | volume = 125 | issue = 1| pages = 74–101 | doi=10.1086/284329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iyer | first1 = P. | last2 = Roughgarden | first2 = J. | year = 2008 | title = Gametic conflict versus contact in the evolution of anisogamy | url = | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 73 | issue = 4| pages = 461–472 | doi = 10.1016/j.tpb.2008.02.002 | pmid = 18485981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = J.-N. | year = 2010 | title = Cooperation and the evolution of anisogamy | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 264 | issue = 1| pages = 24–36 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.01.019 | pmid=20097207}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this is possible, it has also been shown that gamete competition and gamete limitation are the ends of a continuum of selective pressures, and they can act separately or together depending on the conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lehtonen | first1 = J. | last2 = Kokko | first2 = H. | year = 2011 | title = Two roads to two sexes: unifying gamete competition and gamete limitation in a single model of anisogamy evolution | url = | journal = Behav Ecol Sociobiol | volume = 65 | issue = 3| pages = 445–459 | doi = 10.1007/s00265-010-1116-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These selection pressures also act in the same direction (to increase gamete numbers at the expense of size) and at the same level (individual selection). Theory also suggests that gamete limitation could only have been the dominant force of selection for the evolutionary origin of the sexes under quite limited circumstances, and the presence on average of just one competitor can makes the 'selfish' evolutionary force of gamete competition stronger than the 'cooperative' force of gamete limitation even if gamete limitation is very acute (approaching 100% of eggs remaining unfertilized).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = G.A. | last2 = Lehtonen | first2 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Gamete evolution and sperm numbers: sperm competition versus sperm limitation | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 281 | issue = 1791| page = 1791 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2014.0836 | pmid=25100694 | pmc=4132674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is then a relatively sound theory base for understanding this fundamental transition from isogamy to anisogamy in the evolution of reproduction, which is predicted to be associated with the transition to multicellularity. In fact, Hanschen et al (2018) demonstrate that anisogamy evolved from isogamous multicellular ancestors and that anisogamy would subsequently drive secondary sexual dimorphism.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Some comparative empirical evidence for the gamete competition theories exists,&lt;ref name="Lessels09"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knowlton | first1 = N | year = 1974 | title = A note on the evolution of gamete dimorphism | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 283–285 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(74)90153-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker G.A., 2011, "The origin and maintenance of two sexes (anisogamy), and their gamete sizes by gamete competition". ''The evolution of anisogamy'' (eds. Togashi T., Cox P.A.), pp. 17-74. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is difficult to use this evidence to fully tease apart the competition and limitation theories because their testable predictions are similar.&lt;ref name="LehtonenParker14"/&gt; It has also been claimed that some of the organisms used in such comparative studies do not fit the theoretical assumptions well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Randerson | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Hurst | first2 = L.D. | year = 2001 | title = The uncertain evolution of the sexes | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 16 | issue = 10| pages = 571–579 | doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(01)02270-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A valuable model system to the study of the evolution of anisogamy is the volvocine algae, which group of [[Chlorophyta|chlorophytes]] is quite unique for its extant species exhibit a diversity of mating systems ([[isogamy]] and anisogamy) in addition to its extremes in both [[Unicellular organism|unicellularity]] and [[Multicellular organism|multicellularity]] with a diversity of forms in species of intermediate ranges of sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferris|first=Patrick|last2=Olson|first2=Bradley J.S.C.|last3=De Hoff|first3=Peter L.|last4=Douglass|first4=Stephen|last5=Diaz-Cano|first5=David Casero|last6=Prochnik|first6=Simon|last7=Geng|first7=Sa|last8=Rai|first8=Rhitu|last9=Grimwood|first9=Jane|date=2010-04-16|title=Evolution of an Expanded Sex Determining Locus in Volvox|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2880461/|journal=Science|volume=328|issue=5976|pages=351–354|doi=10.1126/science.1186222|issn=0036-8075|pmc=2880461|pmid=20395508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine algae have been closely studied to understand the trajectories of such diversified reproductive systems,&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Togashi|first=Tatsuya|last2=Bartelt|first2=John L.|last3=Yoshimura|first3=Jin|last4=Tainaka|first4=Kei-ichi|last5=Cox|first5=Paul Alan|date=2012|title=Evolutionary trajectories explain the diversified evolution of isogamy and anisogamy in marine green algae|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|issue=34|pages=13692–13697|doi=10.1073/pnas.1203495109|issn=1091-6490|pmc=3427103|pmid=22869736}}&lt;/ref&gt; evolution of sex and mating types,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herron|first=Matthew D.|date=2016|title=Origins of multicellular complexity: Volvox and the volvocine algae|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=25|issue=6|pages=1213–1223|doi=10.1111/mec.13551|issn=1365-294X|pmc=5765864|pmid=26822195}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the adaptiveness and stability of anisogamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=P.

'''Anxiety buffer disruption theory''' (ABDT) is an application of [[terror management theory]] to explain an individual's reaction to a traumatic event, which leads to [[post traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="mainpaper"&gt;Pyszczynski, T., &amp; Kesebir, P. (2011). Anxiety buffer disruption theory: A terror management account of posttraumatic stress disorder. Anxiety, Stress, &amp; Coping, 24(1), 3–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Terror management theory posits that humans, unlike any other organism, are uniquely aware that death is the inevitable outcome of life. When thoughts of death are made salient, such as when a terrorist attack carries those thoughts into the level of consciousness, humans are subject to debilitating anxiety unless it can be "buffered." Humans respond to the anxiety and dread [[mortality salience]] produces by clinging  to their [[World view|cultural worldview]], through [[self-esteem]] and also [[Interpersonal relationship|close personal relationships]].&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, C. &amp; Landau, M. (2005) Communication and terrorism: a terror management theory perspective. Communication Research Reports. Vol. 22 Nos 1–4 pages 79–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural worldviews, with their cultural norms, religious beliefs and moral values infuse life with meaning. They give life a feeling of normalcy and also a feeling of control. There is no way to definitely prove one's cultural world view, there they are fragile human constructs and must be maintained. Clinging to a cultural worldview and self-esteem buffer the anxiety connected to thoughts of mortality.&lt;ref name="luo"&gt;Luo, S., Shi, Z., Yang, X., Wang., X. &amp; Han, S. (2014) Reminders of mortality decrease midcingulate activity in response to others' suffering. SCAN (9) 477–486.&lt;/ref&gt; When thoughts of death are salient, humans are drawn to their cultural world view which "stipulates appropriate social requirements, and standards for valued conduct, while instilling one's life with meaning, order and permanence." &lt;ref name="mainpaper"/&gt;

When a traumatic experience cannot be assimilated into a currently held cultural worldview, the anxiety-buffering mechanisms are disrupted.&lt;ref name="edmonson"&gt;Edmondson, D., Chaudoir, S.

Journal of Loss and Trauma, 16(4), 358–385.&lt;/ref&gt; ABDT argues that individuals face overwhelming anxiety which leads to the symptoms of PTSD including re-experiencing, hyper-arousal, avoidance and disassociation.&lt;ref name="ABDT"&gt;Pyszczynski, T., &amp; Kesebir, P.

Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy. 2011, Vol. 3, Nov. 4, 329–341.&lt;/ref&gt; The dissociation causes atypical responses to mortality salience compared with individuals who do not suffer from an anxiety buffer disruption &lt;ref name="mainpaper" /&gt; When the anxiety buffer disruption is mild, exaggerated coping responses, such as rejecting or taking offense at other cultures, is expected. When the anxiety buffer disruption is severe, there can be a total breakdown of coping mechanisms.&lt;ref name="studyone"&gt;Abdollahi, A., Pyszczynski, T., Maxfield, M., &amp; Luszczynska, A.

Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, 3(4), 329.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was proposed by [[Tom Pyszczynski]] and  Pelin Kesebir.&lt;ref name="mainpaper"/&gt;

== Origins ==

=== Shattered assumption theory ===
In 1992, Janoff-Bulman delineated a theory of trauma response ([[Shattered Assumptions Theory]]). Janoff-Bulman posits that humans have basic assumptions about the world in which they live, based on the belief that the world is a benevolent and meaningful place and that the individual has self-worth.&lt;ref name="mills"&gt;Mills, M. (2010) Shattered assumptions? A prospective study: The impact of trauma of global beliefs and adjustment. Doctoral Dissertations. Paper AAI3447452. http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/dissertations/AAI3447452.&lt;/ref&gt; These assumptions give the individual the illusion that they have a measure of control on their own lives as well as a feeling of invulnerability.&lt;ref name="edmonson" /&gt; When an individual faces a traumatic event, their deeply held beliefs that the world is a benevolent and meaningful place and that they have a worthy role in that world are shattered.&lt;ref name="mills" /&gt; The world is no longer benevolent or predictable.
Terror management theory and anxiety buffer disruption theory have taken the concept one step further.

=== Anxiety buffer disruption theory ===
Anxiety buffer disruption theory not only focuses on the thoughts and emotions of an individual, but it also studies the behavior that results when terror management theory and shattered assumptions theory are examined together.&lt;ref name="edmonson" /&gt; Excessive anxiety experienced by post-traumatic stress disorder sufferers occurs because the events causing the post-traumatic stress disorder have demonstrated to these individuals that anxiety-buffering mechanisms are not capable of protecting them from death.&lt;ref name="mainpaper" /&gt; Individuals who have high levels of [[dissociation (psychology)|peritraumatic dissociation]] and low levels of [[self-efficacy]] coping, two indicators of post-traumatic stress disorder,  have abnormal responses to reminders of death. These individuals in turn do not utilize the coping mechanisms that are typically used to remove the fear of death: culture, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships. In fact, in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder, mortality salience coping mechanisms are viewed as worthless and perhaps are even seen to be detestable.&lt;ref name="ABDT" /&gt;

=== Components of anxiety buffers ===

* '''Cultural Worldview''':  Individuals who have post traumatic stress disorder will often reject their culture when provided with mortality salience triggers, the direct opposite of what terror management theory demonstrates to be true in those without post traumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="ABDT" /&gt; Cultural worldviews infuse life with structure, purpose and meaning. People maintain these fragile constructions by preferring the company of the like-minded. But when faced with a traumatic event, there are times when the horror cannot be assimilated into the framework of the person's existing cultural worldview.&lt;ref name="mainpaper"/&gt;
* '''Self-Esteem''': Various studies demonstrate that individuals who have post traumatic stress disorder also have decreased self-esteem. Self-esteem cannot function well as an anxiety buffering system in those who have post traumatic stress disorder as the buffer is weakened in these individuals.&lt;ref name="mainpaper" /&gt; High self-esteem can displace defensive responses and buffer against the terror of mortality salience because it is a signal that the individual is living at the standard they should, based on their world view.&lt;ref name="edmonson" /&gt; Self-worth as the terror management theory suggests is an essential component of the existential anxiety- buffering system. PTSD is related to a breakdown in this system, and noted that veterans with past and present, or ongoing PTSD have shown to have lower self-esteem. According to ABDT this leaves this group particularly vulnerable to anxiety, since self-worth is an integral part of the individual’s anxiety- buffering mechanism. [1]
* '''Close Relationships''': It is often mentioned that worldview and self-esteem affect ways in which our fears of death are buffered with ABDT. Close relationships also serve as a regulator of these fears. Previous studies hinted at that close relationships played a role in terror management, but they did not conceptualize, theoretically explain, or test the context of close relationships in Terror Management Theories.&lt;ref name="florian"&gt;Florian, V., Mikulincer, M., &amp; Hirschberger, G. (2002). The anxiety-buffering function of close relationships: evidence that relationship commitment acts as a terror management mechanism. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 82(4), 527.&lt;/ref&gt; Close relationships seem to be a product of natural selection because of their reproductive and survival benefits, having reproductive benefits contribute to the survival of people’s genes through their offspring. Therefore, close relationships increase the likelihood of mating and brings about other survival skills like gathering food, finding shelter, environmental awareness, and protects offspring from dangers.&lt;ref name="buss"&gt;Buss, D. M., &amp; Schmitt, D. P. (1993). Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating. Psychological review, 100(2), 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Love and belongingness are ranked over those of esteem and self- actualization.&lt;ref name="maslow"&gt;Maslow, A. H., Frager, R., &amp; Cox, R. (1970). Motivation and personality (Vol. 2). J. Fadiman, &amp; C. McReynolds (Eds.). New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; The formation and maintenance of close relationships have been recognized in both infants and adults as a source of regulating distress. It is also noted that self- esteem can also stem from close relationships. Based on these things it was assumed that formation and maintenance of close relationships may serve as a death- anxiety- buffering mechanism.&lt;ref name="florian" /&gt;

Close relationships appear to have inoculating power against basic existential threats, which allows people to respond to these threats by fulfilling relational potentials. Second, it seems the sense of relationship commitment is shaped by not only perceived relational investment, gains, and potential alternatives, as well as the existential need of denial of death awareness. Third, it seems processes of terror management not only include worldview defenses to protect the self, but also promote commitment to significant others and the expansion of the self, provided by these relationships.&lt;ref name="florian" /&gt;

An important finding is that close relationships may serve as a fundamental anxiety buffer. It appears close relationships not only protect individuals from concrete and actual threats or danger, but also offers a symbolic shield against the awareness of one’s finitude. Since the threat of death is inescapable, the support from those close to us make may make the thought of death more tolerable by giving meaning to our lives by being important to others.&lt;ref name="florian" /&gt;

As other anxiety buffers, interpersonal relationships are damaged as well in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder. People with post traumatic stress disorder have higher rates of divorce, more difficulty with their children, are more prone to domestic violence, and are emotionally distant from loved ones. All of these are damaging and as a result, terror management cannot be accomplished through close interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="mainpaper" /&gt;

== Anxiety buffer disruption theory studies ==

=== Posttraumatic stress reactions ===
A study looked at dissociation responses and PTSD in students who survived the [[2005 Zarand earthquake]] in Iran. The earthquake measured 6.4 on the Richter scale, killed more than 1,500 people and displaced more than 6,700 for two months or more. It looked at dissociation one month later then two years later to see if level of dissociation predicted PTSD.

Four weeks after the earthquake, researchers solicited for volunteers at local universities. All of the participants met the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] criterion for a Class A1 trauma. Many were wearing black mourning clothes or had injuries from the earthquake.

Three priming conditions were employed: mortality salience, earthquake or dental pain. The researchers then evaluated  how the subjects felt toward foreign aid in the wake of the disaster. The results indicated that subjects with high dissociative tendencies showed no effect of mortality salience on attitudes toward the foreign aid. Subjects with low dissociative tendencies reacted as terror management theory predicts when confronted with mortality salience and thought of the earthquake.

Two years after the quake, the researchers returned and 172 of the original respondents participated. They predicted that subjects with high PTSD symptoms would have a disrupted worldview on both foreign aid and the [[Islam and clothing|Islamic dress code]]. They found a strong relationship between dissociation and subsequent PTSD symptom severity. Even after the passage of two years, subjects with high dissociative tendencies were still not defending against existential threats in a way typical for the population who has not experienced trauma.&lt;ref name="studyone"/&gt;

=== Extent of trauma exposure and PTSD symptom severity ===
105 students of the University of Abidjan took the Post-Traumatic Stress Checklist-Civilian Version and then an opinion survey on the civil war in [[Cote d'Ivoire]]. Last, they took part in a word-completion task designed to measure their accessibility of death-related thoughts. This study, unlike previous studies related to terror management theory, looked at the subjects' thoughts of death as related to the war, a specific traumatic event.

In the [[Scientific control|control condition]], where subjects were asked to talk about their anxiety related to their worst exam, death thought accessibility was lower for those with higher levels of PTSD. This suggests that people suffering from strong PTSD repress thoughts of death. But when mortality was made salient, it provoked a marked increase in death thought accessibility for those with high PTSD. The results indicate that the anxiety buffer of death thought suppression under normal circumstances failed when subjects were reminded of the traumatic event.

A second experiment was conducted with 197 students of the University of Ajidjan where they evaluated exposure (proximity) to a traumatic event. In this case, it was geographical location to the civil war. The researchers hypothesized that subjects who lived where the fighting was more constant and intense would be more likely to increase their PTSD reports when mortality was made salient. Those who lived in an area of less conflict should not increase their reports of PTSD. As a form of defensive denial, the researchers predicted they might report lower levels of symptoms. As expected, subjects who had more exposure to war reported greater PTSD symptoms in the mortality salience condition.&lt;ref name="tard"&gt;Chatard, A., Pyszczynski, T., Arndt, J., Selimbegović, L., Konan, P. N., &amp; Van der Linden, M. (2012). Extent of trauma exposure and PTSD symptom severity as predictors of anxiety-buffer functioning. Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, 4(1), 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''being''' means the existence of a thing. Anything that exists has being. [[Ontology]] is the branch of philosophy that studies being. Being is a concept encompassing [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[Subjectivity|subjective]] features of [[reality]] and [[existence]]. Anything that partakes in being is also called a "being", though often this usage is limited to entities that have subjectivity (as in the expression "[[human being]]"). The notion of "being" has, inevitably, been elusive and controversial in the history of philosophy, beginning in Western philosophy with attempts among the [[pre-Socratics]] to deploy it intelligibly. The first effort to recognize and define the concept came from [[Parmenides]], who famously said of it that "what is-is". Common words such as "is", "are", and "am" refer directly or indirectly to being.

As an example of efforts in recent times, [[Martin Heidegger]] (who himself drew on ancient Greek sources) adopted after German terms like ''[[Dasein]]'' to articulate the topic.&lt;ref name="dasein1"&gt;Heidegger, the day  ''[[Being and Time|Sein und Zeit]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;27: "this entity which each of us is himself&amp;nbsp;... we shall denote by the term 'Dasein'."&lt;/ref&gt; Several modern approaches build on such continental European exemplars as Heidegger, and apply metaphysical results to the understanding of human psychology and the human condition generally (notably in the [[Existentialism|Existentialist]] tradition). By contrast, in mainstream [[Analytical philosophy]] the topic is more confined to abstract investigation, in the work of such influential theorists as [[W. V. O. Quine]], to name one of many. One of the most fundamental questions that continues to exercise philosophers is posed by [[William James]]: "How comes the world to be here at all instead of the nonentity which might be imagined in its place?&amp;nbsp;... from nothing to being there is no logical bridge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Some problems of philosophy: a beginning of an introduction to philosophy|first=William|last=James|authorlink=William James|pages=38, 40|year=1916|location=New York|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The substantial being==

===Being and the substance theorists===
The deficit of such a bridge was first encountered in history by the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic philosophers]] during the process of evolving a classification of all beings (noun). Aristotle, who wrote after the Pre-Socratics, applies the term [[Categories (Aristotle)|category]] (perhaps not originally) to ten highest-level classes. They comprise one category of substance ([[ousia]]e) existing independently (man, tree) and nine categories of accidents, which can only exist in something else (time, place). In Aristotle, substances are to be clarified by stating their [[definition]]: a note expressing a larger class (the genus) followed by further notes expressing [[Differentia|specific difference]]s (differentiae) within the class. The substance so defined was a species. For example, the species, man, may be defined as an animal (genus) that is rational (difference). As the difference is potential within the genus; that is, an animal may or may not be rational, the difference is not identical to, and may be distinct from, the genus.

Applied to being, the system fails to arrive at a definition for the simple reason that no difference can be found. The species, the genus, and the difference are all equally being: a being is a being that is being. The genus cannot be nothing because nothing is not a class of everything. The trivial solution that being is being added to nothing is only a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]: being is being. There is no simpler intermediary between being and non-being that explains and classifies being.

[[File:Being Parmenides.png|thumb|right|The Being according to [[Parmenides]] is like the mass of a sphere.]]
Pre-Socratic reaction to this deficit was varied. As [[Substance theory|substance theorists]] they accepted [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] the hypothesis that appearances are deceiving, that reality is to be reached through reasoning. [[Parmenides]] reasoned that if everything is identical to being and being is a category of the same thing then there can be neither differences between things nor any change. To be different, or to change, would amount to [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]] or being non-being; that is, not existing. Therefore, being is a homogeneous and non-differentiated sphere and the appearance of beings is illusory. [[Heraclitus]], on the other hand, foreshadowed modern thought by denying existence. Reality does not exist, it flows, and beings are an illusion upon the flow.

[[Aristotle]] knew of this tradition when he began his ''Metaphysics'', and had already drawn his own conclusion, which he presented under the guise of asking what being is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle|authorlink=Aristotle|title=[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]|chapter=Book VII Section 1 (paragraph 1028b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"And indeed the question which was raised of old is raised now and always, and is always the subject of doubt, viz., what being is, is just the question, what is substance? For it is this that some assert to be one, others more than one, and that some assert to be limited in number, others unlimited. And so we also must consider chiefly and primarily and almost exclusively what that is which is in this sense."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and reiterates in no uncertain terms:&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' Chapter VII, Section 4 (paragraph 1030a).&lt;/ref&gt; "Nothing, then, which is not a species of a genus will have an essence – only species will have it ....". Being, however, for Aristotle, is not a genus.

===Aristotle's theory of act and potency===
One might expect a solution to follow from such certain language but none does. Instead Aristotle launches into a rephrasing of the problem, the [[Potentiality and actuality|Theory of Act and Potency]]. In the definition of man as a two-legged animal Aristotle presumes that "two-legged" and "animal" are parts of other beings, but as far as man is concerned, are only potentially man. At the point where they are united into a single being, man, the being, becomes actual, or real. Unity is the basis of actuality:&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'', Book IX, Chapter 10 (paragraph 1051b).&lt;/ref&gt; "... 'being' is being combined and one, and 'not being' is being not combined but more than one." Actuality has taken the place of existence, but Aristotle is no longer seeking to know what the actual is; he accepts it without question as something generated from the potential. He has found a "half-being" or a "pre-being", the potency, which is fully being as part of some other substance. Substances, in Aristotle, unite what they actually are now with everything they might become.

==The transcendental being==
Some of Thomas Aquinas' propositions were reputedly condemned by Étienne Tempier, the local Bishop of Paris (not the Papal Magisterium itself) in 1270 and 1277,&lt;ref&gt;For text of condemnations 1277 (technically still 1276 at the date, since before 25 of March) see David Piché, La condemnation parisienne de 1277, [http://www.vrin.fr/html/main.htm?action=loadbook&amp;isbn=2711614166], parallel Latin text with his French translation, or online list Latin only with footnotes, by Hans-Georg Lundahl, [http://petitlien.com/tempier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, William A. “Thomism and Its Opponents.” ''Dictionary of the Middle Ages''. Ed. Joseph R. Strayer. Vol. 12. New York: Scribner, 1982. 38–45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but his dedication to the use of philosophy to elucidate theology was so thorough that he was proclaimed a [[Doctor of the Church]] in 1568. Those who adopt it are called [[Thomism|Thomists]].

===Thomistic analogical predication of being===
In a single sentence, parallel to Aristotle's statement asserting that being is substance, St. Thomas pushes away from the Aristotelian doctrine:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The metaphysical thought of Thomas Aquinas: from finite being to uncreated being|first=John F. |last=Wippel|page=75|series=Monographs of the Society for Mediaeval and Renaissance Philosophy, No. 1|year=2000|publisher=The Catholic University of America Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Being is not a genus, since it is not predicated univocally but only analogically." His term for analogy is Latin ''analogia''. In the categorical classification of all beings, all substances are partly the same: man and chimpanzee are both animals and the animal part in man is "the same" as the animal part in chimpanzee. Most fundamentally all substances are matter, a theme taken up by science, which postulated one or more matters, such as earth, air, fire or water ([[Empedocles]]). In today's chemistry the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in a chimpanzee are identical to the same elements in a man.

The original text reads, ''"Although equivocal predications must be reduced to univocal, still in actions, the non-univocal agent must precede the univocal agent. For the non-univocal agent is the universal cause of the whole species, as for instance the sun is the cause of the generation of all men; whereas the univocal agent is not the universal efficient cause of the whole species (otherwise it would be the cause of itself, since it is contained in the species), but is a particular cause of this individual which it places under the species by way of participation. Therefore the universal cause of the whole species is not an univocal agent; and the universal cause comes before the particular cause. But this universal agent, whilst it is not univocal, nevertheless is not altogether equivocal, otherwise it could not produce its own likeness, but rather it is to be called an analogical agent, as all univocal predications are reduced to one first non-univocal analogical predication, which is being."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1013.htm#article5|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The names of God (Prima Pars, Q. 13)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If substance is the highest category and there is no substance, being, then the unity perceived in all beings by virtue of their existing must be viewed in another way. St. Thomas chose the analogy: all beings are like, or analogous to, each other in existing. This comparison is the basis of his Analogy of Being. The analogy is said of being in many different ways, but the key to it is the real distinction between existence and essence. Existence is the principle that gives reality to an essence not the same in any way as the existence: "If things having essences are real, and it is not of their essence to be, then the reality of these things must be found in some principle other than (really distinct from) their essence."&lt;ref name=Kreyche70&gt;{{harvnb|Kreyche|1959|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substance can be real or not. What makes an individual substance – a man, a tree, a planet – real is a distinct act, a "to be", which actuates its unity. An analogy of proportion is therefore possible:&lt;ref name=Kreyche70/&gt; "essence is related to existence as potency is related to act."

Existences are not things; they do not themselves exist, they lend themselves to essences, which do not intrinsically have them. They have no nature; an existence receives its nature from the essence it actuates. Existence is not being; it gives being – here a customary phrase is used, existence is a principle (a source) of being, not a previous source, but one which is continually in effect. The stage is set for the concept of God as the cause of all existence, who, as the Almighty, holds everything actual without reason or explanation as an act purely of will.

===The transcendentals===
Aristotle's classificatory scheme had included the five [[predicables]], or characteristics that might be predicated of a substance. One of these was the [[Property (philosophy)|property]], an essential universal true of the species, but not in the definition (in modern terms, some examples would be grammatical language, a property of man, or a spectral pattern characteristic of an element, both of which are defined in other ways). Pointing out that predicables are predicated [[Univocity|univocally]] of substances; that is, they refer to "the same thing" found in each instance, St. Thomas argued that whatever can be said about being is not univocal, because all beings are unique, each actuated by a unique existence. It is the analogous possession of an existence that allows them to be identified as being; therefore, being is an analogous predication.

Whatever can be predicated of all things is universal-like but not universal, category-like but not a category. St. Thomas called them (perhaps not originally) the ''transcendentia'', "[[transcendentals]]", because they "climb above" the categories, just as being climbs above substance. Later academics also referred to them as "the properties of being."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A companion to metaphysics|editor-first=Jaegwon |editor-last=Kim|editor2-first=Ernest |editor2-last=Sosa|pages=21–22|series=Blackwell Companions to philosophy|year=1995|contribution=Aquinas, St. Thomas|first=Jan A.|last=Aersten}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number is generally three or four.

==Being in Islamic philosophy==
The nature of "being" has also been debated and explored in [[Islamic philosophy]], notably by [[Ibn Sina]] ([[Avicenna]]), [[Suhrawardi Maqtul|Suhrawardi]], and [[Mulla Sadra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/personalities/msadra/mulla_sadra.php|title=Iranian Personalities: Sadr Al-Din Mohammad Shirazi|author=|date=|website=www.iranchamber.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; [[Indo-European copula|A modern linguistic approach]] which notices that [[Persian language]] has exceptionally developed two kinds of "[[Indo-European copula|is]]"es, i.e. ''ast'' ("is", as a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]) and ''hast'' (as an existential "is") examines the linguistic properties of the two lexemes in the first place, then evaluates how the statements made by other languages with regard to ''being'' can stand the test of Persian frame of reference.

In this modern linguistic approach, it is noticed that the original language of the source, e.g. [[Greek language|Greek]] (like [[German language|German]] or [[French language|French]] or [[English language|English]]), has only one word for two concepts, ''ast'' and ''hast'', or, like [[Arabic language|Arabic]], has no word at all for either word. It therefore exploits the Persian ''hast'' (existential ''is'') versus ''ast'' (predicative ''is'' or [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]) to address both Western and Islamic ontological arguments on ''being'' and ''existence''.&lt;ref&gt;Toofan, M. ''Zabān ast yā hast?''(Language: is or exists?. Ketāb-e Tehran, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

This linguistic method shows the scope of confusion created by languages which cannot differentiate between existential be and copula. It manifests, for instance, that the main theme of [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]'' is  ''astī'' (is-ness) rather than ''hastī'' (existence). When, in the beginning of his book, [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] claims that people always talk about existence in their everyday language, without knowing what it means, the example he resorts to is: "the sky ''is'' blue" which in Persian can be ONLY translated with the use of the copula ''ast'', and says nothing about ''being'' or ''existence''.

In the same manner, the linguistic method addresses the ontological works written in Arabic. Since [[Arabic language|Arabic]], like [[Latin]] in Europe, had become the official language of philosophical and scientific works in the so-called Islamic World, the early Persian or Arab philosophers had difficulty discussing ''being'' or ''existence'', since the [[Arabic language]], like other Semitic languages, had no verb for either predicative "be" ([[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]) or existential "be". So if you try to translate the aforementioned [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s example into Arabic it appears as السماء زرقاء (viz. "The Sky-- blue") with no linking "is" to be a sign of existential statement. To overcome the problem, when translating the [[ancient Greek philosophy]], certain words were coined like ایس ''aysa'' (from Arabic لیس ''laysa'' 'not') for '[[Indo-European copula|is]]'. Eventually the Arabic verb وجد ''wajada'' (to find) prevailed, since it was thought that whatever is existent, is to be "''found''" in the world. Hence ''existence'' or Being was called وجود ''wujud'' (Cf. [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''finns'' [found]&gt; there exist; also the [[Medieval Latin]] coinage of ''exsistere'' 'standing out (there in the world)' &gt; appear&gt; exist).&lt;br /&gt;  Now, with regard to the fact that Persian, as the mother tongue of both [[Avicenna]] and [[Mulla Sadra|Sadrā]], was in conflict with either Greek or Arabic in this regard, these philosophers should have been warned implicitly by their mother tongue not to confuse two kinds of linguistic beings (viz. [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] vs. existential). In fact when analyzed thoroughly, [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], or Persian ''ast'' ('is') indicates an ever-moving chain of relations with no fixed ''entity'' to hold onto (every ''entity'', say A, will be dissolved into "A is B" and so on, as soon as one tries to define it). Therefore, the whole reality or what we see as existence ("found" in our world) resembles an ever-changing world of ''astī'' (is-ness) flowing in time and space. On the other hand, while Persian ''ast''  can be considered as the 3rd person singular of the verb 'to be', there is no verb but an arbitrary one supporting ''hast'' ('is' as an existential be= exists) has neither future nor past tense and nor a negative form of its own: ''hast'' is just a single untouchable lexeme. It needs no other linguistic element to be complete (''Hast.'' is a complete sentence meaning "s/he it exists"). In fact, any manipulation of the arbitrary verb, e.g. its conjugation, turns ''hast'' back into a copula.

Eventually from such linguistic analyses, it appears that while ''astī'' (is-ness) would resemble the world of [[Heraclitus]], ''hastī'' (existence) would rather approaches a metaphysical concept resembling the [[Parmenides|Parmenidas]]'s interpretation of ''existence''.

In this regard, [[Avicenna]], who was a firm follower of [[Aristotle]], could not accept either Heraclitian ''is-ness'' (where only constant was ''change''), nor Parmenidean ''monist immoveable existence'' (the ''hastī'' itself being constant). To solve the contradiction, it so appeared to Philosophers of Islamic world that [[Aristotle]] considered the core of existence (i.e. its ''[[Substance theory|substance]]''/''[[essence]]'') as a fixed constant, while its facade ([[Accident (philosophy)|accident]]) was prone to change. To translate such a philosophical image into Persian it is like having ''hastī'' (existence) as a unique constant core covered by ''astī'' (is-ness) as a cloud of ever-changing relationships. It is clear that the Persian language, deconstructs such a composite as a sheer mirage, since it is not clear how to link the interior core (existence) with the exterior shell (is-ness). Furthermore, ''hast'' cannot be linked to anything but itself (as it is self-referent).

The argument has a theological echos as well: assuming that God is the ''Existence'', beyond time and space, a question is raised by philosophers of the Islamic world as how he, as a transcendental existence, may ever create or contact a world of ''is-ness'' in space-time.

However, [[Avicenna]] who was more philosopher than theologian, followed the same line of argumentation as that of his ancient master, [[Aristotle]], and tried to reconcile between ''ast'' and ''hast'', by considering the latter as higher order of existence than the former. It is like a hierarchical order of existence. It was a philosophical [[Tower of Babel]] that the restriction of his own mother tongue (Persian) would not allow to be built, but he could maneuver in Arabic by giving the two concepts the same name ''wujud'', although with different attributes. So, implicitly, ''astī'' (is-ness) appears as ممکن الوجود "momken-al-wujud" (contingent being), and ''hastī'' (existence) as واجب الوجود "wājeb-al-wujud" (necessary being).

On the other hand, centuries later, [[Mulla Sadra|Sadrā]], chose a more radical route, by inclining towards the reality of ''astī'' (is-ness),  as the true mode of existence, and tried to get rid of the concept of ''hastī'' (existence as fixed or immovable). Thus, in his philosophy, the universal movement penetrates deep into the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ''[[Substance theory|substance]]''/''[[essence]]'',  in unison with changing [[Accident (philosophy)|accident]].  He called this deep existential change حرکت جوهری ''harekat-e jowhari'' (Substantial Movement). In such a changing existence, the whole world has to go through instantaneous annihilation and recreation incessantly, while as [[Avicenna]] had predicted in his remarks on Nature, such a universal change or substantial movement would eventually entail the shortening and lengthening of time as well which has never been observed. This logical objection, which was made on Aristotle's argumentation, could not be answered in the ancient times or medieval age, but now it does not sound contradictory to the real nature of Time (as addressed in relativity theory), so by a reverse argument, a philosopher may indeed deduce that everything is changing (moving) even in the deepest core of Being.

==Being in the Age of Reason==
Although innovated in the late [[medieval]] period, Thomism was dogmatized in the [[Renaissance]]. From roughly 1277 to 1567, it dominated the philosophic landscape. The [[rationalist]] philosophers, however, with a new emphasis on [[Reason]] as a tool of the intellect, brought the classical and medieval traditions under new scrutiny, exercising a new concept of [[doubt]], with varying outcomes. Foremost among the new doubters were the [[Empiricism|empiricists]], the advocates of [[scientific method]], with its emphasis on [[experiment]]ation and reliance on evidence gathered from sensory experience. In parallel with the [[revolution]]s against rising political [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]] based on [[established religion]] and the replacement of [[faith]] by reasonable faith, new systems of metaphysics were promulgated in the lecture halls by charismatic professors, such as [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Hegel]]. The late 19th and 20th centuries featured an emotional return to the concept of existence under the name of [[existentialism]]. These philosophers were concerned mainly with ethics and religion. The metaphysical side became the domain of the [[phenomenalism|phenomenalists]]. In parallel with these philosophies Thomism continued under the protection of the Catholic Church; in particular, the [[Jesuit order]].

===Empiricist doubts===
[[Rationalism]] and [[empiricism]] have had many definitions, most concerned with specific schools of philosophy or groups of philosophers in particular countries, such as Germany. In general rationalism is the predominant school of thought in the multi-national, cross-cultural [[Age of reason]], which began in the century straddling 1600 as a conventional date,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=age of reason|encyclopedia=dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/age+of+reason|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; empiricism is the reliance on sensory data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=empiricism|encyclopedia=dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/empiricism|accessdate=9 January 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090125191857/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/empiricism| archivedate= 25 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; gathered in experimentation by scientists of any country, who, in the Age of Reason were rationalists. An early professed empiricist, [[Thomas Hobbes]], known as an eccentric denizen of the court of [[Charles II of England]] (an "old bear"), published in 1651 ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', a political treatise written during the [[English civil war]], containing an early [[manifesto]] in English of rationalism.
Hobbes said:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=18, 21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Latines called Accounts of mony Rationes ... and thence it seems to proceed that they extended the word Ratio, to the faculty of Reckoning in all other things....When a man reasoneth hee does nothing else but conceive a summe totall ... For Reason ... is nothing but Reckoning ... of the consequences of generall names agreed upon, for the marking and signifying of our thoughts ...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Hobbes reasoning is the right process of drawing conclusions from definitions (the "names agreed upon"). He goes on to define error as self-contradiction of definition ("an absurdity, or senselesse Speech"&lt;ref name=hobbes23&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or conclusions that do not follow the definitions on which they are supposed to be based. Science, on the other hand, is the outcome of "right reasoning," which is based on "natural sense and imagination", a kind of sensitivity to nature, as "nature it selfe cannot erre."

Having chosen his ground carefully Hobbes launches an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] attack on [[metaphysics]]. The academic philosophers had arrived at the [[Hylomorphism (Aristotelian)|Theory of Matter and Form]] from consideration of certain natural [[paradox]]es subsumed under the general heading of the Unity Problem. For example, a body appears to be one thing and yet it is distributed into many parts. Which is it, one or many? Aristotle had arrived at the real distinction between [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] and [[Substantial form|form]], metaphysical components whose interpenetration produces the paradox. The whole unity comes from the substantial form and the distribution into parts from the matter. Inhering in the parts giving them really distinct unities are the [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental forms]]. The unity of the whole being is actuated by another really distinct principle, the existence.

If nature cannot err, then there are no paradoxes in it; to Hobbes, the paradox is a form of the absurd, which is inconsistency:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Natural sense and imagination, are not subject to absurdity" and "For error is but a deception ... But when we make a generall assertion, unlesse it be a true one, the possibility of it is inconceivable. And words whereby we conceive nothing but the sound, are those we call Absurd ...." Among Hobbes examples are "round quadrangle", "immaterial substance", "free subject."&lt;ref name=hobbes23/&gt; Of the scholastics he says:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=501}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Yet they will have us beleeve, that by the Almighty power of God, one body may be at one and the same time in many places [the problem of the universals]; and many bodies at one and the same time in one place [the whole and the parts]; ... And these are but a small part of the Incongruencies they are forced to, from their disputing philosophically, instead of admiring, and adoring of the Divine and Incomprehensible Nature ...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The real distinction between essence and existence, and that between form and matter, which served for so long as the basis of metaphysics, Hobbes identifies as "the Error of Separated Essences."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=500}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The words "Is, or Bee, or Are, and the like" add no meaning to an argument nor do derived words such as "Entity, Essence, Essentially, Essentiality", which "are the names of nothing"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=498–499}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but are mere "Signes" connecting "one name or attribute to another: as when we say, ''"a man is a living body"'', we mean not that the ''man'' is one thing, the ''living body'' another, and the ''is'', or ''being'' a third: but that the ''man'', and the ''living body'', is the same thing; ..."  Metaphysiques, Hobbes says, is "far from the possibility of being understood" and is "repugnant to natural reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=496–497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being to Hobbes (and the other empiricists) is the physical universe:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The world, (I mean ... the Universe, that is, the whole masse of all things that are) is corporeall, that is to say, Body; and hath the dimension of magnitude, namely, Length, Bredth and Depth: also every part of Body, is likewise Body ... and consequently every part of the Universe is Body, and that which is not Body, is no part of the Universe: and because the Universe is all, that which is no part of it is nothing; and consequently no where."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hobbes' view is representative of his tradition. As Aristotle offered the categories and the act of existence, and Aquinas the analogy of being, the rationalists also had their own system, the [[great chain of being]], an interlocking hierarchy of beings from God to dust.

===Idealist systems===
In addition to the [[materialism]] of the empiricists, under the same [[aegis]] of Reason, rationalism produced systems that were diametrically opposed now called [[idealism]], which denied the reality of [[matter]] in favor of the reality of [[mind]]. By a 20th-century classification, the idealists ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Hegel]] and others), are considered the beginning of [[continental philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fritzman|first=J. M.|date=2011-10-12|title=Review of Kant, Kantianism, and Idealism: The Origins of Continental Philosophy|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/kant-kantianism-and-idealism-the-origins-of-continental-philosophy/|issn=1538-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the empiricists are the beginning, or the immediate predecessors, of [[analytical philosophy]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/analytic-philosophy|title=Analytic philosophy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Being in continental philosophy and existentialism==
Some philosophers deny that the concept of "being" has any meaning at all, since we only define an object's existence by its relation to other objects, and actions it undertakes. The term "I am" has no meaning by itself; it must have an action or relation appended to it. This in turn has led to the thought that "being" and [[nothing]]ness are closely related, developed in [[Existentialism|existential]] philosophy.

[[Existentialism|Existentialist]] philosophers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], as well as [[continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] have also written extensively on the concept of being. Hegel distinguishes between the being of objects ([[being in itself]]) and the being of people (''[[Geist (philosophy)|Geist]])''.  Hegel, however, did not think there was much hope for delineating a "meaning" of being, because being stripped of all predicates is simply nothing.

Heidegger, in his quest to re-pose the original pre-Socratic question of Being, wondered at how to meaningfully ask the question of the meaning of being, since it is both the greatest, as it includes everything that is, and the least, since no particular thing can be said of it.  He distinguishes between different modes of beings: a privative mode is [[present-at-hand]], whereas beings in a fuller sense are described as [[ready-to-hand]].  The one who asks the question of Being is described as Da-sein ("there/here-being") or '''[[being-in-the-world]].''' Sartre, popularly understood as misreading Heidegger (an understanding supported by Heidegger's essay "Letter on Humanism" which responds to Sartre's famous address, "Existentialism is a Humanism"), employs modes of being in an attempt to ground his concept of freedom ontologically by distinguishing between being-in-itself and being-for-itself.

Being is also understood as one's "state of being," and hence its common meaning is in the context of human (personal) [[experience]], with aspects that involve expressions and manifestations coming from an innate "being", or personal character. [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] coined the term "''[[dasein]]''" for this property of being in his influential work ''[[Being and Time]]'' ("this entity which each of us is himself…we shall denote by the term 'dasein.'"&lt;ref name="dasein1"/&gt;), in which he argued that being or ''dasein'' links one's sense of one's body to one's perception of [[world]]. Heidegger, amongst others, referred to an innate language as the foundation of being, which gives [[Information|signal]] to all aspects of being.

The US carries out 46% of global research and development (R&amp;D) in life sciences, making it the world leader.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=United States of America. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Stewart|first=Shannon|last2=Springs|first2=Stacy|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Federal expenditure on biomedical research ==
Life sciences accounted for 51% of federal research expenditure in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
[[File:R&amp;D budget by US agency, 1994–2014.svg|thumb|Research budget by US agency, 1994-2014. Source: Figure 5.4 from UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, based on data from the American Association for the Advancement of Science]]
The [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) are considered the government's flagship biomedical research funding organization. Between 2004 and 2014, NIH funding remained relatively flat and was not increased to keep pace with [[inflation]].  The NIH budget peaked at circa $35 billion per year from 2003 to 2005 and was around $30 billion in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Government efforts to increase allocations to research between 2013 and 2016 were often thwarted by the congressional austerity drive, with Congress withholding approval of the federal government's budget several times. Over this period, the executive’s priorities were taken forward largely thanks to collaboration between the government, industry and the non-profit sector. This was particularly true for the health sector which, like climate change, was a priority for the [[Obama administration]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Towards more targeted therapies ==
A key policy objective of the Obama administration was to develop more targeted therapies while reducing the time and cost of drug development. Developing a new drug takes well over a decade and has a failure rate of more than 95%. The most expensive failures happen in late phase clinical trials. It is thus vital to pinpoint the right biological targets (genes, proteins and other molecules) early in the process, so as to design more rational drugs and better tailored therapies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[21st Century Cures Act]] was signed into law on 13 December 2016, a year after the release of the [[UNESCO Science Report]]. The report had predicted that, ‘were the bill to pass into law, it would alter the way in which clinical trials are conducted by allowing new and adaptive trial designs that factor in personalized parameters, such as biomarkers and genetics. This provision has proven controversial, with doctors cautioning that overreliance on biomarkers as a measure of efficacy can be misleading, as they may not always reflect improved patient outcomes'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another government scheme hopes to increase the number of new diagnostics and therapies for patients, while reducing the time and cost of developing these. At the launch of the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in February 2014, NIH director Francis S. Collins stated that 'Currently, we are investing too much money and time in avenues that don't pan out, while patients and their families wait'. Over the five years to 2019, this public−private partnership is developing up to five pilot projects for three common but difficult-to-treat diseases: Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 (adult onset) diabetes and the autoimmune disorders of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Proportional allocation of federal R&amp;D spending in the USA by discipline, 1994–2011.svg|thumb|Proportional allocation of federal research funding in the US by discipline, 1994-2011 (%). Source: Figure 5.5 from UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, based on data from American Association for Advancement of Science]]
The partnership involves the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), as well as 10 major biopharmaceutical companies and several non-profit organizations like the Alzheimer's Association. The industrial partners are [[AbbVie Inc.|Abbvie]] (US), [[Biogen]] (US), [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] (US), [[GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd|GlaxoSmithKline]] (UK), [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] (US), Lilly (US), [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]] (US), [[Pfizer]] (US), [[Sanofi]] (France) and [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]] (Japan).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Laboratories share samples, such as blood or brain tissue from deceased patients, to identify biomarkers. They also participate in NIH clinical trials. One critical component is that industry partners have agreed to make the data and analyses arising from the partnership accessible to the broad biomedical community. They will not use any discoveries to develop their own drug until these findings have been made public.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In April 2013, the government announced another public−private partnership, this time to implement its [[BRAIN Initiative|Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologie]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (BRAIN) Initiative. The goal of this project is to leverage genetic, optical and imaging technologies to map individual neurons and complex circuits in the brain, eventually leading to a more complete understanding of this organ’s structure and function. By 2015, the BRAIN Initiative had ‘obtained commitments of over US$ 300 million in resources from federal agencies ([[National Institutes of Health]], [[Food and Drug Administration]], National Science Foundation, etc.), industry (National Photonics Initiative, [[General Electric]], [[Google]], GlaxoSmithKline, etc.) and philanthropy (foundations and universities)’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Precision Medicine Initiative]] has been another government priority. Defined as delivering the right treatment to the right patient at the right time, precision medicine tailors treatments to patients based on their unique physiology, biochemistry and genetics. In his 2016 budget request, the president asked for US$215 million to be shared by the NIH, [[National Cancer Institute]] and FDA to fund the Precision Medicine Initiative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Research spending by biopharmaceutical companies ==

In 2013, US pharmaceutical companies spent $40 billion on R&amp;D inside the US and nearly another $11 billion on R&amp;D abroad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Between 2005 and 2010, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies increased their investment in precision medicine by roughly 75% and a further increase of 53% is projected by 2015. Between 12% and 50% of the products in their drug development pipelines are related to personalized medicine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The federal government and most of the 50 states that make up the United States offer R&amp;D tax credits to particular industries and companies. Congress usually renews a tax credit every few years.  According to a survey by the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2012, companies do not factor in these credits when making décisions about investing in R&amp;D, since they cannot rely on these credits being renewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Tech CFOs don't really trust R&amp;D tax credit, survey says|last=Chasan|first=Emily|date=2012|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, six US biopharmaceutical companies figured in the global Top 50 for the volume of expenditure on R&amp;D. The following have figured in the Top 20 for at least ten years: Intel, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer and IBM. Google was included for the first time in 2013 and Amazon in 2014, which is why the online store does not figure in the Top 50 for 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trends in venture capital investment ==
The National Venture Capital Association has reported that, in 2014, venture capital investment in the life sciences was at its highest level since 2008: in biotechnology, $6.0 billion was invested in 470 deals and, in life sciences overall, $8.6 billion in 789 deals (including biotechnology and medical devices). Two-thirds (68%) of the investment in biotechnology went to first-time/early-stage development deals and the remainder to the expansion stage of development (14%), seed-stage companies (11%) and late-stage companies (7%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, it was the software industry which invested in the greatest number of deals overall: 1 799, for an investment of $19.8 billion. Second came internet-specific companies, garnering US$11.9 billion in investment through 1 005 deals. Many of these companies are based in the State of California, which alone concentrates 28% of US research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Total investment in venture capital amounted to US$48.3 billion in 2014, for 4 356 deals. This represented ‘an increase of 61% in dollars and a 4% increase in deals over the prior year,’ reported the National Venture Capital Association.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that venture capital investment in the United States had fully recovered by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science, Technology and Innovation Outlook|last=|first=|publisher=Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development|year=2014|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, a number of pharmaceutical companies have made strategic mergers to relocate their headquarters overseas to gain a tax advantage, including Medtronic and Endo International. Pfizer's own attempt to take over the British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca aborted in 2014 after Pfizer admitted plans to cut research spending in the combined company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trends in prescription drug prices ==
One policy concern for the [[Obama administration]] has been the steep rise in the price of prescription drugs, in a country where these prices are largely unregulated. From January 2008 to December 2014, the price of commonly used branded drugs increased by a little over 127%, even as the price of commonly prescribed generic drugs decreased by almost 63%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2014, spending on prescription drugs hit $374 billion. This increase in spending was fuelled by the costly new drugs on the market for treating hepatitis C ($11 billion), rather than by the millions of newly insured Americans under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] of 2010 ($1 billion). About 31% of this spending went on specialty drug therapies to treat inflammatory conditions, multiple sclerosis, oncology, hepatitis C and HIV, etc., and 6.4% on traditional therapies to treat diabetes, high cholesterol, pain, high blood pressure and heart disease, asthma, depression and so on’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fuelling the 'astronomic' rise in consumer prices for prescription drugs has been a new trend in the US, the acquisition of pharmaceuticals through licensing, purchase, a merger or acquisition. In the first half of 2014, the value of mergers and acquisitions by pharmaceutical companies totalled US$317.4 billion and, in the first quarter of 2015, the drug industry accounted for a little more than 45% of all US mergers and acquisitions. Several pharmaceutical companies have made strategic mergers in recent years to relocate their headquarters overseas to order to gain a tax advantage. Pfizer’s own attempt to take over the British pharmaceutical company [[AstraZeneca|Astrazeneca]] aborted in 2014, after [[Pfizer]] admitted plans to cut research spending in the combined company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Bringing down the cost to consumers ==
The [[Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act)|Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act]] was signed into law in March 2010 to encourage the development of generic drug competition as a cost containment measure for high-priced pharmaceuticals. Part of the government’s signatory [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], it has created a pathway for fast-track licensure for biological products that are shown to be ‘biosimilar’ to, or ‘interchangeable’ with, an approved biological product. One inspiration for the act was that the patents for many biologic drugs will expire in the next decade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although the act was passed in 2010, the first biosimilar was only approved in the US by the FDA in 2015: Zarxio, made by [[Sandoz Laboratories|Sandoz]]. Zarxio is a biosimilar of the cancer drug Neupogen, which boosts the patient’s white blood cells to ward off infection. In September 2015, a US court ruled that the Neupogen brand manufacturer Amgen could not block Zarxio from being sold in the US. Neupogen costs about US$3 000 per chemotherapy cycle; Zarxio hit the US market on 3 September 2015 at a 15% discount.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Europe, the same drug had been approved as early as 2008 and has been safely marketed there ever since. The lag in development of an approval pathway in the US has been criticized for impeding access to biological therapies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The true cost savings from the use of biosimilars is difficult to assess. A 2014 study by the [[Rand Institute]] estimates a range of US$13–66 billion in savings over 2014–2024, depending upon the level of competition and FDA regulatory approval patterns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike generics, biosimilars cannot be approved on the basis of minimal and inexpensive tests to prove bioequivalence. Since biological drugs are complex, heterogeneous products derived from living cells, they can only be shown to be highly similar to the appropriate reference product and therefore require demonstration that there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety and efficacy. The extent to which clinical trials are required will largely determine the cost of development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Orphan drugs ==
Orphan diseases affect fewer than 200 000 Americans each year. Since the [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983|Orphan Drug Act]] of 1983, over 400 drugs and biologic products for rare diseases have been designated by the Food and Drug Administration (as of 2015), 260 alone in 2013. In 2014, sales of the top 10 [[Orphan drug|orphan drugs]] in the US amounted to US$18.32 billion; by 2020, orphan drugs sales worldwide are projected to account for 19% (US$ 28.16 billion) of the total US$ 176 billion in prescription drug spending.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, orphan drugs cost about 19.1 times more than non-orphan drugs (on an annual basis) in 2014, at an average annual cost per patient of US$ 137 782. Some are concerned that the incentives given to pharmaceutical companies to develop orphan drugs by the FDA’s orphan drug products programme is taking the companies’ attention away from developing drugs that will benefit more of the population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Medical devices ==
There are more than 6500 medical device companies in the US, more than 80% of which have fewer than 50 employees. According to the [[United States Department of Commerce|US Department of Commerce]], the market size of the medical device industry in the US is expected to reach US$ 133 billion by 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Observers foresee the further development and emergence of wearable health monitoring devices, telediagnosis and telemonitoring, robotics, biosensors, three-dimensional (3D) printing, new ''in vitro'' diagnostic tests and mobile apps that enable users to monitor their health and related behaviour better.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trends in pharmaceutical exports and patents ==
[[File:High-tech exports from the USA as a world share, 2008–2013.svg|thumb|High-tech exports from the United States of America as a world share, 2008-2013, data from Comtrade database, taken from UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 5.10]]
Until 2010, the United States of America was a net exporter of pharmaceuticals. Since 2011, it has become a net importer of these goods. The United States has lost its world leadership for high-tech goods. Even computing and communications equipment is now assembled in China and other emerging economies, with high-tech value-added components being produced elsewhere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The United States is a post-industrial country. Imports of high-tech products far exceed exports. However, the United States' technologically skilled workforce produces a large volume of patents and can still profit from the license or sale of these patents. Within the United States' scientific industries active in research, 9.1% of products and services are concerned with the licensing of intellectual property rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When it comes to trade in intellectual property, the United States remains unrivalled. Income from royalties and licensing amounted to $129.2 billion in 2013, the highest in the world. Japan comes a distant second, with receipts of $31.6 billion in 2013. The United States' payments for use of intellectual property amounted to $39.0 billion in 2013, exceeded only by Ireland ($46.4 billion).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Cryo surgery.jpg|thumb|Technicians prepare a body for cryopreservation in 1985.]]

'''Cryonics''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] κρύος ''kryos'' meaning 'cold') is the [[Cryopreservation|low-temperature preservation]] (usually at −196&amp;nbsp;[[degree Celsius|°C]]) of a human corpse, with the hope that [[wikt:resuscitate|resuscitation]] and restoration to life and full health may be possible in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McKie|first=Robin|title=Cold facts about cryonics|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jul/14/medicalscience.science|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=13 July 2002|
quote="Cryonics, which began in the Sixties, is the freezing – usually in liquid nitrogen – of human beings who have been legally declared dead. The aim of this process is to keep such individuals in a state of refrigerated limbo so that it may become possible in the future to resuscitate them, cure them of the condition that killed them, and then restore them to functioning life in an era when medical science has triumphed over the activities of the Grim Reaper."
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cryopreservation]] of humans is not reversible with present technology; [[wikt:cryonicist|cryonicists]] hope that medical advances will someday allow cryopreserved bodies to be revived.&lt;ref name="guardian keep cool"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dying is the last thing anyone wants to do – so keep cool and carry on|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/11/cryonics-booms-in-us|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryonics is regarded with skepticism within the mainstream scientific community and is not part of normal medical practice. It is not known if it will ever be possible to revive a cryopreserved human cadaver. Cryonics depends on beliefs that the frozen body has not experienced [[information-theoretic death]].&lt;ref name="Merkle 1992 6–16"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Merkle| first1 = R|  title = The technical feasibility of cryonics| journal = Medical Hypotheses| volume = 39| issue = 1| pages = 6–16| year = 1992| publisher = Elsevier| pmid=1435395| doi = 10.1016/0306-9877(92)90133-W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such views are at the speculative edge of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Wowk| first = B| title = The future of death| journal = Journal of Critical Care| volume = 29| issue = 6 |pages = 1111–1113| year = 2014| publisher = Elsevier| pmid=25194588| doi =10.1016/j.jcrc.2014.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Cryonic proponents go further than the mainstream [[Scientific consensus|consensus]] in asserting that the brain does not have to be continuously active to survive or retain memory. Cryonics controversially asserts that a human survives even within an inactive brain that has been badly damaged, provided that original encoding of memory and personality can, in theory, be adequately inferred and reconstituted from structure that remains.&lt;ref name="Merkle 1992 6–16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=moen&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moen, OM |title=The case for cryonics |journal=[[Journal of Medical Ethics]] |volume=41 | issue=18 |pages=493–503  |date=August 2015 | pmid=25717141 | doi=10.1136/medethics-2015-102715}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doyle, DJ |title=Cryonic Life Extension: Scientific Possibility or Stupid Pipe Dream? |journal=Ethics in Biology, Engineering and Medicine: an International Journal |volume=3 | issue=1–3 |pages=9–28 |date=2012 | doi=10.1615/EthicsBiologyEngMed.2013006985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryonicists argue that as long as brain structure remains intact, there is no fundamental barrier, given our current understanding of physical law, to recovering its information content. Cryonicists argue that true "death" should be defined as irreversible loss of brain information critical to personal identity, rather than inability to resuscitate using current technology.&lt;ref name="Merkle 1992 6–16" /&gt; The cryonics argument that death does not occur as long as brain structure remains intact and theoretically repairable has received some mainstream medical discussion in the context of the ethical concept of [[brain death]] and organ donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Whetstine| title = Pro/con ethics debate: When is dead really dead?| journal = Critical Care | volume = 9 | pages = 538–542| year = 2005| publisher = BioMed Central| pmid=16356234| doi = 10.1186/cc3894 | first1 = L| last2 = Streat| first2 = S| last3 = Darwin| first3 = M| last4 = Crippen| first4 = D| issue = 6| pmc=1414041| quote= The brain is a discrete pattern of atoms, each as effective as the next as long as the unique pattern of their arrangement persists.

Does this mean that every dying patient must be assaulted by every possible intervention if he or she is to be proven dead? A third caucus says that irreversibility occurs when the inherent order of the atoms that make up the brain are irrevocably destroyed.

Cryonics uses temperatures below −130&amp;nbsp;[[degree Celsius|°C]], called [[cryopreservation]], in an attempt to preserve enough brain information to permit future revival of the cryopreserved person. Cryopreservation may be accomplished by freezing, freezing with [[cryoprotectant]] to reduce ice damage, or by [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] to avoid ice damage. Even using the best methods, cryopreservation of whole bodies or brains is very damaging and irreversible with current technology.

Cryonics requires future technology to repair or regenerate tissue that is diseased, damaged, or missing. Brain repairs in particular will require analysis at the molecular level. This far-future technology is usually assumed to be [[nanomedicine]] based on [[molecular nanotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Drexler, K.

==Obstacles to success==
=== Preservation injury ===
Long-term preservation of biological tissue can be achieved by cooling to temperatures below −130&amp;nbsp;[[degree Celsius|°C]].&lt;ref name="Mazur P C125–42"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mazur P |title=Freezing of living cells: mechanisms and implications |journal=The American Journal of Physiology |volume=247 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=C125–42 |date=September 1984 |pmid=6383068 |url=http://ajpcell.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&amp;pmid=6383068}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immersion in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of −196&amp;nbsp;[[degree Celsius|°C]] (77 [[kelvin]]s and −320.8&amp;nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]]) is often used for convenience. Low temperature preservation of tissue is called [[cryopreservation]]. Contrary to popular belief, water that freezes during cryopreservation is usually water outside cells, not water inside cells. Cells don't burst during freezing, but instead become dehydrated and compressed between ice crystals that surround them. Intracellular ice formation only occurs if the rate of freezing is faster than the rate of osmotic loss of water to the extracellular space.&lt;ref name="Mazur P C125–42" /&gt;

Without [[cryoprotectant]]s, [[Cell (biology)|cell]] shrinkage and high [[salt]] concentrations during freezing usually prevent frozen cells from functioning again after thawing.

The use of vitrification rather than freezing for cryonics was anticipated in 1986, when [[K. Eric Drexler]] proposed a technique called ''fixation and vitrification'', anticipating reversal by [[molecular nanotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Drexler |first =Eric |title =Engines of Creation |publisher =Anchor Press/Doubleday |date =1986 |pages =130–146 |chapter=Chapter 9: A Door to the Future |chapterurl =http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_9.html#section02of06 |isbn =978-0-385-19972-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Robert L. McIntyre and [[Gregory Fahy]] at the cryobiology research company [[21st Century Medicine|21st Century Medicine, Inc.]] won the Small Animal Brain Preservation Prize of the Brain Preservation Foundation by demonstrating to the satisfaction of neuroscientist judges that a particular implementation of fixation and vitrification called ''aldehyde-stabilized cryopreservation''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McIntyre RL, Fahy GM |title=Aldehyde-stabilized cryopreservation |journal=Cryobiology |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=448–458 |date=December 2015 |pmid=26408851 |doi=10.1016/j.cryobiol.2015.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; could preserve a rabbit brain in "near perfect" condition at −135&amp;nbsp;[[degree Celsius|°C]], with the cell membranes, synapses, and intracellular structures intact in electron micrographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Small Mammal BPF Prize Winning Announcement| publisher = Brain Preservation Foundation| date = 2016-02-09| url = http://www.brainpreservation.org/small-mammal-announcement/ | accessdate =  2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Claire Maldarelli|title=Researchers Have Preserved an Entire Rabbit Brain|url=http://www.popsci.com/researchers-have-preserved-an-entire-rabbit-brain|accessdate=20 March 2016|work=[[Popular Science]]|date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Michael Shermer|title=Can Our Minds Live Forever?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-our-minds-live-forever/|accessdate=20 March 2016|work=[[Scientific American]]|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brain Preservation Foundation President, Ken Hayworth, said, "This result directly answers a main skeptical and scientific criticism against cryonics—that it does not provably preserve the delicate synaptic circuitry of the brain.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Anthony Cuthbertson|title=Rabbit Brain Returns Successfully from Cryopreservation|url=http://www.newsweek.com/rabbit-brain-first-mammal-brain-return-successfully-cryopreservation-424913|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the price paid for perfect preservation as seen by microscopy was tying up all protein molecules with [[Fixation (histology)#Crosslinking fixatives – aldehydes|chemical crosslinks]], completely eliminating [[viable count|biological viability]]. Actual cryonics organizations use vitrification without a [[fixation (histology)|chemical fixation]] step,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Alcor Position Statement on Brain Preservation Prize| publisher = Alcor Life Extension Foundation| date = 2016-02-12| url = http://www.alcor.org/blog/alcor-position-statement-on-brain-preservation-foundation-prize/ | accessdate =  2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; sacrificing some structural preservation quality for less damage at the molecular level. Some scientists, like Joao Pedro Magalhaes, have questioned whether using a deadly chemical for fixation eliminates the possibility of biological revival, making chemical fixation unsuitable for cryonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Mammal brain frozen and thawed out perfectly for first time| url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/2077140-mammal-brain-frozen-and-thawed-out-perfectly-for-first-time/| accessdate = 2016-06-06 | work=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While preservation of both structure and function has been possible for brain slices using vitrification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pichugin Y, Fahy GM, Morin R |title= Cryopreservation of rat hippocampal slices by vitrification |journal=Cryobiology |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=228–240 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16403489 |doi=10.1016/j.cryobiol.2005.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; this goal remains elusive for whole brains. In absence of a revived brain, or [[brain simulation]] from somehow scanning a preserved brain, the adequacy of present vitrification technology (with or without fixation) for preserving the anatomical and molecular basis of long-term memory as required by cryonics is still unproven.

Outside the cryonics community, many scientists have a blanket skepticism toward existing preservation methods. [[Cryobiologist]] Dayong Gao states that "we simply don't know if (subjects have) been damaged to the point where they've 'died' during vitrification because the subjects are now inside liquid nitrogen canisters." Biochemist Ken Storey argues (based on experience with organ transplants), that "even if you only wanted to preserve the brain, it has dozens of different areas, which would need to be cryopreserved using different protocols."&lt;ref name="bbc frozen" /&gt;

===Revival===
Those who believe that revival may someday be possible generally look toward advanced [[bioengineering]], [[molecular nanotechnology]],&lt;ref&gt;Nanofactory Collaboration http://www.molecularassembler.com/Nanofactory&lt;/ref&gt; or [[nanomedicine]]&lt;ref name="Nanomedicine.com" /&gt; as key technologies. Revival would require repairing damage from lack of oxygen, cryoprotectant toxicity, thermal stress (fracturing), freezing in tissues that do not successfully vitrify, and reversing the cause of death. In many cases extensive [[Regeneration (biology)|tissue regeneration]] would be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karow|first1=Armand|last2=Webb|first2=Watts|title=Tissue Freezing: A theory for injury and survival|journal=Crybiology|date=1965|volume=2|issue=3|pages=99–108|accessdate=|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011224065800943|doi=10.1016/s0011-2240(65)80094-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cryonics Institute president Ben Best, cryonics revival may be similar to a [[LIFO (computing)|last in, first out]] process. People cryopreserved in the future, with better technology, may require less advanced technology to be revived because they will have been cryopreserved with better technology that caused less damage to tissue. In this view, preservation methods would get progressively better until eventually they are demonstrably reversible, after which medicine would begin to reach back and revive people cryopreserved by more primitive methods.&lt;ref name="guardian frozen in time"&gt;{{cite news|title=Patients who are frozen in time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/14/research.cryonics|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The "last in, first out" view of cryonics has been criticized because the quality of cryopreservation depends on many factors other than the era in which cryopreservation takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Legal issues===
Historically, a person had little control regarding how their body was treated after death as religion had jurisdiction over the disposal of the body.&lt;ref name="trust"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dukeminier |first1=Jesse | last2= Sitkoff | first2=Robert | date=2013 |title=Wills, Trusts, and Estates |url= |location= |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business in New York |page=507 |isbn=978-1-4548-2457-2 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, secular courts began to exercise jurisdiction over the body and use discretion in carrying out of the wishes of the deceased person.&lt;ref name="trust" /&gt; Most countries legally treat preserved individuals as [[deceased]] persons because of laws that forbid vitrifying someone who is medically alive.&lt;ref name="guardian frozen in time" /&gt; In France, cryonics is not considered a legal mode of body disposal;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leparticulier.fr/jcms/c_101664/conseil-d-etat-du-06/01/2006-n-260307-cryogenisation-interdiction&lt;/ref&gt; only burial, cremation, and formal donation to science are allowed.

==Ethics==
Writing in ''[[Bioethics (journal)|Bioethics]]'', David Shaw examines the ethical status of cryonics. The arguments against it include changing the concept of death, the expense of preservation and revival, lack of scientific advancement to permit revival, temptation to use premature euthanasia, and failure due to catastrophe. Arguments in favor of cryonics include the potential benefit to society, the prospect of immortality, and the benefits associated with avoiding death. Shaw explores the expense and the potential payoff, and applies an adapted version of [[Pascal's Wager]] to the question.&lt;ref name="shaw cryoethics"&gt;Shaw, David.

==History==
{{See also|Cryopreservation#History}}

Cryopreservation was applied to human cells beginning in 1954 with frozen sperm, which was thawed and used to inseminate three women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fatherhood After Death Has Now Been Proved Possible|newspaper=Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=April 9, 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years later, the freezing of humans was first scientifically proposed by Michigan professor [[Robert Ettinger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/18/the-cryonics-dilemma-will-deep-frozen-bodies-be-fit-for-new-life|title=The cryonics dilemma: will deep-frozen bodies be fit for new life?|website=[[The Guardian]]|last=Devlin|first=Hannah|date=18 November 2016|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1966, the first human body was frozen with some thought of future reanimation, though it had been embalmed for two months. The body was placed in [[liquid nitrogen]], and stored at just above freezing. The middle-aged woman from Los Angeles, whose name is unknown, was soon thawed out and buried by relatives.&lt;ref name="alcor1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alcor.org/Library/html/suspensionfailures.html |title=Suspension Failures – Lessons from the Early Days |publisher=Alcor.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first body to be truly cryopreserved was [[James Bedford]]'s a few hours after his cancer-caused death in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Dear Dr. Bedford (and those who will care for you after I do) | publisher=Cryonics   | date=July 1991 | url=http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/BedfordLetter.htm | access-date=2009-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the only cryonics patient frozen before 1974 still preserved today.

In 2018, a [[Y-Combinator]] startup called Nectome was recognized for developing a method of preserving brains with chemicals rather than by freezing.  The method is fatal, performed as euthanasia under general anethesia, but the hope is that future technology would allow the brain to be physically scanned into a computer simulation, neuron by neuron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610456/a-startup-is-pitching-a-mind-uploading-service-that-is-100-percent-fatal/ |title=A startup is pitching a mind-uploading service that is "100 percent fatal" |date=13 March 2018 |publisher=Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', cryonicists are predominantly nonreligious white males, outnumbering women by about three to one.&lt;ref name="nytimes do us part"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howley|first1=Kerry|title=Until Cryonics Do Us Part|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/magazine/11cryonics-t.html|accessdate=2 February 2016|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', as of 2008, while most cryonicists used to be young, male and "geeky" recent demographics have shifted slightly towards whole families.&lt;ref name="guardian frozen in time" /&gt;

In 2015 Du Hong, a 61-year-old female writer of children's literature, became the first known Chinese national to be cryopreserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Chen|url=http://www.scmp.com/tech/science-research/article/1859328/cheating-death-elderly-writer-first-known-chinese-test-subject |title=Cheating death?

==Public reception==
Some scientists have expressed skepticism about cryonics in media sources,&lt;ref name="ft" /&gt; however the number of peer-reviewed papers on cryonics is limited because its speculative aspects place it outside of the focus of most academic fields.&lt;ref name="moen" /&gt; While most neuroscientists agree that all the subtleties of a human mind are contained in its anatomical structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jerry Adler|title=The Quest to Upload Your Mind Into the Digital Space|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/quest-upload-mind-into-digital-space-180954946/|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=[[Smithsonian Magazine]]|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; few neuroscientists will comment directly upon the topic of cryonics due to its speculative nature. Individuals who intend to be frozen are often "looked at as a bunch of kooks", despite many of them being scientists and doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brain Freeze: Can putting faith in cryonics deliver life after death?|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2015/10/06/brain-freeze-can-putting-faith-in-cryonics-deliver-life-after-death|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|accessdate=21 February 2016|date=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to cryonicist Aschwin de Wolf and others, cryonics can often produce intense hostility from spouses who are not cryonicists. James Hughes, the executive director of the pro-life-extension [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]], chooses not to personally sign up for cryonics, calling it a worthy experiment but stating laconically that "I value my relationship with my wife."&lt;ref name="nytimes do us part" /&gt;

[[Cryobiologist]] Dayong Gao states that "People can always have hope that things will change in the future, but there is no scientific foundation supporting cryonics at this time."&lt;ref name="bbc frozen"&gt;{{cite news|title=Frozen body: Can we return from the dead?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/0/23695785|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=[[BBC News]]|date=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcor disagrees, stating that "There are no known credible technical arguments that lead one to conclude that cryonics, carried out under good conditions today, would not work."&lt;ref name="independent chilling facts" /&gt; As well, while it is universally agreed that "[[personal identity]]" is uninterrupted when brain activity temporarily ceases during incidents of accidental drowning (where people have been restored to normal functioning after being completely submerged in cold water for up to 66 minutes), some people express concern that a centuries-long cryopreservation might interrupt their conception of personal identity, such that the revived person would "not be you".&lt;ref name="moen" /&gt;

Many people assert there would be no point in being revived in the far future if their friends and families are dead.&lt;ref name="shaw cryoethics" /&gt;

Death – particularly the death of [[human]]s – has commonly been considered a [[sadness|sad]] or unpleasant occasion, due to the [[affection]] for the being that has died and the termination of social and familial [[human bonding|bonds]] with the deceased. Other concerns include [[death anxiety (psychology)|fear of death]], [[necrophobia]], [[anxiety]], [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]], [[grief]], [[emotional pain]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[sympathy]], [[compassion]], [[solitude]], or [[saudade]]. Many cultures and religions have the idea of an [[afterlife]], and also hold the idea of [[Heaven|reward]] or [[Judgement (afterlife)|judgement]] and [[Hell|punishment for past sin]].

== Etymology ==
The word death comes from [[Old English]] ''dēaþ'', which in turn comes from Proto-Germanic *''dauþuz'' (reconstructed by etymological analysis). This comes from the Proto-Indo-European stem *''dheu-'' meaning the "process, act, condition of dying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death |title=Death |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013162848/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death |archivedate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=5 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated terms ==
[[File:Leonardo Skeleton 1511.jpg|thumb|''Study of Skeletons'', c. 1510, by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]
The concept and symptoms of death, and varying degrees of delicacy used in discussion in public forums, have generated numerous scientific, legal, and socially acceptable terms or euphemisms for death.  When a person has died, it is also said they have ''passed away'', ''passed on'', ''expired'', or are ''gone'', among numerous other socially accepted, religiously specific, slang, and irreverent terms. Bereft of life, the dead person is then a ''corpse'', ''[[cadaver]]'', a ''body'', a ''set of remains'', and when all flesh has rotted away, a [[skeleton]]. The terms ''[[carrion]]'' and ''carcass'' can also be used, though these more often connote the remains of non-human animals.  As a polite reference to a dead person, it has become common practice to use the [[participle]] form of "decease", as in ''the deceased''; another noun form is ''decedent''.  The ashes left after a [[cremation]] are sometimes referred to by the [[neologism]] ''cremains'', a [[portmanteau]] of "cremation" and "remains".

== Senescence ==
[[File:Dead magpie.jpg|thumb|alt=A dead magpie|A dead [[Eurasian magpie]]]]

[[Senescence]] refers to a scenario when a living being is able to survive all calamities, but eventually dies due to causes relating to old age. Animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence, but the aging process derives from deterioration of cellular activity and ruination of regular functioning. Aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and long-term loss of living capacities, even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability. In the United Kingdom, for example, nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur on a daily basis relates to senescence, while around the world it accounts for two-thirds of 150,000 deaths that take place daily (Hayflick &amp; Moody, 2003).

Almost all [[animal]]s who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from [[Senescence|biological aging]], known in life sciences as "senescence". Some organisms experience [[negligible senescence]], even exhibiting [[biological immortality]].  These include the jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/turritopsis-nutricula-immortal-jellyfish.html |title=Turritopsis nutricula (Immortal jellyfish) |publisher=Jellyfishfacts.net |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013163459/http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/turritopsis-nutricula-immortal-jellyfish.html |archivedate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]], and the [[planarian]]. Unnatural causes of death include [[suicide]] and [[homicide]]. From all causes, roughly 150,000 people die around the world each day.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aubrey D.N.J |first=de Grey |authorlink=Aubrey de Grey |title=Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations |journal=Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology |volume=1 |issue=1, Article 5 |year=2007 |url=http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.2202/1941-6008.1011 |accessdate=20 March 2009 |ref=harv |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013163622/http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf |archivedate=13 October 2016|citeseerx=10.1.1.395.745 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, two thirds die directly or indirectly due to senescence, but in industrialized countries – such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany – the rate approaches 90%, i.e., nearly nine out of ten of all deaths are related to senescence.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt;

[[Physiological]] death is now seen as a process, more than an event: conditions once considered indicative of death are now reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crippen |first=David |website=Scientific American Surgery, Critical Care, April 2005 |url=http://www.sciamsurgery.com/sciamsurgery/institutional/payPerAdd.action?chapterId=part08_ch10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624132446/http://www.acssurgery.com/abstracts/acs/acs0812.htm |archivedate=24 June 2006 |title=Brain Failure and Brain Death |accessdate=9 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where in the process a dividing line is drawn between life and death depends on factors beyond the presence or absence of [[vital signs]]. In general, [[clinical death]] is neither necessary nor sufficient for a determination of [[legal death]]. A patient with working [[human heart|heart]] and [[human lung|lungs]] determined to be [[brain death|brain dead]] can be pronounced legally dead without clinical death occurring. As [[science|scientific knowledge]] and [[medicine]] advance, formulating a precise medical definition of death becomes more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Life Death Whatever |first=Alexander |last=Artishevsky |publisher=Createspace |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4495-9420-6 }}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signs===
Signs of death or strong indications that a [[endotherm|warm-blooded animal]] is no longer alive are:
* [[Respiratory arrest]] (no [[breathing]])
* [[Cardiac arrest]] (no [[heart rate|pulse]])
* [[Brain death]] (no neuronal activity)
* {{lang|la|[[Pallor mortis]]}}, paleness which happens in the 15–120 minutes after death
* {{lang|la|[[Livor mortis]]}}, a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body
* {{lang|la|[[Algor mortis]]}}, the reduction in body temperature following death. This is generally a steady decline until matching ambient temperature
* {{lang|la|[[Rigor mortis]]}}, the limbs of the corpse become stiff (Latin ''rigor'') and difficult to move or manipulate
* [[Decomposition]], the reduction into simpler forms of matter, accompanied by a strong, unpleasant odor.

The concept of death is a key to human understanding of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Samir Hossain Mohammad |author2=Gilbert Peter | year = 2010 | title = Concepts of Death: A key to our adjustment | url = | journal = Illness, Crisis and Loss | volume = 18 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many scientific approaches to the concept. For example, brain death, as practiced in medical science, defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceases.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf |title=Additional Lifespan Development Topics |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Fenwick%20Book%20Review%20Human%20Immortality;%20%20Death%20and%20Adjustment%20Hypotheses%20Elaborated.x.x.pdf Human Immortality; Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated.] Book Review by Dr. Peter Fenwick  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518024043/http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Fenwick%20Book%20Review%20Human%20Immortality%3B%20%20Death%20and%20Adjustment%20Hypotheses%20Elaborated.x.x.pdf |date=18 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf Facing the finality – Death and Adjustment Hypotheses] Dr. Mohammad Samir Hossain, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from [[life]]. As a point in time, death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends. Determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Crossing Over: How Science Is Redefining Life and Death |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |authorlink=Robin Marantz Henig |publisher=''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' |date=April 2016 |accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such determination therefore requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is difficult, due to there being little consensus on how to define life. This general problem applies to the particular challenge of defining death in the context of medicine.

It is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died. One of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms which are alive but probably not conscious (for example, single-celled organisms). Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers.  Additionally, many religious traditions, including [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] and [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic]] traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness.  In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1991 |last=Metcalf |first=Peter |last2=Huntington |first2=Richard |title=Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual |publisher=Cambridge Press |place=New York}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of something.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary{{clarify|date=January 2014|reason=This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=&lt;nowiki&gt;This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details. Use &lt;ref...&gt; inline in the article (see WP:CITE) to source the specific facts provided by this reference.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} In this context "death" describes merely the state where something has ceased, for example, life. Thus, the definition of "life" simultaneously defines death.

Historically, attempts to define the exact moment of a human's death have been subjective, or imprecise. Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt [[defibrillation]] have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events which were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.

Today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to "brain death" or "biological death" to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of [[consciousness]]. Suspension of consciousness must be permanent, and not transient, as occurs during certain [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|sleep]] stages, and especially a [[coma]]. In the case of sleep, [[electroencephalography|EEGs]] can easily tell the difference.

The category of "brain death" is seen as problematic by some scholars. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: "By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant "brain-dead" women)."&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller |first=F.G. |title=Death and organ donation: back to the future |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |date=October 2009 |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=616–620 |doi=10.1136/jme.2009.030627 |pmid=19793942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those people maintaining that only the [[neo-cortex]] of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of [[cognition|cognitive]] function, as evidenced by the death of the [[cerebral cortex]]. All hope of recovering human thought and [[personality psychology|personality]] is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology. At present, in most places the more conservative definition of death&amp;nbsp;– irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex&amp;nbsp;– has been adopted (for example the [[Uniform Determination Of Death Act]] in the United States). In 2005, the [[Terri Schiavo case]] brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].

Even by whole-brain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated. EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain [[drugs]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], or [[hypothermia]] can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis. Because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving EEGs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.

===Legal===
{{See also|Legal death}}

The death of a person has legal consequences that may vary between different jurisdictions.
A [[death certificate]] is issued in most jurisdictions, either by a doctor, or by an administrative office upon presentation of a doctor's declaration of death.

===Misdiagnosed===
{{See also|Premature burial}}
[[File:Wiertz burial.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Wiertz]]'s painting of a man buried alive]]
There are many anecdotal references to people being declared dead by physicians and then "coming back to life", sometimes days later in their own coffin, or when [[embalming]] procedures are about to begin. From the mid-18th century onwards, there was an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before [[burial]], ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet or into the [[rectum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|pp=56,&amp;nbsp;71.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1895, the physician J.C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in [[England]] and [[Wales]], although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of [[electric shock]], [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) for an hour or longer can allow stunned [[nerve]]s to recover, allowing an apparently dead person to survive. People found unconscious under icy water may survive if their faces are kept continuously cold until they arrive at an [[emergency department|emergency room]].&lt;ref name=Limmer&gt;{{cite book|title=Brady Emergency Care AHA |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-159390-9 |author=Limmer, Dan; O'Keefe, Michael F.; Bergeron, J.

As medical technologies advance, ideas about when death occurs may have to be re-evaluated in light of the ability to restore a person to vitality after longer periods of apparent death (as happened when CPR and defibrillation showed that cessation of heartbeat is inadequate as a decisive indicator of death). The lack of electrical brain activity may not be enough to consider someone scientifically dead. Therefore, the concept of information-theoretic death&lt;ref name="InfoDeath"&gt;{{cite web

There have been some scientific attempts to bring dead organisms back to life, but with limited success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/06/28/blood-swapping-reanimates-dead-dogs/ |title=Blood Swapping Reanimates Dead Dogs |newspaper=Fox News |date=28 June 2005 |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014135940/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/06/28/blood-swapping-reanimates-dead-dogs.html |archivedate=14 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--to find this if it goes dead: original url http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,160903,00.html--&gt; In [[science fiction]] [[scenario]]s where such technology is readily available, real death is distinguished from reversible death.

The leading cause of human death in [[developing countries]] is [[infectious disease]]. The leading causes in [[developed countries]] are [[atherosclerosis]] ([[heart disease]] and [[stroke]]), [[cancer]], and other diseases related to [[obesity]] and [[aging]]. By an extremely wide margin, the largest unifying cause of death in the developed world is biological aging,&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; leading to various complications known as [[aging-associated diseases]]. These conditions cause loss of [[homeostasis]], leading to [[cardiac arrest]], causing loss of [[oxygen]] and nutrient supply, causing irreversible deterioration of the [[Human brain|brain]] and other [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, approaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; With improved medical capability, dying has become [[respite care|a condition to be managed]]. Home deaths, once commonplace, are now rare in the developed world.

Many leading developed world causes of death can be postponed by [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[physical fitness|physical activity]], but the accelerating incidence of disease with age still imposes limits on human [[longevity]]. The [[evolution of aging|evolutionary cause of aging]] is, at best, only just beginning to be understood. It has been suggested that direct intervention in the aging process may now be the most effective intervention against major causes of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olshansky |first=S.

[[Hans Selye|Selye]] proposed a unified non-specific approach to many causes of death. He demonstrated that [[Stress (biology)|stress]] decreases adaptability of an organism and proposed to describe the adaptability as a special resource, ''adaptation energy''. The animal dies when this resource is exhausted.&lt;ref name="SelyeAE2"&gt;Selye, H. (1938). Experimental evidence supporting the conception of "adaptation energy", Am. J. Physiol. 123 (1938), 758–765.&lt;/ref&gt; Selye assumed that  the adaptability is a finite supply, presented at birth. Later on, Goldstone proposed the concept of a production or income of adaptation energy which may be stored (up to a limit), as a capital reserve of adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goldstone B |year=1952 |title=The general practitioner and the general adaptation syndrome |journal=South African Medical Journal |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent works,  adaptation energy is considered as an internal coordinate on the "dominant path" in the model of adaptation. It is demonstrated that oscillations of well-being appear when the reserve of adaptability is almost exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gorban A.N. |author2=Tyukina T.A. |author3=Smirnova E.V. |author4=Pokidysheva L.I. |year=2016 |title=Evolution of adaptation mechanisms: adaptation energy, stress, and oscillating death|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287251014 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.12.017 |pmid=26801872 |journal=J.

=== Autopsy ===
[[File:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg|thumb|alt=A painting of an autopsy, by Rembrandt, entitled "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp"|An autopsy is portrayed in ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]
An [[autopsy]], also known as a ''postmortem examination'' or an ''obduction'', is a [[medical procedure]] that consists of a thorough [[Medical examination|examination]] of a human [[dead body|corpse]] to determine the cause and manner of a person's death and to evaluate any [[disease]] or [[injury]] that may be present. It is usually performed by a specialized [[physician|medical doctor]] called a [[pathologist]].

Autopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from [[next of kin]] may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together. Autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices.

A "necropsy" is an older term for a postmortem examination, unregulated, and not always a medical procedure. In modern times the term is more often used in the postmortem examination of the corpses of animals.

== Cryonics ==
[[File:Cryo surgery.jpg|thumb|Technicians prepare a body for cryopreservation in 1985.]]
{{Main|Cryonics}}

[[Cryonics]] (from Greek κρύος 'kryos-' meaning 'icy cold') is the [[cryopreservation|low-temperature preservation]] of animals and humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and [[wikt:resuscitate|resuscitation]] may be possible in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McKie|first=Robin |title=Cold facts about cryonics |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jul/14/medicalscience.science |newspaper=[[The Oalobserver]] |date=13 July 2002 |accessdate=1 December 2013 |quote="Cryonics, which began in the Fifties, is the freezing – usually in liquid nitrogen – of human beings who have been legally declared dead. The aim of this process is to keep such individuals in a state of refrigerated limbo so that it may become possible in the future to resuscitate them, cure them of the condition that killed them, and then restore them to functioning life in an era when medical science has triumphed over the activities of the Banana Reaper."

[[Cryopreservation]] of people or large animals is not reversible with current technology.

== Life extension ==
{{Main|Life extension}}

Life extension refers to an increase in [[maximum life span|maximum]] or [[life expectancy|average lifespan]], especially in humans, by slowing down or reversing the [[senescence|processes of aging]]. Average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age or lifestyle-related afflictions such as [[cancer]], or [[cardiovascular disease]]. Extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]. Maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s. Currently, the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is [[calorie restriction]]. Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], or by [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues.

A United States poll found that religious people and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension, while Africans and Hispanics have higher rates of support than white people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans' Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension |date=6 August 2013 |publisher=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project |website=Pew Research Center |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130816050024/http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |archivedate=16 August 2013 |accessdate=19 September 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 38 percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured.

Researchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as "biomedical [[gerontologist]]s". They try to understand the nature of aging and they develop treatments to reverse aging processes or to at least slow them down, for the improvement of health and the maintenance of youthful vigor at every stage of life. Those who take advantage of life extension findings and seek to apply them upon themselves are called "life extensionists" or "longevists". The primary life extension strategy currently is to apply available anti-aging methods in the hope of living long enough to benefit from a complete cure to aging once it is developed.

In society, the nature of death and humanity's [[Mortality salience|awareness of its own mortality]] has for millennia been a concern of the world's [[religious traditions]] and of [[philosophy|philosophical inquiry]]. This includes belief in [[resurrection]] or an [[afterlife]] (associated with [[Abrahamic religions]]), [[reincarnation]] or rebirth (associated with [[Dharmic religions]]), or that consciousness permanently ceases to exist, known as [[eternal oblivion]] (associated with [[atheism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fuKB8MPMdG4C&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Handbook to the Afterlife |last1=Heath |first1=Pamela Rae |last2=Klimo |first2=Jon |publisher=North Atlantic Books |year=2010 |page=18 |isbn=978-1-55643-869-1 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commemoration ceremonies after death may include various [[mourning]], [[funeral]] practices and ceremonies of honouring the deceased. The physical remains of a person, commonly known as a ''corpse'' or ''body'', are usually [[burial|interred]] whole or [[cremated]], though among the world's cultures there are a variety of other methods of [[Disposal of human corpses|mortuary disposal]]. In the English language, blessings directed towards a dead person include ''[[rest in peace]]'', or its [[initialism]] RIP.

Death is the center of many traditions and organizations; customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world. Much of this revolves around the care of the dead, as well as the [[afterlife]] and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death. The [[disposal of human corpses]] does, in general, begin with the [[last offices]] before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or [[cremation]]. This is not a unified practice; in [[Tibet]], for instance, the body is given a [[sky burial]] and left on a mountain top. Proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer one's spiritual attainments into another body ([[reincarnation]]) are subjects of detailed study in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mullin|1999|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mummification]] or [[embalming]] is also prevalent in some cultures, to retard the rate of [[Decomposition|decay]].

Legal aspects of death are also part of many cultures, particularly the settlement of the deceased [[estate (law)|estate]] and the issues of [[inheritance]] and in some countries, [[inheritance tax]]ation.

[[File:Grave stone2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Gravestones in Japan|Gravestones in [[Kyoto]], Japan]]
[[Capital punishment]] is also a culturally divisive aspect of death. In most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today, the death penalty is reserved for premeditated [[murder]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of [[military justice]]. In some countries, sexual crimes, such as [[adultery]] and [[sodomy]], carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[apostasy]], the formal renunciation of one's religion. In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|retentionist]] countries, [[drug trafficking]] is also a capital offense. In China, [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[political corruption|corruption]] are also punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world [[courts-martial]] have imposed death sentences for offenses such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], and [[mutiny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |title=Shot at Dawn, campaign for pardons for British and Commonwealth soldiers executed in World War I |publisher=Shot at Dawn Pardons Campaign |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004030535/http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |archivedate=4 October 2006 |accessdate=20 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death in warfare and in [[suicide attack]] also have cultural links, and the ideas of [[dulce et decorum est pro patria mori]], [[mutiny]] punishable by death, grieving relatives of dead soldiers and [[death notification]] are embedded in many cultures. Recently in the western world, with the increase in terrorism following the [[September 11 attacks]], but also further back in time with suicide bombings, [[kamikaze]] missions in [[World War II]] and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history, death for a cause by way of suicide attack, and [[martyrdom]] have had significant cultural impacts.

[[Suicide]] in general, and particularly [[euthanasia]], are also points of cultural debate. Both acts are understood very differently in different cultures. In [[Japan]], for example, ending a life with honor by [[seppuku]] was considered a desirable death, whereas according to traditional Christian and Islamic cultures, suicide is viewed as a sin. [[Death (personification)|Death is personified]] in many cultures, with such symbolic representations as the [[Grim Reaper]], [[Azrael]], the [[Hindu]] God [[Yama]] and [[Father Time]].

In [[Brazil]], a human death is counted officially when it is registered by existing family members at a cartório, a government-authorized registry.  Before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cartório.  Though a Public Registry Law guarantees all Brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means, of their family members (often children), the Brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs and fees, of filing for a death. For many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, cultural burial, which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate [[mortality rates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nations |first=Marilyn K. |last2=Amaral |first2=Mara Lucia |title=Flesh, Blood, Souls, and Households: Cultural Validity in Mortality Inquiry |journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly |date=September 1999 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=204–220 |doi=10.1525/maq.1991.5.3.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures. Western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect, with an official embalmer and associated rites. Eastern societies (like India) may be more open to accepting it as a ''fait accompli'', with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an open air burning-to-ashes of the same.

== Consciousness ==
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}

Much interest and debate surround the question of what happens to one's consciousness as one's body dies. The belief in the permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called ''[[eternal oblivion]]''. Belief that the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] is preserved after physical death is described by the term ''[[afterlife]]''.

== In biology ==
[[File:Earthworm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Earthworm]]s are a good example of soil-dwelling detritivores.]]
After death the remains of an organism become part of the [[biogeochemical cycle]]. Animals may be [[necrophagy|consumed]] by a [[predator]] or a [[scavenger]]. [[Organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms which recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]], where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of a living organism. Examples of detritivores include [[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]] and [[dung beetle]]s.

[[Microorganism]]s also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. Not all materials need to be decomposed fully. [[Coal]], a [[fossil fuel]] formed over vast tracts of time in [[swamp]] ecosystems, is one example.

=== Natural selection ===
{{Main|Competition (biology)|Natural selection|Extinction}}

Contemporary [[history of evolutionary thought|evolutionary theory]] sees death as an important part of the process of [[natural selection]]. It is considered that organisms less [[adaptation|adapted]] to their environment are more likely to die having produced fewer offspring, thereby reducing their contribution to the [[gene pool]]. Their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to [[extinction]] and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as [[speciation]]. Frequency of [[biological reproduction|reproduction]] plays an equally important role in determining species survival: an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] criteria, much greater [[Darwinian fitness|fitness]] than a long-lived organism leaving only one.

=== Extinction ===
{{Main|Extinction}}
[[File:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a dodo|A [[dodo]], the bird that became a [[byword (saying)|byword]] in the English language for the extinction of a species&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=[[W.W.

Extinction is the cessation of existence of a species or group of [[Taxon|taxa]], reducing [[biodiversity]]. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species (although the [[population bottleneck|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point). Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where species presumed extinct abruptly "reappear" (typically in the [[fossil]] record) after a period of apparent absence. New species arise through the process of [[speciation]], an aspect of [[evolution]]. New varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]] – and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.

=== Evolution of aging and mortality ===
{{Main|Evolution of aging}}

Inquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age (exceptions include ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and the already cited jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', which research shows to be [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]). The evolutionary origin of [[senescence]] remains one of the fundamental puzzles of biology. [[Gerontology]] specializes in the science of human aging processes.

Organisms showing only [[asexual reproduction]] (e.g. [[bacteria]], some [[protist]]s, like the [[euglenoid]]s and many [[amoebozoan]]s) and [[unicellular]] organisms with [[sexual reproduction]] ([[Colony (biology)|colonial]] or not, like the [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae ''[[Pandorina]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'') are "immortal" at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident.

== Religious views ==
Death is an important subject of religious doctrine.

=== Buddhism ===
{{See also|Anussati#The ten recollections}}

In Buddhist doctrine and practice, death plays an important role. Awareness of death was what motivated [[Gautama Buddha|Prince Siddhartha]] to strive to find the [[amrta#Theravada Buddhism|"deathless"]] and finally to attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. In Buddhist doctrine, death functions as a reminder of the value of [[Human beings in Buddhism|having been born as a human being]]. Being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain  enlightenment, therefore death helps remind oneself that one should not that for granted. The belief in rebirth among Buddhists does not necessarily remove [[existential angst|death anxiety]], since all existence in the [[samsara (Buddhism)|cycle of rebirth]] is considered filled with [[dukkha|suffering]], and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses.&lt;ref name="Blum 2004"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|last=Blum|first=Mark L.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=1|title=Death|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death is part of several key Buddhist tenets, such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]].&lt;ref name="Blum 2004" /&gt;

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Yahrtzeit candle.JPG|thumb|A [[yahrtzeit candle]] lit in memory of a loved one on the anniversary of the death]]
{{see also|Bereavement in Judaism}}
Death is seen in Judaism as tragic and intimidating.  Persons who come into contact with corpses are [[Tumah and taharah|ritually impure]].  There are a [[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|variety of beliefs about the afterlife]] within Judaism, but none of them contradict the preference of life over death.  This is partially because death puts a cessation to the possibility of fulfilling any [[Mitzvah|commandments]].&lt;ref&gt;Soloveitchik, Joseph B.  ''Halakhic Man.'' Qtd. in [https://elmad.pardes.org/2018/04/tazria-metzora-understanding-purity/ Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5232">'''Delta 6 desaturase''' (D6D or Δ-6-desaturase) is a [[desaturase]] enzyme that converts between types of fatty acids (termed ''6'' after [[omega-6 fatty acids]]), which are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] nutrients in the human body.  The enzyme is molecularly identical across all living things (preserved across [[Kingdom (biology)]]) it is present in animals, plants, and [[cyanobacteria]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee JM, Lee H, Kang S, Park WJ | title = Fatty Acid Desaturases, Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Regulation, and Biotechnological Advances | journal = Nutrients | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 23 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26742061 | pmc = 4728637 | doi = 10.3390/nu8010023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nakamura"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakamura MT, Nara TY | title = Structure, function, and dietary regulation of delta6, delta5, and delta9 desaturases | journal = Annual Review of Nutrition | volume = 24 | pages = 345–76 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15189125 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.nutr.24.121803.063211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

D6D is one of the 3 [[fatty acid desaturase]]s present in humans along with Δ-5 and [[Delta-9 desaturase|Δ-9]], named so because it was thought to convert only [[omega-6]] fatty acids, but actually converts some others also, and is obligatory to build the longer chain [[omega-3 fatty acids]] from other simpler fatty acids in humans {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.  In humans, it is encoded by the [[FADS2]] gene {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

==Molecular activity==
D6D is an [[desaturase]] enzyme, i.e. introduces a double bond in a specific position of long-chain fatty acids.  Among them, it converts between various forms of [[Omega-3]] and [[Omega-6]] fatty acids{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}:
* primarily (in humans):
** cis-[[linoleic acid]] to [[gamma-linolenic acid]] (GLA)
** [[Palmitic acid]] to [[Sapienic acid]]
* less efficiently in humans:
** [[alpha-Linolenic acid|ALA]] to [[Stearidonic acid]], along with an [[elongase]] to provide EPA. 
** Tetracosatetranoic acid to tetracosapentanoic acid, an intermediate step between EPA to DHA synthesis.

D6D is obligatory along with various [[elongase]]s to convert to longer chain omega-3's, such as between ALA to EPA as well as EPA to [[Docosahexanoic acid|DHA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Dharmendra Kumar | last = Meena | name-list-format = vanc | title = HUFA and PUFA: Structures, Occurrence, Biochemistry And Their Health Benefits | url = http://aquafind.com/articles/HUFA-and-PUFA.php | work = Aquafind Aquatic Fish Database }} &lt;/ref&gt;

GLA deficiencies in animals including humans have shown wide effects down the line -- [[Dihomo-γ-linolenic acid|Dihomogamma-linolenic acid]] (DGLA) and [[Prostaglandin E1]] deficiency.  PGE1 activates [[T lymphocytes]], inhibits smooth muscle proliferation and thrombosis, is important in gonadal function and raises [[cyclic AMP]] levels in many tissues. It is a good candidate for a key factor lost in aging.&lt;ref name=pmid6270521/&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}  It also affects viability of [[sperm]].&lt;ref name="ncbi2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roqueta-Rivera M, Stroud CK, Haschek WM, Akare SJ, Segre M, Brush RS, Agbaga MP, Anderson RE, Hess RA, Nakamura MT | title = Docosahexaenoic acid supplementation fully restores fertility and spermatogenesis in male delta-6 desaturase-null mice | journal = Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 360–7 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19690334 | pmc = 2803238 | doi = 10.1194/jlr.M001180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dermatitis]].&lt;ref name="ncbi2010"/&gt;

{{For|the 1843 short story|Egotism; or, The Bosom-Serpent}}
{{Other uses|Egoist (disambiguation)}}
{{refimprove|date=January 2016}}
'''Egotism''' is the drive to maintain and enhance favorable views of oneself, and generally features an inflated opinion of one's personal features and importance. It often includes intellectual, physical, social and other overestimations.&lt;ref&gt;Robin M. Kowalski ed., ''Aversive Interpersonal Behaviors'' (1997) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

The egotist has an overwhelming sense of the centrality of the 'Me', that is to say of their personal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;William Walker Atkinson, ''The New Psychology'' (2010 [1909]) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Egotism means placing oneself at the core of one's world with no concern for others, including those "loved" or considered as "close", in any other terms except those subjectively set by the egotist.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==Characteristics==
Egotism is closely related to an egocentric love for one's imagined self or [[narcissism]] – indeed some would say "by egotism we may envisage a kind of socialized narcissism".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel D. Schmalhausen, ''Why We Misbehave'' (2004 [1928]) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Egotists have a strong tendency to talk about themselves  in a self-promoting fashion, and they may well be arrogant and boastful with a [[grandiose]] sense of their own importance.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 1114&lt;/ref&gt; Their inability to recognise the accomplishments of others&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Leary, ''The Curse of the Self'' (OUP 2007) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; leaves them profoundly self-promoting; while sensitivity to criticism may lead on the egotist's part to [[narcissistic rage]] at a sense of insult.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 121-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Egotism differs from both [[altruism]] – or acting to gain ''fewer'' values than are being given – and from [[egoism]], the constant pursuit of one's self-interest. Various forms of "empirical egoism" have been considered consistent with egotism, but do not – which is also the case with egotism in general –  necessitate having an inflated sense of self.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In developmental terms, two rather different trajectories can be distinguished with respect to egotism – the one individual, the other cultural.

With respect to the developing individual, a movement takes place from egocentricity to sociality during the process of growing up.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. C. Flügel]], ''Man, Morals and Society'' (1973) p. 242–3&lt;/ref&gt; It is normal for an infant to have an inflated – almost a majestic – sense of egotism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sigmund Freud]], ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;  The over-evaluation of one's own ego&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 38 and p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; regularly appears in childish forms of love – in large part because the baby is to himself everything, [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] to the best of their own  knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Skynner]] and [[John Cleese]], ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Optimal development allows a gradual reconciliation to a more realistic view of one's own place in the world – a lessening of the egotistical swollen head.&lt;ref&gt;Skynner &amp; Cleese, ''Families'' p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Less adequate adjustment may later lead to what has been called defensive egotism, serving to overcompensate for the fragility of the underlying concept of self.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robin Skynner]] however considered that in the main growing up leads to a state where "your ego is still there, but it's taking its proper limited place among all the other egos".&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner and John Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (London 1994) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

However, alongside such a positive trajectory of diminishing ''individual'' egotism, a rather different arc of development can be noted in cultural terms, linked to what has been seen as the increasing infantilism of (post)modern society.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bly and M. Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (1999) p. 85–8&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in the nineteenth century egotism was still widely regarded as a traditional vice – for [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] egotism was a sort of diseased self-contemplation&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Cowley, ed., ''The Portable Hawthorne'' (Penguin 1977) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Romanticism]] had already set in motion a countervailing current, what [[Richard Eldridge]] described as a kind of "cultural egotism, substituting the individual imagination for vanishing social tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Eldridge, ''The Persistence of Romanticism'' (2001) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; The romantic idea of the self-creating individual – of a self-authorizing, artistic egotism&lt;ref&gt;Scott Wilson, in Patricia Waugh, ed., ''Literary Theory and Criticism'' (2006) p. 563–4&lt;/ref&gt; – then took on broader social dimensions in the following century. [[Keats]] might still attack [[Wordsworth]] for the regressive nature of his retreat into the egotistical sublime;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Hart, ''Robert Lowell and the Sublime'' (1995) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; but by the close of the twentieth century egotism had been naturalized much more widely by the [[Me generation]] into the [[Culture of Narcissism]].

In the 21st century, romantic egotism has been seen as feeding into techno-capitalism in two complementary ways:&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 565-6&lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand, through the self-centred consumer, focused on their own self-fashioning through brand 'identity'; on the other through the equally egotistical voices of 'authentic' protest,  as they rage against the machine, only to produce new commodity forms that serve to fuel the system for further consumption.

==Sex==
There is a question mark over the relationship between sex and egotism. [[Sigmund Freud]] popularly made the claim that love can transform the egotist,&lt;ref&gt;Schmalhausen, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; giving him or her a new sense of  humility in relation to others.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, it is very apparent that egotism can readily show itself in sexual ways&lt;ref&gt;Schmalhausen, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed arguably one's whole sexuality may function in the service of egotistical needs.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 516-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term egotism is derived from the Greek ("εγώ") and subsequently its Latinised ego (''[[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]''), meaning "self" or "I," and ''[[-ism]]'', used to denote a system of belief. As such, the term shares early etymology with [[wikt:egoism|egoism]].

==Cultural examples==
* [[A. A. Milne]] has been praised for his clear-eyed vision of the ruthless, open, unashamed egotism of the young child.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Thwaite, ''A. A. Milne: His Life'' (2006) p. 123 and p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ryan Holiday]] described our cultural values as dependent on validation, entitled, and ruled by our emotions, a form of egotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ego Is The Enemy|last=Holiday|first=Ryan|publisher=Penguin Random House|year=2016|isbn=9780698192157|location=New York|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethics''' or '''moral philosophy''' is a branch of [[philosophy]] that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong [[action (philosophy)|conduct]].&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt; The field of ethics, along with [[aesthetics]], concern matters of [[Value (ethics)|value]], and thus comprise the branch of [[philosophy]] called [[axiology]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Random House Unabridged Dictionary]]'': [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/axiology Entry on Axiology.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics seeks to resolve questions of human [[morality]] by defining concepts such as [[good and evil]], right and [[wrong]], [[virtue]] and [[vice]], [[justice]] and [[crime]]. As a field of intellectual inquiry, moral [[philosophy]] also is related to the fields of [[moral psychology]], [[descriptive ethics]], and [[value theory]].

Three major areas of study within ethics recognized today are:&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;
# [[Meta-ethics]], concerning the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions, and how their [[truth value]]s (if any) can be determined
# [[Normative ethics]], concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action
# [[Applied ethics]], concerning what a person is [[obligated]] (or permitted) to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

==Defining ethics==
The English word "ethics" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''ēthikós'' ({{lang|el|ἠθικός}}), meaning "relating to one's character", which itself comes from the root word ''êthos'' ({{lang|el|ἦθος}}) meaning "character, moral nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon|year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was borrowed into [[Latin]] as ''ethica'' and then into French as ''éthique'', from which it was borrowed into English.

[[Rushworth Kidder]] states that "standard definitions of ''ethics'' have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character' or 'the science of moral duty'{{-"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How Good People Make Tough Choices: Resolving the Dilemmas of Ethical Living|last=Kidder|first= Rushworth|year=2003|publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|location=New York|ISBN=0-688-17590-2|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard William Paul and [[Linda Elder]] define ethics as "a set of concepts and principles that guide us in determining what behavior helps or harms sentient creatures".&lt;ref name="Reference A"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning|last1=Paul|first1=Richard|last2=Elder |first2=Linda|year=2006|publisher=Foundation for Critical Thinking Free Press|location=United States|ISBN=0-944583-17-2|page=NP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' states that the word "ethics" is "commonly used interchangeably with '[[morality]]'&amp;nbsp;... and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual."&lt;ref&gt;John Deigh in Robert Audi (ed), ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul and Elder state that most people confuse ethics with behaving in accordance with social conventions, religious beliefs and the law and don't treat ethics as a stand-alone concept.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning|last1=Paul|first1=Richard|last2=Elder |first2=Linda|year=2006|publisher=Foundation for Critical Thinking Free Press|location=United States|isbn=0-944583-17-2|page=np}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''ethics'' in English refers to several things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=October 4, 2015|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethic|title=Definition of ethic by Merriam Webster|publisher= Merriam Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can refer to [[philosophical]] ethics or moral philosophy—a project that attempts to use reason to answer various kinds of ethical questions. As the English philosopher [[Bernard Williams]] writes, attempting to explain moral philosophy: "What makes an inquiry a philosophical one is reflective generality and a style of argument that claims to be rationally persuasive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy|last=Williams|first=Bernard|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams describes the content of this area of inquiry as addressing the very broad question, "how one should live".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy|last=Williams|first=Bernard|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics can also refer to a common human ability to think about [[ethical]] problems that is not particular to philosophy. As [[bioethicist]] Larry Churchill has written: "Ethics, understood as the capacity to think critically about moral values and direct our actions in terms of such values, is a generic human capacity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are We Professionals? A Critical Look at the Social Role of Bioethicists.
|journal=Daedalus|year=1999|pages=253–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics can also be used to describe a particular person's own [[idiosyncratic]] principles or habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 24, 2014 |accessdate=July 22, 2014 |url=http://soulofwit.com/2014/01/24/Buddha-And-Socrates-Share-Common-Ground |title=Buddha and Socrates share Common ground |author=David Tanguay |publisher=Soul of Wit |archivedate=July 22, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722174808/http://soulofwit.com/2014/01/24/Buddha-And-Socrates-Share-Common-Ground |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: "Joe has strange ethics."

==Meta-ethics==
{{Main|Meta-ethics}}
Meta-ethics is the branch of philosophical ethics that asks how we understand, know about, and what we mean when we talk about what is right and what is wrong.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/introduction/intro_1.shtml |title=What is ethics? |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=July 22, 2014 |archivedate=October 28, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028131348/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/introduction/intro_1.shtml |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; An ethical question pertaining to a particular practical situation—such as, "Should I eat this particular piece of chocolate cake?"—cannot be a meta-ethical question (rather, this is an applied ethical question). A meta-ethical question is abstract and relates to a wide range of more specific practical questions. For example, "Is it ever possible to have secure knowledge of what is right and wrong?" is a meta-ethical question.

Meta-ethics has always accompanied philosophical ethics. For example, Aristotle implies that less precise knowledge is possible in ethics than in other spheres of inquiry, and he regards ethical knowledge as depending upon habit and [[acculturation]] in a way that makes it distinctive from other kinds of knowledge. Meta-ethics is also important in [[George Edward Moore|G.E. Moore]]'s ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' from 1903. In it he first wrote about what he called ''the [[naturalistic fallacy]]''. Moore was seen to reject [[Ethical naturalism|naturalism]] in ethics, in his [[Open Question Argument]]. This made thinkers look again at second order questions about ethics. Earlier, the Scottish [[philosopher]] [[David Hume]] had put forward a similar view on the difference between [[Is-ought problem|facts and values]].

Studies of how we know in ethics divide into [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] and [[non-cognitivism]]; this is quite akin to the thing called descriptive and non-descriptive. Non-cognitivism is the view that when we judge something as morally right or wrong, this is neither true nor false. We may, for example, be only expressing our emotional feelings about these things.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/non-cogn/&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitivism can then be seen as the claim that when we talk about right and wrong, we are talking about matters of fact.

The [[ontology]] of ethics is about [[Value (ethics)|value]]-bearing things or properties, i.e. the kind of things or stuff referred to by ethical propositions. Non-descriptivists and non-cognitivists believe that ethics does not need a specific [[ontology]] since ethical propositions do not refer. This is known as an anti-realist position. Realists, on the other hand, must explain what kind of entities, properties or states are relevant for ethics, how they have value, and why they guide and motivate our actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = C | year = 2009 | title = The Conditions of Moral Realism | url = | journal = The Journal of Philosophical Research | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 123–155 | doi=10.5840/jpr_2009_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normative ethics==
{{Main|Normative ethics}}
[[Normative ethics|Normative]] ethics is the study of ethical action. It is the branch of ethics that investigates the set of questions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking. Normative ethics is distinct from [[meta-ethics]] because normative ethics examines standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Normative ethics is also distinct from [[descriptive ethics]], as the latter is an [[empirical]] investigation of people's moral beliefs. To put it another way, descriptive ethics would be concerned with determining what proportion of people believe that killing is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is correct to hold such a belief. Hence, normative ethics is sometimes called prescriptive, rather than descriptive. However, on certain versions of the meta-ethical view called [[moral realism]], moral facts are both descriptive and prescriptive at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavalier |first=Robert |title=Meta-ethics, Normative Ethics, and Applied Ethics |work=Online Guide to Ethics and Moral Philosophy |url=http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80130/part2/II_preface.html |accessdate=February 26, 2014 |archivedate=November 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112114345/http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80130/part2/II_preface.html |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, normative ethics (also known as moral theory) was the study of what makes actions right and wrong. These theories offered an overarching moral principle one could appeal to in resolving difficult moral decisions.

At the turn of the 20th century, moral theories became more complex and were no longer concerned solely with rightness and wrongness, but were interested in many different kinds of moral status. During the middle of the century, the study of normative ethics declined as meta-ethics grew in prominence. This focus on meta-ethics was in part caused by an intense linguistic focus in [[analytic philosophy]] and by the popularity of [[logical positivism]].

===Virtue ethics===
{{main|Virtue ethics}}
[[File:Socrates BM GR1973.03-27.16.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Socrates]]]]
[[Virtue ethics|Virtue]] ethics describes the character of a moral agent as a driving force for ethical behavior, and it is used to describe the ethics of [[Socrates]], [[Aristotle]], and other early Greek philosophers. [[Socrates]] (469–399 BC) was one of the first [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] to encourage both scholars and the common citizen to turn their attention from the outside world to the condition of humankind. In this view, [[knowledge]] bearing on human life was placed highest, while all other knowledge was secondary. [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]] was considered necessary for success and inherently an essential good. A self-aware person will act completely within his capabilities to his pinnacle, while an ignorant person will flounder and encounter difficulty. To Socrates, a person must become aware of every fact (and its context) relevant to his existence, if he wishes to attain self-knowledge. He posited that people will naturally do what is good if they know what is right. Evil or bad actions are the results of ignorance. If a criminal was truly aware of the intellectual and spiritual consequences of his or her actions, he or she would neither commit nor even consider committing those actions. Any person who knows what is truly right will automatically do it, according to Socrates. While he correlated knowledge with [[virtue]], he similarly equated virtue with [[joy]]. The truly wise man will know what is right, do what is good, and therefore be happy.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William S. Sahakian|author2=Mabel Lewis Sahakian|title=Ideas of the Great Philosophers|year=1966|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-56619-271-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32–33}}

[[Aristotle]] (384–323&amp;nbsp;BC) posited an ethical system that may be termed "virtuous". In Aristotle's view, when a person acts in accordance with virtue this person will do good and be content. Unhappiness and frustration are caused by doing wrong, leading to failed goals and a poor life. Therefore, it is imperative for people to act in accordance with virtue, which is only attainable by the practice of the virtues in order to be content and complete. Happiness was held to be the ultimate goal. All other things, such as civic life or [[wealth]], were only made worthwhile and of benefit when employed in the practice of the virtues. The practice of the virtues is the surest path to happiness.

Aristotle asserted that the soul of man had three natures: body (physical/metabolism), animal (emotional/appetite), and rational (mental/conceptual). Physical nature can be assuaged through exercise and care; emotional nature through indulgence of instinct and urges; and mental nature through human reason and developed potential. Rational development was considered the most important, as essential to philosophical self-awareness and as uniquely human. [[Moderation]] was encouraged, with the extremes seen as degraded and immoral. For example, [[courage]] is the moderate virtue between the extremes of [[cowardice]] and [[recklessness (psychology)|recklessness]]. Man should not simply live, but live well with conduct governed by virtue. This is regarded as difficult, as virtue denotes doing the right thing, in the right way, at the right time, for the right reason.

====Stoicism====
{{main|Stoicism}}
[[File:Epictetus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Epictetus]]]]
The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Epictetus]] posited that the greatest good was contentment and serenity. Peace of mind, or ''[[apatheia]]'', was of the highest [[Value (ethics)|value]]; self-mastery over one's desires and emotions leads to spiritual peace. The "unconquerable will" is central to this philosophy. The individual's will should be independent and inviolate. Allowing a person to disturb the mental equilibrium is, in essence, offering yourself in slavery. If a person is free to anger you at will, you have no control over your internal world, and therefore no freedom. Freedom from material attachments is also necessary. If a thing breaks, the person should not be upset, but realize it was a thing that could break. Similarly, if someone should die, those close to them should hold to their serenity because the loved one was made of flesh and blood destined to death. Stoic philosophy says to accept things that cannot be changed, resigning oneself to the existence and enduring in a rational fashion. Death is not feared. People do not "lose" their life, but instead "return", for they are returning to God (who initially gave what the person is as a person). Epictetus said difficult problems in life should not be avoided, but rather embraced. They are spiritual exercises needed for the health of the spirit, just as physical exercise is required for the health of the body. He also stated that sex and sexual desire are to be avoided as the greatest threat to the [[integrity]] and equilibrium of a man's mind. Abstinence is highly desirable. Epictetus said remaining abstinent in the face of temptation was a victory for which a man could be proud.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"/&gt;{{rp|38–41}}

====Contemporary virtue ethics====
Modern virtue ethics was popularized during the late 20th century in large part as a response to [[G. E. M. Anscombe]]'s "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]". Anscombe argues that consequentialist and deontological ethics are only feasible as universal theories if the two schools ground themselves in divine law. As a deeply devoted Christian herself, Anscombe proposed that either those who do not give ethical credence to notions of divine law take up virtue ethics, which does not necessitate universal laws as agents themselves are investigated for virtue or vice and held up to "universal standards", or that those who wish to be utilitarian or consequentialist ground their theories in religious conviction.&lt;ref name="Vries"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Professor Michiel S. S. De De Vries|author2=Professor Pan Suk Kim|title=Value and Virtue in Public Administration: A Comparative Perspective|date=October 28, 2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-35709-9|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], who wrote the book ''[[After Virtue]]'', was a key contributor and proponent of modern virtue ethics, although some claim that MacIntyre supports a relativistic account of virtue based on [[Norm (social)|cultural norms]], not objective standards.&lt;ref name="Vries"/&gt; [[Martha Nussbaum]], a contemporary virtue ethicist, objects to MacIntyre's relativism, among that of others, and responds to relativist objections to form an objective account in her work "Non-Relative Virtues: An Aristotelian Approach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|title=Non-Relative Virtues: An Aristotelian Approach|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nussbaum's accusation of relativism appears to be a misreading. In ''Whose Justice, Whose Rationality?'', MacIntyre's ambition of taking a rational path beyond relativism was quite clear when he stated "rival claims made by different traditions […] are to be evaluated […] without relativism" (p.&amp;nbsp;354) because indeed "rational debate between and rational choice among rival traditions is possible” (p.&amp;nbsp;352). ''Complete Conduct Principles for the 21st Century''&lt;ref name="ethics"&gt;John Newton, Ph.D., ''Complete Conduct Principles for the 21st Century'' (2000). {{ISBN|0-9673705-7-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; blended the Eastern virtue ethics and the Western virtue ethics, with some modifications to suit the 21st Century, and formed a part of contemporary virtue ethics.&lt;ref name="ethics" /&gt;

===Hedonism===
{{Main|Hedonism}}
[[Hedonism]] posits that the principal ethic is maximizing [[pleasure]] and minimizing [[suffering|pain]]. There are several schools of Hedonist thought ranging from those advocating the indulgence of even momentary desires to those teaching a pursuit of spiritual bliss. In their consideration of consequences, they range from those advocating [[self-gratification]] regardless of the pain and expense to others, to those stating that the most ethical pursuit maximizes pleasure and happiness for the most people.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"/&gt;{{rp|37}}

====Cyrenaic hedonism====
Founded by [[Aristippus]] of Cyrene, [[Cyrenaics]] supported immediate gratification or pleasure. "Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die." Even fleeting desires should be indulged, for fear the opportunity should be forever lost. There was little to no concern with the future, the present dominating in the pursuit of immediate pleasure. Cyrenaic hedonism encouraged the pursuit of enjoyment and indulgence without hesitation, believing pleasure to be the only good.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"/&gt;{{rp|37}}

====Epicureanism====
{{Main|Epicureanism}}
Epicurean ethics is a hedonist form of virtue ethics. [[Epicurus]] "...presented a sustained argument that pleasure, correctly understood, will coincide with virtue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ancient/#9 Ancient Ethical Theory], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the extremism of the [[Cyrenaics]], believing some pleasures and indulgences to be detrimental to human beings. [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] observed that indiscriminate indulgence sometimes resulted in negative consequences. Some experiences were therefore rejected out of hand, and some unpleasant experiences endured in the present to ensure a better life in the future. To Epicurus, the ''summum bonum'', or greatest good, was prudence, exercised through moderation and caution. Excessive indulgence can be destructive to pleasure and can even lead to pain. For example, eating one food too often makes a person lose a taste for it. Eating too much food at once leads to discomfort and ill-health. Pain and fear were to be avoided. Living was essentially good, barring pain and illness. Death was not to be feared. Fear was considered the source of most unhappiness. Conquering the fear of death would naturally lead to a happier life. Epicurus reasoned if there were an afterlife and immortality, the fear of death was irrational. If there was no life after death, then the person would not be alive to suffer, fear or worry; he would be non-existent in death. It is irrational to fret over circumstances that do not exist, such as one's state of death in the absence of an afterlife.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"/&gt;{{rp|37–38}}

===State consequentialism===
{{Main|State consequentialism}}
[[State consequentialism]], also known as Mohist consequentialism,&lt;ref name="readings"&gt;{{cite book|title=Readings in classical Chinese philosophy|year=2005|last=Ivanhoe|first=P.J.|last2= Van Norden|first2= Bryan William|publisher=[[Hackett Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-87220-780-6 |page=60|quote=he advocated a form of state consequentialism, which sought to maximize three basic goods: the wealth, order, and population of the state}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an ethical theory that evaluates the moral worth of an action based on how much it contributes to the basic goods of a state.&lt;ref name=readings/&gt; The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' describes Mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century BC, as "a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare".&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Chris, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mohism/ Mohism]", ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Edward N. Zalta.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike utilitarianism, which views pleasure as a moral good, "the basic goods in Mohist consequentialist thinking are&amp;nbsp;... order, material wealth, and increase in population".&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]]|year=1999|last=Loewe|first=Michael|last2=Shaughnessy|first2=Edward L.|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-47030-8|page=761}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Mozi]]'s era, war and famines were common, and population growth was seen as a moral necessity for a harmonious society. The "material wealth" of Mohist consequentialism refers to [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|basic needs]] like shelter and clothing, and the "order" of Mohist consequentialism refers to Mozi's stance against warfare and violence, which he viewed as pointless and a threat to social stability.&lt;ref name="Norden"&gt;{{cite book|title= Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy|year=2011|last=Van Norden|first=Bryan W. |publisher=[[Hackett Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-60384-468-0|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanford University|Stanford]] [[sinologist]] [[David S. Nivison|David Shepherd Nivison]], in ''[[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]]'', writes that the moral goods of Mohism "are interrelated: more basic wealth, then more reproduction; more people, then more production and wealth&amp;nbsp;... if people have plenty, they would be good, filial, kind, and so on unproblematically."&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt; The Mohists believed that morality is based on "promoting the benefit of all under heaven and eliminating harm to all under heaven". In contrast to Bentham's views, state consequentialism is not utilitarian because it is not hedonistic or individualistic. The importance of outcomes that are good for the community outweigh the importance of individual pleasure and pain.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jay L. Garfield|author2=William Edelglass|title=The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F06FKmKKIXwC&amp;pg=PA62|date=June 9, 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-532899-8|page=62|quote=The goods that serve as criteria of morality are collective or public, in contrast, for instance, to individual happiness or well-being}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequentialism/teleology===
{{Main|Consequentialism}}
{{See also|Ethical egoism}}
Consequentialism refers to moral theories that hold the consequences of a particular action form the basis for any valid moral judgment about that action (or create a structure for judgment, see [[#Rule consequentialism|rule consequentialism]]). Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right action is one that produces a good outcome, or consequence. This view is often expressed as the [[aphorism]] ''"The ends justify the means"''.

The term "consequentialism" was coined by [[G. E. M. Anscombe]] in her essay "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" in 1958, to describe what she saw as the central error of certain moral theories, such as those propounded by [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] and [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwick]].&lt;ref name="Anscombe"&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=G.E.M. Anscombe|title= Modern Moral Philosophy|journal=[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]|volume=33|pages=1–19 |url=http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/cmt/mmp.html|doi=10.1017/S0031819100037943 |year=1958|author=Anscombe, G. E. M.|publisher=1958|issue=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the term has become common in English-language ethical theory.

The defining feature of consequentialist moral theories is the weight given to the consequences in evaluating the rightness and wrongness of actions.&lt;ref name="Mackie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mackie|first=J. L.|authorlink=J._L._Mackie|origyear=1977|title=Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=0-14-013558-8|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consequentialist theories, the consequences of an action or rule generally outweigh other considerations. Apart from this basic outline, there is little else that can be unequivocally said about consequentialism as such. However, there are some questions that many consequentialist theories address:
* What sort of consequences count as good consequences?
* Who is the primary beneficiary of moral action?
* How are the consequences judged and who judges them?

One way to divide various consequentialisms is by the many types of consequences that are taken to matter most, that is, which consequences count as good states of affairs. According to [[utilitarianism]], a good action is one that results in an increase and positive effect, and the best action is one that results in that effect for the greatest number. Closely related is [[eudaimonia|eudaimonic]] consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, which may or may not be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. Similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. However, one might fix on non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. Thus, one might pursue an increase in [[Equality of outcome|material equality]] or [[Freedom (political)|political liberty]] instead of something like the more ephemeral "pleasure". Other theories adopt a package of several goods, all to be promoted equally.  Whether a particular consequentialist theory focuses on a single good or many, conflicts and tensions between different good states of affairs are to be expected and must be adjudicated.

====Utilitarianism====
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Jeremy Bentham]]
[[File:John Stuart Mill by London Stereoscopic Company, c1870.jpg|thumb|upright|John Stuart Mill]]
Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that argues the proper course of action is one that maximizes a positive effect, such as "happiness", "welfare", or the ability to live according to personal preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ethics Toolkit: A Compendium of Ethical Concepts and Methods|edition=|last=Baqgini|first=Julian|author-link=Julian Baggini |last2=Fosl|first2=Peter S.|author2-link=Peter S.

In ''A Fragment on Government'' Bentham says 'it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong' and describes this as a fundamental [[axiom]]. In ''An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'' he talks of 'the principle of utility' but later prefers "the greatest happiness principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bentham |first= Jeremy|title=The Works of Jeremy Bentham: Published under the Superintendence of His Executor, John Bowring. Volume 1|year=2001|publisher=Adamant Media Corporation|page=18|isbn= 978-1-4021-6393-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Stuart Mill"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11224/11224-h/11224-h.htm#CHAPTER_I Mill, John Stuart, Utilitarianism (Project Gutenberg online edition)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilitarianism is the paradigmatic example of a consequentialist moral theory. This form of utilitarianism holds that the morally correct action is the one that produces the best outcome for all people affected by the action. [[John Stuart Mill]], in his exposition of utilitarianism, proposed a hierarchy of pleasures, meaning that the pursuit of certain kinds of pleasure is more highly valued than the pursuit of other pleasures.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;{{cite book|title= Utilitarianism|year=1998|last=Mill|first=John Stuart|authorlink=John Stuart Mill|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn = 978-0-19-875163-2|url= http://www.utilitarianism.com/mill1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other noteworthy proponents of utilitarianism are neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], author of ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', and moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]], author of, amongst other works, ''[[Practical Ethics]]''.

The major division within utilitarianism is between ''[[act utilitarianism]]'' and ''[[rule utilitarianism]]''. In act utilitarianism, the principle of utility applies directly to each alternative act in a situation of choice. The right act is the one that brings about the best results (or the least amount of bad results). In rule utilitarianism, the principle of utility determines the validity of rules of conduct (moral principles). A rule like promise-keeping is established by looking at the consequences of a world in which people break promises at will and a world in which promises are binding. Right and wrong are the following or breaking of rules that are sanctioned by their utilitarian value.&lt;ref name="Carnegie Mellon University"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/cavalier/80130/part2/sect9.html |work=Department of Philosophy, [[Carnegie Mellon University]] |title=Utilitarian Theories |year=1996 |access-date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed "middle ground" between these two types is [[Two-level utilitarianism]], where rules are applied in ordinary circumstances, but with an allowance to choose actions outside of such rules when unusual situations call for it.

===Deontology===
&lt;!-- Section linked from "Categorical imperative" --&gt;
{{Main|Deontological ethics}}
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]

Deontological ethics or deontology (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|δέον}}, ''deon'', "obligation, duty"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is an approach to ethics that determines goodness or rightness from examining [[acts]], or the rules and duties that the person doing the act strove to fulfill.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/ Stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in contrast to [[consequentialism]], in which rightness is based on the consequences of an act, and not the act by itself. Under deontology, an act may be considered right even if the act produces a bad consequence,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Robert G. 1967. 'Deontological Ethics'. In Paul Edwards (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: [[Collier Macmillan]]: 343.&lt;/ref&gt; if it follows the ''rule'' or moral law.  According to the deontological view, people have a ''duty'' to act in a way that does those things that are inherently good as acts ("truth-telling" for example), or follow an objectively obligatory rule (as in [[rule utilitarianism]]).

Immanuel Kant's theory of ethics is considered deontological for several different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Orend, Brian. 2000. ''War and International Justice: A Kantian Perspective''. West Waterloo, Ontario: [[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]]: 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Eugene. 2006. ''The Basics of Western Philosophy''. [[Greenwood Press]]: 160.&lt;/ref&gt; First, Kant argues that to act in the morally right way, people must act from duty (''deon'').&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1780. 'Preface'. In ''The Metaphysical Elements of Ethics''. Translated by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Kant argued that it was not the consequences of actions that make them right or wrong but the motives (expressed as maxims) of the person who carries out the action. Kant's argument that to act in the morally right way, one must act from duty, begins with an argument that the highest good must be both good in itself, and good without qualification.&lt;ref name="transition"&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1785. 'First Section: Transition from the Common Rational Knowledge of Morals to the Philosophical', [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]].&lt;/ref&gt; Something is 'good in itself' when it is [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsically good]], and 'good without qualification' when the addition of that thing never makes a situation ethically worse. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be good, such as [[intelligence]], perseverance and [[pleasure]], fail to be either intrinsically good or good without qualification. Pleasure, for example, appears to not be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffer, they make the situation ethically worse. He concludes that there is only one thing that is truly good:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nothing in the world—indeed nothing even beyond the world—can possibly be conceived which could be called good without qualification except a ''good will''.&lt;ref name="transition" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pragmatic ethics===
{{Main|Pragmatic ethics}}
Associated with the [[pragmatism|pragmatists]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and especially [[John Dewey]], pragmatic ethics holds that moral correctness evolves similarly to scientific knowledge: socially over the course of many lifetimes. Thus, we should prioritize social reform over attempts to account for consequences, individual virtue or duty (although these may be worthwhile attempts, if social reform is provided for).&lt;ref name=Lafollette2000&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Hugh|editor-last= Lafollette|series=Blackwell Philosophy Guides|edition=1|url=http://www.hughlafollette.com/papers/pragmati.htm |date=February 2000|title=The Blackwell Guide to Ethical Theory|isbn=978-0-631-20119-9 | publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics of care===
{{Main|Ethics of care}}
Care ethics contrasts with more well-known ethical models, such as consequentialist theories (e.g. utilitarianism) and deontological theories (e.g., Kantian ethics) in that it seeks to incorporate traditionally feminized virtues and values that—proponents of care ethics contend—are absent in such traditional models of ethics. These values include the importance of empathetic relationships and compassion.

Care-focused feminism is a branch of feminist thought, informed primarily by ethics of care as developed by [[Carol Gilligan]] and [[Nel Noddings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-ethics/#CarEthTheDifVoi|title=Feminist Ethics|last=Tong|first=Rosemarie|last2=Williams|first2=Nancy|date=May 4, 2009|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab|access-date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This body of theory is critical of how caring is socially assigned to women, and consequently devalued. They write, “Care-focused feminists regard women’s capacity for care as a human strength,” that should be taught to and expected of men as well as women.  Noddings proposes that ethical caring has the potential to be a more concrete evaluative model of moral dilemma than an ethic of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings, Nel: Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education, page 3-4. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  Noddings’ care-focused feminism requires practical application of [[Nel Noddings#Nel Noddings' relational ethics|relational ethics]], predicated on an ethic of care.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings, Nel: Women and Evil, page 222. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role ethics===
{{main|Role ethics}}
Role ethics is an ethical theory based on [[family]] roles.&lt;ref name="Ames"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Roger T. Ames |author=Roger T.

Ames]] and Henry Rosemont, "Confucian normativity is defined by living one's family roles to maximum effect." Morality is determined through a person's fulfillment of a role, such as that of a parent or a child. Confucian roles are not [[rationalism|rational]], and originate through the ''xin'', or human emotions.&lt;ref name="Fraser"/&gt;

===Anarchist ethics===
{{Main|Anarchism}}
[[Anarchism|Anarchist]] ethics is an ethical theory based on the studies of anarchist thinkers. The biggest contributor to the anarchist ethics is the Russian zoologist, geographer, economist, and political activist [[Peter Kropotkin]].

Starting from the premise that the goal of ethical philosophy should be to help humans adapt and thrive in evolutionary terms, Kropotkin's ethical framework uses biology and anthropology as a basis – in order to scientifically establish what will best enable a given social order to thrive biologically and socially – and advocates certain behavioural practices to enhance humanity's capacity for freedom and well-being, namely practices which emphasise solidarity, equality, and justice.

Kropotkin argues that ethics itself is evolutionary, and is inherited as a sort of a social instinct through cultural history, and by so, he rejects any religious and transcendental explanation of morality. The origin of ethical feeling in both animals and humans can be found, he claims, in the natural fact of "sociality" (mutualistic symbiosis), which humans can then combine with the instinct for justice (i.e. equality) and then with the practice of reason to construct a non-supernatural and anarchistic system of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-ethics-origin-and-development.pdf "Ethics: Origin and Development" by Pëtr Kropotkin]&lt;/ref&gt; Kropotkin suggests that the principle of equality at the core of anarchism is the same as the [[Golden rule]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;This principle of treating others as one wishes to be treated oneself, what is it but the very same principle as equality, the fundamental principle of anarchism? And how can any one manage to believe himself an anarchist unless he practices it? We do not wish to be ruled. And by this very fact, do we not declare that we ourselves wish to rule nobody? We do not wish to be deceived, we wish always to be told nothing but the truth. And by this very fact, do we not declare that we ourselves do not wish to deceive anybody, that we promise to always tell the truth, nothing but the truth, the whole truth? We do not wish to have the fruits of our labor stolen from us. And by that very fact, do we not declare that we respect the fruits of others' labor? By what right indeed can we demand that we should be treated in one fashion, reserving it to ourselves to treat others in a fashion entirely different? Our sense of equality revolts at such an idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/AM/anarchist_moralityVI.html "Anarchist morality", chapter VI, Pëtr Kropotkin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Postmodern ethics===
{{Main|Postmodernism}}
{{Synthesis|date=July 2009}}
The 20th century saw a remarkable expansion and evolution of critical theory, following on earlier [[Marxism|Marxist Theory]] efforts to locate individuals within larger structural frameworks of ideology and action.

[[Antihumanism|Antihumanists]] such as [[Louis Althusser]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Structuralism|structuralists]] such as [[Roland Barthes]] challenged the possibilities of individual agency and the coherence of the notion of the 'individual' itself. This was on the basis that personal identity was, at least in part, a social construction. As critical theory developed in the later 20th century, [[post-structuralism]] sought to problematize human relationships to knowledge and 'objective' reality. [[Jacques Derrida]] argued that access to meaning and the 'real' was always deferred, and sought to demonstrate via recourse to the linguistic realm that "there is no outside-text/non-text" ("''il n'y a pas de hors-texte''" is often mistranslated as "there is nothing outside the text"); at the same time, [[Jean Baudrillard]] theorised that signs and symbols or simulacra mask reality (and eventually the absence of reality itself), particularly in the consumer world.

Post-structuralism and [[postmodernism]] argue that ethics must study the complex and relational conditions of actions.  A simple alignment of ideas of right and particular acts is not possible.  There will always be an ethical remainder that cannot be taken into account or often even recognized.  Such theorists find narrative (or, following Nietzsche and Foucault, [[genealogy]]) to be a helpful tool for understanding ethics because narrative is always about particular lived experiences in all their complexity rather than the assignment of an idea or norm to separate and individual actions.

[[Zygmunt Bauman]] says [[postmodernity]] is best described as modernity without illusion, the illusion being the belief that humanity can be repaired by some ethic principle.  Postmodernity can be seen in this light as accepting the messy nature of humanity as unchangeable.

David Couzens Hoy states that [[Emmanuel Levinas]]'s writings on the face of the Other and [[Derrida]]'s meditations on the relevance of death to ethics are signs of the "ethical turn" in Continental philosophy that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. Hoy describes post-critique ethics as the "obligations that present themselves as necessarily to be fulfilled but are neither forced on one or are enforceable" (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;103).

Hoy's post-critique model uses the term ''ethical resistance''. Examples of this would be an individual's resistance to consumerism in a retreat to a simpler but perhaps harder lifestyle, or an individual's resistance to a terminal illness. Hoy describes Levinas's account as "not the attempt to use power against itself, or to mobilize sectors of the population to exert their political power; the ethical resistance is instead the resistance of the powerless"(2004, p.&amp;nbsp;8).

Hoy concludes that
{{quote|The ethical resistance of the powerless others to our capacity to exert power over them is therefore what imposes unenforceable obligations on us. The obligations are unenforceable precisely because of the other's lack of power. That actions are at once obligatory and at the same time unenforceable is what put them in the category of the ethical. Obligations that were enforced would, by the virtue of the force behind them, not be freely undertaken and would not be in the realm of the ethical. (2004, p. 184)}}

==Applied ethics==
{{Main|Applied ethics}}
Applied ethics is a discipline of philosophy that attempts to apply ethical theory to real-life situations.  The discipline has many specialized fields, such as [[engineering ethics]], [[bioethics]], [[geoethics]], public service ethics and [[business ethics]].

===Specific questions===
Applied ethics is used in some aspects of determining public policy, as well as by individuals facing difficult decisions. The sort of questions addressed by applied ethics include: "Is getting an abortion immoral?" "Is euthanasia immoral?" "Is affirmative action right or wrong?" "What are human rights, and how do we determine them?" "Do animals have rights as well?" and "Do individuals have the right of self-determination?"&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

A more specific question could be: "If someone else can make better out of his/her life than I can, is it then moral to sacrifice myself for them if needed?" Without these questions, there is no clear fulcrum on which to balance law, politics, and the practice of arbitration—in fact, no common assumptions of all participants—so the ability to formulate the questions are prior to rights balancing. But not all questions studied in applied ethics concern public policy. For example, making ethical judgments regarding questions such as, "Is lying always wrong?" and, "If not, when is it permissible?" is prior to any etiquette.

People, in general, are more comfortable with dichotomies (two opposites).  However, in ethics, the issues are most often multifaceted and the best-proposed actions address many different areas concurrently. In ethical decisions, the answer is almost never a "yes or no", "right or wrong" statement. Many buttons are pushed so that the overall condition is improved and not to the benefit of any particular faction.

===Particular fields of application===
====Bioethics====
{{Main|Bioethics}}
{{See also|Islamic bioethics|Jewish medical ethics}}
Bioethics is the study of controversial ethics brought about by advances in [[biology]] and [[medicine]]. Bioethicists are concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among [[life sciences]], [[biotechnology]], [[medicine]], [[politics]], [[law]], and [[philosophy]]. It also includes the study of the more commonplace questions of values ([[primary care ethics|"the ethics of the ordinary"]]) that arise in primary care and other branches of medicine.

Bioethics also needs to address emerging biotechnologies that affect basic biology and future humans. These developments include [[cloning]], [[gene therapy]], [[human genetic engineering]], astroethics and life in space,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astroethics.com/ |title=Astroethics |accessdate=December 21, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060209/http://www.astroethics.com/ |archivedate=October 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and manipulation of basic biology through altered DNA, RNA and proteins, e.g. "three parent baby, where baby is born from genetically modified embryos, would have DNA from a mother, a father and from a female donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freemont|first1=P.

I.|year=2012|title=Synthetic Biology|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|location =New Jersey|isbn=978-1-84816-862-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, new bioethics also need to address life at its core. For example, [[biotic ethics]] value organic gene/protein life itself and seek to propagate it.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mautner|first=Michael N.|title=Life-centered ethics, and the human future in space|journal=[[Bioethics (journal)|Bioethics]]|volume=23|issue=8|pages=433–440|year=2009|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00688.x|pmid=19077128|url=http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFLifeCenteredBioethics2009Paper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; With such life-centered principles, ethics may secure a cosmological future for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mautner|first=Michael N.|title= Seeding the Universe with Life: Securing Our Cosmological Future|publisher=[[Legacy Books]] (www.amazon.com)|location=Washington D.

====Business ethics====
{{Main|Business ethics}}
Business ethics (also corporate ethics) is a form of [[applied ethics]] or [[professional ethics]] that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that arise in a business environment, including fields like [[medical ethics]]. Business ethics represents the practices that any individual or group exhibits within an organization that can negatively or positively affect the businesses core values. It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations.

Business ethics has both [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] and descriptive dimensions. As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative. Academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods. The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflect the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns. Interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, both within major corporations and within academia. For example, today most major corporations promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters. Adam Smith said, "People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A (1776/1952). ''An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations''. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions. Ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control.&lt;ref&gt;Berle, A. A., &amp; Means, G. C. (1932). The Modern Corporation and Private Property. New Jersey: Transaction Publishers. In this book, Berle and Means observe, "Corporations have ceased to be merely legal devices through which the private business transactions of individuals may be carried on. Though still much used for this purpose, the corporate form has acquired a much larger significance. The corporation has, in fact, become both a method of property tenure and a means of organizing economic life. Grown to tremendous proportions, there may be said to have evolved a 'corporate system'—as there once was a feudal system—which has attracted to itself a combination of attributes and powers, and has attained a degree of prominence entitling it to be dealt with as a major social institution.&amp;nbsp;... We are examining this institution probably before it has attained its zenith. Spectacular as its rise has been, every indication seems to be that the system will move forward to proportions which stagger imagination today&amp;nbsp;... They [management] have placed the community in a position to demand that the modern corporation serve not only the owners&amp;nbsp;... but all society." p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of large corporations with limited relationships and sensitivity to the communities in which they operate accelerated the development of formal ethics regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=C. |first2=M. |last2=Parker |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CSKX2HdnikC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=For Business Ethics: A Critical Text |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-31135-7 |display-authors=etal |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Cases|last=ferrell|first=o.c|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9781305500846|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Machine ethics====
{{Main|Machine ethics}}
In ''Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong'', Wendell Wallach and Colin Allen conclude that issues in [[machine ethics]] will likely drive advancement in understanding of human ethics by forcing us to address gaps in modern normative theory and by providing a platform for experimental investigation.&lt;ref name=Wallach2008&gt;{{cite book|first1=Wendell |last1=Wallach|first2=Colin|last2=Allen|date=November 2008|title=Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong|isbn=978-0-19-537404-9|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=USA|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort to actually program a machine or artificial agent to behave as though instilled with a sense of ethics requires new specificity in our normative theories, especially regarding aspects customarily considered common-sense. For example, machines, unlike humans, can support a wide selection of [[List of machine learning algorithms|learning algorithms]], and controversy has arisen over the relative ethical merits of these options. This may reopen classic debates of normative ethics framed in new (highly technical) terms.

====Military ethics====
{{See also|Geneva Conventions|Nuremberg Principles}}

Military ethics are concerned with questions regarding the application of force and the ethos of the soldier and are often understood as applied professional ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last2=Syse|first2=Henrik|last1=Cook|first1=Martin L.|title=What Should We Mean by 'Military Ethics'?|journal=Journal of Military Ethics|volume=9|issue=2|year=2010|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Just war theory]] is generally seen to set the background terms of military ethics. However individual countries and traditions have different fields of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Emmanuel|last=Goffi|authorlink=Emmanuel Goffi|year=2011|title=Les Armée Françaises Face à la Morale|trans-title=The French Army Facing Morale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VpyjGdEsCA4C|language=fr|location=France|publisher=L'Harmattan|isbn=978-2296542495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military ethics involves multiple subareas, including the following among others:
# what, if any, should be the laws of war.
# justification for the initiation of military force.
# decisions about who may be targeted in warfare.
# decisions on choice of weaponry, and what collateral effects such weaponry may have.
# standards for handling military prisoners.
# methods of dealing with violations of the laws of war.

====Political ethics====
{{main|Political ethics}}
Political ethics (also known as political morality or public ethics) is the practice of making moral judgements about political action and political agents.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis F. "Political Ethics". ''International Encyclopedia of Ethics'', ed. Hugh LaFollette (Blackwell Publishing, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public sector ethics====
{{main|Public sector ethics}}
Public sector ethics is a set of principles that guide public officials in their service to their constituents, including their decision-making on behalf of their constituents.  Fundamental to the concept of public sector ethics is the notion that decisions and actions are based on what best serves the public's interests, as opposed to the official's personal interests (including financial interests) or self-serving political interests.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, work of Institute for Local Government, at [http://www.ca-ilg.org/trust www.ca-ilg.org/trust].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Publication ethics====
Publication ethics is the set of principles that guide the writing and publishing process for all professional publications. To follow these principles, authors must verify that the publication does not contain [[plagiarism]] or [[publication bias]].&lt;ref name="Publication ethics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=Neil|title=Publication ethics|journal=Pediatric Anesthesia|date=October 2009|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1011–1013|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.03086.x/full|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.03086.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a way to avoid misconduct in research these principles can also apply to experiments that are referenced or analyzed in publications by ensuring the data is recorded honestly and accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wager|first1=E|last2=Fiack|first2=S|last3=Graf|first3=C|last4=Robinson|first4=A|last5=Rowlands|first5=I|title=Science journal editors' views on publication ethics: results of an international survey|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=31 March 2009|volume=35|issue=6|pages=348–353|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/35/6/348.short|doi=10.1136/jme.2008.028324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plagiarism is the failure to give credit to another author’s work or ideas, when it is used in the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scollon|first1=Ron|title=Plagiarism|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|date=June 1999|volume=9|pages=188–190|jstor=43102462|doi=10.1525/jlin.1999.9.1-2.188|issue=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the obligation of the editor of the journal to ensure the article does not contain any plagiarism before it is published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wager|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Williams|first2=Peter|title=Why and how do journals retract articles? An analysis of Medline retractions 1988—2008|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=September 2011|volume=37|issue=9|pages=567–570|jstor=23034717|doi=10.1136/jme.2010.040964}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a publication that has already been published is proven to contain plagiarism, the editor of the journal can retract the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanjeev|first1=Handa|title=Plagiarism and publication ethics: Dos and don'ts|journal=Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology|date=2008|volume=74|issue=4|pages=301–303|url=http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2008;volume=74;issue=4;spage=301;epage=303;aulast=Handa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publication bias occurs when the publication is one-sided or "[[prejudiced]] against results".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigelman|first1=Lee|title=Publication Bias Reconsidered|journal=Political Analysis|date=2000|volume=8|issue=2|pages=201–210|jstor=25791607|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.pan.a029813}}&lt;/ref&gt; In best practice, an author should try to include information from all parties involved, or affected by the topic. If an author is prejudiced against certain results, than it can "lead to erroneous conclusions being drawn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peters|first1=Jamie L.|last2=Sutton|first2=Alex J.|last3=Jones|first3=David R.|last4=Abrams|first4=Keith R.|last5=Rushton|first5=Lesley|last6=Moreno|first6=Santiago G.|title=Assessing publication bias in meta-analysis in the presence of between-study heterogeneity|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A (Statistics in Society)|date=July 2010|volume=173|issue=3|pages=575–591|doi=10.1111/j.1467-985x.2009.00629.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Misconduct in research can occur when an experimenter falsifies results.&lt;ref name="j25175246"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Richard|title=Misconduct in Research: Editors Respond: The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) Is Formed|journal=British Medical Journal|date=July 26, 1997|volume=315|issue=7102|pages=201–202|jstor=25175246|doi=10.1136/bmj.315.7102.201|pmc=2127155|pmid=9253258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falsely recorded information occurs when the researcher "fakes" information or data, which was not used when conducting the actual experiment.&lt;ref name="j25175246"/&gt; By faking the data, the researcher can alter the results from the experiment to better fit the hypothesis they originally predicted. When conducting medical research, it is important to honor the healthcare rights of a patient by protecting their [[anonymity]] in the publication.&lt;ref name="Publication ethics"/&gt;
''Respect for autonomy'' is the principle that decision-making should allow individuals to be autonomous; they should be able to make decisions that apply to their own lives. This means that individuals should have control of their lives.
''Justice'' is the principle that decision-makers must focus on actions that are fair to those affected. Ethical decisions need to be consistent with the ethical theory. There are cases where the management has made decisions that seem to be unfair to the employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders (Solomon, 1992, pp49). Such decisions are unethical.

====Relational ethics====
Relational ethics are related to an [[ethics of care]].&lt;ref name="GILLIGAN2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carol Gilligan|title=In a Different Voice|date=June 30, 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-03761-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62–63}} They are used in qualitative research, especially ethnography and autoethnography. Researchers who employ relational ethics value and respect the connection between themselves and the people they study, and "...between researchers and the communities in which they live and work." (Ellis, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = C | year = 2007 | title = Telling secrets, revealing lives: Relational ethics in research with intimate others | url = | journal = Qualitative Inquiry | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 3–29 | doi=10.1177/1077800406294947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relational ethics also help researchers understand difficult issues such as conducting research on intimate others that have died and developing friendships with their participants.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (1986). ''Fisher folk. Two communities on Chesapeake Bay.'' Lexington: [[University Press of Kentucky]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (1995).''Final negotiations: A story of love, loss, and chronic illness.'' Philadelphia: [[Temple University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Relational ethics in close personal relationships form a central concept of [[Ivan Böszörményi-Nagy#Contextual therapy|contextual therapy]].

====Animal ethics====
{{Main|Animal ethics}}
Animal ethics is a term used in academia to describe human-animal relationships and how animals ought to be treated. The subject matter includes [[animal rights]], [[animal welfare]], [[animal law]], [[speciesism]], [[animal cognition]], [[wildlife conservation]], the moral status of nonhuman animals, the concept of nonhuman [[personhood]], [[Anthropocentrism|human exceptionalism]], the history of animal use, and theories of [[justice]].

==Moral psychology==
{{Main|Moral psychology}}
'''Moral psychology''' is a field of study that began as an issue in [[philosophy]] and that is now properly considered part of the discipline of [[psychology]].  Some use the term "moral psychology" relatively narrowly to refer to the study of [[moral development]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Lapsley (2006) and "moral psychology" (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; However, others tend to use the term more broadly to include any topics at the intersection of ethics and psychology (and [[philosophy of mind]]).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Doris &amp; Stich (2008) and Wallace (2007). Wallace writes: "Moral psychology is the study of morality in its psychological dimensions" (p. 86).&lt;/ref&gt; Such topics are ones that involve the mind and are relevant to moral issues. Some of the main topics of the field are [[moral responsibility]], moral development, [[moral character]] (especially as related to [[virtue ethics]]), [[altruism]], [[psychological egoism]], [[moral luck]], and moral disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;See Doris &amp; Stich (2008), §1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary ethics===
{{Main|Evolutionary ethics}}
{{See also|Evolution of morality}}
Evolutionary ethics concerns approaches to ethics (morality) based on the role of evolution in shaping human psychology and behavior. Such approaches may be based in scientific fields such as [[evolutionary psychology]] or [[sociobiology]], with a focus on understanding and explaining observed ethical preferences and choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evol-eth/ |title=Evolutionary Ethics |author=Doris Schroeder |accessdate=January 5, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007081051/http://www.iep.utm.edu/evol-eth/ |archivedate=October 7, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptive ethics==
{{Main|Descriptive ethics}}
Descriptive ethics is on the less philosophical end of the spectrum since it seeks to gather particular information about how people live and draw general conclusions based on observed patterns. Abstract and theoretical questions that are more clearly philosophical—such as, "Is ethical knowledge possible?"—are not central to descriptive ethics. Descriptive ethics offers a [[Value-neutral|value-free]] approach to ethics, which defines it as a social science rather than [[humanities|a humanity]].  Its examination of ethics doesn't start with a preconceived theory but rather investigates [[revealed preference|observations of actual choices]] made by moral agents in practice. Some philosophers rely on descriptive ethics and choices made and unchallenged by a [[society]] or [[culture]] to derive categories, which typically vary by context. This can lead to [[situational ethics]] and [[situated ethics]]. These philosophers often view [[aesthetics]], [[etiquette]], and [[arbitration]] as more fundamental, percolating "bottom up" to imply the existence of, rather than explicitly prescribe, theories of value or of conduct. The study of descriptive ethics may include examinations of the following:
* [[Ethical code]]s applied by various groups. Some consider aesthetics itself the basis of ethics—and a personal [[moral core]] developed through art and storytelling as very influential in one's later ethical choices.
* Informal theories of etiquette that tend to be less rigorous and more situational. Some consider etiquette a simple negative ethics, i.e., where can one evade an uncomfortable truth without doing wrong? One notable advocate of this view is [[Judith Martin]] ("Miss Manners"). According to this view, ethics is more a summary of [[common sense]] social decisions.
* Practices in arbitration and [[law]], e.g., the claim that ethics itself is a matter of balancing "right versus right", i.e., putting priorities on two things that are both right, but that must be traded off carefully in each situation.
* [[Revealed preference|Observed choices]] made by ordinary people, without expert aid or advice, who [[Voting|vote]], buy, and decide what is worth valuing. This is a major concern of sociology, [[political science]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hary Gunarto]], Ethical Issues in Cyberspace and IT Society, Symposium on Whither The Age of Uncertainty, APU Univ., [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254440840_Ethical_Issues_in_Cyberspace_and_IT_Society paper],  Jan. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biology]], '''gonochorism''' (''[[Greek language|Greek]]'' offspring + disperse) or '''unisexualism''' or '''gonochory''' describes the state of having just one of at least two distinct sexes in any one individual organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gonochorism|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/cestode-life-cycle/database/glossary.jsp#G|work=Glossary|publisher=The Natural History Museum|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often used with animals, in which the individual organisms are often gonochorous. Gonochory is less common in [[plantae|plants]]. For example, in [[flowering plant]]s, individual flowers may be hermaphroditic (i.e. with both stamens and ovaries) or gonochorous (unisexual), having either no stamens (i.e. no male parts) or no ovaries (i.e. no female parts). Among flowering plant species that have unisexual flowers, some also produce hermaphrodite flowers, and the three types occur in different arrangements on separate plants; species can be [[monoecious]], [[dioecious]], [[trioecious]], [[polygamomonoecious]], [[polygamodioecious]], [[andromonoecious]], or [[gynomonoecious]].

[[File:Schistosome_Parasite_SEM.jpg|right|thumb|Unlike most [[Platyhelminthes|flatworms]], [[Schistosoma|schistosomes]] are gonochoristic. The narrow female can be seen emerging from the thicker male's gynecophoral canal below his ventral sucker.]] 

Sex is most often genetically determined, but may be determined by other mechanisms. For example, [[alligator]]s use [[temperature-dependent sex determination]] during egg incubation. Examples of gonochoric or dioecious [[pollination]] include [[holly|hollies]] and [[kiwifruit]]. In these plants the male plant that supplies the [[pollen]] is referred to as the [[pollenizer]].

Gonochorism stands in contrast to other [[reproductive strategy|reproductive strategies]] such as [[asexual reproduction]] and [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditism]]. The sex of an individual may also change during its lifetime – this [[sequential hermaphroditism]] can for example be found in [[parrotfish]]&lt;ref&gt;Bester, C.

Aabrekk made his debut for Sogndal in 1974 in the [[Norwegian Second Division]] (the third tier of Norwegian football).&lt;ref name="Sogndal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Alaget/Spelarstall/Spelarinfo/tabid/620/person/504/mid/1437/Default.aspx |title=Harald Aabrekk – Statistikk Sogndal |publisher=[[Sogndal Fotball]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=8 May 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sogndalhistorie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Klubben/Historia/5HaraldAabrekkogstartenpå90talet/tabid/489/Default.aspx |title=90-talet og Hardal Aabrekk |publisher=Sogndal Fotball |language=Norwegian |accessdate=11 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208033129/http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Klubben/Historia/5HaraldAabrekkogstartenp%C3%A590talet/tabid/489/Default.aspx |archive-date=8 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for a short spell at SK Brann, where he played a match in the [[Tippeligaen]] (the top division) in [[1978 Norwegian First Division|1978]],&lt;ref name="Brann"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brann.no/historie/spillerdatabase/spillerarkiv/harald-aabrekk/ |title=Statistics; Brann |publisher=[[SK Brann]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he played for Sogndal throughout his career and was a major contributor to their promotion to the [[Norwegian First Division]] in 1981. He scored Sogndal's first goal in that division, against [[Molde FK|Molde]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="Sogndalhistorie"/&gt; He played a total of 133 league games from 1973 to 1982, including 22 matches in the [[1982 Norwegian First Division|First Division in 1982]].&lt;ref name="Sogndal"/&gt;

==Coaching career==
Aabrekk started his coaching career in his home county, [[Sogn og Fjordane]], at lower-league clubs Eid, Sandane, and [[Stryn TIL|Stryn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-blir-ny-sogndal-trener/ |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk blir ny Sogndal-trener |publisher=SK Brann |date= |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801042447/http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-blir-ny-sogndal-trener/ |archivedate=1 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Nyheter/Aktuelt/tabid/486/smid/1092/ArticleID/10197/reftab/360/t/Harald-Aabrekk-er-tilbake/Default.aspx |language=Norwegian |title=Harald Aabrekk er tilbake |publisher=Sogndal Fotball |date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=11 May 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming head coach of Sogndal. In 1990, his first season with them, Sogndal was promoted to the Tippeligaen in spite of a 5–0 loss against [[Bryne FK|Bryne]] in their first home match.&lt;ref name="Sogndalhistorie"/&gt; He then served as head coach of Tromsø in the Tippeligaen from 1993 to 1995.&lt;ref name="redningsmann"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.bt.no/incoming/article115043.ece |title=Trist redningsmann |first=Roy |last=Ellingsen |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |language=Norwegian |date=7 August 2008 |accessdate=3 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917153008/http://fotball.bt.no/incoming/article115043.ece |archivedate=17 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, during a match against [[FK Bodø/Glimt|Bodø/Glimt]], Aabrekk tried to stall for time by acting as if he were injured after he was run down by Bodø/Glimt's physiotherapist Truls Karlsen. Although uninjured, he was taken by ambulance to hospital.&lt;ref name="hospital"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2006/11/04/481856.html |language=Norwegian |title=Fotballens største skuespillere |work=[[Dagbladet]] |first=Sigve |last=Kvamme |date=4 November 2006 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Verdens Gang]]'', he excused his behavior by saying, "I felt I was lying on the ground a bit too long, and I did not dare to get up so I stayed on the ground. I lay there and was thinking, 'What's going on?' It was not planned, and it was definitely not very smart. I would rather call it a blackout." This episode, according to the Norwegian newspaper ''[[Dagbladet]]'', was the third worst case of acting in the history of football.&lt;ref name="hospital"/&gt;

Aabrekk later worked for the [[Football Association of Norway]] as a coordinator for youth development in [[Western Norway]]. He also served as [[Nils Johan Semb]]'s assistant coach for the [[Norway national under-21 football team|Norwegian under-21 team]] from 1992 to 1998, and when Semb succeeded [[Egil Olsen]] as head coach of the [[Norway national football team|Norwegian national team]] in 1998, Aabrekk became assistant coach of the national senior team.&lt;ref name="redningsmann"/&gt; At the same time, he worked as [[Kjell Tennfjord]]'s assistant in Brann, and in the summer of 1998 he became their head coach.&lt;ref name="tilbake"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-tilbake-i-brann/ |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk tilbake i Brann |publisher=SK Brann |date= |accessdate=8 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130222190913/http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-tilbake-i-brann/ |archivedate=22 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After leading Brann to the finals of the [[1999 Norwegian Football Cup|1999 Norwegian Cup]], where they lost 2–0 against [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/1999/10/31/181874.html |language=Norwegian |title=Uten Aabrekk slokner Brann |work=Dagbladet |date=31 October 1999 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he received a one-year leave of absence to work full-time as assistant coach of the national team during their preparations for the [[UEFA Euro 2000]] football championship.

'''Human spaceflight''' (also referred to as '''crewed spaceflight''' or '''manned spaceflight''') is [[spaceflight|space travel]] with a [[Astronaut|crew]] or passengers aboard the [[spacecraft]]. Spacecraft carrying people may be operated directly, by human crew, or it may be either [[telerobotic|remotely operated]] from ground stations on Earth or be [[autonomous robot|autonomous]], able to carry out a specific mission with no human involvement.

The [[Vostok 1|first human spaceflight]] was launched by the [[USSR|Soviet Union]] on [[Cosmonautics Day|12 April 1961]] as a part of the [[Vostok program]], with [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] aboard. Humans have been continuously present in space for {{age in years and days|2 November 2000|sep=and}} on the [[International Space Station]].  All early human spaceflight was crewed, where at least some of the passengers acted to carry out tasks of piloting or operating the spacecraft.  After 2015, several human-capable spacecraft are being explicitly designed with the ability to operate autonomously.

Since the retirement of the US [[Space Shuttle]] in 2011, only [[Russia]] and [[China]] have maintained human spaceflight capability with the [[Soyuz program]] and [[Shenzhou program]]. Currently, all expeditions to the International Space Station use [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] vehicles, which remain attached to the station to allow quick return if needed. The United States is developing commercial crew transportation to facilitate domestic access to ISS and low Earth orbit, as well as the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] vehicle for beyond-low Earth orbit applications.

While spaceflight has typically been a government-directed activity, commercial spaceflight has gradually been taking on a greater role. The first private human spaceflight took place on 21 June 2004, when [[SpaceShipOne]] conducted a suborbital flight, and a [[List of private spaceflight companies|number of non-governmental companies]] have been working to develop a [[space tourism]] industry. NASA has also played a role to stimulate [[private spaceflight]] through programs such as [[Commercial Orbital Transportation Services]] (COTS) and [[Commercial Crew Development]] (CCDev). With its 2011 budget proposals released in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/news/budget/index.html |title=FY 2011 Budget |work=NASA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221004158/http://www.nasa.gov/news/budget/index.html |archivedate=21 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Obama administration moved towards a model where commercial companies would supply NASA with transportation services of both people and cargo transport to low Earth orbit. The vehicles used for these services could then serve both NASA and potential commercial customers. Commercial resupply of ISS began two years after the retirement of the Shuttle, and commercial crew launches could begin by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Hails Success of Commercial Space Program|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-hails-success-of-commercial-space-program/index.html#.U9DmePldV8G|website=nasa.gov|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vostok Spacecraft Diagram.svg|thumb|Vostok space capsule, which carried the first human into orbit]]

[[File:As11-40-5886.jpg|thumb|right|[[Neil Armstrong]] became the first human to land and walk on the Moon, July 1969.]]
Human spaceflight capability was first developed during the [[Cold War]] between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR), which developed the first [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] rockets to deliver [[nuclear weapon]]s. These rockets were large enough to be adapted to carry the first [[artificial satellite]]s into [[low Earth orbit]]. After the first satellites were launched in 1957 and 1958, the US worked on [[Project Mercury]] to launch men singly into orbit, while the USSR secretly pursued the [[Vostok programme|Vostok program]] to accomplish the same thing. The USSR launched the first human in space, [[Yuri Gagarin]], into a single orbit in [[Vostok 1]] on a [[Vostok 3KA]] rocket, on 12 April 1961. The US launched its first [[astronaut]], [[Alan Shepard]], on a suborbital flight aboard ''[[Freedom 7]]'' on a [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle|Mercury-Redstone rocket]], on 5 May 1961. Unlike Gagarin, Shepard manually [[attitude control|controlled his spacecraft's attitude]], and landed inside it. The first American in orbit was [[John Glenn]] aboard ''[[Friendship 7]]'', launched 20 February 1962 on a [[Atlas LV-3B|Mercury-Atlas rocket]]. The USSR launched five more cosmonauts in Vostok [[space capsule|capsule]]s, including the first woman in space, [[Valentina Tereshkova]] aboard [[Vostok 6]] on 16 June 1963. The US launched a total of two astronauts in suborbital flight and four into orbit through 1963.

US President [[John F. Kennedy]] raised the stakes of the Space Race by setting the goal of landing a man on the [[Moon]] and returning him safely by the end of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Kennedy, John F. |date=25 May 1961 |title=Special Message to Congress on Urgent National Needs |medium=Motion picture (excerpt) |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/xzw1gaeeTES6khED14P1Iw.aspx |accessdate=1 August 2013 |publisher=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum |location=Boston, MA |id=Accession Number: TNC:200; Digital Identifier: TNC-200-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US started the three-man [[Apollo program]] in 1961 to accomplish this, launched by the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn family of launch vehicles]], and the interim two-man [[Project Gemini]] in 1962, which flew 10 missions launched by [[Titan II GLV|Titan II rockets]] in 1965 and 1966. Gemini's objective was to support Apollo by developing American orbital spaceflight experience and techniques to be used in the Moon mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Meanwhile, the USSR remained silent about their intentions to send humans to the Moon, and proceeded to stretch the limits of their single-pilot Vostok capsule into a two- or three-person [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]] capsule to compete with Gemini. They were able to launch two orbital flights in 1964 and 1965 and achieved the first [[spacewalk]], made by [[Alexei Leonov]] on [[Voskhod 2]] on 8 March 1965. But Voskhod did not have Gemini's capability to maneuver in orbit, and the program was terminated. The US Gemini flights did not accomplish the first spacewalk, but overcame the early Soviet lead by performing several spacewalks and solving the problem of astronaut fatigue caused by overcoming the lack of gravity, demonstrating up to two weeks endurance in a human spaceflight, and the first [[space rendezvous]] and [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|docking]]s of spacecraft.

The US succeeded in developing the [[Saturn V]] rocket necessary to send the Apollo spacecraft to the Moon, and sent [[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]], and [[William Anders]] into 10 orbits around the Moon in [[Apollo 8]] in December 1968. In July 1969, [[Apollo 11]] accomplished Kennedy's goal by landing [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] on the Moon 21 July and returning them safely on 24 July along with Command Module pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]]. A total of six Apollo missions landed 12 men to walk on the Moon through 1972, half of which drove [[Lunar Roving Vehicle|electric powered vehicles]] on the surface. The crew of [[Apollo 13]], Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]], survived a catastrophic in-flight spacecraft failure and returned to Earth safely without landing on the Moon.

They successfully developed the three-person [[Soyuz spacecraft]] for use in the lunar programs, but failed to develop the [[N1 (rocket)|N1 rocket]] necessary for a human landing, and discontinued the lunar programs in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Challenge To Apollo The Soviet Union and The Space Race, 1945–1974|last = Siddiqi|first = Asif|page = 832|publisher = NASA|url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?Ntk=all&amp;Ntx=mode%20matchall&amp;Ntt=SP-2000-4408}}&lt;/ref&gt; On losing the Moon race, they concentrated on the development of [[space station]]s, using the Soyuz as a ferry to take cosmonauts to and from the stations. They started with a series of [[Salyut program|Salyut]] sortie stations from 1971 to 1986.

After the Apollo program, the US launched the [[Skylab]] sortie space station in 1973, manning it for 171 days with three crews aboard Apollo spacecraft. President [[Richard Nixon]] and Soviet Premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]] negotiated an easing of relations known as [[détente]], an easing of Cold War tensions. As part of this, they negotiated the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]], in which an Apollo spacecraft carrying a special docking adapter module rendezvoused and docked with [[Soyuz 19]] in 1975. The American and Russian crews shook hands in space, but the purpose of the flight was purely diplomatic and symbolic.

[[File:North American Rockwell P333.jpg|thumb|right|Space Shuttle as originally designed by North American Rockwell, 1969]]
Nixon appointed his Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] to head a Space Task Group in 1969 to recommend follow-on human spaceflight programs after Apollo. The group proposed an ambitious [[Space Transportation System]] based on a [[Space Shuttle design process|reusable Space Shuttle]] which consisted of a winged, internally fueled orbiter stage burning liquid hydrogen, launched by a similar, but larger [[RP-1|kerosene]]-fueled booster stage, each equipped with airbreathing jet engines for powered return to a runway at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] launch site. Other components of the system included a permanent modular space station, reusable [[space tug]] and [[NERVA|nuclear]] interplanetary ferry, leading to a [[human mission to Mars|human expedition to Mars]] as early as 1986, or as late as 2000, depending on the level of funding allocated. However, Nixon knew the American political climate would not support Congressional funding for such an ambition, and killed proposals for all but the Shuttle, possibly to be followed by the space station. [[Space Shuttle|Plans for the Shuttle were scaled back]] to reduce development risk, cost, and time, replacing the piloted flyback booster with two reusable [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]]s, and the smaller orbiter would use an expendable [[Space Shuttle external tank|external propellant tank]] to feed its hydrogen-fueled [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engine]]s. The orbiter would have to make unpowered landings.

[[File:Space Shuttle Atlantis landing at KSC following STS-122 (crop).jpg|thumb|The Space Shuttle orbiter, as built]]
The two nations continued to compete rather than cooperate in space, as the US turned to developing the Space Shuttle and planning the space station, dubbed ''[[Space Station Freedom|Freedom]]''. 
The USSR launched three [[Almaz]] military sortie stations from 1973 to 1977, disguised as Salyuts. They followed Salyut with the development of ''[[Mir]]'', the first modular, semi-permanent space station, the construction of which took place from 1986 to 1996. ''Mir'' orbited at an altitude of {{convert|354|km|nmi|abbr=off|sp=us}}, at a 51.6° inclination. It was occupied for 4,592 days, and made a controlled reentry in 2001.

[[File:Buran on An-225 (Le Bourget 1989) (cropped).JPEG|thumb|Buran Orbiter 1K1 at [[Le Bourget]] airshow, 1989]]
The Space Shuttle started flying in 1981, but the US Congress failed to approve sufficient funds to make ''Freedom'' a reality. A fleet of four shuttles was built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. A fifth shuttle, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built to replace ''Challenger'', which was destroyed in [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|an accident during launch]] that killed 7 astronauts on 28 January 1986. Twenty-two Shuttle flights carried a [[European Space Agency]] sortie space station called [[Spacelab]] in the payload bay from 1983 to 1998.&lt;ref name=StoryShuttle&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of the Space Shuttle |author=David Michael Harland |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] Praxis |date=2004 |page=444 |isbn=978-1-85233-793-3 |authorlink=David M. Harland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USSR copied the reusable [[Space Shuttle orbiter]], which it called ''[[Buran programme|Buran]]''. It was designed to be launched into orbit by the expendable [[Energia]] rocket, and capable of robotic orbital flight and landing. Unlike the US Shuttle, ''Buran'' had no main rocket engines, but like the Shuttle used its orbital maneuvering engines to perform its final orbital insertion. A single unmanned orbital test flight was successfully made in November 1988. A second test flight was planned by 1993, but the program was cancelled due to lack of funding and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. Two more orbiters were never completed, and the first one was destroyed in a hangar roof collapse in May 2002.

=== US / Russian cooperation ===
[[File:International Space Station after undocking of STS-132.jpg|thumb|right|International Space Station, assembled in orbit by US and Russia]]
The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought an end to the Cold War and opened the door to true cooperation between the US and Russia. The Soviet Soyuz and Mir programs were taken over by the Russian Federal Space Agency, now known as the [[Roscosmos State Corporation]]. The [[Shuttle-Mir Program]] included American Space Shuttles visiting the ''Mir'' space station, Russian cosmonauts flying on the Shuttle, and an American astronaut flying aboard a Soyuz spacecraft for long-duration expeditions aboard ''Mir''.

In 1993, President [[Bill Clinton]] secured Russia's cooperation in converting the planned Space Station ''Freedom'' into the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). Construction of the station began in 1998. The station orbits at an altitude of {{convert|409|km|nmi|sp=us}} and an inclination of 51.65°.

The Space Shuttle was retired in 2011 after 135 orbital flights, several of which helped assemble, supply, and crew the ISS. ''Columbia'' was destroyed in [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|another accident during reentry]], which killed 7 astronauts on 1 February 2003.

=== China ===
After Russia's launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] intended to place a Chinese satellite in orbit by 1959 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the [[China#People's Republic of China (1949–present)|People's Republic of China]] (PRC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2007/10/16/15/33/09.htm|title =赵九章与中国卫星 |publisher= [[中国科学院]]|date=16 October 2007|accessdate=3 July 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080314030932/http://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2007/10/16/15/33/09.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, China did not successfully launch its first satellite until 24 April 1970. Mao and Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] decided on 14 July 1967, that the PRC should not be left behind, and started China's own human spaceflight program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.tom.com/1121/1122/2005916-250955.html |title=首批航天员19人胜出 为后来积累了宝贵的经验 |publisher=雷霆万钧 |date=16 September 2005 |accessdate=24 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222024152/http://tech.tom.com/1121/1122/2005916-250955.html |archivedate=22 December 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first attempt, the [[Shuguang spacecraft]] copied from the US Gemini, was cancelled on 13 May 1972.
 
China later designed the [[Shenzhou (spacecraft)|Shenzhou spacecraft]] resembling the Russian Soyuz, and became the third nation to achieve independent human spaceflight capability by launching [[Yang Liwei]] on a 21-hour flight aboard [[Shenzhou 5]] on 15 October 2003. China launched the [[Tiangong-1]] space station on 29 September 2011, and two sortie missions to it: [[Shenzhou 9]] 16–29 June 2012, with China's first female astronaut [[Liu Yang (astronaut)|Liu Yang]]; and [[Shenzhou 10]], 13–26 June 2013. The station was retired on 21 March 2016 and remains in a {{convert|363|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off|adj=on}}, 42.77° inclination orbit.

=== Abandoned programs of other nations ===
The [[European Space Agency]] began development in 1987 of the [[Hermes (spacecraft)|Hermes]] [[spaceplane]], to be launched on the [[Ariane 5]] expendable launch vehicle. The project was cancelled in 1992, when it became clear that neither cost nor performance goals could be achieved. No Hermes shuttles were ever built.

Japan began development in the 1980s of the [[HOPE-X]] experimental spaceplane, to be launched on its [[H-IIA]] expendable launch vehicle. A string of failures in 1998 led to funding reduction, and the project's cancellation in 2003.

=== United States post-Space Shuttle gap ===
[[File:Ares I-X launch 08.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The launch of Ares I prototype, [[Ares I-X]]
on 28 October 2009]]
Under the Bush administration, the [[Constellation Program]] included plans for retiring the Shuttle program and replacing it with the capability for spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit. In the [[2011 United States federal budget]], the Obama administration cancelled Constellation for being over budget and behind schedule while not innovating and investing in critical new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_space_thewritestuff/2008/11/congressional-w.html Congressional watchdog finds NASA’s new rocket is in trouble] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129102151/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_space_thewritestuff/2008/11/congressional-w.html |date=29 November 2011 }}.

The period between the retirement of the shuttle in 2011 and the initial operational capability of new systems in 2017, similar to the gap between the end of [[Apollo program|Apollo]] in 1975 and the [[STS-1|first space shuttle flight]] in 1981, is referred to by a presidential Blue Ribbon Committee as the U.S. human spaceflight gap.&lt;ref&gt;Klamper, Amy (8 September 2009) [http://www.space.com/7255-white-house-panel-spells-human-spaceflight-options-nasa.html White House Panel Spells Out Human Spaceflight Options for NASA]. Space News&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commercial private spaceflight ===

Since the early 2000s, a variety of [[private spaceflight]] ventures have been undertaken. Several of the companies, including [[Blue Origin]], [[SpaceX]], [[Virgin Galactic]], and [[Sierra Nevada Corporation|Sierra Nevada]] have explicit plans to advance human spaceflight.  {{asof|2016}}, all four of those companies have development programs underway to fly commercial passengers.

A commercial [[suborbital spaceflight|suborbital]] spacecraft aimed at the [[space tourism]] market is being developed by [[Virgin Galactic]] called [[SpaceshipTwo]], and could reach space around 2018.&lt;ref&gt;David, Leonard.

SpaceX and [[Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security|Boeing]] are both developing passenger-capable [[orbital spaceflight|orbital]] [[space capsule]]s as of 2015, planning to fly [[Commercial Crew Development|NASA astronauts to the International Space Station]] by 2018.  SpaceX will be carrying passengers on [[Dragon 2]] launched on a [[Falcon 9 Full Thrust|Falcon 9]] launch vehicle.

== Milestones ==
[[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first human to orbit the Earth on April 12, 1961.

[[Alan Shepard]] became the first American to reach space on [[Mercury-Redstone 3]] on May 5, 1961.

[[John Glenn]] became the first American to orbit the Earth on February 20, 1962.

[[Valentina Tereshkova]] became the first woman to orbit the Earth on June 16, 1963.

[[Joseph A. Walker]] became the first human to pilot a [[spaceplane]], the [[X-15 Flight 90]], [[Kármán line|into space]] on July 19, 1963.

[[Alexey Leonov]] became the first human to [[Extravehicular activity|leave a spacecraft in orbit]] on March 18, 1965.

[[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell]], and [[William Anders]] became the first humans to travel beyond low Earth orbit (LEO)  Dec 21–27, 1968, when the [[Apollo 8]] mission took them to 10 orbits around the Moon and back.

[[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] became the first humans to land on the Moon on July 20, 1969.

[[Svetlana Savitskaya]] became the first woman to [[Extravehicular activity|walk in space]] on July 25, 1984.

[[Sally Ride]] became the first American woman in space in 1983. [[Eileen Collins]] was the first female shuttle pilot, and with shuttle mission [[STS-93]] in 1999 she became the first woman to command a U.S. spacecraft.

The longest single human spaceflight is that of [[Valeri Polyakov]], who left Earth on 8 January 1994, and did not return until 22 March 1995 (a total of 437 days 17 h 58 min 16 s). [[Sergei Krikalyov]] has spent the most time of anyone in space, 803 days, 9 hours, and 39 minutes altogether. The longest period of continuous human presence in space is {{age in years and days|2 November 2000|sep=and}} on the [[International Space Station]], exceeding the previous record of almost 10 years (or 3,634 days) held by [[Mir]], spanning the launch of [[Soyuz TM-8]] on 5 September 1989 to the landing of [[Soyuz TM-29]] on 28 August 1999.

[[Yang Liwei]] became the first human to orbit the Earth as part of the Chinese manned space program on October 15, 2003.

For many years, only the USSR (later [[Russia]]) and the United States had their own astronauts. Citizens of other nations flew in space, beginning with the flight of [[Vladimir Remek]], a [[Czech Republic|Czech]], on a Soviet spacecraft on 2 March 1978, in the [[Interkosmos]] programme. {{As of|2010}}, citizens from 38 nations (including [[space tourism|space tourists]]) have flown in space aboard Soviet, American, Russian, and Chinese spacecraft.

== Space programs ==
Human spaceflight programs have been conducted by the former Soviet Union and current Russian Federation, the United States, the People's Republic of China and by [[private spaceflight]] company [[Scaled Composites]].

===Current programs===
[[Space vehicle]]s are [[spacecraft]] used for transportation between the Earth's surface and outer space, or between locations in outer space. The following space vehicles and [[spaceport]]s are currently used for launching human spaceflights:
* [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz program]] ([[Soviet Union|USSR]]/Russia): spacecraft on [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz launch vehicle]], from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]]; 129 orbital flights since 1967, including one in-flight abort which failed to reach orbit, {{As of|alt=as of July 2016|2016|July}} 
* [[Shenzhou program]] (Chinese): spacecraft on [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March launch vehicle]], from [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]]; 5 flights since 2003, {{As of|alt=as of July 2016|2016|July}}

The following [[space stations]] are currently maintained in Earth orbit for human occupation:
* [[International Space Station]] (US and Russia) assembled in orbit: altitude {{convert|409|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}}, 51.65° inclination; crews transported by Soyuz spacecraft
* [[Tiangong-2]] (Chinese): altitude {{convert|392|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}}; crews transported by Shenzhou spacecraft

Numerous private companies attempted human spaceflight programs in an effort to win the $10 million [[Ansari X Prize]]. The first private human spaceflight took place on 21 June 2004, when SpaceShipOne conducted a suborbital flight. SpaceShipOne captured the prize on 4 October 2004, when it accomplished two consecutive flights within one week. [[SpaceShipTwo]], launching from the carrier aircraft [[Scaled Composites WhiteKnightTwo|White Knight Two]], is planned to conduct regular suborbital space tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = SpaceShipOne {{!}} National Air and Space Museum|url = http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?object=nasm_A20050459000|website = airandspace.si.edu|access-date = 15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the time, the only humans in space are those aboard the ISS, whose crew of six spends up to six months at a time in [[low Earth orbit]].

[[NASA]] and [[ESA]] use the term "human spaceflight" to refer to their programs of launching people into space. These endeavors have also been referred to as "manned space missions," though because of gender specificity this is no longer official parlance according to NASA style guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/styleguide.html |title=Style Guide |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planned future programs===
India has declared it will send humans to space on its orbital vehicle ''[[Gaganyaan]]'' by 2022. The [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) began work on this project in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Space Research Organisation ([[ISRO]])[http://www.isro.org/scripts/futureprogramme.aspx Future Programme].&lt;/ref&gt; The objective is to carry a crew of two to [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) and return them safely for a water-landing at a predefined landing zone. The program is proposed to be implemented in defined phases. Currently, the activities are progressing with a focus on the development of critical technologies for subsystems such as the Crew Module (CM), Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS), Crew Escape System, etc. The department has initiated activities to study technical and managerial issues related to crewed missions. The program envisages the development of a fully autonomous orbital vehicle carrying 2 or 3 crew members to about 300&amp;nbsp;km low Earth orbit and their safe return.

[[NASA]] is developing a plan to land humans on Mars by the 2030s. The first step in this mission begins sometime during 2020, when NASA plans to send an uncrewed craft into deep space to retrieve an asteroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Journey to Mars Overview|url = http://www.nasa.gov/content/journey-to-mars-overview/|website = NASA|access-date = 17 January 2016|first = Jim|last = Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The asteroid will be pushed into the moon’s orbit, and studied by astronauts aboard [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]], NASA’s first human spacecraft in a generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Orion Overview|url = http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/orion/about/index.html|website = NASA|access-date = 17 January 2016|first = Mark|last = Garcia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orion’s crew will return to Earth with samples of the asteroid and their collected data. In addition to broadening America’s space capabilities, this mission will test newly developed technology, such as [[solar electric propulsion]], which uses solar arrays for energy and requires ten times less propellant than the conventional chemical counterpart used for powering space shuttles to orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP)|url = https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/tdm/sep/index.html|website = NASA|access-date = 17 January 2016|first = Lee|last = Mohon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other countries and space agencies have announced and begun human spaceflight programs by their own technology, [[Japan]] ([[JAXA]]), [[Iran]] ([[Iranian Space Agency|ISA]]) and [[Malaysia]] ([[Malaysian National Space Agency|MNSA]]).

== Passenger travel via spacecraft ==
A number of spacecraft have been proposed over the decades that might facilitate spaceliner passenger travel.  Somewhat analogous to travel by [[airliner]] after the middle of the 20th century, these vehicles are proposed to [[space transport|transport]] a large number of passengers to destinations in space, or to destinations on Earth which travel through space. To date, none of these concepts have been built, although a few vehicles that carry fewer than 10 persons are currently in the [[test flight|flight testing]] phase of their development process.

One large spaceliner concept currently in early development is the [[SpaceX]] [[BFR (rocket)|BFR]] which, in addition to replacing the [[Falcon 9]] and [[Falcon Heavy]] [[launch vehicle]]s in the legacy Earth-orbit [[Space launch market competition|market]] after 2020, has been proposed by SpaceX for long-distance commercial travel on Earth.  This is to transport people on point-to-point [[suborbital spaceflight|suborbital]] flights between two points on Earth in under one hour, also known as "Earth-to-Earth," and carrying 100+ passengers.&lt;ref name=rollingstone20171115&gt;

Small [[spaceplane]] or small [[space capsule|capsule]] suborbital spacecraft have been under development for the past decade or so and, {{asof|2017|lc=y}}, at least one of each type are under development.  Both [[Virgin Galactic]] and [[Blue Origin]] are in active [[new product development|development]], with the [[SpaceShipTwo]] spaceplane and the [[New Shepard]] capsule, respectively.  Both would carry approximately a half-dozen passengers up to space for a brief time of zero gravity before returning to the same location from where the trip began.

== Safety concerns ==
There are two main sources of hazard in space flight: those due to the ''environment'' of space which make it hostile to the human body, and the potential for ''mechanical'' malfunctions of the equipment required to accomplish space flight.

=== Environmental hazards ===
{{See also| Space habitat|Effect of spaceflight on the human body|Locomotion in Space}}

Planners of human spaceflight missions face a number of safety concerns.

==== Life support ====
{{Main| Life support system}}
The immediate needs for breathable air and drinkable water are addressed by the [[life support system]] of the spacecraft.

In October 2015, the [[NASA Office of Inspector General]] issued a [[Effect of spaceflight on the human body|health hazards report]] related to [[space exploration]], including a [[human mission to Mars]].&lt;ref name="AP-20151029"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dunn |first=Marcia |title=Report: NASA needs better handle on health hazards for Mars |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20151029/us-sci-space-travel-health-6dfd5b2c76.html |date=29 October 2015 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=30 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20151029oig"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=NASA's Efforts to Manage Health and Human Performance Risks for Space Exploration (IG-16-003) |url=https://oig.nasa.gov/audits/reports/FY16/IG-16-003.pdf |format=PDF |date=29 October 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=29 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 2017, scientists reported that significant changes in the position and structure of the [[brain]] have been found in [[astronaut]]s who have taken [[Effect of spaceflight on the human body|trips in space]], based on [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI studies]]. Astronauts who took longer space trips were associated with greater brain changes.&lt;ref name="NEJM-20171102"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roberts, Donna R. et al. |title=Effects of Spaceflight on Astronaut Brain Structure as Indicated on MRI |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1705129 |date=2 November 2017 |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=377 |pages=1746–1753  |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1705129 |accessdate=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="QTZ-20171103"&gt;{{cite web |last=Foley |first=Katherine Ellen |title=Astronauts who take long trips to space return with brains that have floated to the top of their skulls |url=https://qz.com/1119668/space-travel-changes-astronauts-brains/ |date=3 November 2017 |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |accessdate=3 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Microgravity =====
{{See also|Weightlessness}}

[[Image:Space fluid shift.gif|thumb|The effects of microgravity on fluid distribution around the body (greatly exaggerated).]]

Medical data from astronauts in low Earth orbits for long periods, dating back to the 1970s, show several adverse effects of a microgravity environment: loss of [[bone]] density, decreased muscle strength and endurance, postural instability, and reductions in aerobic capacity. Over time these [[deconditioning]] effects can impair astronauts’ performance or increase their risk of injury.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/Exploration/Advanced/Human/Exercise/ |title=Exploration Systems Human Research Program – Exercise Countermeasures |work=NASA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011052437/http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/Exploration/Advanced/Human/Exercise/ |archivedate=11 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a weightless environment, astronauts put almost no weight on the back [[muscle]]s or leg muscles used for standing up, which causes them to weaken and get smaller. Astronauts can lose up to twenty per cent of their muscle mass on spaceflights lasting five to eleven days. The consequent loss of strength could be a serious problem in case of a landing emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/64249main_ffs_factsheets_hbp_atrophy.pdf|title = NASA Information: Muscle Atrophy|date = |accessdate = 20 November 2015|website = NASA|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon return to Earth from long-duration flights, astronauts are considerably weakened, and are not allowed to drive a car for twenty-one days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Earth Living Is Tough for Astronaut Used to Space|url = http://www.space.com/21413-hadfield-astronaut-health-return-earth.html|website = Space.com|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronauts experiencing weightlessness will often lose their orientation, get [[motion sickness]], and lose their sense of direction as their bodies try to get used to a weightless environment. When they get back to Earth, or any other mass with gravity, they have to readjust to the gravity and may have problems standing up, focusing their gaze, walking and turning. Importantly, those body motor disturbances after changing from different gravities only get worse the longer the exposure to little gravity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3830060&amp;page=1 Watson, T. (2007, November 11). Readjusting to gravity anti-fun for astronauts. ''ABC News.'' Retrieved from https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3830060&amp;page=1]&lt;/ref&gt; These changes will affect operational activities including approach and landing, docking, remote manipulation, and emergencies that may happen while landing. This can be a major roadblock to mission success.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===== Radiation =====
{{See also|Health threat from cosmic rays}}

Without proper shielding, the crews of missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) might be at risk from high-energy protons emitted by [[solar flare]]s. [[Lawrence Townsend]] of the University of Tennessee and others have studied [[Solar storm of 1859|the most powerful solar flare ever recorded]]. That flare was seen by the British astronomer [[Richard Christopher Carrington|Richard Carrington]] in September 1859. Radiation doses astronauts would receive from a Carrington-type flare could cause acute radiation sickness and possibly even death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7142 |title= Superflares could kill unprotected astronauts|work=New Scientist |date=21 March 2005 |first=Stephen |last=Battersby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of radiation, [[galactic cosmic ray]]s, presents further challenges to human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-309-10264-2|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11760 |title=Space Radiation Hazards and the Vision for Space Exploration |publisher=NAP |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also some scientific concern that extended spaceflight might slow down the body’s ability to protect itself against diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1189/jlb.0309167 |title=Could spaceflight-associated immune system weakening preclude the expansion of human presence beyond Earth's orbit|date=2009|last1=Gueguinou|first1=N.|last2=Huin-Schohn|first2=C.|last3=Bascove|first3=M.|last4=Bueb|first4=J.-L.|last5=Tschirhart|first5=E.|last6=Legrand-Frossi|first6=C.|last7=Frippiat|first7=J.-P.|journal=Journal of Leukocyte Biology|volume=86|issue=5|pages=1027–1038|pmid=19690292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the problems are a weakened [[immune system]] and the activation of dormant [[virus]]es in the body. [[Radiation]] can cause both short and long term consequences to the bone marrow stem cells which create the blood and immune systems. Because the interior of a spacecraft is so small, a weakened immune system and more active viruses in the body can lead to a fast spread of infection.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===== Isolation =====

During long missions, astronauts are isolated and confined into small spaces. [[depression (mood)|Depression]], [[cabin fever]] and other psychological problems may impact the crew's safety and mission success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Christopher F.|date=2005-06-01|title=An Operational Approach to Long-Duration Mission Behavioral Health and Performance Factors|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asma/asem/2005/00000076/A00106s1/art00007|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|volume=76|issue=6|pages=B42–B51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronauts may not be able to quickly return to Earth or receive medical supplies, equipment or personnel if a medical emergency occurs. The astronauts may have to rely for long periods on their limited existing resources and medical advice from the ground.

Space flight requires much higher velocities than ground or air transportation, which in turn requires the use of high [[energy density]] propellants for launch, and the dissipation of large amounts of energy, usually as heat, for safe reentry through the Earth's atmosphere.

==== Launch ====
{{See also| Launch escape system}}
[[File:Sts33-e204.jpg|thumb|There was no practical way for the Space Shuttle ''Challenger'''s crew to safely abort before the vehicle's violent disintegration.]]
Since rockets carry the potential for fire or explosive destruction, [[space capsule]]s generally employ some sort of [[launch escape system]], consisting either of a tower-mounted solid fuel rocket to quickly carry the capsule away from the [[launch vehicle]] (employed on [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo]], and [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]]), or else [[ejection seat]]s (employed on [[Vostok spacecraft|Vostok]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]]) to carry astronauts out of the capsule and away for individual parachute landing. The escape tower is discarded at some point before the launch is complete, at a point where an abort can be performed using the spacecraft's engines.

Such a system is not always practical for multiple crew member vehicles (particularly [[spaceplane]]s), depending on location of egress hatch(es). When the single-hatch Vostok capsule was modified to become the 2 or 3-person [[Voskhod (spacecraft)|Voskhod]], the single-cosmonaut ejection seat could not be used, and no escape tower system was added. The two Voskhod flights in 1964 and 1965 avoided launch mishaps. The [[Space Shuttle]] carried ejection seats and escape hatches for its pilot and copilot in early flights, but these could not be used for passengers who sat below the flight deck on later flights, and so were discontinued.

There have only been two in-flight launch aborts of a crewed flight. The first occurred on [[Soyuz 7K-T No.39|Soyuz 18a]] on 5 April 1975. The abort occurred after the launch escape system had been jettisoned, when the launch vehicle's spent second stage failed to separate before the third stage ignited. The vehicle strayed off course, and the crew separated the spacecraft and fired its engines to pull it away from the errant rocket. Both cosmonauts landed safely. The second occurred on 11 October 2018 with the launch of [[Soyuz MS-10]]. Again, both crew members survived. 

In the only use of a launch escape system on a crewed flight, the planned [[Soyuz 7K-ST No. 16L|Soyuz T-10a]] launch on 26 September 1983 was aborted by a launch vehicle fire 90 seconds before liftoff. Both cosmonauts aboard landed safely.

The only crew fatality during launch occurred on 28 January 1986, when the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] broke apart 73 seconds after liftoff, due to failure of a [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]] seal which caused separation of the booster and failure of the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external fuel tank]], resulting in explosion of the fuel. All seven crew members were killed.

==== Reentry and landing ====
{{See also| Atmospheric reentry}}

The single pilot of [[Soyuz 1]], [[Vladimir Komarov]] was killed when his capsule's parachutes failed during an emergency landing on 24 April 1967, causing the capsule to crash.

The crew of seven aboard the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] were killed on reentry after completing a [[STS-107|successful mission in space]] on 1 February 2003. A wing leading edge [[reinforced carbon-carbon]] heat shield had been damaged by a piece of frozen external tank foam insulation which broke off and struck the wing during launch. Hot reentry gasses entered and destroyed the wing structure, leading to breakup of the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|orbiter vehicle]].

==== Artificial atmosphere ====
There are two basic choices for an artificial atmosphere: either an Earth-like mixture of oxygen in an inert gas such as nitrogen or helium, or pure oxygen, which can be used at lower than standard atmospheric pressure. A nitrogen-oxygen mixture is used in the International Space Station and Soyuz spacecraft, while low-pressure pure oxygen is commonly used in space suits for [[extravehicular activity]].

Use of a gas mixture carries risk of [[decompression sickness]] (commonly known as "the bends") when transitioning to or from the pure oxygen space suit environment. There have also been instances of injury and fatalities caused by suffocation in the presence of too much nitrogen and not enough oxygen.
* In 1960, [[McDonnell Aircraft]] test pilot G.B. North passed out and was seriously injured when testing a Mercury cabin / spacesuit atmosphere system in a vacuum chamber, due to nitrogen-rich air leaking from the cabin into his space suit feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giblin |first=Kelly A. |date=Spring 1998 |title ='Fire in the Cockpit!' |journal=[[American Heritage of Invention &amp; Technology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |publisher=American Heritage Publishing |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1998/4/1998_4_46.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120153024/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1998/4/1998_4_46.shtml |archivedate=20 November 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This incident led NASA to decide on a pure oxygen atmosphere for the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft.
* In 1981, three pad workers were killed by a nitrogen-rich atmosphere in the aft engine compartment of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] at the [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010605212352/http://www-lib.ksc.nasa.gov/lib/chrono.html 1981 KSC Chronology Part 1 – pages 84, 85, 100; Part 2 – pages 181, 194, 195], NASA&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1995, two pad workers were similarly killed by a nitrogen leak in a confined area of the [[Ariane 5]] launch pad at [[Guiana Space Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/Pr_17_1995_p_EN.html "Fatal accident at the Guiana Space Centre"], ''ESA Portal'', 5 May 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

A pure oxygen atmosphere carries risk of fire. The original design of the Apollo spacecraft used pure oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure prior to launch. An electrical fire started in the cabin of [[Apollo 1]] during a ground test at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34]] on 27 January 1967, and spread rapidly. The high pressure (increased even higher by the fire) prevented removal of the [[plug door]] hatch cover in time to rescue the crew. All three, [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger Chaffee]], were killed.&lt;ref name="SP4029"&gt;{{cite book |last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |title=Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/SP-4029.htm |accessdate=12 July 2013 |series=NASA History Series |origyear=First published 2000 |date=September 2004 |work=NASA History Division, Office of Policy and Plans |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-16-050631-X |lccn=00061677 |id=NASA SP-2000-4029 |chapter=Apollo 1 – The Fire: 27 January 1967 |chapterurl=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_01a_Summary.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led NASA to use a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere before launch, and low pressure pure oxygen only in space.

==== Reliability ====
{{See also| Reliability engineering}}
The March 1966 [[Gemini 8]] mission was aborted in orbit when an [[attitude control system]] thruster stuck in the on position, sending the craft into a dangerous spin which threatened the lives of [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[David Scott]]. Armstrong had to shut the control system off and use the reentry control system to stop the spin. The craft made an emergency reentry and the astronauts landed safely. The most probable cause was determined to be an electrical short due to a [[static electricity]] discharge, which caused the thruster to remain powered even when switched off. The control system was modified to put each thruster on its own isolated circuit.

The third lunar landing expedition [[Apollo 13]] in April 1970, was aborted and the lives of the crew, [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]], [[Jack Swigert]] and [[Fred Haise]], were threatened by failure of a [[cryogenic]] [[liquid oxygen]] tank en route to the Moon. The tank burst when electrical power was applied to internal stirring fans in the tank, causing the immediate loss of all of its contents, and also damaging the second tank, causing the loss of its remaining oxygen in a span of 130 minutes. This in turn caused loss of electrical power provided by [[fuel cell]]s to the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command spacecraft]]. The crew managed to return to Earth safely by using the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar landing craft]] as a "life boat". The tank failure was determined to be caused by two mistakes. The tank's drain fitting had been damaged when it was dropped during factory testing. This necessitated use of its internal heaters to boil out the oxygen after a pre-launch test, which in turn damaged the fan wiring's electrical insulation, because the thermostats on the heaters did not meet the required voltage rating due to a vendor miscommunication.

The crew of [[Soyuz 11]] were killed on June 30, 1971 by a combination of mechanical malfunctions: they were [[asphyxia|asphyxiated]] due to cabin decompression following separation of their descent capsule from the service module. A cabin ventilation valve had been jolted open at an altitude of {{convert|168|km|ft}} by the stronger than expected shock of explosive separation bolts which were designed to fire sequentially, but in fact had fired simultaneously. The loss of pressure became fatal within about 30 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch8-2.htm|title=The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project|accessdate=20 October 2007|publisher=NASA|year=1974|author=NASA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823124845/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch8-2.htm|archivedate=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient moral intellectualism==
In the view of [[Socrates]] (c. 470 – 399 BC), intellectualism allows that “one will do what is right or best just as soon as one truly understands what is right or best”; that [[virtue]] is a purely intellectual matter, since virtue and [[knowledge]] are familial relatives, which a person accrues and improves with dedication to [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} (Definition and note on Socrates)&lt;/ref&gt; So defined, [[Socratic intellectualism]] became a key philosophic doctrine of [[Stoicism]]. The apparent, problematic consequences of this view are “Socratic paradoxes”, such as the view that there is no [[weakness of will]] — that no one knowingly does, or seeks to do, evil (moral wrong); that anyone who does, or seeks to do, moral wrong does so involuntarily; and that virtue is knowledge, that there are not many virtues, but that all virtues are one.

Contemporary philosophers dispute that Socrates’s conceptions of knowing truth, and of ethical conduct, can be equated with modern, post–[[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] conceptions of knowledge and of rational intellectualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=No one errs willingly: the meaning of socratic intellectualism | author=Heda Segvic | url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-924226-7.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930151328/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-924226-7.pdf | archivedate=2011-09-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, [[Michel Foucault]] demonstrated, with detailed historical study, that in [[Classical Antiquity]] (800 BC – AD 1000), “knowing the truth” is akin to “spiritual knowledge”, in the contemporarily understanding of the concept. Hence, without exclusively concerning the rational intellect, spiritual knowledge is integral to the broader principle of “caring for the self”.

Typically, such care of the self-involved specific [[ascetic]] exercises meant to ensure that not only was knowledge of truth memorized, but learned, and then integrated to the self, in the course of transforming oneself into a [[Value (ethics)|good]] person. Therefore, to understand truth meant “intellectual knowledge” requiring one’s integration to the (universal) truth, and [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentically]] living it in one’s speech, heart, and conduct. Achieving that difficult task required continual care of the self, but also meant being someone who embodies truth, and so can readily practice the [[Rhetoric|Classical]]-era rhetorical device of [[parrhesia]]: “to speak candidly, and to ask forgiveness for so speaking”; and, by extension, practice the [[Morality|moral]] obligation to speak the truth for the common good, even at personal risk.&lt;ref&gt;Gros, Frederic (ed.)(2005) ''Michel Foucault: The Hermeneutics of the Subject'', Lectures at the College de France 1981–1982. Picador: New York&lt;/ref&gt; This ancient, Socratic moral philosophic perspective contradicts the contemporary understanding of truth and knowledge as [[Reason|rational]] undertakings.

==Medieval theological intellectualism&lt;!--'Medieval theological intellectualism' redirects here; linked from 'Averroes', 'Thomas Aquinas', and 'Meister Eckhart'--&gt;==
'''Medieval theological intellectualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a doctrine of divine action, wherein the faculty of [[intellect]] precedes, and is superior to, the faculty of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] (''voluntas intellectum sequitur''). As such, Intellectualism is contrasted with [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]], which proposes the Will as superior to the intellect, and to the emotions; hence, the stance that “according to intellectualism, choices of the Will result from that which the intellect recognizes as good; the will, itself, is determined. For voluntarism, by contrast, it is the Will which identifies which objects are good, and the Will, itself, is indetermined”.&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/v/voluntar.htm | title = Voluntarism| publisher = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that philosophical perspective and historical context, the Spanish [[Islam|Muslim]] polymath [[Averroës]] (1126–1198) in the 12th century, the Italian Christian theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274), and the German Christian theologian [[Meister Eckhart]] (1260–1327) in the 13th century, are recognised intellectualists.&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah Hackett, ''A Companion to Meister Eckhart'', BRILL, 2012, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Philip hails from Akoefe in the Volta Region of Ghana. Growing up, [[afrobeats]] music became his favorite at the junior high school level Ashaiman Government School.
He won himself the pleasure to be the first Ghanaian to be introduced by BBC Music and to feature on BBC6 Music Mixtape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/introducing/entries/6a33f87e-bbfa-4843-86e2-6f5aa1c6ea86| title=BBC Music Introducing Mixtape 26 March 2018|publisher= Tom Robison | date= | author= | accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kay |first1=9ice |title=Kay 9ice wobeti bbc |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/tracks/n5zpn3 |website=bbc |publisher=Tom Robison |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kay 9ice became part of a musical group called Rekx Bois (Real Entertainment Knocked Down Extremely). Due to his hard work musically he had his first big appearance during Flowking Stone's oseikrom shutdown show in Kumasi, Ghana. With his hard work, he got nominated for the median edition for Ashaiman Music Awards 2018 and Ghana Music Awards South Africa for which he got 7 nominations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kay 9ice |first1=7 nominations |title=Kay 9ice 7 nominations |agency=ModernGhana |ref=https://www.modernghana.com/entertainment/52027/kay-9ice-bags-7-nominations-at-the-maiden-amas.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promising Artist Of The Year 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=2018 Ghana Music Awards South Africa: Check |first1=The Full List of Nominees |title=2018 Ghana Music Awards South Africa: Check The Full List of Nominees |agency=NYDJ live |ref=https://www.nydjlive.com/2018-ghana-music-awards-south-africa-check-the-full-list-of-nominees/}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

The name, as well as referring to the parent institution, derives from the [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] '''M'''ulti-'''A'''gent '''S'''imulator '''O'''f '''N'''eighborhoods (or Networks).&lt;ref name="GMU_mason"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/ |title=MASON Multiagent Simulation Toolkit |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MASON development started within the [[Java.net]] environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mason.dev.java.net/ |title=mason: Home |accessdate=19 January 2011 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; then moved to [[Google Code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://code.google.com/p/mason/
|title=mason - Project Hosting on Google Code |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now at [[GitHub]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/eclab/mason
|title=mason - Project Hosting on Github |accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst MASON is less extensive than other similar libraries it is designed with simplicity and execution speed as a priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://sim.sagepub.com/content/82/9/609.abstract |title=Agent-based simulation platforms: review and development recommendations. |first1=S.

'''Miro Aaltonen''' (born 7 June 1993) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]]. He is currently playing with [[HC Vityaz]] of the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL).&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url = http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/maple-leafs-sign-khl-forward-miro-aaltonen-entry-level-contract/  | title = Miro Aaltonen signing with Toronto Maple Leafs | publisher = ''[[Sportsnet.ca]]'' | date = 2017-03-17 | accessdate = 2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaltonen was selected by [[Atlant Moscow Oblast]] in the 2nd round (45th overall) of the [[2011 KHL Junior Draft]], and he was also selected by the [[Anaheim Ducks]] in the 6th round (177th overall) of the [[2013 NHL Entry Draft]].

==Playing career==
Following the [[2016-17 KHL season|2016–17]] season, after recording a career best 44 points in 59 games after his first season with [[HC Vityaz]] in the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], he signed an entry-level contract with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] on March 17, 2017.

Despite a strong push for a roster spot as the Leafs' [[Line (ice hockey)|fourth-line]] center, he was assigned to the Maple Leafs [[American Hockey League]] affiliate, the [[Toronto Marlies]] for the [[2017–18 AHL season|2017–18]] season. In adapting to his first North American season, Aaltonen established himself among the offensive leaders with the Marlies, contributing with 20 goals and 43 points in 64 regular season games. Unable to earn a call up to the NHL, Aaltonen continued in the post-season with the Marlies, helping claim the club's first [[Calder Cup]] in posting 13 points in 20 games.

As an impending restricted free agent from the Maple Leafs but unable to make his NHL debut, Aaltonen opted to return to the KHL on a contract with former Russian club, Vityaz on July 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb| url = http://www.hcvityaz.ru/news.php?full=9650 | title = Miro Aaltonen returns to Vityaz | publisher = ''[[HC Vityaz]]'' | date = 2018-07-01 | accessdate = 2018-07-01 | language = Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than half of embryos miscarried in the first 13 weeks.

===Second and third trimesters===
Second trimester losses may be due to maternal factors such as [[uterine malformation]], growths in the uterus ([[Uterine fibroid|fibroid]]s), or [[Cervical incompetence|cervical problems]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; These conditions also may contribute to [[premature birth]].&lt;ref name="webmd" /&gt; Unlike first-trimester miscarriages, second-trimester miscarriages are less likely to be caused by a genetic abnormality; chromosomal aberrations are found in a third of cases.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt; Infection during the third trimester can cause a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== Age ===
{{Further|Advanced maternal age}}
The age of the pregnant woman is a significant risk factor.  Miscarriage rates increase steadily with age, with more substantial increases after age 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bray I, Gunnell D, [[George Davey Smith|Davey Smith G]]|year=2006|title=Advanced paternal age: How old is too old?|journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health|volume=60|issue=10|pages=851–3|doi=10.1136/jech.2005.045179|pmc=2566050|pmid=16973530}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In those under the age of 35 the risk is about 10% while it is about 45% in those over the age of 40.&lt;ref name="John2012" /&gt; Risk begins to increase around the age of 30.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Epi" /&gt; Paternal age is associated with increased risk.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=175}}

===Obesity, eating disorders and caffeine===
Not only is obesity associated with miscarriage, it can result in sub-fertility and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recurrent miscarriage is also related to obesity. Women with [[bulimia nervosa]] and [[anorexia nervosa]] may have a greater risk for miscarriage. Nutrient deficiencies have not been found to impact miscarriage rates but [[hyperemesis gravidarum]] sometimes precedes a miscarriage.

[[Caffeine]] consumption also has been correlated to miscarriage rates, at least at higher levels of intake.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However, such higher rates have been found to be statistically significant only in certain circumstances.

Vitamin supplementation has generally not shown to be effective in preventing miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue = 5|pages = CD004073|last=Balogun|first=Olukunmi O|last2=da Silva Lopes|first2=Katharina|last3=Ota|first3=Erika|last4=Takemoto|first4=Yo|last5=Rumbold|first5=Alice|last6=Takegata|first6=Mizuki|last7=Mori|first7=Rintaro|date=2016-05-06|isbn = |language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd004073.pub4|pmid = 27150280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese traditional medicine has not been found to prevent miscarriage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Endocrine disorders===
Disorders of the thyroid may affect pregnancy outcomes. Related to this, iodine deficiency is strongly associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}} The risk of miscarriage is increased in those with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}} Women with well-controlled diabetes have the same risk of miscarriage as those without diabetes.&lt;ref name=Ferri2017&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred F.

===Food poisoning===
Ingesting food that has been contaminated with [[listeriosis]], [[toxoplasmosis]], and [[salmonella]] is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = gloss/&gt;

===Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling===
Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are procedures conducted to assess the fetus. A sample of amniotic fluid is obtained by the insertion of a needle through the abdomen and into the uterus. Chorionic villus sampling is a similar procedure with a sample of tissue removed rather than fluid. These procedures are not associated with pregnancy loss during the second trimester but they are associated with miscarriages and birth defects in the first trimester.&lt;ref name="Alfirevic"/&gt; Miscarriage caused by invasive prenatal diagnosis ([[chorionic villus sampling]] (CVS) and [[amniocentesis]]) is rare (about 1%).&lt;ref name="Agarwal-Alfirevic-2012"/&gt;

===Surgery===
The effects of surgery on pregnancy are not well-known including the effects of [[bariatric]] surgery. Abdominal and pelvic surgery are not risk factors in miscarriage. Ovarian tumors and cysts that are removed have not been found to increase the risk of miscarriage. The exception to this is the removal of the corpus luteum from the ovary. This can cause fluctuations in the hormones necessary to maintain the pregnancy.{{sfn|Hoffman|pages=172–173}}

===Medications===
Immunizations have not been found to cause miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=72}} There is no significant association between [[antidepressant]] medication exposure and spontaneous abortion.&lt;ref name="Ross LE 436–443"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross LE|last2=Grigoriadis S|last3=Mamisashvili L|display-authors=etal|date=2013-04-01|title=Selected pregnancy and delivery outcomes after exposure to antidepressant medication: A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=JAMA Psychiatry|volume=70|issue=4|pages=436–443|doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.684|pmid=23446732|issn=2168-622X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of miscarriage is not likely decreased by discontinuing [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] prior to pregnancy.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalke|first=Katharine Baratz|last2=Wenzel|first2=Amy|last3=Kim|first3=Deborah R.|date=2016-04-19|title=Depression and Anxiety During Pregnancy: Evaluating the Literature in Support of Clinical Risk-Benefit Decision-Making|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|language=en|volume=18|issue=6|pages=1–12|doi=10.1007/s11920-016-0698-x|pmid=27091646|issn=1523-3812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some available data suggest that there is a small increased risk of miscarriage for women taking any [[antidepressant]],&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=Gestational exposure to antidepressants and the risk of spontaneous abortion: A review|journal=Current Drug Delivery|volume=7|issue=1|pages=76–92|doi=10.2174/156720110790396508|pmid=19863482|vauthors=Broy P, Bérard A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=Use of antidepressants during pregnancy and the risk of spontaneous abortion|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=182|issue=10|pages=1031–7|doi=10.1503/cmaj.091208|pmc=2900326|pmid=20513781|vauthors=Nakhai-Pour HR, Broy P, Bérard A}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this risk becomes less [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] when excluding studies of poor quality.&lt;ref name="Ross LE 436–443"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yonkers|first=Kimberly A.|last2=Blackwell|first2=Katherine A.|last3=Glover|first3=Janis|last4=Forray|first4=Ariadna|date=2014-01-01|title=Antidepressant Use in Pregnant and Postpartum Women|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=10|issue=1|pages=369–392|doi=10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032813-153626|pmc=4138492|pmid=24313569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicines that increase the risk of miscarriage include:

* retinoids&amp;nbsp;
* nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&amp;nbsp;, such as ibuprofen
* misoprostol&amp;nbsp;
* methotrexate&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Chemotherapy and radiation treatments for cancer===
Ionizing radiation levels given to a woman during cancer treatment cause miscarriage. Exposure can also impact fertility. The use of chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat childhood cancer increases the risk of miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}}

===Intercurrent diseases===
Several [[intercurrent diseases in pregnancy]] can potentially increase the risk of miscarriage, including diabetes, [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] (PCOS), hypothyroidism, certain infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases. PCOS may increase the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Two studies suggested treatment with the drug [[metformin]] significantly lowers the rate of miscarriage in women with PCOS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jakubowicz DJ, Iuorno MJ, Jakubowicz S, Roberts KA, Nestler JE | title = Effects of Metformin on Early Pregnancy Loss in the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome | journal = Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 524–9 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11836280 | doi = 10.1210/jc.87.2.524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khattab S, Mohsen IA, Foutouh IA, Ramadan A, Moaz M, Al-Inany H | title = Metformin reduces abortion in pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome | journal = Gynecological Endocrinology | volume = 22 | issue = 12 | pages = 680–4 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17162710 | doi = 10.1080/09513590601010508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the quality of these studies has been questioned.&lt;ref name="RCOG-PCOS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|title=Long-term consequences of polycystic ovarian syndrome|url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/GT33_LongTermPCOS.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20100710113119/http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/GT33_LongTermPCOS.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-07-10|website=Green-top Guideline No. 27|publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|accessdate=2 July 2013|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metformin treatment in pregnancy has not been shown to be safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lilja AE, Mathiesen ER | title = Polycystic ovary syndrome and metformin in pregnancy | journal = Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica | volume = 85 | issue = 7 | pages = 861–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16817087 | doi = 10.1080/00016340600780441 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists also recommended against use of the drug to prevent miscarriage.&lt;ref name="RCOG-PCOS" /&gt; Thrombophilias or defects in coagulation and bleeding were once thought to be a risk in miscarriage but have been subsequently questioned.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=174}}
Severe cases of [[hypothyroidism]] increase the risk of miscarriage. The effect of milder cases of hypothyroidism on miscarriage rates has not been established. A condition called luteal phase defect (LPD) is a failure of the uterine lining to be fully prepared for pregnancy. This can keep a fertilized egg from implanting or result in miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/you-get-pregnant/trying-conceive/#4|title=Trying to conceive {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' infection is associated with increased risk of [[preterm birth]] and miscarriage.&lt;ref name="LisRowhani-Rahbar2015"/&gt;

Infections can increase the risk of a miscarriage: rubella&amp;nbsp;(German measles), cytomegalovirus, bacterial vaginosis, HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhoea,&amp;nbsp;syphilis,&amp;nbsp;and malaria.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Immune status===
Autoimmunity is possible cause of recurrent or late-term miscarriages. In the case of an autoimmune-induced miscarriages the woman's body attacks the growing fetus or prevents normal pregnancy progression.&lt;ref name="CarpSelmi2012"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=The autoimmune bases of infertility and pregnancy loss|journal=J Autoimmun|type=Review|volume=38|issue=2–3|pages=J266–74|doi=10.1016/j.jaut.2011.11.016|pmid=22284905|vauthors=Carp HJ, Selmi C, Shoenfeld Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=Female infertility due to abnormal autoimmunity: Frequently overlooked and greatly underappreciated.

===Anatomical defects and trauma===
Fifteen percent of women who have experienced three or more recurring miscarriages have some anatomical defect that prevents the pregnancy from being carried for the entire term.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=181}} The structure of the [[uterus]] has an effect on the ability to carry a child to term. Anatomical differences are common and can be congenital.

===Smoking===
{{See also|Smoking and pregnancy}}
Tobacco (cigarette) smokers have an increased risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="x"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; There is an increased risk regardless of which parent smokes, though the risk is higher when the gestational mother smokes.&lt;ref name="paternal smoking"/&gt;

===Morning sickness===
Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP, or [[morning sickness]]) are associated with a decreased risk.

===Chemicals and occupational exposure===
Chemical and [[occupational exposure]]s may have some effect in pregnancy outcomes. A cause and effect relationship almost can never be established. Those chemicals that are implicated in increasing the risk for miscarriage are [[DDT]], [[lead]], [[formaldehyde]], [[arsenic]], [[benzene]] and [[ethylene oxide]]. [[Video display terminal]]s and ultrasound have not been found to have an effect on the rates of miscarriage. In dental offices where [[nitrous oxide]] is used with the absence of [[anesthetic gas scavenging equipment]], there is a greater risk of miscarriage. For women who work with cytotoxic [[antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agent]]s there is a small increased risk of miscarriage. No increased risk for [[cosmetologist]]s has been found.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=272}}

==Diagnosis==
In the case of blood loss, pain, or both, [[Obstetric ultrasonography|transvaginal ultrasound]] is performed.  If a viable intrauterine pregnancy is not found with ultrasound, blood tests (serial [[human chorionic gonadotropin|βHCG]] tests) can be performed to rule out ectopic pregnancy, which is a life-threatening situation.&lt;ref name="followHCG"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Condous G, Okaro E, Khalid A, Bourne T | title = Do we need to follow up complete miscarriages with serum human chorionic gonadotrophin levels? | journal = BJOG | volume = 112 | issue = 6 | pages = 827–9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15924545 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2004.00542.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bmj&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://us.bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/666.html|title=Miscarriage|last=BMJ Best Practice|first=|date=|website=us.bestpractice.bmj.com|language=en|others=Ida Muslim, Jothi Doraiswamy, Acknowledgements|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If [[hypotension]], [[tachycardia]], and [[anemia]] are discovered, exclusion of an ectopic pregnancy is important.&lt;ref name = bmj/&gt;

A miscarriage may be confirmed by an [[obstetric ultrasound]] and by the examination of the passed tissue. When looking for microscopic [[pathology|pathologic]] symptoms, one looks for the [[products of conception]]. Microscopically, these include [[Chorionic villi|villi]], [[trophoblast]], fetal parts, and background gestational changes in the [[endometrium]].

===Ultrasound criteria===
A review article in [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] based on a consensus meeting of the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound in America (SRU) has suggested that miscarriage should be diagnosed only if any of the following criteria are met upon ultrasonography visualization:&lt;ref name="Doubilet2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doubilet PM, Benson CB, Bourne T, Blaivas M, Barnhart KT, Benacerraf BR, Brown DL, Filly RA, Fox JC, Goldstein SR, Kendall JL, Lyons EA, Porter MB, Pretorius DH, Timor-Tritsch IE | title = Diagnostic Criteria for Nonviable Pregnancy Early in the First Trimester | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 15 | pages = 1443–1451 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24106937 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1302417 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
A threatened miscarriage describes any bleeding during pregnancy, prior to viability, that has yet to be assessed.. At investigation it may be found that the fetus remains viable and the pregnancy continues without further problems.{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2017}}

An [[Anembryonic gestation|anembryonic pregnancy]] (also called an "empty sac" or "blighted ovum") is a condition where the [[gestational sac]] develops normally, while the embryonic part of the pregnancy is either absent or stops growing very early. This accounts for approximately half of miscarriages. All other miscarriages are classified as embryonic miscarriages, meaning that there is an embryo present in the gestational sac. Half of embryonic miscarriages have [[aneuploidy]] (an abnormal number of chromosomes).&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;

An inevitable miscarriage occurs when the cervix has already dilated,&lt;ref name="isbn 0-07-144874-8"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Latha |last1=Stead |first2=S. Matthew |last2=Stead |first3=Matthew |last3=Kaufman|first4=Luis |last4=Suarez |title=First Aid for The Obstetrics and Gynecology Clerkship |publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York |year=2006 |page=138 |isbn=978-0-07-144874-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the fetus has yet to be expelled. This usually will progress to a complete miscarriage. The fetus may or may not have cardiac activity.

[[File:Complete miscarriage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Transvaginal ultrasonography]] after an episode of heavy bleeding in an intrauterine pregnancy that had been confirmed by a previous ultrasononography. There is some widening between the [[uterine wall]]s, but no sign of any [[gestational sac]], thus in this case being diagnostic of a complete miscarriage.]] A complete miscarriage is when all products of conception have been expelled; these may include the [[trophoblast]], [[chorionic villi]], [[gestational sac]], [[yolk sac]], and [[fetal pole]] ([[embryo]]); or later in pregnancy the [[fetus]], [[umbilical cord]], [[placenta]], amniotic fluid, and [[amniotic sac|amniotic membrane]]. The presence of a [[pregnancy test]] that is still positive as well as an empty uterus upon [[transvaginal ultrasonography]] does, however, fulfill the definition of [[pregnancy of unknown location]]. Therefore, there may be a need for follow-up pregnancy tests to ensure that there is no remaining pregnancy, including an ectopic pregnancy.

A [[Septic abortion|septic miscarriage]] occurs when the tissue from a missed or incomplete miscarriage becomes infected, which carries the risk of spreading infection ([[septicaemia]]) and can be fatal.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;

[[Recurrent miscarriage]] ("recurrent pregnancy loss" (RPL) or "habitual abortion") is the occurrence of multiple consecutive miscarriages; the exact number used to diagnose recurrent miscarriage varies.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt; If the proportion of pregnancies ending in miscarriage is 15% and assuming that miscarriages are independent events,&lt;ref name="rcog2003" /&gt; then the probability of two consecutive miscarriages is 2.25% and the probability of three consecutive miscarriages is 0.34%.

The physical symptoms of a miscarriage vary according to the length of pregnancy, though most miscarriages cause pain or cramping. The size of blood clots and pregnancy tissue that are passed become larger with longer gestations. After 13 weeks' gestation, there is a higher risk of placenta retention.&lt;ref name="ausbirth"&gt;{{cite web| date=October 2004| title=miscarriage| url=http://www.birth.com.au/Info.asp?class=6620&amp;page=13| accessdate=3 January 2014| author=Home page at www.birth.com.au| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201112940/http://www.birth.com.au/Info.asp?class=6620&amp;page=13| archivedate=December 1, 2008| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Prevention of a miscarriage can sometimes be accomplished by decreasing risk factors.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Pre" /&gt; This may include good [[prenatal care]], avoiding drugs and alcohol, preventing infectious diseases, and avoiding x-rays.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Pre" /&gt; Identifying the cause of the miscarriage may help prevent future pregnancy loss, especially in cases of recurrent miscarriage. Often there is little a person can do to prevent a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Pre" /&gt; Vitamin supplementation before or during pregnancy has not been found to affect the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2016|title=Vitamin supplementation for preventing miscarriage|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=5|issue=5|pages=CD004073|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004073.pub4|pmid=27150280|vauthors=Balogun OO, da Silva Lopes K, Ota E, Takemoto Y, Rumbold A, Takegata M, Mori R|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modifiable risk factors===
Maintaining a healthy weight and good pre-natal care can reduce the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Some risk factors can be minimized by avoiding the following:
*Smoking&lt;ref name="x"/&gt;&lt;ref name="paternal smoking"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
*Cocaine use&lt;ref name="x"/&gt;

*Drug abuse&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Management==
Women who miscarry early in their pregnancy usually do not require any subsequent medical treatment but they can benefit from support and counseling.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jeve"/&gt; Most early miscarriages will complete on their own; in other cases, medication treatment or aspiration of the products of conception can be used to remove remaining tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babycentre.co.uk/a1039515/understanding-early-miscarriage#ixzz2x52G1IYu |title=Understanding early miscarriage |date=January 2017 |accessdate=June 4, 2017 |publisher=BabyCenter, L.L.C. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905095051/https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a1039515/understanding-early-miscarriage#ixzz2x52G1IYu |archivedate=September 5, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[bed rest]] has been advocated to prevent miscarriage, this has not been found to be of benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christina A.|last1=McCall|first2=David A.|last2=Grimes|first3=Anne Drapkin|last3=Lyerly|title="Therapeutic" bed rest in pregnancy: unethical and unsupported by data|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=1 June 2013|issn=1873-233X|pages=1305–1308|volume=121|issue=6|pmid=23812466|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e318293f12f}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hoffman|page = 176}} Those who are or who have experienced an abortion benefit from the use of careful medical language.

===Methods===
No treatment is necessary for a diagnosis of complete miscarriage (so long as ectopic pregnancy is ruled out). In cases of an incomplete miscarriage, empty sac, or missed abortion there are three treatment options: watchful waiting, medical management, and surgical treatment. With no treatment ([[watchful waiting]]), most miscarriages (65–80%) will pass naturally within two to six weeks.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kripke C | title = Expectant management vs. surgical treatment for miscarriage | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 74 | issue = 7 | pages = 1125–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17039747 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/1001/p1125.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140525195924/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/1001/p1125.html | archivedate = May 25, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment avoids the possible side effects and complications of medications and surgery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tang OS, Ho PC | title = The use of misoprostol for early pregnancy failure | journal = Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 581–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17099326 | doi = 10.1097/GCO.0b013e32800feedb }}&lt;/ref&gt; but increases the risk of mild bleeding, need for unplanned surgical treatment, and incomplete miscarriage. Medical treatment usually consists of using [[misoprostol]] (a [[prostaglandin]]) to contract the uterus, expelling remaining tissue out of the cervix. This works within a few days in 95% of cases.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;  Vacuum aspiration or sharp curettage can be used, though vacuum aspiration is lower-risk and more common.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;

===Delayed and incomplete miscarriage===
In delayed or incomplete miscarriage, treatment depends on the amount of tissue remaining in the uterus. Treatment can include surgical removal of the tissue with [[vacuum aspiration]] or [[misoprostol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333519/|title=Surgery for Family Planning, Abortion, and Postabortion Care|last=Babigumira|first=Joseph B.|last2=Vlassoff|first2=Michael|last3=Ahimbisibwe|first3=Asa|last4=Stergachis|first4=Andy|date=2015-01-01|publisher=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank|isbn=9781464803468|editor-last=Debas|editor-first=Haile T.|location=Washington (DC)|pmid=26741012|editor-last2=Donkor|editor-first2=Peter|editor-last3=Gawande|editor-first3=Atul|editor-last4=Jamison|editor-first4=Dean T.|editor-last5=Kruk|editor-first5=Margaret E.|editor-last6=Mock|editor-first6=Charles N.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910181311/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333519/|archivedate=September 10, 2017|df=mdy-all|doi=10.1596/978-1-4648-0346-8_ch7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies looking at the methods of anaesthesia for surgical management of incomplete miscarriage have not shown that any adaptation from normal practice is beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calvache|first1=JA|last2=Delgado-Noguera|first2=MF|last3=Lesaffre|first3=E|last4=Stolker|first4=RJ|title=Anaesthesia for evacuation of incomplete miscarriage|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=18 April 2012|issue=4|pages=CD008681|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008681.pub2|pmid=22513963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations recommend delaying sexual relations immediately after a miscarriage to prevent [[infection]].&lt;ref name="misorg" /&gt; However, there is not sufficient evidence for the routine use of antibiotic to try to avoid infection in incomplete abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=May|first1=W|last2=Gülmezoglu|first2=AM|last3=Ba-Thike|first3=K|title=Antibiotics for incomplete abortion|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=17 October 2007|issue=4|pages=CD001779|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001779.pub2|pmid=17943756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent pregnancies===
Some parents want to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The decision of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, there may be some sense of urgency. Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and want to know about the risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one [[menstrual cycle]] before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage or [[molar pregnancy]], or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.&lt;ref name="misorg"/&gt;

The risks of having another miscarriage vary according to the cause. The risk of having another miscarriage after a molar pregnancy is very low. The risk of another miscarriage is highest after the third miscarriage. Pre-conception care is available in some locales.&lt;ref name="misorg" /&gt;

===Later cardiovascular disease===
There is a significant association between miscarriage and later development of [[coronary artery disease]], but not of [[cerebrovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oliver-Williams CT, Heydon EE, Smith GC, Wood AM | title = Miscarriage and future maternal cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Heart | volume = 99 | issue = 22 | pages = 1636–1644 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23539554 | pmc = 3812894 | doi = 10.1136/heartjnl-2012-303237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hoffman|page = 172}}

==Epidemiology==
Among women who know they are pregnant, the miscarriage rate is roughly 10% to 20%, while rates among all [[Fertilisation|fertilized zygotes]] are around 30% to 50%.&lt;ref name="John2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NIH2013Epi" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name="jeve" /&gt; A 2012 review found the risk of miscarriage between 5 and 20 weeks from 11% to 22%.&lt;ref name=Avalos-2012 /&gt; Up to the 13th week of pregnancy, the risk of miscarriage each week was around 2%, dropping to 1% in week 14 and reducing slowly between 14 and 20 weeks.&lt;ref name=Avalos-2012 /&gt;

The precise rate is not known because a large number of miscarriages occur before pregnancies become established and before the woman is aware they are pregnant.&lt;ref name="Avalos-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ammon Avalos L, Galindo C, Li DK | title = A systematic review to calculate background miscarriage rates using life table analysis | journal = Birth Defects Research. Part A, Clinical and Molecular Teratology | volume = 94 | issue = 6 | pages = 417–23 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22511535 | doi = 10.1002/bdra.23014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, those with bleeding in early pregnancy may seek medical care more often than those not experiencing bleeding.&lt;ref name="Avalos-2012" /&gt; Although some studies attempt to account for this by recruiting women who are planning pregnancies and testing for very early pregnancy, they still are not representative of the wider population.&lt;ref name="Avalos-2012" /&gt;

The prevalence of miscarriage increases with the age of both parents.&lt;ref name=Avalos-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nybo Andersen AM, Wohlfahrt J, Christens P, Olsen J, Melbye M | title = Maternal age and fetal loss: Population based register linkage study | journal = BMJ | volume = 320 | issue = 7251 | pages = 1708–12 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10864550 | pmc = 27416 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7251.1708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kleinhaus K, Perrin M, Friedlander Y, Paltiel O, Malaspina D, Harlap S | title = Paternal Age and Spontaneous Abortion | journal = Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 108 | issue = 2 | pages = 369–77 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16880308 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000224606.26514.3a }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Slama R, Bouyer J, Windham G, Fenster L, Werwatz A, Swan SH | title = Influence of Paternal Age on the Risk of Spontaneous Abortion | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 161 | issue = 9 | pages = 816–23 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15840613 | doi = 10.1093/aje/kwi097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Danish register-based study where the prevalence of miscarriage was 11%, the prevalence rose from 9% at 22 years of age to 84% by 48 years of age.&lt;ref name=Andersen /&gt;{{Update inline|date=October 2017}} Another, later study in 2013 found that when either parent was over the age of 40, the rate of known miscarriages doubled.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;

In 2010, 50,000 inpatient admissions for miscarriage occurred in the UK.&lt;ref name="radford" /&gt;

==Terminology==
Most affected women and family members refer to miscarriage as the loss of a baby, rather than an embryo or fetus, and healthcare providers are expected to respect and use the language that the person chooses.&lt;ref name="Chris2014" /&gt; Clinical terms can suggest blame, increase distress, and even cause anger. Terms that are known to cause distress in those experiencing miscarriage include:

* ''abortion'' (including ''spontaneous abortion'') rather than miscarriage, 
* ''habitual aborter'' rather than a woman experiencing [[recurrent pregnancy loss]], 
* ''products of conception'' rather than [[baby]], 
* ''blighted ovum'' rather than early pregnancy loss or delayed miscarriage, 
* ''cervical incompetence'' rather than [[cervical weakness]], and 
* ''evacuation of retained products of conception'' (ERPC) rather than [[surgical management of miscarriage]].&lt;ref name="Chris2014" /&gt;

''Pregnancy loss'' is a broad term that describes miscarriage, ectopic and molar pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Chris2014" /&gt; The term ''[[fetal death]]'' applies variably in different countries and contexts, sometimes incorporating weight, and gestational age from 16 weeks in Norway, 20 weeks in the US and Australia, 24 weeks in the UK to 26 weeks in Italy and Spain.&lt;ref name="Mohangoo-2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mohangoo AD, Blondel B, Gissler M, Velebil P, Macfarlane A, Zeitlin J | title = International comparisons of fetal and neonatal mortality rates in high-income countries: should exclusion thresholds be based on birth weight or gestational age? | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = e64869 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23700489 | pmc = 3658983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0064869 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...864869M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIHW-2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Li|first=Z|title=Australia's Mothers and Babies 2010|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=60129542372|website=Perinatal statistics series no. 27.

==History==
The medical terminology applied to experiences during early pregnancy has changed over time.&lt;ref name=pmid23429567&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moscrop A | title = 'Miscarriage or abortion?'

Some medical authors advocated change to use of ''miscarriage'' instead of ''spontaneous abortion'' because they argued this would be more respectful and help ease a distressing experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beard RW, Mowbray JF, Pinker GD | title = Miscarriage or abortion | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 8464 | pages = 1122–3 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2865589 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(85)90709-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hutchon DJ, Cooper S | title = Terminology for early pregnancy loss must be changed | journal = BMJ | volume = 317 | issue = 7165 | pages = 1081 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9774309 | pmc = 1114078 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.317.7165.1081 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=October 2017}} The change was being recommended by some in the profession in Britain in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=Hutchon-1998&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hutchon DJ, Cooper S | title = Terminology for early pregnancy loss must be changed | journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume = 317 | issue = 7165 | pages = 1081 | date = Oct 17, 1998 | pmid = 9774309 | pmc = 1114078 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.317.7165.1081 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) published a paper aiming to facilitate a revision of nomenclature used to describe early pregnancy events.&lt;ref name=Farquharson&gt;{{cite journal | author = Farquharson RG, Jauniaux E, Exalto N | title = Updated and revised nomenclature for description of early pregnancy events | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 20 | issue = 11 | pages = 3008–11 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16006453 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/dei167 | author4 = ESHRE Special Interest Group for Early Pregnancy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Society's reactions to miscarriage changed over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;In the early 20th century, the focus was on the mother's physical health and the difficulties and disabilities that miscarriage could produce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Other reactions, such as the expense of medical treatments and relief at ending an unwanted pregnancy, were also heard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the 1940s and 1950s, people were more likely to express relief, not because the miscarriage ended an unwanted or mistimed pregnancy, but because people believed that miscarriages were primarily caused by birth defects, and miscarrying meant that the family would not raise a child with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The dominant attitude in the mid-century was that a miscarriage, although temporarily distressing, was a blessing in disguise for the family, and that another pregnancy and a healthier baby would soon follow, especially if women trusted physicians and reduced their anxieties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Media articles were illustrated with pictures of babies, and magazine articles about miscarriage ended by introducing the healthy baby—usually a boy—that had shortly followed it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Beginning in the 1980s, miscarriage in the US was primarily framed in terms of the individual woman's personal emotional reaction, and especially her grief over a tragic outcome.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The subject was portrayed in the media with images of an empty crib or an isolated, grieving woman, and stories about miscarriage were published in general-interest media outlets, not just [[women's magazines]] or health magazines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Family members were encouraged to grieve, to memorialize their losses through funerals and other rituals, and to think of themselves as being parents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;This shift to recognizing these emotional responses was partly due to medical and political successes, which created an expectation that pregnancies are typically planned and safe, and to women's demands that their emotional reactions no longer be dismissed by the medical establishments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;It also reinforces the [[Pro-Life movement|pro-life movement's]] belief that human life begins at conception or early in pregnancy, and that [[Pronatalism|motherhood is a desirable life goal]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The modern one-size-fits-all model of grief does not fit every woman's experience, and an expectation to [[Performativity|perform]] grief creates unnecessary burdens for some women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reframing of miscarriage as a private emotional experience brought less awareness of miscarriage and a sense of silence around the subject, especially compared to the public discussion of miscarriage during campaigns for access to birth control during the early 20th century, or the public campaigns to prevent miscarriages, stillbirths, and infant deaths by reducing industrial pollution during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/04/the-history-of-talking-about-miscarriage.html|title=The History of Talking About Miscarriage|last=Blei|first=Daniela|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In places where induced abortion is illegal or carries social stigma, suspicion may surround miscarriage, complicating an already sensitive issue.

In the 1960s, the use of the word ''miscarriage'' in Britain (instead of ''spontaneous abortion'') occurred after changes in legislation.

Developments in ultrasound technology (in the early 1980s) allowed them to identify earlier miscarriages.&lt;ref name="pmid23429567" /&gt;

According to French statutes, an infant born before the age of viability, determined to be 28 weeks, is not registered as a 'child'. If birth occurs after this, the infant is granted a certificate that allows women who have given birth to a stillborn child, to have a symbolic record of that child. This certificate can include a registered and given name with the purpose of allowing a funeral and acknowledgement of the event.&lt;ref&gt;Communiqué de presse de [[Rachida Dati]], Garde des Sceaux, ministre de la Justice et de [[Roselyne Bachelot|Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin]], ministre de la Santé, de la Jeunesse, des Sports et de la Vie associative, « Possibilité de demande d’un acte d’enfant sans vie », 22 août 2008, [http://www.sante.gouv.fr/possibilite-de-demande-d-un-acte-d-enfant-sans-vie.html lire en ligne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.service-public.fr/|title=Accueil Particuliers {{!}} service-public.fr|website=www.service-public.fr|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Décret n°74-449 du 15 mai 1974 relatif au livret de famille et à l'information des futurs époux sur le droit de la famille - Article 9|date=15 May 1974|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006285245&amp;cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000328986|accessdate=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
{{anchor|In animals}}
Miscarriage occurs in all animals that experience pregnancy, though in such contexts it is more commonly referred to as a "spontaneous abortion" (the two terms are synonymous). There are a variety of known risk factors in non-human animals. For example, in sheep, miscarriage may be caused by crowding through doors, or being chased by dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, James.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RXMuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=abortion+and+husbandry&amp;ct=result#PPA124,M1 Sheep Husbandry in Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924203629/https://books.google.com/books?id=RXMuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=abortion+and+husbandry&amp;ct=result |date=September 24, 2015 }}'', page 124 (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; In cows, spontaneous abortion may be caused by contagious disease, such as [[brucellosis]] or ''[[Campylobacter]]'', but often can be controlled by vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/B/BeefCattleAndBeefProduction/ManagementAndHusbandryOfBeefCattle/en "Beef cattle and Beef production: Management and Husbandry of Beef Cattle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101142401/http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/B/BeefCattleAndBeefProduction/ManagementAndHusbandryOfBeefCattle/en |date=January 1, 2009 }}, ''Encyclopaedia of New Zealand'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;  In many species of sharks and rays, stress induced miscarriage occurs frequently on capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Kye R.|last2=Fetterplace|first2=Lachlan C.|last3=Davis|first3=Andrew R.|last4=Taylor|first4=Matthew D.|last5=Knott|first5=Nathan A.|title=Sharks, rays and abortion: The prevalence of capture-induced parturition in elasmobranchs|journal=Biological Conservation|date=January 2018|volume=217|pages=11–27|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2017.10.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other diseases are also known to make animals susceptible to miscarriage. Spontaneous abortion occurs in pregnant [[prairie vole]]s when their mate is removed and they are exposed to a new male,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fraser-Smith AC | title = Male-induced pregnancy termination in the prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster | journal = Science | volume = 187 | issue = 4182 | pages = 1211–3 | year = 1975 | pmid = 1114340 | doi = 10.1126/science.1114340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an example of the [[Bruce effect]], although this effect is seen less in wild populations than in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00265-002-0484-0 |title=A field test of the Bruce effect in the monogamous prairie vole (''Microtus ochrogaster'') |year=2002 |last1=Mahady |first1=Scott |last2=Wolff |first2=Jerry |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=31–7 |jstor=4602102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female mice who had spontaneous abortions showed a sharp rise in the amount of time spent with unfamiliar males preceding the abortion than those who did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Becker SD, Hurst JL | title = Female behaviour plays a critical role in controlling murine pregnancy block | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume = 276 | issue = 1662 | pages = 1723–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19324836 | pmc = 2660991 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2008.1780 | jstor = 30245000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early modern age saw various economic changes as well as several significant diseases that have affected the mortality rates. Data collection during this time was not consistent or broadly recorded and there have been efforts to reconstruct plausible statistics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laqueur|first=Thomas|title=The Work of the Dead: A Cultural History of Mortal Remains|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|volume=72|issue=4|pages=504–506|doi=10.1093/jhmas/jrx024|issn=0022-5045|via=|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality rates vary on geographic location, social environment, and cultural values.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There were also gender differences in the mortality rates, leading to an excess mortality rate in urban areas and in the female population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Derosas|first=Renzo|title=Life Under Pressure: Mortality And Living Standards In Europe And Asia, 1700-1900|date=|url=|work=Infant and Child Mortality|volume=|pages=327–398, 431–440|publisher=|isbn=|access-date=2018-07-24|last2=Breschi|first2=Marco|last3=Fornasin|first3=Alessio|last4=Manfredini|first4=Matteo|last5=Munno|first5=Cristina}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main cause of death was [[stillbirth]], which could be attributed to, but not limited to, maternal infections, birth complications, and congenital anomalies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/epidemiology/stillbirth/en/|title=Stillbirths|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another contributing factor to the mortality rate was food insecurity and shortages as well as unemployment, both of which varied per region.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Post|first=John D.|date=1990|title=The Mortality Crises of the Early 1770s and European Demographic Trends|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume=21|issue=1|pages=29|doi=10.2307/204917|issn=0022-1953|jstor=204917}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final factor was violence, which occurred mainly due to [[Structural violence|structural]] or systemic violence; however, violence since the 12th century has been steadily falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Campbell|first=Roderick Campbell|title=Toward a Deep History of Violence and Civilization|url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=2084655|work=Violence and Civilization: Studies of Social Violence in History and Prehistory|volume=|pages=1–22|publisher=|isbn=9781782976202|access-date=2018-07-25|date=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Steven Pinker on the myth of violence|last=Pinker|first=Steven|date=2007|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|doi = 10.1037/e597002010-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data Collection ==
Data from the early modern age was not accurately or consistently collected. However, there have been a number of studies and reconstructed statistics from this era, particularly on children and women. There has not been any empirical research published and the only information has been theoretical as there has been insufficient data and sources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was also common for many statistics to go unreported; this is especially true regarding unmarried women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Models and theoretic equations need to take into account "social, economic, cultural, geographical, and even climatological variables" in order to accurately reflect the statistics of the time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Gender differences ==
One study, the Eurasia Project, has shown that boys, especially those under one year, had a higher mortality rate during childhood than girls, but the mortality rate for men and women were about equal. It has also been shown that there is a higher male mortality than female mortality rate during the time of famine. Male mortality has also been linked to "economic modernization and urbanization ... especially for cardiovascular disease".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Women faced increased mortality during childbirth as pregnancy and childbirth compromised the mother's immune system, with the most common causes of death being [[Postpartum infections|puerperal fever]], [[Pre-eclampsia|toxemia]], and [[Postpartum bleeding|hemorrhage]]. These dangers suggest an association to the excess female mortality, especially considering that women had to compete more for resources as they had no property rights and had a lower ranking in the household hierarchy. The average age of childbearing differed between Asia and Europe with an average difference of five years, which would affect cross-cultural data collection. Children born to mothers 35 years or older had a higher risk of mortality than children born to younger mothers. linking a mother's health and a child's survival.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Female infants and children often had a higher mortality rate, especially in times of food insecurity, compared to male infants and children. However, a maternal presence worked as a protective factor for children. regardless of age or gender.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Economics ==
Food insecurity and shortages were common throughout this time period and were matched with the high food prices and high unemployment rate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is shown through the differences in mortality rates between the lower and upper class, with poor infants being up to two times more likely to die than their wealthier counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 17th century Europe, it was common that at least one in five children from the same family would die before the age of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21375348|title=Making sex : body and gender from the Greeks to Freud|last=Walter.|first=Laqueur, Thomas|date=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674543492|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=21375348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this high rate, it was common for there to be a large amount of children in one family so that there would be a higher rate of survival. Especially among poorer families, having multiple children was common in order to ensure there would be children to contribute to the family later on.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During the early modern era, house calls were common. If the patient was female, the doctor, commonly an upper class male, would typically be summoned by a male family member who wound remain throughout the examination. The physician and male family member would then discuss the diagnosis and treatment plan without the female's input. This practice reinforced and perpetuated social hierarchies and patriarchal values.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Furth|first=Charlotte|date=1999-03-05|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History|journal=Isis|volume=93|issue=3|pages=479–480|doi=10.1086/374084|isbn=9780520208292|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and diseases ==

Food shortages and insecurity were leading concerns in the 18th century, especially in Europe, and these were exacerbated by reduced harvests yields.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Disease was another leading cause of death, with rats and fleas being the common carriers of disease, specifically plagues, during this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/faq/index.html|title=FAQ {{!}} Plague {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Death]] was a plague that affected much of the world, originating in Asia and spreading to Europe through diseased fleas and rats. This epidemic has been reported to have been the cause of death for approximately "60% of the European population".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During the end of the 19th century, there was a plague, known as the [[Third plague pandemic|Modern Plague]], that started in China and spread to different cities through ports, reportedly causing roughly ten million deaths.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/history/index.html|title=History {{!}} Plague {{!}} CDC|date=2018-05-31|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plague affected Asia, the Americas, and Africa and lasted into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There were also epidemics that occurred locally and did not spread to national levels, notably in 18th century England.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These local epidemics included fevers, dysentery, smallpox, starvation, typhoid fever, under-nutrition, cholera, malaria.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

By the end of the era, [[disease]] and [[malnutrition]] were no longer the main leading causes of death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Orphan Wisdom''' is a philosophical system invented and promoted by Stephen Jenkinson that believes what modern people "suffer from most is culture failure, amnesia of ancestry and deep family story, phantom or sham rites of passage, no instruction on how to live with each other or with the world around us or with our dead or with our history."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://orphanwisdom.com/teachings/making-wisdom/ Making Wisdom]" on the [http://orphanwisdom.com/ Orphan Wisdom] website.

The '''philosophy of happiness''' is the [[philosophical]] concern with the [[existence]], [[nature]], and attainment of [[happiness]]. Philosophers believe, happiness can be understood as the moral goal of life or as an aspect of chance; indeed, in most European languages the term happiness is synonymous with luck.&lt;ref&gt;Cassin et al. ''Dictionary of Untranslatables''. Princeton University Press, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, philosophers usually explicate on happiness as either a state of mind, or a life that goes well for the person leading it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/happiness/#MeaHap|title=Happiness|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greece==

===Plato===
{{rquote|right|''We have proved that justice in itself is the best thing for the soul itself, and that the soul ought to do justice...''|[[Plato]], ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''&lt;ref name="Pl-10.612b"&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'' 10.612b&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Plato]] (c. 428{{snd}} c. 347 BCE), using [[Socrates]] (c. 470{{snd}} 399 BCE) as the main character in his [[Plato#The dialogues|philosophical dialogues]], outlined the requirements for happiness in ''The Republic''.

In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato asserts that those who are moral are the only ones who may be truly happy. Thus, one must understand the [[cardinal virtues]], particularly justice. Through the thought experiment of the [[Ring of Gyges]], Plato comes to the conclusion that one who abuses power enslaves himself to his appetites, while the man who chooses not to remains rationally in control of himself, and therefore is happy.&lt;ref name="Pl-10.612b"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/12487162/Plato_Happiness_and_Justice Joshua Olsen, ''Plato, Happiness and Justice'']&lt;/ref&gt;

He also sees a type of happiness stemming from [[social justice]] through fulfilling one's social function; since this duty forms happiness, other typically seen sources of happiness{{snd}} such as leisure, wealth, and pleasure{{snd}} are deemed lesser, if not completely false, forms of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27743804 Richard D. Mohr, "A Platonic Happiness". ''History of Philosophy Quarterly,'' Vol. 4, No. 2 (Apr., 1987), pp. 131-145.University of Illinois.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
[[Aristotle]] (384 – 322 BCE) held that ''[[eudaimonia]]'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:εὐδαιμονία|εὐδαιμονία]]) is the goal of human thought and action. Eudaimonia is usually translated as [[happiness]], but "human flourishing" may be a more accurate translation.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel N. Robinson. (1999). Aristotle's Psychology. Published by Daniel N. Robinson. {{ISBN|0-9672066-0-X}} {{ISBN|978-0967206608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eudaimonia involves activity, exhibiting virtue (''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[wiktionary:ἀρετή|ἀρετή]]) in accordance with [[virtue]].

Within the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', Aristotle points to the fact that many aims are really only intermediate aims, and are desired only because they make the achievement of higher aims possible.&lt;ref&gt;Book I Chapter 1 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker+page%3D1094a 1094a].&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, things such as wealth, intelligence, and courage are valued only in relation to other things, while eudaimonia is the only thing valuable in isolation.

Aristotle regarded virtue as necessary for a person to be happy and held that without virtue the most that may be attained is contentment. Aristotle has been criticized for failing to show that virtue is necessary in the way he claims it to be, and he does not address this moral skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;Kraut, Richard, "Aristotle's Ethics", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/aristotle-ethics/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cynicism===
{{Main|Cynicism (philosophy)}}
[[File:Greek philosopher busts.jpg|thumb|The carved busts of [[Socrates]], [[Antisthenes]], [[Chrysippus]], and [[Epicurus]].]]

[[Antisthenes]] (c. 445 – c. 365 BCE), often regarded as the founder of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]], advocated an ascetic life lived in accordance with [[virtue]]. Xenophon testifies that Antisthenes had praised the joy that sprang "from out of one's soul,"&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, Symposium, iv. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Diogenes Laertius]] relates that Antisthenes was fond of saying: "I would rather go mad than feel pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', vi. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that virtue was sufficient in itself to ensure happiness, only needing the strength of a [[Socrates]].

He, along with all following Cynics, rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money, [[power (sociology)|power]], and [[celebrity|fame]], to lead entirely virtuous, and thus happy, [[personal life|lives]].&lt;ref name="cynic1"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/cynics.htm ''Cynics''] – ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, happiness can be gained through [[asceticism|rigorous training]] (askesis, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:ἄσκησις|ἄσκησις]]) and by living in a way which was natural for [[humans]], rejecting all conventional desires, preferring a [[simple living|simple life]] free from all possessions.

[[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 – c. 323 BCE) is most frequently seen as the perfect embodiment of the philosophy. The [[stoicism|Stoics]] themselves saw him as one of the few, if not only, who have had achieved the state of [[sophos (philosophy)|sage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/497576|title=The Stoic Sage|work=ancientworlds.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stoicism===
{{Main|Stoicism}}
{{rquote|right|''If you work at that which is before you, following right reason seriously, vigorously, calmly, without allowing anything else to distract you, but keeping your divine part pure, as if you were bound to give it back immediately; if you hold to this, expecting nothing, but satisfied to live now according to nature, speaking heroic truth in every word that you utter, you will live happy. And there is no man able to prevent this.''|[[Marcus Aurelius]], ''[[Meditations]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Aurelius]], ''[[Meditations]]''. iii.12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Stoicism]] was a school of philosophy established by [[Zeno of Citium]] (c. 334 – c. 262 BCE). While Zeno was [[syncretism|syncretic]] in thought, his primary influence were the Cynics, with [[Crates of Thebes]] (c. 365 – c. 285 BCE) as his mentor.

Stoics believe that "virtue is sufficient for [[happiness]]".&lt;ref name="Stoicism"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; One who has attained this sense of virtue would become a [[sage (philosophy)|sage]]. In the words of Epictetus, this sage would be "sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy,"&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics therefore spent their time trying to attain virtue. This would only be achieved if one was to dedicate their life studying [[Stoic logic]], [[Stoic physics]], and [[Stoicism#Ethics and virtues|Stoic ethics]].

===Cyrenaics===
{{Main|Cyrenaics}}
{{rquote|right|''As a consequence the [[sage (philosophy)|sage]], even if he has his troubles, will nonetheless be happy, even if few pleasures accrue to him.''|[[Diogenes Laertius]] on [[Anniceris]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', ii. 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes the Cynics: Sayings and Anecdotes with Other Popular Moralists, trans.

The [[Cyrenaics]] were a school of philosophy established by [[Aristippus of Cyrene]] (c. 435 – c. 356 BCE). The school asserted that the only good is positive pleasure, and pain is the only evil. They posit that all feeling is momentary so all past and future pleasure have no real existence for an individual, and that among present pleasures there is no distinction of kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1995|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudius Aelianus]], in his ''Historical Miscellany'',&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, Historical Miscellany 14.6&lt;/ref&gt; writes about Aristippus:

{{quote|"He recommended that one should concrete on the present day, and indeed on the very part of it in which one is acting and thinking. For only the present, he said, truly belongs to us, and not what has passed by or what we are anticipating: for the one is gone and done with, and it is uncertain whether the other will come to be"&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes the Cynics: Sayings and Anecdotes with Other Popular Moralists, trans. Robin Hard. Oxford University Press, 2012. Page 124.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some immediate pleasures can create more than their equivalent of pain. The wise person should be in control of pleasures rather than be enslaved to them, otherwise pain will result, and this requires judgement to evaluate the different pleasures of life.&lt;ref name="copleston122"&gt;{{Harvnb|Copleston|2003|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|right|''Of all the means which wisdom acquires to ensure happiness throughout the whole of life, by far the most important is friendship.''|Epicurus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurus.net/en/principal.html|title=Epicurus - Principal Doctrines|author=Vincent Cook|work=epicurus.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Epicureanism]] was founded by [[Epicurus]] (c. 341 – c. 270 BCE). The goal of his philosophy was to attain a state of [[ataraxia|tranquility]] (''ataraxia'', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:ἀταραξία|ἀταραξία]]) and freedom from fear, as well as [[aponia|absence of bodily pain]] (''aponia'', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary: ἀπονία|ἀπονία]]). Toward these ends, Epicurus recommended an [[asceticism|ascetic lifestyle]], noble friendship, and the avoidance of politics.

One aid to achieving happiness is the ''[[tetrapharmakos]]'' or the four-fold cure:

===School of the Sextii===
{{Main|School of the Sextii}}

The School of the Sextii was founded by [[Quintus Sextius the Elder]] ([[fl.]] 50 BCE). It characterized itself mainly as a philosophical-medical school, blending [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]], [[Platonism|Platonic]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]], and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] elements together.&lt;ref name='Paola'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricercafilosofica.it/epekeina/index.php/epekeina/article/view/74|title=Philosophical thought of the School of the Sextii - Di Paola - EPEKEINA.

[[St. Augustine of Hippo]] (354 – 430 AD)  was an early [[Christian theology|Christian theologian]] and [[philosopher]]&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Mendelson|first=Michael|title=Saint Augustine|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/augustine/|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  whose writings influenced the development of [[Western Christianity]] and [[Western philosophy]].

For St. Augustine, all human actions revolve around [[love]], and the primary problem humans face is the misplacing of love.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ethics-everyone/201106/achieving-hapGenesis creation narrativepiness-advice-augustine&lt;/ref&gt; Only in [[God]] can one find happiness, as He is source of happiness.

J. O'Connell, "The Enneads and St. Augustine's Image of Happiness."

St. Augustine deals with the concept of happiness directly in his treatises ''De beata vita'' and ''Contra Academicos''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Boethius===

[[Boethius]] (c. 480–524 AD) was a [[philosopher]], most famous for writing ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]]''. The work has been described as having had the single most important influence on the [[Christianity]] [[History of Christianity during the Middle Ages|of the Middle Ages and]] early [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]] and as the last great work of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical Period]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to ''The Consolation of Philosophy'', Oxford World's Classics, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dante Divine"&gt;[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] identified Boethius as the "last of the Romans and first of the Scholastics" among the doctors in his Paradise (see ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' and also below).&lt;/ref&gt; The book describes many themes, but among them he discusses how happiness can be attainable despite changing [[Luck|fortune]], while considering the nature of happiness and God.

He posits that happiness is acquired by attaining the perfect good, and that perfect good is God.&lt;ref name="catholic.com"/&gt; He then concludes that as God ruled the universe through Love, prayer to God and the application of Love would lead to true happiness.&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;Sanderson Beck (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Modern==

=== Michel de Montaigne ===
[[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533-1592) was a [[French philosophy|French philosopher]]. Influenced by [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Christianity]], alongside the conviction of the separation of public and private spheres of life, Montaigne writes that happiness is a subjective state of mind and that satisfaction differs from person to person.&lt;ref name="utm.edu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/montaign/|title=Montaigne, Michel de - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|work=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues by acknowledging that one must be allowed a private sphere of life to realize those particular attempts of happiness without the interference of society.&lt;ref name="utm.edu1"/&gt;

===Jeremy Bentham===
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
[[Jeremy Bentham]] (1748-1832) was a British [[philosopher]], [[jurist]], and [[social reformer]]. He is regarded as the founder of modern [[utilitarianism]].

His particular brand of utilitarianism indicated that the most moral action is that which causes the highest amount of utility, where defined utility as the aggregate pleasure after deducting suffering of all involved in any action. Happiness, therefore, is the experience of pleasure and the lack of pain.&lt;ref name="utm.edu2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/bentham/|title=Bentham, Jeremy - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|work=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actions which do not promote the greatest happiness is morally wrong - such as ascetic sacrifice.&lt;ref name="utm.edu2"/&gt; This manner of thinking permits the possibility of [[Felicific calculus|a calculator to measure happiness and moral value]].

===Arthur Schopenhauer===
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788-1860) was a [[Germans|German]] [[philosopher]]. His philosophy express that egotistical acts are those that are guided by self-interest, desire for pleasure or happiness, whereas only [[compassion]] can be a moral act.

Schopenhauer explains happiness in terms of a wish that is satisfied, which in turn gives rise to a new wish. And the absence of satisfaction is suffering, which results in an empty longing. He also links happiness with the movement of time, as we feel happy when time moves faster and feel sad when time slows down.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Idea. Cologne 1997, Volume One, §52th.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary==

===Władysław Tatarkiewicz===
[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] (1886-1980) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]], historian of [[philosophy]], historian of [[art]], [[estethician|esthetician]], and [[ethics|ethicist]].&lt;ref&gt;"Władysław Tatarkiewicz," ''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;686.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Tatarkiewicz, happiness is a fundamental ethical category.

===Herbert Marcuse===
[[Herbert Marcuse]] (1898–1979) was a German-American [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[sociology|sociologist]], and [[political philosophy|political theorist]], associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory]].

In his 1937 essay 'The Affirmative Character of Culture,' he suggests culture develops tension within the structure of society, and in that tension can challenge the current social order. If it separates itself from the everyday world, the demand for happiness will cease to be external, and begin to become an object of spiritual contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marcuse/|title=Herbert Marcuse|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'', his criticism of consumerism suggests that the current system is one that claims to be [[democracy|democratic]], but is [[authoritarian]] in character, as only a few individuals dictate the perceptions of freedom by only allowing certain choices of happiness to be available for purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Marcuse | first1 = Herbert | title = One-dimensional Man: studies in ideology of advanced industrial society | chapter = Introduction to the Second Edition | publisher = Routledge | year = 1991 | location = London | pages = 3 | isbn = 978-0-415-07429-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further suggests that the conception that 'happiness can be bought' is one that is psychologically damaging.

[[Robert Nozick]] (1938-2002) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nozick/ |title=Nozick, Robert |work=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |first=Edward |last=Feser |date=4 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1974 book, ''[[Anarchy, State, Utopia]]'', he proposed a thought experiment where one is given the option to enter a machine that would give the maximum amount of unending hedonistic pleasure for the entirety of one's life.

[[Scientism]] is the approach that the [[empirical sciences]] are the most valuable branches of learning and culture.

===Happiness economics===
[[Happiness economics]] is the quantitative and  theoretical study of [[happiness]], positive and negative [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], [[well-being]], [[quality of life]], [[life satisfaction]] and related concepts, typically combining [[economics]] with other fields such as [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. The tracking of [[Gross National Happiness]] or the [[Satisfaction with Life Index|satisfaction of life]] grow increasingly popular as the economics of happiness challenges traditional economic aims.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Layard]], 2006.

[[Richard Layard]] has been very influential in this area.

In [[ethics]] and other branches of [[philosophy]], [[suicide]] poses difficult questions, answered differently by various philosophers. The French essayist, novelist, and playwright [[Albert Camus]] (1913–1960) began his philosophical essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' with the famous line "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide" ({{lang-fr|Il n'y a qu'un problème philosophique vraiment sérieux : c'est le suicide}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Camus |first=Albert |translator-last=O'Brien |translator-first=Justin |date=1942 |title=The Myth of Sisyphus |url= |location= |publisher=Penguin Group |page= |isbn=978-0-141-18200-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor of suicide==
There are arguments in favor of allowing an individual to choose between life and suicide. Those in favor of suicide as a personal choice reject the thought that suicide is always or usually irrational, but is instead a solution to real problems; a line of last resort that can legitimately be taken when the alternative is considered worse. They believe that no being should be made to suffer unnecessarily, and suicide provides an escape from suffering.

===Idealism===
{{See also|Idealism}}
[[Herodotus]] wrote: "When life is so burdensome, death has become for man a sought-after refuge". Schopenhauer affirmed: "They tell us that suicide is the greatest act of cowardice... that suicide is wrong; when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in the world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person."

Schopenhauer's main work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', occasionally uses the act in its examples. He denied that suicide was immoral and saw it as one's right to take one's life. In an allegory, he compared ending one's life, when subject to great suffering, to waking up from sleep when experiencing a terrible nightmare. However, most suicides were seen as an act of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]], as it takes place when one denies life's pains, and is thus different from ascetic renunciation of the will, which denies life's pleasures.

According to Schopenhauer, moral freedom—the highest ethical aim—is to be obtained only by a denial of the will to live. Far from being a denial, suicide is an emphatic assertion of this will. For it is in fleeing from the pleasures, not from the sufferings of life, that this denial consists. When a man destroys his existence as an individual, he is not by any means destroying his will to live. On the contrary, he would like to live if he could do so with satisfaction to himself; if he could assert his will against the power of circumstance; but circumstance is too strong for him.

===Liberalism=== &lt;!--should this be Libertarianism?--&gt;
[[Liberalism]] asserts that a person's life belongs only to them, and no other person has the right to force their own ideals that life must be lived. Rather, only the individual involved can make such a decision, and whatever decision they make should be respected.

Philosopher and psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] goes further, arguing that suicide is the most basic right of all. If freedom is [[self-ownership]]—ownership over one's own life and body—then the right to end that life is the most basic of all. If others can force you to live, you do not own yourself and belong to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Suicide as a Moral Issue|author=Thomas Szasz|url=http://www.szasz.com/iol2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Améry]], in his book ''On Suicide: a Discourse on Voluntary Death'' (originally published in German in 1976), provides a moving insight into the suicidal mind. He argues forcefully and almost romantically that suicide represents the ultimate freedom of humanity, justifying the act with phrases such as "we only arrive at ourselves in a freely chosen death" and lamenting "ridiculously everyday life and its alienation". {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Améry killed himself in 1978.

Philosophical thinking in the 19th and 20th century has led, in some cases, beyond thinking in terms of pro-choice, to the point that suicide is no longer a last resort, or even something that one must justify, but something that one must justify {{em|not}} doing. Many forms of [[Existentialism|existentialist]] thinking essentially begin with the premise that life is objectively meaningless, and proceed to the question of why one should not just kill oneself; they then answer this question by suggesting that the individual has the power to give personal meaning to life.

===Stoicism===
Although [[George Lyman Kittredge]] states that "the Stoics held that suicide is cowardly and wrong," the most famous [[Stoicism|stoics]]—[[Seneca the Younger]], [[Epictetus]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]]—maintain that death by one's own hand is always an option and frequently more honorable than a life of protracted misery.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Suicide and Brutus' Philosophy in Julius Caesar|author=Mark Sacharoff|publisher=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=33|number=1|date=Jan–Mar 1972|pages=115–122|jstor=2709060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics accepted that [[suicide]] was permissible for the wise person in circumstances that might prevent them from living a virtuous life.&lt;ref name="marietta153"&gt;Don E. Marietta, (1998), ''Introduction to ancient philosophy'', pages 153–4. Sharpe&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] held that accepting life under tyranny would have compromised [[Cato the Younger|Cato]]'s self-consistency ({{lang-la|constantia}}) as a Stoic and impaired his freedom to make the honorable moral choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cato's suicide in Plutarch AV Zadorojnyi|publisher=The Classical Quarterly|year=2007|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0009838807000195|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide could be justified if one fell victim to severe pain or disease,&lt;ref name="marietta153"/&gt; but otherwise suicide would usually be seen as a rejection of one's social duty.&lt;ref name="irvine200"&gt;William Braxton Irvine, (2009), ''A guide to the good life: the ancient art of Stoic joy'', page 200. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confucianism===
{{see also|Suicide in China}}
[[Confucianism]] holds that failure to follow certain values is worse than death; hence, suicide can be morally permissible, and even praiseworthy, if it is done for the sake of those values. The Confucian emphasis on loyalty, self-sacrifice, and honour has tended to encourage [[altruistic suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Stress and Suicide in Japan|journal=Transcultural Psychiatric Research Review|author1=Iga, Mamoura|author2=KS Adam (abstract)|publisher=Transcultural Psychiatry|year=1980|url=http://tps.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/17/4/243.pdf|volume=17|issue=4|pages=243–244|doi=10.1177/136346158001700405}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confucius]] wrote, "For gentlemen of purpose and men of [[Ren (Confucianism)|ren]] while it is inconceivable that they should seek to stay alive at the expense of ren, it may happen that they have to accept death in order to have ren accomplished."&lt;ref&gt;Analects, trans. D.C. Lau, second edition, (Hong Kong: Chinese University Press, 1992), XV:9D&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mencius]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Mencius, trans. D.C. Lau, (Hong Kong: Chinese University Press, 1984), VI A:10&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Fish is what I want; bear's palm is also what I want. If I cannot have both, I would rather take bear's palm than fish. Life is what I want; [[Yi (Confucianism)|yi]] is also what I want. If I cannot have both, I would rather take yi than life. On the one hand, though life is what I want, there is something I want more than life. That is why I do not cling to life at all cost. On the other hand, though death is what I loathe, there is something I loathe more than death. That is why there are dangers I do not avoid ... Yet there are ways of remaining alive and ways of avoiding death to which a person will not resort. In other words, there are things a person wants more than life and there are also things he or she loathes more than death.}}

==Arguments against suicide==
Common philosophical opinion of suicide since modernization reflected a spread in cultural beliefs of western societies that suicide is immoral and unethical. One popular argument is that many of the reasons for committing [[suicide]]—such as [[Clinical depression|depression]], emotional pain, or economic hardship—are transitory and can be ameliorated by therapy and through making changes to some aspects of one's life. A common [[adage]] in the discourse surrounding [[suicide prevention]] sums up this view: "Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem." However, the argument against this is that while emotional pain may seem transitory to most people, and in many cases it is, in other cases it may be extremely difficult or even impossible to resolve, even through counseling or lifestyle change, depending upon the severity of the affliction and the person's ability to cope with their pain. Examples of this are incurable disease or lifelong mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, Craig. Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia. Ashgate, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absurdism===
The [[French Algeria]]n absurdist philosopher [[Albert Camus]] saw the goal of [[absurdism]] in establishing whether suicide is a necessary response to a world which appears to be mute both on the question of God's existence (and thus what such an existence might answer) and for our search for meaning and purpose in the world. For Camus, suicide was the rejection of freedom. He thinks that fleeing from the absurdity of reality into [[illusion]]s, [[religion]], or [[death]] is not the way out. Instead of fleeing the [[Albert Camus#Camus' ideas on the Absurd|absurd]] meaninglessness of life, we should embrace life passionately.

Existentialist [[Sartre]] describes the position of Meursault, the protagonist of Camus' ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' who is condemned to death, in the following way:

{{Quote|"The absurd man will not commit suicide; he wants to live, without relinquishing any of his certainty, without a future, without hope, without illusions ... and without resignation either. He stares at death with passionate attention and this fascination liberates him. He experiences the "divine irresponsibility" of the condemned man."&lt;ref&gt;Sartre analysis of Mersault, in Literary and Philosophical Essays, 1943&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Christian-inspired philosophy===
{{See also|Christian philosophy}}
[[G. K. Chesterton]] calls suicide "the ultimate and absolute evil, the refusal to take an interest in existence". He argues that a person who kills himself, as far as he is concerned, destroys the entire world (apparently exactly repeating [[Maimonides]]' view).

===Liberalism===
[[John Stuart Mill]] argued, in his influential essay "[[On Liberty]]", that since the {{lang|la|[[sine qua non]]}} of liberty is the power of the individual to make choices, any choice that one might make that would deprive one of the ability to make further choices should be prevented. &lt;!-- As it stands, that assertion is worthless, since {{em|every}} choice one makes deprives one of {{em|some}} further choices; perhaps the writer means to say "all further choices", as is consistent with the next sentence. --&gt;Thus, for Mill, selling oneself into [[slavery]] should be prevented in order to avoid precluding the ability to make further choices. Concerning these matters, Mill writes in "On Liberty"

{{Quote|Not only persons are not held to engagements which violate the rights of third parties, but it is sometimes considered a sufficient reason for releasing them from an engagement, that it is injurious to themselves. In this and most other civilized countries, for example, an engagement by which a person should sell himself, or allow himself to be sold, as a slave, would be null and void; neither enforced by law nor by opinion. The ground for thus limiting his power of voluntarily disposing of his own lot in life, is apparent, and is very clearly seen in this extreme case. The reason for not interfering, unless for the sake of others, with a person's voluntary acts, is consideration for his liberty. His voluntary choice is evidence that what he so chooses is desirable, or at the least endurable, to him, and his good is on the whole best provided for by allowing him to take his own means of pursuing it. But by selling himself for a slave, he abdicates his liberty; he forgoes any future use of it, beyond that single act. He therefore defeats, in his own case, the very purpose which is the justification of allowing him to dispose of himself. He is no longer free; but is thenceforth in a position which has no longer the presumption in its favour, that would be afforded by his voluntarily remaining in it. The principle of freedom cannot require that he should be free not to be free. It is not freedom, to be allowed to alienate his freedom.}}

It could be argued that suicide prevents further choices in the same way slavery does. However, it can also be argued that there are significant differences in not having any further involvement in decisions about your life and not having any further life to make decisions about. Suicide essentially removes the condition of being alive, not the condition of making choices about your life. 

Mill believes the individual to be the best guardian of their own interests. He uses the example of a man about to cross a broken bridge: we can forcibly stop that person and warn him of the danger, but ultimately should not prevent him from crossing the bridge—for only ''he'' knows the worth of his life balanced against the danger of crossing the bridge.

Too much should not be read into "disposing of his own lot in life" in the passage as this is not necessarily talking about anything other than slavery. Indeed, it would be odd if Mill had intended it to be about suicide but not explored the issue fully.

===Deontology===
From a [[deontological]] perspective, [[Immanuel Kant]] argues against suicide in ''Fundamental Principles of The Metaphysic of Morals''. In accordance with the second formulation of his [[categorical imperative]], Kant argues that, "He who contemplates suicide should ask himself whether his action can be consistent with the idea of humanity as an end in itself." Kant's theory looks at the act only, and not at its outcomes and consequences, and claims that one is ethically required to consider whether one would be willing to ''universalise'' the act: to claim ''everyone'' should behave that way. Kant argues that choosing to commit suicide entails considering oneself as a means to an end, which he rejects: a person, he says, must ''not'' be used "merely as means, but must in all actions always be considered as an end in himself." Therefore, it is unethical to commit suicide to satisfy oneself.

===Social contract===
The [[social contract]], according to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], is such that every man has "a right to risk his own life in order to preserve it."

[[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]] reject the right of individuals to take their own life. Hobbes claims in his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' that natural law forbids every man "to do, that which is destructive of his life, or take away the means of preserving the same." Breaking this natural law is irrational and immoral. Hobbes also states that it is intuitively rational for men to want felicity and to fear death most.

==Neutral and situational stances==
===Honor===
Japan has a form of suicide called [[seppuku]], which is considered an honorable way to redeem oneself for transgressions or personal defeats. It was widely accepted in the days of the Samurai and even before that. It was generally seen as a privilege granted only to the samurai class; civilian criminals would thus not have this 'honor' and be executed. This reflects a view of suicide as brave and correct rather than cowardly and wrong.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Utilitarianism===
[[Utilitarianism]] can be used as a justification for, or an argument against, suicide. Though the death of a depressed person ends their suffering, the person's family and friends may grieve.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Other arguments===
[[David Hume]] left an essay on suicide to be published after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/suicide.htm|title=''Essays on Suicide and the Immortality of the Soul: The Complete 1783 Edition''|accessdate=2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of it is concerned with the claim that suicide is an affront to God. Hume argues that suicide is no more a rebellion against God than is saving the life of someone who would otherwise die, or changing the position of anything in one's surroundings. He spends much less time dismissing arguments that it is an affront to one's duty to others or to oneself. Hume claims that suicide can be compared to retiring from society and becoming a total recluse, which is not normally considered to be immoral, although the comparison would not seem to justify a suicide that leaves in its wake children or dependents who are thereby rendered vulnerable. As for duty to self, Hume takes it to be obvious that there can be times when suicide is desirable, though he also thinks it ridiculous that anyone would consider suicide unless they first considered every other option.&lt;!-- I am not sure that my edit has captured the gist of Hume's position; an editor familiar with H.'s essay will need to review this. --&gt;

Those who support the [[right to die]] argue that suicide is acceptable under certain circumstances, such as incurable disease and old age. The idea is that although life is, in general, good, people who face irreversible suffering should not be forced to continue suffering.

[[Leonard Peikoff]] states in his book ''[[Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]]'':

{{Quote|Suicide is justified when man's life, owing to circumstances outside of a person's control, is no longer possible; an example might be a person with a painful terminal illness, or a prisoner in a concentration camp who sees no chance of escape. In cases such as these, suicide is not necessarily a philosophic rejection of life or of reality. On the contrary, it may very well be their tragic reaffirmation. Self-destruction in such contexts may amount to the tortured cry: "Man's life means so much to me that I will not settle for anything less. I will not accept a living death as a substitute."}}

Bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] has criticized "arbitrary" ethical systems that allow patients to refuse care when they are physically ill, while denying the mentally ill the right to suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Appel, JM. A Suicide Right for the Mentally Ill? A Swiss Case Opens a New Debate, The Hastings Center Report. 2007;37(3):21–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wesley J. Smith]], Death on Demand: The assisted-suicide movement sheds its fig leaf, ''The Weekly Standard'', June 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polyworld''' is a cross-platform ([[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]]) program written by [[Larry Yaeger]] to evolve [[Artificial Intelligence]] through [[natural selection]] and [[evolutionary algorithm]]s. 

It uses the [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] graphics toolkit and [[OpenGL]] to display a graphical environment in which a population of trapezoid agents search for food, mate, have offspring, and prey on each other. The population is typically only in the hundreds, as each individual is rather complex and the environment consumes considerable computer resources. The graphical environment is necessary since the individuals actually move around the 2-D [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] and must be able to "see." Since some basic abilities, like eating carcasses or randomly generated food, seeing other individuals, mating or fighting with them, etc., are possible, a number of interesting behaviours have been observed to spontaneously arise after prolonged evolution, such as cannibalism, predators and prey, and mimicry.

Each individual makes decisions based on a [[neural net]] using [[Hebbian learning]]; the neural net is derived from each individual's genome. The genome does not merely specify the wiring of the neural nets, but also determines their size, speed, color, [[mutation rate]] and a number of other factors. The [[genome]] is randomly mutated at a set probability, which are also changed in descendant organisms.

In an interview Aalto described her music.&lt;ref name=Rojas/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I call my music Epic Love Pop! I love dramatic and emotional music with a show feeling. I also want to bring love, joy and encouragement for everybody; be yourself and inspire others!

(...) I’ve performed in musicals and big shows in Finland. (...) I’m happy to be versatile performer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aalto auditioned for the [[The X Factor (UK series 13)|thirteenth UK series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in 2016, singing a cover of [[Sia Furler|Sia]]'s "[[Chandelier (song)|Chandelier]]", which earned her three yeses from the attending judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiwibloggs.com/2016/08/28/finlands-saara-aalto-nails-x-factor-uk-audition/149412/|title="That's How You Do It!" Finland's Saara Aalto Nails X Factor UK Audition|date=29 August 2016|publisher=Wiwibloggs|website=wiwibloggs.com|last=Rahn|first=Florian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the bootcamp, she performed "[[On the Radio (Donna Summer song)|On the Radio]]" by [[Donna Summer]] and was sent through as part of the over-25s category with [[Sharon Osbourne]] as her mentor. At the six-chair challenge, she performed "[[I See Fire]]" by [[Ed Sheeran]] and was sent home by Osbourne who stated a lack of connection. However, after the crowd chanted to bring her back, Aalto was given a chance to perform [[Serge Lama]]'s "[[Je suis malade (song)|Je suis malade]]", which caused the crowd to turn on her, while [[Nicole Scherzinger]] criticized her song choice, stating "we ain't in France". Osbourne then asked Aalto to leave. 

Aalto was brought back as Scherzinger's wildcard pick for the over-25s category and therefore went to judges' houses. She was chosen to proceed to the live shows after performing [[ABBA]]'s "[[The Winner Takes It All]]". In week 1 of the live shows, Aalto finished in the bottom three after performing "[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]" and faced a sing-off against the duo Bratavio, where she performed "[[Alive (Sia song)|Alive]]" by Sia. Aalto was saved with only [[Louis Walsh]] voting to eliminate her, though praising her performance. The following week, she sang "[[River Deep – Mountain High]]" and finished again in the bottom three, performing "[[Run (Snow Patrol song)|Run]]" by [[Snow Patrol]] in a sing-off against Freddy Parker. The result went to deadlock and Aalto was saved as she had the greater public vote. In week 3 she performed "[[It's Oh So Quiet]]" coming 2nd in the public vote, and in week 4 Aalto sang "[[Bad Romance]]", placing 3rd in the public vote. In week 5, Aalto finished in the bottom three for the third time after her rendition of "[[Sound of the Underground (song)|Sound of the Underground]]", but was saved by majority vote after performing "[[Who You Are (Jessie J song)|Who You Are]]" in a sing-off against the group Four of Diamonds. Her following performances were "[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)]]" in week 6 placing 2nd and "[[My Heart Will Go On]]" in week 7 again placing 2nd. In week 8, she sang "The Winner Takes It All" and a medley of "[[Diamonds Are Forever (soundtrack)|Diamonds Are Forever]]" and "[[Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend]]", topping the public vote for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voting stats 2016 revealed |url=http://www.itv.com/xfactor/news/voting-stats-2016|website=[[Itv.com|ITV]]|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the eliminations of Relley C in week 3 and Honey G in week 8, Aalto became Osbourne's last remaining act in the competition.

In the semifinals on 3 December, she sang a medley of "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]" and "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]", and "Chandelier" as 2nd song, topping the vote again reaching the Final 3, where on 10 December she performed "[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]" and "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", the latter as a duet with [[Adam Lambert]], again topping the public vote. With the elimination of the group [[5 After Midnight]] she was in the Final 2 facing [[Matt Terry]]. In the Final on 11 December, she performed "It's Oh So Quiet" and "[[I Didn't Know My Own Strength (Whitney Houston song)|I Didn't Know My Own Strength]]". In the ensuing public vote, she placed as the runner-up to eventual winner Matt Terry with 40.4% of the votes.

'''(b)''' The reproduction probability peaks early in life at sexual maturity and then steadily decreases as an individual ages, with the remaining share of the population decreasing with age as they enter the selection shadow.]]
The '''selection shadow''' is a concept involved with the [[Senescence#Evolutionary theories|evolutionary theories of ageing]] that states that [[selection pressures]] on an individual decrease as an individual ages and passes [[sexual maturity]], resulting in a "shadow" of time where [[selective fitness]] is not considered. Over generations, this results in maladaptive mutations that accumulate later in life due to aging being non-adaptive toward reproductive fitness.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; The concept was first worked out by [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Peter Medawar]] in the 1940s, with Medawar creating the first [[graphical model]].&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/the-evolution-of-aging-23651151 |title=The Evolution of Aging |last1=Fabian |first1=Daniel |last2=Flatt |first2=Thomas |date=2011 |website=[[Scitable]] |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model==
The model developed by Medawar states that due to the dangerous conditions and pressures from the environment, including predators and diseases, most individuals in the wild die not long after sexual maturity. Therefore, there is a low probability for individuals to survive to an advanced age and suffer the effects related to [[aging]]. In conjunction with this, the effects of natural selection decrease as age increases, so that later individual performance is ignored by selection forces.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; This results in beneficial [[mutations]] not being selected for if they only have a positive result later in life, along with later in life deleterious mutations not being selected against. Due to the fitness of an individual not being affected once it is past its reproductive prime, later mutations and effects are considered to be in the "shadow" of selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flatt |first=Thomas |last2=Schmidt |first2=Paul S. |date=July 18, 2009 |title=Integrating evolutionary and molecular genetics of aging |url=http://i122server.vu-wien.ac.at/pop/Flatt_website/FlattSchmidt09.pdf |journal=[[Biochimica et Biophysica Acta]] |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=1790 |issue=10 |pages=951–962 |doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.07.010 |accessdate=May 20, 2014|pmc=2972575 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept would later be adapted into Medawar's 1952 [[Evolution of ageing#Mutation accumulation|mutation accumulation hypothesis]], which was itself expanded upon by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in his 1957 [[antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;

A classical requirement and [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]] of the model is that the number of individuals within a population that live to reach [[senescence]] must be small in number. If this is not true for a population, then the effects of old age will not be under a selection shadow and instead affect adaptation and evolution of the population as a whole. At the same time, however, this requirement has been challenged by increasing evidence of senescence being more common in wild populations than previously expected, especially among birds and mammals, while the effects of the selection shadow remain present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turbill |first=Christopher |last2=Ruf |first2=Thomas |date=August 6, 2010 |title=Senescence Is More Important in the Natural Lives of Long- Than Short-Lived Mammals |journal=[[PLOS ONE]] |publisher=[[Public Library of Science]] |volume=5 |issue=8 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0012019 |pmid=20700508 |pmc=2917356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some scientists, however, have criticized the idea of aging being non-adaptive, instead adopting the theory of "[[Death by Design]]". This theory follows the work of [[August Weismann]], which states that aging specifically evolved as an [[adaptation]], and disagrees with Medawar's model as a perceived oversimplification of the impact older organisms have on evolution. It is also claimed that older organisms have a higher reproductive capacity due to being better fit in order to reach their age, rather than their capacity being equal as in Medawar's calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lachowicz |first=Miroslaw |last2=Miękisz |first2=Jacek |date=April 20, 2009 |title=From Genetics to Mathematics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m7n18NlBYSoC&amp;dq |location=[[Singapore]] |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |page=39 |isbn=9812837256 |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sugarscape''' is a model for [[Artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] [[Agent-based model|agent-based]] [[social simulation]] following some or all rules presented by [[Joshua M. Epstein]] &amp; [[Robert Axtell]] in their book ''Growing Artificial Societies''.&lt;ref name="GAS"&gt;{{cite book

|date=October 11, 1996
|pages=224
|isbn=978-0-262-55025-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Fundaments of Sugarscape models can be traced back to the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] where economist [[Thomas Schelling]] presented his paper titled ''[[Thomas Schelling#Models of segregation|Models of Segregation]]''.&lt;ref name="Sourceforge1"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://sugarscape.sourceforge.net/ |title=Sugarscape - Growing Agent-based Artificial Societies |publisher=[[Sourceforge]] |accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in 1969, Schelling and the rest of the [[social environment]] modelling fraternity had their options limited by a lack of adequate computing power and an applicable programming mechanism to fully develop the potential of their model.

[[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]'s agent-based simulation "[[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]" was enhanced and applied to Schelling's original idea by [[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] in their book ''Growing Artificial Societies''. To demonstrate their findings on the field of agent-based simulation, a model was created and distributed with their book on CD-ROM. The concept of this model has come to be known as "the Sugarscape model".&lt;ref name="GAS" /&gt; Since then, the name "Sugarscape" has been used for agent-based models using rules similar to those defined by Epstein &amp; Axtell.

==Principles==
All Sugarscape models include the [[Intelligent agent|agents]] (inhabitants), the environment (a two-dimensional grid) and the rules governing the interaction of the agents with each other and the environment.

The original model presented by J. Epstein &amp; R. Axtell (considered as the [[Social simulation#History and development|first large scale agent model]]) is based on a 51x51 cell grid, where every cell can contain different amounts of sugar (or spice). In every step agents look around, find the closest cell filled with sugar, move and metabolize. They can leave pollution, die, reproduce, inherit sources, transfer information, trade or borrow sugar, generate immunity or transmit diseases - depending on the specific scenario and variables defined at the set-up of the model.

Sugar in simulation could be seen as a metaphor for resources in an artificial world through which the examiner can study the effects of social dynamics such as evolution, marital status and inheritance on populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|issn=1535-0096
}}(Retrieved from [[ProQuest|ABI/Inform]] Document ID: 347271391)&lt;/ref&gt;

Exact simulation of the original rules provided by J. Epstein &amp; R. Axtell in their book can be problematic&lt;ref name="tricky"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/research/replicating-sugarscape
|title=Replicating Sugarscape — University of Leicester
|accessdate=18 January 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not always possible to recreate the same results as those presented in ''Growing Artificial Societies''.

==Model implementations==
The Sugarscape model has had several implementations, some of which are available as [[Open-source software|open source]] software.

===Ascape===
An original implementation was developed in [[Ascape]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] software suitable for [[agent-based social simulation]]. The Sugarscape model remains part of the built-in library of models distributed with Ascape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ascape.sourceforge.net/manual/Section1.html
|title=The Ascape Model Developer’s Manual
|publisher=[[Sourceforge]]
|accessdate=9 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NetLogo===
[[NetLogo]] has been used to build Sugarscape models. Three Sugarscape scenarios are included in the NetLogo Models Library: "Immediate Growback", "Constant Growback" and "Wealth Distribution". Besides these three scenarios lies Iain Weaver's Sugarscape NetLogo model, which is part of the User Community Models Library. "It builds on Owen Densmore's NetLogo community model to encompass all rules discussed in ''Growing Artificial Societies'' with the exception of the combat rule (although trivial to include, it adds little value to the model)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/Sugarscape
|title=NetLogo User Community Models: Sugarscape
|accessdate=9 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is equipped with rich documentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/research/the-sugarscape
|title=The Sugarscape 
|publisher=[[University of Leicester]]
|accessdate=19 January 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; including instructions for successful replication of the original Sugarscape rules.&lt;ref name="tricky"/&gt;

===SugarScape on steroids===

Due to the emergent nature of [[agent-based model]]s (ABMs), it is critical that the population sizes in the simulations match the population sizes of the dynamic systems being modelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Gilbert
|first1=Nigel
|last2=Bankes
|first2=Steven
|year=2002
|title=Platforms and Methods for Agent-Based Modelling

|volume=99
|issue=3
|pages=7197–7198
|doi=10.1073/pnas.072079499 |pmc=128584
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the performance of contemporary agent simulation frameworks has been inadequate to handle such large population sizes and parallel computing frameworks designed to run on [[computing cluster]]s has been limited by available bandwidth. As computing power increases with [[Moore's law]], the size and complexity of simulation frameworks can be expected to increase. The team of R. M. D’Souza, M. Lysenko and K Rahmani from [[Michigan Technological University]] used a Sugarscape model to demonstrate the power of [[Graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) in ABM simulations with over 50 updates per second with agent populations exceeding 2 millions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''tree of life''' or '''universal tree of life''' is a [[metaphor]], model and research tool used to explore the evolution of life and describe the relationships between organisms, both living and extinct, as described in a famous passage in [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mindell|first1=D.

Tree diagrams originated in the [[Middle Ages|medieval era]] to represent [[family tree|genealogical relationships]].

[[Phylogenetic tree]] diagrams in the evolutionary sense date back to at least the early 19th century.

The term [[phylogeny]] for the evolutionary relationships of species through time was coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]], who  went further than [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] in proposing [[Phylogenetics|phylogenic]] histories of life. In contemporary usage, ''tree of life'' refers to the compilation of comprehensive phylogenetic databases rooted at the [[last universal common ancestor]] of life on Earth. The [[Open Tree of Life]], first published 2015, is a project to compile such a database for free public access.

==Early phylogenetic trees==
[[File:Edward Hitchcock Paleontological Chart.jpg|left|thumb|Fold-out paleontological chart of Edward Hitchcock in 'Elementary Geology' (1840)]]
{{evolutionary biology}}
Although the mutability of species may have appeared in paintings&lt;ref&gt;Fausto Barbagli (2009) 'In Retrospect: The earliest picture of evolution?', ''Nature'' 19 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and trees have been used as a metaphor for other purposes ([[Arbor porphyriana|Porphyrian tree]]) earlier than 1800, the combination of the concept of branching evolution and the tree image did not appear before 1800. The earliest tree of life was published by the French botanist [[Augustin Augier]] in 1801. It shows the relationships between members of the plant kingdom.

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (1744–1829) produced the first branching tree of animals in his ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'' (1809). It was an upside-down tree starting with worms and ending with mammals. However, Lamarck did not believe in common descent of all life. Instead, he believed that life consists of separate parallel lines advancing from simple to complex.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Bowler (2003) 'Evolution. The History of an Idea', third edition, p.90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American geologist [[Edward Hitchcock]] (1793–1864) published in 1840 the first tree of life based on paleontology in his ''Elementary Geology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Archibald | first1 = J. David | year = 2009 | title = Edward Hitchcock's Pre-Darwinian (1840) 'Tree of Life'. | doi=10.1007/s10739-008-9163-y | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 561–592 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.688.7842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the vertical axis are paleontological periods. Hitchcock made a separate tree for plants (left) and animals (right). The plant and the animal tree are not connected at the bottom of the chart. Furthermore, each tree starts with multiple origins. Hitchcock's tree was more realistic than Darwin's 1859 theoretical tree (see below) because Hitchcock used real names in his trees. It is also true that Hitchcock's trees were branching trees. However, they were not ''evolutionary'' trees, because Hitchcock believed that a deity was the agent of change. That was an important difference with Darwin.

The first edition of [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]]' ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', which was published anonymously in 1844 in England, contained [[:File:Vestiges dev diag.svg|a tree-like diagram]] (p.&amp;nbsp;212) in the chapter "Hypothesis of the development of the vegetable and animal kingdoms". It shows a model of embryological development where fish (F), reptiles (R), and birds (B) represent branches from a path leading to mammals (M). In the text this branching tree idea is tentatively applied to the history of life on earth: "there may be branching" (p.&amp;nbsp;191), but the branching diagram is not displayed again specifically for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;See for [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 online edition of ''Vestiges''].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the image of a branching tree could easily have inspired others to use it explicitly as a representation of the history of life on earth.

In 1858, a year before Darwin's ''Origin'', the paleontologist [[Heinrich Georg Bronn]] (1800–1862) published a hypothetical tree labeled with letters. Although not a creationist, Bronn did not propose a mechanism of change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Archibald | first1 = J. David | year = 2009 | title = Edward Hitchcock's Pre-Darwinian (1840) 'Tree of Life'. | doi=10.1007/s10739-008-9163-y | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 42 | issue = 3| page = 568 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.688.7842 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882) used the concept of a tree of life in the context of his theory of evolution. In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859) Chapter IV he presented an abstract diagram of a theoretical tree of life for species of an unnamed large [[genus]] (see figure). On the horizontal base line hypothetical species within this genus are labelled A – L and are spaced irregularly to indicate how distinct they are from each other, and are above broken lines at various angles suggesting that they have diverged from one or more common ancestors. On the vertical axis divisions labelled I – XIV each represent a thousand generations. From A, diverging lines show branching descent producing new varieties, some of which become extinct, so that after ten thousand generations descendants of A have become distinct new varieties or even sub-species a&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, f&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, and m&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly, the descendants of I have diversified to become the new varieties w&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; and z&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. The process is extrapolated for a further four thousand generations so that the descendants of A and I become fourteen new species labelled a&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; to z&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;. While F has continued for fourteen thousand generations relatively unchanged, species B,C,D,E,G,H,K and L have gone extinct. In Darwin's own words: "Thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species, will steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater differences between species of the same genus, or even of distinct genera.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=131 116–130]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a branching pattern with no names given to species, unlike the more linear tree Ernst Haeckel made years later (figure below) which includes the names of species and shows a more linear development from "lower" to "higher" species. In his summary to the section, Darwin put his concept in terms of the metaphor of the tree of life:

[[File:Darwin Tree 1837.png|thumb|right|upright|Page from Darwin's notebooks around July 1837, showing his first sketch of an evolutionary tree, with the words "I think" at the top]]

{{quote|The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the truth. The green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and those produced during each former year may represent the long succession of extinct species. At each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as species and groups of species have tried to overmaster other species in the great battle for life. The limbs divided into great branches, and these into lesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was small, budding twigs; and this connexion of the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups. Of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush, only two or three, now grown into great branches, yet survive and bear all the other branches; so with the species which lived during long-past geological periods, very few now have living and modified descendants. From the first growth of the tree, many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off; and these lost branches of various sizes may represent those whole orders, families, and genera which have now no living representatives, and which are known to us only from having been found in a fossil state. As we here and there see a thin straggling branch springing from a fork low down in a tree, and which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive on its summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the [[Platypus|Ornithorhynchus]] or [[South American Lungfish|Lepidosiren]], which in some small degree connects by its affinities two large branches of life, and which has apparently been saved from fatal competition by having inhabited a [[ecological niche|protected station]]. As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications.|[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=147&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 129–130]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The meaning and importance of Darwin's use of the tree of life metaphor have been extensively discussed. [[Stephen Jay Gould]], for example, says that Darwin placed the famous passage quoted above "at a crucial spot in his text", where it marked the conclusion of his argument for natural selection, illustrating both the interconnectedness by descent of organisms as well as their success and failure in the history of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |year=1993 |title=Eight Little Piggies |publisher=Jonathan Cape |location=London |isbn=978-0-224-03716-7}} p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; David Penny has written that Darwin did not use the tree of life to describe the relationship between groups of organisms, but to suggest that, as with branches in a living tree, lineages of species competed with and supplanted one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Penny |first=D. |year=2011 |title=Darwin's Theory of Descent with Modification, versus the Biblical Tree of Life |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=9 |issue=7 |page=e1001096 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001096 |pmid=21750664 |pmc=3130011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petter Hellström has demonstrated that Darwin consciously chose to name his tree after the biblical [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]], as described in [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis]], thus relating his theory to Christian mythology, and suggesting that he did so to mobilise the imagination of his readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petter Hellström | first1 = Nils | year = 2012 | title = Darwin and the tree of life: the roots the evolutionary tree | url = http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-185510| journal = Archives of Natural History | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 234–252 | doi = 10.3366/anh.2012.0092 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

[[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919) constructed several trees of life. His first sketch (in the 1860s) of his famous tree of life shows "''Pithecanthropus alalus''" as the ancestor of ''Homo sapiens''. His 1866 tree of life from ''Generelle Morphologie der Organismen'' shows three kingdoms: Plantae, Protista and Animalia. His 1879 'Pedigree of Man' was published in ''The Evolution of Man''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3397">'''Viveza criolla''' is a [[Spanish language]] phrase literally meaning "[[creole peoples|creole]]' cleverness" and may be translated as "creoles' cunning",{{cn|date=August 2015}} describing a way of life in [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]], among other [[Latin America|Latin American]] countries. It is a philosophy of progress along the [[line of least resistance]] and ignoring rules, a lack of sense of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] and consideration for others, and it extends to all social groups and throughout the whole country, although it predominates in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies" /&gt; Viveza criolla has been called "the principal cause of a moral, cultural, [[Economy of Argentina|economic]], social and [[Politics of Argentina|political]] [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|crisis]]".&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a similar concept to [[jeitinho brasileiro]] in [[Brazil]].

==Characteristics== 
Viveza criolla includes:
*Lack of [[respect]] for others and indifference to the [[common good]] in a framework of individual interests.&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies" /&gt; 
*[[Political corruption]], which extends in all institutions, in the form of [[Employee benefit|perk]]s, direct appropriation of [[public funds]], [[Cronyism|favoritism]], [[nepotism]], misallocation of state resources, etc.&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies" /&gt; 
*Extreme [[individualism]], with [[Trust (social sciences)|mistrust]] of others.  This includes having little ability to partner and cooperate in community goals.&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies" /&gt; (Interpersonal trust is a key component of [[social capital]], which is crucial for economic development and proper functioning of democratic institutions.)&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies" /&gt; 
*[[Anomie]] or weakening of the common [[morality]], and social deviance as behavior that departs from generally accepted standards in [[society]].&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies" /&gt;  
*The habit of blaming problems on others, thereby encouraging [[paranoia]] and granting a permit to self-indulgence.
*The tendency to take advantage of or cheat others in favor of one's own self-interests, partially for reasons of self-protection and mistrust, but also to assert one's superiority and "quick-wittedness" over another. &lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies" /&gt;

==Phrases==
*''Hecha la ley, hecha la trampa.'' -- "Made the law, made the loophole."
*''Total, si no robo yo, robará otro.'' -- "In the end, if I do not steal, someone else will."
*''El vivo vive del zonzo y el zonzo de su trabajo'' -- "The cunning lives off the sucker, and the sucker lives off his job"
