Sport became increasingly popular in [[England]] and [[Ireland]] through the 17th century and there are several references to [[cricket]] and [[horse racing]], while [[bare-knuckle boxing]] was revived. The interest of gamblers in these sports gave rise to [[Professional sports|professionalism]]. The first known attempts to organise [[football]] took place in Ireland.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 1681 — The ancient sport of [[Boxing|pugilism]] resurfaced in England during the late 17th century in the form of [[bare-knuckle boxing]], also known as [[prizefighting]]; the first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight was published in the ''London Protestant Mercury''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==[[Chess]]==
* Having been firmly established in Spain and Italy during the 15th and 16th centuries, chess became increasingly fashionable in France which, by the end of the 17th century, was the main centre of European chess.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==[[Cotswold Games]]==
* [[Robert Dover (Cotswold Games)|Robert Dover]]'s [[Cotswold Games|Olimpick Games]] held in the [[Cotswolds]] from c.1604 to 1612.&lt;ref name=BOA&gt;{{citation |title=400 Years of Olimpick Passion |url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=853 |publisher=Robert Dover's Games Society |accessdate=4 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606045814/http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=853 |archive-date=2010-06-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{citation |last=Williams |first=Jean |title=The Curious Mystery of the Cotswold 'Olimpick' Games: Did Shakespeare Know Dover ... and Does it Matter? |journal=Sport in History |doi=10.1080/17460260902872602 |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=150–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* c.1611 — the world's earliest known organised cricket match was played at [[Chevening, Kent]] between teams styled [[Weald and Upland cricket team|Weald and Upland]] and [[Chalkhill cricket team|Chalkhill]].&lt;ref name=DU4&gt;Underdown, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Village cricket]] thrived in the middle period of the 17th century, but there is no evidence of teams of county strength being formed at this time.&lt;ref name=LTL17C/&gt;
* c.1660 — in the wake of the [[English Restoration]], the popularity of cricket as a gambling sport encouraged investment and patronage; the introduction of professional players and the formation of teams representative of multiple parishes, possibly whole counties, mark the beginning of an evolution from the level of village cricket towards a major standard.&lt;ref name=HSA23&gt;Altham, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W10&gt;Webber, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LTL17C/&gt; 
* 1695 — Parliament decided against a renewal of the 1662 Licensing Act and so cleared the way for a [[Freedom of the press|free press]] on the Act's expiry in 1696; it is from this time that matters concerning cricket and other sports could be reported in the newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/pp428-435 |title=Charles II, 1662: An Act for preventing the frequent Abuses in printing seditious treasonable and unlicensed Bookes and Pamphlets and for regulating of Printing and Printing Presses |publisher=British History Online |work=Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5 |date=1628–80 |accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 7 July 1697 — the ''Foreign Post'' reported a "A Great Match in Sussex" played for fifty guineas, the earliest known record of a top-class match.&lt;ref name=FL18C1&gt;Buckley, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TJM3&gt;McCann, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The game had the earliest described rules requiring equal numbers, no playing of the ball on the ground, and banning the forward pass, with similarities to the modern game of [[Rugby football]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
'''Ireland'''
* 17th century — football games grew in popularity and were widely played under the patronage of the gentry; games were organised between landlords with each team comprising 20 or more tenants and attracting wagers with purses of up to 100 guineas.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1670 — the earliest record of a recognised precursor to modern football dates from a match in [[County Meath]] in which catching and kicking the ball were permitted.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1695 — "foot-ball" is banned by the severe ''Sunday Observance Act'', imposing a fine of one shilling (a substantial amount at the time) for those caught playing sports on the Sabbath but it proved difficult, if not impossible, for the authorities to enforce the Act.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==[[Golf]]==
'''Events'''

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''Events'''
* 1605 — [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] became known as the home of horse racing in England after its discovery by [[James I of England|James I]] while out [[falconry|hawking]] or riding; the region has a long association with horses going back to the time of [[Boadicea]] and the [[Iceni]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1634 — by this time, spring and autumn race meetings had been introduced at Newmarket and the first Gold Cup event was held in 1634.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1654 — all horse racing banned by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and many horses requisitioned by the state.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1664 — following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], racing flourished and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] instituted the [[Newmarket Town Plate]], writing the rules himself:{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
::"Articles ordered by His Majestie to be observed by all persons that put in horses to ride for the Plate, the new round heat at Newmarket set out on the first day of October, 1664, in the 16th year of our Sovereign Lord King Charles II, which Plate is to be rid for yearly, the second Thursday in October for ever".

==[[Lacrosse]]==
'''Events'''
* 15th–19th century — [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] played lacrosse to resolve conflicts, heal the sick, give thanks to the Creator and train for war in modern-day Canada and the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1636 — [[Jean de Brébeuf]], a French [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[missionary]], watched a [[Wyandot people|Huron]] game of lacrosse in what is now [[Ontario]], and he noticed that the sticks resemble a [[bishop]]'s [[crosier]] or "la crosse" in [[French language|French]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In some [[team sport]]s, an '''attacker''' is a specific type of player, usually involved in aggressive play. Heavy attackers are, usually, placed up front: their goal is to score the most possible points for the team.

In [[association football]], attackers are also referred to as [[Forward (association football)#Striker|strikers]].

'''BodyCode Training System''' is a technique for evaluating and correcting movement patterns using specifically designed equipment. It deals with how people construct awkward postures, and how to maintain and apply intervention strategies to correct them. It was developed in the 1990s by Pino Carbone.&lt;ref name=EE/&gt; It is mainly used by dancers and athletes but can be used by anybody. It is among the curricula of [[Boston Ballet|Boston Ballet School]], the [[National Ballet of China|Chinese National Ballet]], [[English National Ballet School]], and other private ballet school.&lt;ref name=TR/&gt;

BodyCode Training System includes [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic activities]], [[Isometric exercise|isometric]] and [[Isotonic (exercise physiology)|isotonic exercises]] and proprioceptive movement, as well as static and dynamic activities.&lt;ref name=EE/&gt; The specific set of exercises suitable for an individual is designed by a trainer after a postural examination.&lt;ref name=TV&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telva.com/2008/05/27/estarbienfitness/1211878356.html|title= Body-Code|publisher=Telva|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Carbone was awarded Geneva’s international inventor’s prize for designing BodyCode equipment called SpheralMind.&lt;ref name=TF/&gt;

== History ==
BodyCode Training System was developed by Pino Carbone. Carbone was a professional dancer for several years before he had an accident in the 1980s during the rehearsal of a ballet that affected his back and resulted in a [[Spinal disc herniation|herniated disc]]. Following his injury, he had to incorporate acupuncture, Pilates, Gyrotonics [[yoga]], [[massage]] and [[physical therapy]] in his regimen in order to continue with his dancing. At that time, he started research to develop a training system for strengthening and stretching muscles without the risk of injury that he could use.&lt;ref name=TR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mujer.terra.es/muj/articulo/html/mu225597.htm|title= Body Code: cuerpo y men| publisher=Terra|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several years of research and work, he developed the BodyCode System in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-19-01-2008/abc/Sabados/%C2%A1a-moverse!-body-code-en-forma-sin-desgaste_1641570674316.html |title=¡A moverse! Body Code, en forma sin desgaste|publisher=ABC.es|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carbone, he was tired of dancing in pain. He wanted to settle down and open his own studio. By then he was already doing [[Gyrotonics]] with Juliu Horvath, in New York City, so he decided to open his first studio in [[Florence]] and offer training that combined principles of yoga, dance, Gyrotonics and [[Pilates]].&lt;ref name=TF/&gt;

Although Carbone primarily worked with dancers and athletes, in the early 1990s, he began collaborating with orthopaedics, neurosurgeons and other medical specialists.&lt;ref name=PL/&gt;&lt;ref name=RR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reportpistoia.com/archivio-benessere/6954-che-cosa-e-il-metodo-bodycode.html|title= Che cosa è il metodo Bodycode|publisher=Report Pistoia|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it is taught in dance programs worldwide.&lt;ref name=PL/&gt;

== Principles ==
BodyCode exercises are based on the principles of harmonizing body and mind. The basis of the method is to restore the physical as well as mental balance. Theories of BodyCode have oriental roots and are related to [[acupuncture]], yoga, dance and [[feng shui]].&lt;ref name=EL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.es/belleza/cara-cuerpo/en-forma-con-body-code|title=La nueva disciplina para poner a punto cuerpo y mente|publisher=Elle Spanish|accessdate=22 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227175444/http://www.elle.es/belleza/cara-cuerpo/en-forma-con-body-code#|archive-date=2014-02-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It draws influences from Gyrotonics as well as Pilates.&lt;ref name=TF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=1642|title= An Interview with Pino Carbone|publisher=The Florentine|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BodyCode also employs basic principles of traditional gymnastics and dance movements. The purpose of the method is to improve the body movement and postural alignment.&lt;ref name=TR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Elle Spanish|title=El Codigo Da Pino|date=September 2008|pages=233, 234}}&lt;/ref&gt; BodyCode Training System includes [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic activities]], [[Isometric exercise|isometric]] and [[Isotonic (exercise physiology)|isotonic exercises]] and proprioception exercises as well as static and dynamic activities.&lt;ref name=EE/&gt; It deals with how people construct awkward postures, and how to maintain and apply intervention strategies to correct them.&lt;ref name=PL/&gt;

== Approach and equipment ==
There are various pieces of equipment designed by Carbone for performing different body movements. Some of these are handmade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanitatis.com/cache/2008/09/18/tendencias_30_bodycode_fusion_entre_cuerpo_mente.html|title=BodyCode o la fusión entre cuerpo y mente|publisher=Vanitatis|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and include ''Pegasus'', ''SpheralMind'', ''ProArch'', ''Geometrix'', ''Elvis'', ''Dance Ruler'' and ''MasterStretch''.&lt;ref name=TV/&gt; ''MasterStretch'' is developed for improving the flexibility of the spine and coordination and proprioception.&lt;ref name=EE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/evasion/gente-estilo/noticias/480996/04/08/Body-Code-la-manera-de-hacer-ejercicio-en-el-siglo-XXI.html |title=Body Code, la manera de hacer ejercicio en el siglo XXI|publisher=El Economista|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbone holds the trademark for BodyCode system as well as several equipment design patents. Only legally authorized instructors can lawfully provide BodyCode training. Before beginning BodyCode training, an individual's posture and balance are evaluated in order to determine their weaknesses and their requirements. Following this assessment, the instructor prepares a program that is focused on rebalancing the body.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; The first phase of evaluating body posture is called ''decoding'' and the second phase of training to improve balance is called ''coding''.&lt;ref name=PL&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Pilates Lifestyle|title=Body Talk – Cracking the Code of Movement|first=Heidi|last=Dvorak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Work in ===
BodyCode uses the concept of work-in as opposed to work-out. According to this concept, the physical imbalance, stress, trauma, bad habits and poor posture should not be corrected externally but internally. The individuals while practising this technique are taught  to be aware of their body characteristics and how to train it.&lt;ref name=PL/&gt;

== In the media ==
The BodyCode System was featured in Marie Claire Spanish in the article ''Top ten en gimnasios - El más barato (Top ten cheapest gym equipment)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marie-claire.es/belleza/cuerpo/fotos/fotos-gimansios-10/fotos-10-gimnasios-10___12219|title=Top ten en gimnasios - El más barato|publisher=Marie Claire|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikinews|Borussia Dortmund's team bus hit with explosives before Champions League match, Marc Bartra injured}}
On 11 April 2017, the tour bus of German football team [[Borussia Dortmund]] was attacked with [[roadside bomb]]s in [[Dortmund]], Germany. Three bombs exploded as the bus ferried the team to the [[Westfalenstadion]] for the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League knockout phase#Borussia Dortmund v Monaco|first leg of their quarter-final]] against [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]]. One of the team's players, [[Marc Bartra]], and a policeman were wounded, but the strengthened windows of the bus prevented further casualties.

The initial line of inquiry assumed that it was an [[Islamic terrorism|Islamist terrorist]] attack due to letters found at the scene, which claimed the attack was an act of retaliation for Muslims killed in the [[German intervention against ISIL|German military intervention]] against [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]], and threatened further attacks unless Germany withdraws and the [[Ramstein Air Base|US military base in Ramstein]] is shut down. However, discrepancies in the evidence eventually led investigators to consider it a [[false flag]] attack. Additional claims of responsibility, supposedly from far-left and far-right groups, were also investigated.

On 21 April 2017, German police arrested a man on suspicion of planting bombs to drive down the Borussia Dortmund share price and profit by [[Warrant (finance)|put warrants]] he bought prior to the attack.&lt;ref name="guardian-21apr"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/21/dortmund-bus-attack-suspect-arrested-as-police-allege-share-dealing-plot|title=Dortmund attack: man arrested on suspicion of share-dealing plot|date=21 April 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=21 April 2017|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bombing==
The team bus of [[Borussia Dortmund]] was attacked with three homemade [[pipe bomb]]s while on its way to [[Westfalenstadion]] in [[Dortmund]]. The bombs were hidden in hedges by the roadside and detonated at around 19:15 [[Central_European_Summer_Time|local time]] (17:15 [[UTC]]).&lt;ref name="bvbannounce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; They were packed with sharp metal pins and had a reach of about 100 meters (109 yards). Based on the type of detonator and explosive involved, German authorities assume "terrorist involvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/12/europe/dortmund-explosion-germany/index.html|title=Dortmund bus attack: 1 detained, 'terrorist involvement' suspected|website=CNN|access-date=12 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bombs used military detonators and the explosives may have come from military stocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/dortmund-attack-explosive-from-german-military-media/a-38439498 "Dortmund attack explosive 'from German military' - media"]. ''[[Die Welt]]''. 15 April 2017. Retrieved 17 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spain|Spanish]] footballer and Dortmund's team member [[Marc Bartra]] was wounded by shards of glass from the shattered bus window; he was taken to a nearby hospital where his right wrist was immediately operated on.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/article163639356/Anschlag-in-Dortmund-Was-wir-wissen-was-nicht.html|title=Borussia Dortmund: Sprengstoffanschlag beim BVB – Was wir wissen, was nicht - WELT|website=DIE WELT|access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A policeman suffered blast injury and shock; he was escorting the bus on a motorcycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/borussia-dortmund-ein-verdaechtiger-nach-anschlag-festgenommen-a-1143065.html|title=Dortmund: Anschlag auf BVB-Bus - Ermittler nehmen Verdächtigen fest - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Panorama|last=Germany|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, the bus was on its way to the first leg of Borussia Dortmund's [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League#Quarter-finals|2016–17 UEFA Champions League]] quarter-final against [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] at the [[Signal Iduna Park]]; the match was rescheduled for the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/explosionen-vor-champions-league-spiel-anschlag-auf-borussia-dortmund-gibt-ermittlern-raetsel-auf/19661954.html|title=Anschlag auf Borussia Dortmund gibt Ermittlern Rätsel auf|access-date=12 April 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Borussia Bus.jpg|thumb|none|left|The team bus of Borussia Dortmund in 2015]]

==Investigation==
The German police and state lawyers are treating it as attempted murder and a planned attack on [[Borussia Dortmund]]. There were three claims of responsibility: one left at the scene claiming an Islamist motive, one posted on the internet claiming an 'anti-fascist' motive&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/borussia-dortmund-ermittler-pruefen-zwei-bekennerschreiben-a-1143004.html|title=Anschlag auf BVB-Bus: Ermittler prüfen zwei Bekennerschreiben - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Panorama|last=Germany|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which was deemed to be fake),&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and one later sent to a newspaper claiming a far-right motive. The German Federal Prosecutor's Office initially called the attack an act of terrorism with possible Islamist involvement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/bvb-anschlag-in-dortmund-zwei-verdaechtige-eine-festnahme-1.3462381|title=Anschlag in Dortmund: Zwei Verdächtige, eine Festnahme|date=11 April 2017|work=sueddeutsche.de|access-date=12 April 2017|language=de|issn=0174-4917}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Interior Minister of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] called the attack "professional".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/keine-beweise-gegen-verdaechtigen-von-bvb-anschlag-gefunden-14970683.html|title=Anschlag auf Fußballmannschaft: NRW-Innenminister: Bomben auf BVB-Bus waren sehr professionell|date=13 April 2017|work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|access-date=13 April 2017|language=de-DE|issn=0174-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police are investigating whether it was an attack by Islamists, by the far-left or by the far-right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/dortmund-bombe-gegen-bvb-bus-laut-ralf-jaeger-professionell-gebaut-a-1143291.html|title=NRW-Innenminister Jäger über Anschlag in Dortmund: "Die Sprengkraft war enorm" - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Panorama|last=Germany|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|access-date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to German media, investigators are also considering whether a foreign security service was behind the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/new-message-claims-responsibility-for-dortmund-blast/a-38433218 "New message claims responsibility for Dortmund blast"]. ''[[Die Welt]]''. 15 April 2017. Retrieved 17 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims of responsibility===
There were three differing claims of responsibility. The first claim was found in three identical letters left at the scene. The letters said the attack was retaliation for [[German intervention against ISIL|German military intervention]] against [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] (ISIS) in [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]], accusing it of being responsible for killing Muslims. It demanded that the [[Ramstein Air Base|US military base in Ramstein]] be shut down and the German [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado jets]] be withdrawn from Syria. It threatened further attacks on non-Muslim celebrities in Germany unless the demands are met.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/12/borussia-dortmund-blasts-police-investigate-islamist-link-to-attack|title=Borussia Dortmund blasts: suspect 'from Islamist spectrum' detained|last=Oltermann|first=Philip|date=12 April 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=12 April 2017|last2=Connolly|first2=Kate|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letters were seen as unusual, as previous ISIS-linked attacks in Europe did not come with such confessions. Unlike previous video claims of responsibility, the letters directly addressed the German chancellor and had no religious justifications, ISIS logo, or signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/bvb-das-raetselhafte-bekennerschreiben-von-dortmund-a-1143121.html|title=Anschlag auf Mannschaftsbus: Das ungewöhnliche Bekennerschreiben von Dortmund - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Panorama|last=Germany|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; German newspapers later reported that investigators had "significant doubts" over the letters' authenticity, and suggested they may have been written to frame Islamists.&lt;ref name=letters&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39603467|title=Borussia Dortmund bombs: Letters at scene 'not from Islamists'|work=BBC News|date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/borussia-dortmund-football-attack-explosion-terrorism-islam-extremism-doubts-frauke-koehler-a7684651.html|title=Major doubts about letters claiming Islamist motive for Dortmund attack|last=Mortimer|first=Caroline|publisher=The Independent|access-date=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claim was posted on the left-wing, open-publishing website [[IndyMedia]]. It said the attack was committed because Borussia Dortmund did not do enough against racists, Nazis, and right-wing populists within its fanbase.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The claim was removed as fake, and police also treated it as fake.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faktenfinder.tagesschau.de/bvb-fake-bekennerschreiben-101.html|title=Anschlag auf BVB: Ist Antifa-Bekennerschreiben ein Fake?|last=tagesschau.de|website=tagesschau.de|language=de-DE|access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A few days later, a third claim of responsibility was sent to the newspaper ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', which hinted at a far-right motive. The anonymous e-mail praised [[Adolf Hitler]] and attacked [[multiculturalism]], adding that the attack was a "last warning".&lt;ref name=letters/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independentprosecutors&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dortmund-attack-bombing-borussia-team-bus-bvb-isis-terror-right-wing-extremists-claim-responsibility-a7685281.html|title=Prosecutors are investigating if Dortmund bombing could have been the work of right-wing extremists|date=15 April 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=15 April 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokeswoman for the federal prosecutors said the claim was being investigated.&lt;ref name=Localprobe/&gt; The letter also threatened another attack on protesters who plan to demonstrate against the [[Alternative for Germany]] party's conference in Cologne in 22 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/16/german-police-investigate-far-right-link-dortmund-bombing/|title=German police investigate far-Right link to Dortmund bombing|work=The Telegraph|access-date=19 April 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police also considered the possibility that the attack was carried out by the [[Far-right politics in Germany|far-right]] in order to incite backlash against Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pancevski|first1=Bojan|title=Dortmund attackers wanted to incite backlash against Muslims|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/66a34b32-21e6-11e7-84e8-86f619ed3761|website=The Times|accessdate=19 April 2017|date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the initial stage of the investigation, the police identified two suspects and arrested one of them.

On 21 April 2017, the federal prosecutor announced that it had arrested a 28-year-old German-Russian citizen, identified only as Sergej W., on suspicion of 20-fold attempted murder, bringing about an illegal detonation of explosives, and aggravated battery. The man had been staying at the Borussia team hotel. He planted explosives along the road where the team bus would later leave to the stadium. During check-in, he chose a room with a window facing the road so he would be able to remotely trigger the explosion when the bus passed by. It was revealed that on the day of the attack, he had bought [[Warrant (finance)|put warrants]] for €78,000 from an investment bank using the internet connection in his hotel room. These would have made him a large profit of up to €3.9&amp;nbsp;million if Dortmund's share price were to plummet after a successful attack, but it only dropped by 5% after the attack and later recovered. The unusual transaction raised suspicion of [[money laundering]] with bank employees, prompting them to alert authorities and pass to them the identity of Sergej W., which led to his arrest. Police also said Sergej W. left letters at the scene of the crime to frame Muslims for the attack.&lt;ref name="guardian-21apr" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
The match was postponed until the following day at 18:45 [[Central European Summer Time|local time]] (16:45 UTC), which resulted in a 3–2 win for Monaco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uefa.org/about-uefa/news/newsid=2457177.html|title=UEFA statement on Dortmund incident|date=11 April 2017|work=UEFA|access-date=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both Monaco and Dortmund fans united in friendship after the bombing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4217">The '''''Canadian Football Act''''' (1974), also known in its long title as '''''An Act respecting Canadian Professional Football''''', was a proposed [[Act of Parliament|Act]] by the [[Parliament of Canada]] in April 1974 designed to give a government-protected [[monopoly]] over [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional]] [[Canadian football|football]] in Canada to the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). Although it was never signed into law, the move by the government eventually compelled the [[World Football League]]'s [[Toronto Northmen]] to move to the [[United States]] as the [[Memphis Southmen]]. The spectre of the Act was again raised when [[John F. Bassett]], the owner of the Northmen/Southmen franchise, proposed a [[United States Football League]] franchise for [[Hamilton, Ontario]], in 1983.

In 2007, there was speculation that a similar act would develop if the [[National Football League]] attempted to [[National Football League in Toronto|expand to Toronto]] and thus threaten the Canadian league's existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/64892 NFL's New Hot Market Is North of the Border - October 19, 2007 - The New York Sun&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Such an act would likely still allow for an NFL team to play in Canada in an NFL preseason game and the CFL's off season; thus allowing for a Canadian city to host the Super Bowl if the NFL decided to host their premier event in a stadium far from an NFL city.{{citation needed|date = December 2018}}

It is also unlikely that any future act will be passed to affect American college football, such as the [[NCAA]] and [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]], who have or have had teams based in Canada  ([[Simon Fraser University]] being the lone NCAA member in Canada) and bowl games hosted in Canadian cities, with no opposition, in part because the CFL draws some of its players from American college teams (and, in the case of bowl games, because their December and January scheduling is well after [[U Sports football|Canadian university football]] ends its season).

==Details==
* Designated C-22.
* Introduced by the [[Minister of Health (Canada)|Minister of Health]], [[Marc Lalonde]].
* Claimed it would protect the Canadian Football League, would allow the CFL to grow and develop its own distinct character
* Of the mayors of the nine CFL cities at the time, only three were against the ''Canadian Football Act''. They were the mayors of [[List of mayors of Vancouver|Vancouver]], [[List of mayors of Montreal|Montreal]] and [[List of Toronto mayors|Toronto]], also the biggest cities of Canada then and now, with two of them hosting teams from leagues that played a different code of football. Montreal played host to one of the [[World League of American Football]] teams, the [[Montréal Machine]], in the early 1990s after their CFL team folded in the late 1980s. Toronto were hosts to an [[Arena Football League]] team for two seasons, the [[Toronto Phantoms]].
* After the bill passed second reading in the [[House of Commons of Canada]], it was given to the Standing Committee on Health, Welfare and Social Affairs, where it effectively died after the Northmen moved to Memphis.
* Clause 6 in the ''Act'' stated that no person that owns, operates, or manages a team in a league foreign from the CFL shall play in Canada. Subsection 2 stated that no player or member of the said team shall play in Canada, therefore if the bill passed and became law, it would effectively kill teams like the Northmen.

These facts were gathered from the actual debates held in the House of Commons from April 10 to April 28, 1974.

'''''Chariots of Fire''''' is a 1981 British [[historical period drama|historical drama film]]. It tells the fact-based story of two athletes in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]]: [[Eric Liddell]], a devout Scottish Christian who runs for the glory of God, and [[Harold Abrahams]], an English Jew who runs to overcome prejudice.

The film was conceived and produced by [[David Puttnam]], written by [[Colin Welland]], and directed by [[Hugh Hudson]]. [[Ben Cross]] and [[Ian Charleson]] starred as Abrahams and Liddell, alongside [[Nigel Havers]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Cheryl Campbell]], and [[Alice Krige]] in supporting roles.

It was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]] and won four, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. It is ranked 19th in the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of [[BFI Top 100 British films|Top 100 British films]]. The film is also notable for its memorable [[Chariots of Fire (album)|electronic theme tune]] by [[Vangelis]], who won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]].

The film's title was inspired by the line, "Bring me my chariot of fire," from the [[William Blake]] poem adapted into the popular British hymn [[And did those feet in ancient time|"Jerusalem"]]; the hymn is heard at the end of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Dans, Peter E. [https://books.google.com/books?id=52GpN0Hzxd8C&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=colin+welland+jerusalem+%22chariots+of+fire%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3EdJTPqqKovSsAP97PFI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=colin%20welland%20jerusalem%20%22chariots%20of%20fire%22&amp;f=false ''Christians in the Movies: A Century of Saints and Sinners''.] Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2009. p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; The original phrase "chariot(s) of fire" is from [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#2:11|2:11]] and [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#6:17|6:17]] in the Bible.

==Plot==
In 1919, [[Harold Abrahams]] ([[Ben Cross]]) enters the [[University of Cambridge]], where he experiences [[anti-Semitism]] from the staff, but enjoys participating in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] club. He becomes the first person to ever complete the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Trinity Great Court Run]], running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12, and achieves an undefeated string of victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with a leading Gilbert and Sullivan soprano, Sybil ([[Alice Krige]]).

[[Eric Liddell]] ([[Ian Charleson]]), born in China of Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie ([[Cheryl Campbell]]) disapproves of Liddell's plans to pursue competitive running, but Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary.

When they first race against each other, Liddell beats Abrahams. Abrahams takes it poorly, but [[Sam Mussabini]] ([[Ian Holm]]), a professional trainer whom he had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters ([[John Gielgud]] and [[Lindsay Anderson]]), who allege it is not gentlemanly for an amateur to "play the tradesman" by employing a professional coach. Abrahams dismisses this concern, interpreting it as cover for anti-Semitic and class-based prejudice.&lt;!--This is pretty well backed up by Gielgud's character's comments concerning "a Semite", "a different god" etc--&gt;

When Eric Liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, his sister Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. Eric tells her that though he intends to eventually return to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when running, and that not to run would be to dishonour God, saying, "I believe that God made me for a purpose. But He also made me fast, and when I run, I feel His pleasure."

The two athletes, after years of training and racing, are accepted to represent Great Britain in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]] in Paris. Also accepted are Abrahams' Cambridge friends, Lord Andrew Lindsay ([[Nigel Havers]]), [[Aubrey Montague]] ([[Nicholas Farrell]]), and [[H. B. Stallard|Henry Stallard]] ([[Daniel Gerroll]]).

While boarding the boat to Paris for the Olympics, Liddell discovers the heats for his 100-metre race will be on a Sunday. He refuses to run the race, despite strong pressure from the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] and the British Olympic committee, because his Christian convictions prevent him from running on the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].

Hope appears when Liddell's teammate Lindsay, having already won a silver medal in the [[400 metres hurdles]], proposes to concede his place in the [[400 metres|400-metre race]] on the following Thursday to Liddell, who gratefully agrees. His religious convictions in the face of national athletic pride make headlines around the world.

Liddell delivers a sermon at the Paris [[Church of Scotland]] that Sunday, and quotes from [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Isaiah#Chapter 40|Isaiah 40]], ending with, "But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint."

Abrahams is badly beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200 metre race. He knows his last chance for a medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race, and wins. His coach Sam Mussabini is overcome that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams can get on with his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected for the sake of running.

Before Liddell's race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now far longer 400 metre race. But one of the American runners, [[Jackson Scholz]], hands Liddell a note of support for his convictions. Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal.

The British team returns home triumphant. As the film ends, onscreen text explains that Abrahams married Sybil, and became the elder statesman of British athletics. Liddell went on to missionary work in China. All of Scotland mourned his death in 1945 in Japanese-occupied China.

== Historical accuracy ==

=== Characters ===
The film depicts Abrahams as attending [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]] with three other Olympic athletes: [[H. B. Stallard|Henry Stallard]], [[Aubrey Montague]], and Lord Andrew Lindsay. Abrahams and Stallard were in fact students there and competed in the 1924 Olympics. Montague also competed in the Olympics as depicted, but he attended Oxford, not Cambridge.&lt;ref name=aubrey&gt;[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mo/evelyn-montague-1.html Aubrey Montague biography] at SportsReference.com&lt;/ref&gt; Aubrey Montague sent daily letters to his mother about his time at Oxford and the Olympics; these letters were the basis of Montague's narration in the film.

The character of Lindsay was based partially on [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], a significant figure in the history of British athletics. Although Burghley did attend Cambridge, he was not a contemporary of Harold Abrahams, as Abrahams was an undergraduate from 1919 to 1923 and Burghley was at Cambridge from 1923 to 1927. One scene in the film depicts the Burghley-based "Lindsay" as practising hurdles on his estate with full champagne glasses placed on each hurdle – this was something the wealthy Burghley did, although he used matchboxes instead of champagne glasses.&lt;ref name=rw /&gt; The fictional character of Lindsay was created when [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]], who was Britain's third athletics gold medallist in the 1924 Olympics, was not willing to be involved with the film.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 275, 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cross and Havers.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Harold Abrahams|Abrahams]] (left) and the [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Burghley]]-based Lindsay (right) attempt the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Great Court Run]].]]
Another scene in the film recreates the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Great Court Run]], in which the runners attempt to run around the perimeter of the [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in the time it takes the clock to strike 12 at midday. The film shows Abrahams performing the feat for the first time in history. In fact, Abrahams never attempted this race, and at the time of filming the only person on record known to have succeeded was [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], in 1927. In ''Chariots of Fire'', Lindsay, who is based on Lord Burghley, runs the Great Court Run with Abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line just a moment too late. Since the film's release, the Great Court Run has also been successfully run by Trinity undergraduate Sam Dobin, in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-490027/Modern-day-hero-runs-away-Chariots-Fire-challenge.html "Modern-day hero runs away with Chariots of Fire challenge."] ''[[Daily Mail]]'' 27 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film, Eric Liddell is tripped up by a Frenchman in the 400-metre event of a Scotland–France international athletic meeting. He recovers, makes up a 20-metre deficit, and wins. This was based on fact; the actual race was the 440 yards at a Triangular Contest meet between Scotland, England, and Ireland at [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in England in July 1923. His achievement was remarkable as he had already won the 100- and 220-yard events that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Russell W.|title=God's Joyful Runner|publisher=Bridge Publishing, Inc|year=1987|page=54|isbn=0-88270-624-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also unmentioned with regard to Liddell is that it was he who introduced Abrahams to [[Sam Mussabini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0019/ |title=A Sporting Nation: Eric Liddell |publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is alluded to: In the film Abrahams first encounters Mussabini while he is watching Liddell race. The film, however, suggests that Abrahams himself sought Mussabini's assistance.

Abrahams and Liddell did race against each other once, but not quite as depicted in the film, which shows Liddell winning the final of the 100 yards against a shattered Abrahams at the 1923 AAA Championship at Stamford Bridge.  In fact, they raced only in a heat of the 220 yards, which Liddell won, five yards ahead of Abrahams, who did not progress to the final.  In the 100 yards, Abrahams was eliminated in the heats and never raced against Liddell, who won the finals of both races the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCasland|first=David|title=Pure Gold: A New Biography of the Olympic Champion Who Inspired Chariots of Fire|publisher=Discovery House|year=2001|isbn=1572931302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrahams' fiancée is misidentified as [[Sybil Gordon]], a soprano at the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].  In fact, in 1936, Abrahams married [[Sybil Evers]], who sang at the D'Oyly Carte, but they did not meet until 1934.&lt;ref name=ryan188&gt;Ryan (2012), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the film, Sybil is depicted as singing the role of Yum-Yum in ''[[The Mikado]]'', but neither Sybil Gordon nor Sybil Evers ever sang that role with D'Oyly Carte,&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David.

Liddell's sister was several years younger than she was portrayed in the film. Her disapproval of Liddell's track career was creative licence; she actually fully supported his sporting work. Jenny Liddell Somerville cooperated fully with the making of the film and has a brief cameo in the Paris [[Church of Scotland]] during Liddell's sermon.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Russell W.

At the memorial service for Harold Abrahams, which opens the film, Lord Lindsay mentions that he and [[Aubrey Montague]] are the only members of the 1924 Olympic team still alive. However, Montague died in 1948, 30 years before Abrahams' death.

===1924 Olympics===
{{See also|Great Britain at the 1924 Summer Olympics}}

The film takes some liberties with the events at the 1924 Olympics, including the events surrounding Liddell's refusal to race on a Sunday. In the film, he doesn't learn that the 100-metre heat is to be held on the Christian Sabbath until he is boarding the boat to Paris. In fact, the schedule was made public several months in advance; Liddell did however face immense pressure to run on that Sunday and to compete in the 100 metres, getting called before a grilling by the British Olympic Committee, the Prince of Wales, and other [[grandee]]s,&lt;ref name=hudson/&gt; and his refusal to run made headlines around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Feg. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/361517352.html?dids=361517352:361517352&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+24%2C+1924&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=DID+YOU+KNOW+THAT--&amp;pqatl=google "DID YOU KNOW THAT ..."]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. 24 June 1924. Full headline reads, "Did You Know That Famous Scotch Sprinter Will Not Run in the Olympic 100 Metres Because The Trials Are Run on Sunday".&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to change races was, even so, made well before embarking to Paris, and Liddell spent the intervening months training for the 400 metres, an event in which he had previously excelled. It is true, nonetheless, that Liddell's success in the Olympic 400m was largely unexpected.

The film depicts Lindsay, having already won a medal in the 400-metre hurdles, giving up his place in the 400-metre race for Liddell. In fact [[David Burghley|Burghley]], on whom Lindsay is loosely based, was eliminated in the heats of the 110 hurdles (he would go on to win a gold medal in the 400 hurdles at the 1928 Olympics), and was not entered for the 400 metres.

The film reverses the order of Abrahams' 100m and 200m races at the Olympics. In reality, after winning the 100 metres race, Abrahams ran the [[200 metres]] but finished last, [[Jackson Scholz]] taking the gold medal. In the film, before his triumph in the 100m, Abrahams is shown losing the 200m and being scolded by Mussabini. And during the following scene in which Abrahams speaks with his friend Montague while receiving a massage from Mussabini, there is a French newspaper clipping showing Scholz and [[Charlie Paddock]] with a headline which states that the 200 metres was a triumph for the United States. In the same conversation, Abrahams laments getting "beaten out of sight" in the 200. The film thus has Abrahams overcoming the disappointment of losing the 200 by going on to win the 100, a reversal of the real order.

Eric Liddell actually also ran in the 200m race, and finished third, behind Paddock and Scholz. This was the only time in reality that Liddell and Abrahams competed in the same race. While their meeting in the 1923 [[Amateur Athletic Association|AAA]] Championship in the film was fictitious, Liddell's record win in that race did spur Abrahams to train even harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/recollections/content/arthurmarshall.htm |title=Recollections by Sir Arthur Marshall |publisher=Content.ericliddell.org |date= |accessdate=28 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215092135/http://content.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/recollections/content/arthurmarshall.htm |archivedate=15 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrahams also won a silver medal as an opening runner for the [[4 x 100 metres relay]] team, not shown in the film, and [[Aubrey Montague]] placed sixth in the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]], as depicted.&lt;ref name=aubrey /&gt;

====Personal inaccuracies at the Olympics====
In the film, the 100m bronze medallist is a character called "Tom Watson"; the real medallist was [[Arthur Porritt, Baron Porritt|Arthur Porritt]] of New Zealand, who refused permission for his name to be used in the film, allegedly out of modesty, and his wish was accepted by the film's producers, even though his permission was not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arthur Espie Porritt 1900–1994 |url=http://www.library.otago.ac.nz/exhibitions/rhodes_scholars/arthur_espie_porritt.html |title=Reference to Porritt's modesty |publisher=Library.otago.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the brief back-story given for Watson, who is called up to the New Zealand team from the [[University of Oxford]], substantially matches Porritt's history. With the exception of Porritt, all the runners in the 100m final are identified correctly when they line up for inspection by the Prince of Wales.

Jackson Scholz is depicted as handing Liddell an inspirational Bible-quotation message before the 400 metres final: "It says in the Old Book, 'He that honors me, I will honor.' Good luck."&lt;ref&gt;The quoted passage is [[Books of Samuel|First Samuel]] [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Samuel#2:30|2:30]].&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the note was from members of the British team, and was handed to Liddell before the race by his attending masseur at the team's Paris hotel.&lt;ref name=reid&gt;Reid, Alasdair. "Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell". ''[[The Times]]''. 1 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; For dramatic purposes, screenwriter Welland asked Scholz if he could be depicted handing the note, and Scholz readily agreed, saying "Yes, great, as long as it makes me look good."&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Britain's 1924 Olympic Champs Live Again in 'Chariots of Fire'—and Run Away with the Oscars | work = [[People (American magazine)|People]] | date =10 May 1982 | volume = 17 | issue = 18 | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20082112,00.html | accessdate =22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==

=== Script and direction ===
[[File:Charleson as Liddell.jpg|thumb|[[Ian Charleson]], who studied the Bible intensively for his role, wrote Eric Liddell's post-race inspirational speech to a working-class crowd.]]
Producer [[David Puttnam]] was looking for a story in the mold of ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]'' (1966), regarding someone who follows his conscience, and felt sports provided clear situations in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;Goodell, Gregory. [https://books.google.com/books?id=T1kc5_QjiF4C&amp;pg=PR17&amp;lpg=PR17&amp;dq=%22david+puttnam%22+%22chariots+of+fire%22+%22man+for+all+seasons%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LvE2kYmoFg&amp;sig=gmauWSjGfpFMK2WqFSkEdz5GmrM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zdEPS7jiM8KInQfgrOT0DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=22&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwFQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22david%20puttnam%22%20%22chariots%20of%20fire%22%20%22man%20for%20all%20seasons%22&amp;f=false ''Independent Feature Film Production: A Complete Guide from Concept Through Distribution.''] New York: St. Martin's Press, 1982. p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered Eric Liddell's story by accident in 1977, when he happened upon a reference book on the Olympics while housebound from the flu in a rented house in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Peter M. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FIydEd00DbcC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=%22david+puttnam%22+%22chariots+of+fire%22+olympics+book+rented+house&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SwOUBnTU_L&amp;sig=iY-8ny3tRtAkR14raOQLrQIZDSA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TtYPS46PBNXMngenuajTAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22david%20puttnam%22%20%22chariots%20of%20fire%22%20olympics%20book%20rented%20house&amp;f=false ''The New York Times Essential Library, Children's Movies: A Critic's Guide to the Best Films Available on Video and DVD''.] New York: Times Books, 2003. p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reunion&gt;Hugh Hudson in ''Chariots of Fire – The Reunion'' (2005 video; featurette on 2005 ''Chariots of Fire'' DVD)&lt;/ref&gt;

Screenwriter [[Colin Welland]], commissioned by Puttnam, did an enormous amount of research for his [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning script. Among other things, he took out advertisements in London newspapers seeking memories of the 1924 Olympics, went to the National Film Archives for pictures and footage of the 1924 Olympics, and interviewed everyone involved who was still alive. Welland just missed Abrahams, who died 14 January 1978, but he did attend Abrahams' February 1978 memorial service, which inspired the present-day framing device of the film.&lt;ref name=rw /&gt; [[Aubrey Montague]]'s son saw Welland's newspaper ad and sent him copies of the letters his father had sent home – which gave Welland something to use as a narrative bridge in the film. Except for changes in the greetings of the letters from "Darling Mummy" to "Dear Mum" and the change from Oxford to Cambridge, all of the readings from Montague's letters are from the originals.&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt;

Welland's original script also featured, in addition to Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams, a third protagonist, 1924 Olympic gold medallist [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]], who was presented as a privileged aristocratic athlete. However, Lowe refused to have anything to do with the film, and his character was written out and replaced by the fictional character of Lord Andrew Lindsay.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 274–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Charleson]] himself wrote Eric Liddell's speech to the post-race workingmen's crowd at the Scotland v. Ireland races. Charleson, who had studied the Bible intensively in preparation for the role, told director Hugh Hudson that he didn't feel the portentous and sanctimonious scripted speech was either authentic or inspiring. Hudson and Welland allowed him to write words he personally found inspirational instead.&lt;ref&gt;Ian McKellen, Hugh Hudson, Alan Bates, et al. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0094702500 ''For Ian Charleson: A Tribute'']. London: Constable and Company, 1990. pp. 37–39. {{ISBN|0-09-470250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was slightly altered for the U.S. audience. A brief scene depicting a pre-Olympics [[cricket]] game between Abrahams, Liddell, Montague, and the rest of the British track team appears shortly after the beginning of the original film. For the American audience, this brief scene was deleted. In the U.S., to avoid the initial G rating, which had been strongly associated with children's films and might have hindered box office sales, a different scene was used – one depicting Abrahams and Montague arriving at a Cambridge railway station and encountering two [[World War I]] veterans who use an [[shit|obscenity]] – in order to be given a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG rating]].&lt;ref&gt;Puttnam interviewed in BBC Radio obituary of [[Jack Valenti]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Puttnam chose [[Hugh Hudson]], a multiple award-winning advertising and documentary filmmaker who had never helmed a feature film, to direct ''Chariots of Fire''. Hudson and Puttnam had known each other since the 1960s, when Puttnam was an advertising executive and Hudson was making films for ad agencies. In 1977, Hudson had also been [[second-unit]] director on the Puttnam-produced film ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]''.&lt;ref name=round&gt;Round, Simon.

===Casting===
Director [[Hugh Hudson]] was determined to cast young, unknown actors in all the major roles of the film, and to back them up by using veterans like [[John Gielgud]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], and [[Ian Holm]] as their supporting cast. Hudson and producer [[David Puttnam]] did months of fruitless searching for the perfect actor to play Eric Liddell. They then saw Scottish stage actor [[Ian Charleson]] performing the role of Pierre in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s production of ''[[Piaf (play)|Piaf]]'', and knew immediately they had found their man. Unbeknownst to them, Charleson had heard about the film from his father, and desperately wanted to play the part, feeling it would "fit like a kid glove".&lt;ref&gt;Ian McKellen, Hugh Hudson, Alan Bates, et al. ''For Ian Charleson: A Tribute''. London: Constable and Company, 1990. pp. xix, 9, 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Cross]], who plays Harold Abrahams, was discovered while playing Billy Flynn in ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. In addition to having a natural pugnaciousness, he had the desired ability to sing and play the piano.&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bencross.net/biography.html Ben Cross – Bio on Official site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022043111/http://www.bencross.net/biography.html |date=22 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross was thrilled to be cast, and said he was moved to tears by the film's script.&lt;ref name=wings&gt;''Wings on Their Heels: The Making of'' Chariots of Fire. (2005 video; featurette on 2005 DVD).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[20th Century Fox]], which put up half of the production budget in exchange for distribution rights outside of North America,&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 273–274.&lt;/ref&gt; insisted on having a couple of notable American names in the cast.&lt;ref name=reunion /&gt; Thus the small parts of the two American champion runners, Jackson Scholz and Charlie Paddock, were cast with recent headliners: [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]] had recently starred in ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'' (also produced by Puttnam), and [[Dennis Christopher]] had recently starred, as a young bicycle racer, in the popular indie film ''[[Breaking Away]]''.&lt;ref name=wings /&gt;

All of the actors portraying runners underwent a gruelling three-month training intensive with renowned running coach Tom McNab. This training and isolation of the actors also created a strong bond and sense of camaraderie among them.&lt;ref name=wings /&gt;

=== Music ===
{{Main|Chariots of Fire (album)}}
[[File:Charleson on beach.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ian Charleson]] (foreground) and [[Ben Cross]] (left) running in the "[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]" music scene which bookends the film.]]
Although the film is a period piece, set in the 1920s, the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning original soundtrack composed by [[Vangelis]] uses a modern 1980s electronic sound, with a strong use of [[synthesizer]] and piano among other instruments. This was a bold and significant departure from earlier period films, which employed sweeping orchestral instrumentals. The [[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|title theme of the film]] has become iconic, and has been used in subsequent films and television shows during slow-motion segments.

Vangelis, a Greek-born electronic composer who moved to Paris in the late 1960s, had been living in London since 1974.&lt;ref name="dt"&gt;[http://vangeliscollector.com/telegraph112182.htm ''Daily Telegraph'' newspaper, 21 November 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; Director Hugh Hudson had collaborated with him on documentaries and commercials, and was also particularly impressed with his 1979 albums ''[[Opera Sauvage]]'' and ''[[China (Vangelis album)|China]]''.&lt;ref&gt;MacNab, Geoffrey. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/everyone-was-a-winner-when-british-talent-met-the-olympic-spirit-7640574.html "Everyone Was a Winner when British Talent Met the Olympic Spirit"]. ''[[The Independent]]''. 13 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; David Puttnam also greatly admired Vangelis's body of work, having originally selected his compositions for his previous film ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbert, Julie. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gmc28iYGdMcC&amp;pg=PA426&amp;lpg=PA426&amp;dq=puttnam+vangelis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uqcm-_PfON&amp;sig=6frPR9-CwF_fxMfSjiVdlFwvKSI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MkCJT9HJOqqciALJ2bDaCw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=puttnam%20vangelis&amp;f=false ''Celluloid Symphonies: Texts and Contexts in Film Music History'']. University of California Press, 2011. p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson made the choice for Vangelis and for a modern score: "I knew we needed a piece which was anachronistic to the period to give it a feel of modernity. It was a risky idea but we went with it rather than have a period symphonic score."&lt;ref name=round /&gt; The soundtrack had a personal significance to Vangelis: After composing the iconic theme tune he told Puttnam, "My father is a runner, and this is an anthem to him."&lt;ref name=rw&gt;McLaughlin, John. [https://archive.is/20130104210643/http://www.runnersworld.com/article/printer/1,7124,s6-243-297--14187-0,00.html "In Chariots They Ran"]. ''[[Runner's World]]''. February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dt" /&gt;

Hudson originally wanted Vangelis's 1977 tune "L'Enfant",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kRS4pkrBqE "L'Enfant", from ''Opera Sauvage'']&lt;/ref&gt; from his ''Opera Sauvage'' album, to be the title theme of the film, and the beach running sequence was actually filmed with "L'Enfant" playing on loudspeakers for the runners to pace to. Vangelis finally convinced Hudson he could create a new and better piece for the film's main theme – and when he played the now-iconic "Chariots of Fire" theme for Hudson, it was agreed the new tune was unquestionably better.&lt;ref&gt;Vangelis in ''Chariots of Fire – The Reunion'' (2005 video; featurette on 2005 ''Chariots of Fire'' DVD)&lt;/ref&gt; The "L'Enfant" melody still made it into the film: When the athletes reach Paris and enter the stadium, a brass band marches through the field, and first plays a modified, acoustic performance of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsew.com/data/trivia.htm Trivia about Vangelis]&lt;/ref&gt; Vangelis's electronic "L'Enfant" track eventually was used prominently in the 1982 film ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]''.

Some pieces of Vangelis's music in the film did not end up on the film's soundtrack album. One of them is the background music to the race Eric Liddell runs in the Scottish highlands. This piece is a version of "Hymne", the original version of which appears on Vangelis's 1979 album, ''[[Opéra sauvage]]''. Various versions are also included on Vangelis's compilation albums ''[[Themes (Vangelis album)|Themes]]'', ''[[Portraits (So Long Ago, So Clear)|Portraits]]'', and ''[[Odyssey: The Definitive Collection]]'', though none of these include the version used in the film.

Five lively [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] tunes also appear in the soundtrack, and serve as jaunty period music which nicely counterpoints Vangelis's modern electronic score. These are: "He is an Englishman" from ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', "Three Little Maids from School Are We" from ''[[The Mikado]]'', "With Catlike Tread" from ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', "The Soldiers of Our Queen" from ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', and "There Lived a King" from ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.

The film also incorporates a major traditional work: "[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]", sung by a British choir at the 1978 funeral of Harold Abrahams. The words, written by William Blake in 1804-8, were set to music by Parry in 1916 as a celebration of England. This hymn has been described as "England's unofficial national anthem",&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Blair.

The beach scenes associated with the theme tune were filmed at West Sands, [[St Andrews]]. A plaque commemorating the filming can be found there today.

==Revival for the 2012 Olympics==
''Chariots of Fire'' became a recurring theme in promotions for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London. The film's theme tune was featured at the opening of the 2012 London New Years fireworks celebrating the Olympics,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1yLRK2M8YQ London Fireworks 2012 - New Year Live - BBC One]&lt;/ref&gt; and the film's iconic beach-running scene and theme tune were used in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'''s "Let's Make It Great, Britain" Olympic ads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3b-o63wd_M "Let's Make It Great, Britain"]&lt;/ref&gt; The runners who first tested the new [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] were spurred on by the ''Chariots of Fire'' theme tune,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17546859 "London 2012: Olympic Park Runners Finish Race"]. ''[[BBC News]]''. 31 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and the iconic music was also used to fanfare the carriers of the [[2012 Summer Olympics torch relay|Olympic flame]] on parts of its route through the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northantset.co.uk/news/local/musicians-set-to-fanfare-the-flame-1-3693330 "Musicians Set to Fanfare the Flame"].

The film's theme was also performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Simon Rattle]], during the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Opening Ceremony]] of the games; the performance was accompanied by a comedy skit by [[Rowan Atkinson]] (as [[Mr Bean]]) which included the opening beach-running footage from the film.&lt;ref name=mrbean-oc&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr. Bean's 'Chariots of Fire' Skit at 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/367792/20120727/mr-bean-rowan-atkinson-olympic-opening-ceremony.htm|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's theme tune was also played during each medal ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.

==Critical reception==
Since its release ''Chariots of Fire'' has received generally positive reviews from critics. {{as of|2017}} the film holds an 83% "Certified Fresh" rating on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 64 reviews, accompanied by the summary "Decidedly slower and less limber than the Olympic runners at the center of its story, the film nevertheless manages to make effectively stirring use of its spiritual and patriotic themes."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chariots_of_fire]. Chariots of Fire (1981) - Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved 3 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

For its 2012 re-release, Kate Muir of ''[[The Times]]'' gave the film five stars, writing: "In a time when drug tests and synthetic fibres have replaced gumption and moral fibre, the tale of two runners competing against each other in the 1924 Olympics has a simple, undiminished power. From the opening scene of pale young men racing barefoot along the beach, full of hope and elation, backed by Vangelis's now famous anthem, the film is utterly compelling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/firstnightreviews/article3471497.ece]. "First Night Reviews: Chariots of Fire". Retrieved 3 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contraflow lane reversal''' is the altering of the normal flow of traffic, typically on a [[controlled-access]] highway (such as a freeway or motorway), to either aid in an [[emergency evacuation]] (the most common usage of the term in the [[United States]]) or, as part of [[Planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] activities, to facilitate widening or reconstruction of one of the highway's [[carriageway]]s (the most common usage in the [[United Kingdom]]).

Usually, the term is used to refer to reversal of lanes which are normally configured for travel in one direction; routinely changing the configuration of [[reversible lane#Entire roadway routinely reversed|reversible lanes]] (such as during [[rush hour]]) is not normally considered contraflow lane reversal.

==Emergency evacuation==
In an emergency evacuation, contraflow lane reversal roughly doubles the number of lanes available for evacuation traffic. Crossover sections are used to move outgoing traffic to these lanes. All incoming traffic is blocked until the end of the evacuation.

Contraflow lane reversal is usually done on freeways and other controlled-access roadways; however, some examples listed below (particularly in [[South Carolina]]) are divided and undivided roadways. Use of contraflow lane reversal is generally considered to be an emergency measure, as the contraflow lanes (and any associated ramps at interchanges) lack proper [[traffic sign|signage]], [[traffic signal|signals]], and other traffic control devices needed to orderly conduct traffic in the opposite direction.

Generally, a significant number of police officers or other officials are needed to manually direct traffic during a lane reversal (especially at [[interchange (road)|interchanges]], where ramp traffic in the wrong direction must intersect with other roadways that are operating normally).

===Hurricane evacuation===

From the 1990s, many states in the [[Southeastern United States]] adopted [[hurricane]] [[Hurricane evacuation route|evacuation routes]] from coastal areas using contraflow lane reversals on [[Interstate Highways]]. State highway departments have coordinated on plans for traffic direction with state [[highway patrol]] agencies, constructed highway median crossovers, and installed signage for drivers and barriers and swing arms to inhibit wrong-way collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.floridaits.com/Contraflow_Evac.htm |title=Contraflow Evacuation |publisher=Floridaits.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922105826/http://www.floridaits.com/Contraflow_Evac.htm |archivedate=2008-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most evacuation plans involve only a single state; however, the states of [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]] have developed coordinated plans to evacuate the [[New Orleans metropolitan area]] by using [[Interstate 55]] and [[Interstate 59]].

Current contraflow evacuation plans exist for:

==Highway reconstruction==
When roads are undergoing [[Roadworks|construction]] amid heavy traffic, one lane of traffic may be blocked and another lane reversed.

===Single track roads===
[[Single track road]]s are often closed during reconstruction.

===Two-lane arterials===
[[File:Contraflow traffic through roundabout on North Beach Road.ogv|thumb|right|Traffic controllers direct traffic through half of a roundabout with STOP / SLOW signs, using contraflow conditions]]
A [[construction worker]] or [[police officer]] directs traffic with a "Stop/Slow Paddle", which is a sign displaying "STOP" on one side and "SLOW" on the other. The sign is turned, and the other side proceeds. [[Traffic signal]]s are also sometimes used, especially during bridge construction or any situation in which a lane must be closed during times when construction crews are not at work. Other cases include treating the street as a temporary one-way street in areas in which several nearby parallel streets are available as a detour for the opposing side.

===Roads with four or more lanes===
If road construction necessitates the complete closure of one half of a road with four or more lanes, two lanes of traffic may be shifted to the other roadway. If the road being constructed is a highway, the used half is called a [[semi-highway]].

===Freeways and motorways===

{{Main|Semi-highway}}
When [[controlled-access highway]]s undergo reconstruction, both sides are often reduced to one lane. In some cases, traffic may be shifted onto one half, making it a temporary [[two-lane freeway]] corridor. An example of this is [[Interstate 10]] in [[Arizona]], in which eastbound traffic is reduced to one lane and shifted onto the westbound half of the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;z=17&amp;ll=33.630566,-114.41146&amp;spn=0.004315,0.008347&amp;t=k&amp;om=1 |title=Google Maps |publisher=Maps.google.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another technique is to treat the rightmost [[hard shoulder]] as a travel lane. On a six-lane freeway (i.e., one containing three lanes in each direction), a third lane may be kept open for the busier direction, or the shoulder may be opened to allow for four lanes of traffic but with little or no shoulder space; emergency breakdown areas may be added. In these situations, temporary "YIELD" or "STOP" signs are usually posted on merge ramps on freeways, expressways, and uncontrolled roads with interchanges. In such cases, opposing directions are separated by [[jersey barrier]]s, or in rare circumstances, [[traffic cone]]s.

==Sporting events==
At the beginning and end of major sporting events, the center turn lanes of roads around a stadium or arena may be used to accommodate event traffic. Because these lanes are typically not subject to lane control, this can be considered a limited form of contraflow reversal.
[[Image:I-93ContraflowLaneReversalConcordNH.jpg|275px|thumb|right|Contraflow lane reversal in operation on [[Interstate 93|I-93]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]] after completion of a [[NASCAR]] [[2013 Camping World RV Sales 301|race]] at [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]], looking south.]]

Twice annually, upon completion of [[NASCAR]] races at [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]] in [[Loudon, New Hampshire]], a form of contraflow lane reversal, referred to as "borrow a lane" is conducted on [[Interstate 93]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]]. In this case, the left lane of northbound Interstate 93 is temporarily "borrowed" to use as a third southbound lane. Southbound traffic has the option of transferring to the "borrowed" lane north of the [[Interstate 393]] interchange and can travel southbound in the left northbound lane to allow a bypass of heavy race traffic entering I-93 southbound from I-393 at Exit 15. The two lanes of traffic in the normal southbound lanes, and traffic in the bypass "borrowed" lane rejoin on the southbound side of the interstate just south of the [[Interstate 89]] interchange in [[Bow, New Hampshire|Bow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nh.gov/dot/media/nr2013/20130708-nascar-traffic-controls.htm |title=Traffic Control Plans for the July 14 NASCAR Race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon |publisher=NHDOT |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contraflow lane reversal is also used for [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] and [[IndyCar Series]] races at [[Pocono Raceway]] in [[Long Pond, Pennsylvania]]. For these races, two-lane [[Pennsylvania Route 115]] becomes one-way southbound between [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 80]] and the track the morning of the race until everyone has arrived at the track. After the race concludes, PA 115 becomes one-way northbound between Pocono Raceway and I-80 until everyone has left the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|title=Special traffic patterns planned for Pocono race|publisher=WFMZ-TV|location=Allentown, PA|date=July 29, 2014|url=http://www.wfmz.com/news/Regional-Poconos-Coal/Local/special-traffic-patterns-planned-for-pocono-race/27202978|accessdate=2014-09-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623003052/http://www.wfmz.com/news/Regional-Poconos-Coal/Local/special-traffic-patterns-planned-for-pocono-race/27202978|archive-date=2015-06-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|title=Special traffic patterns planned for Pocono race|publisher=WFMZ-TV|location=Allentown, PA|date=June 30, 2014|url=http://www.wfmz.com/news/Regional-Poconos-Coal/Local/special-traffic-patterns-planned-for-pocono-race/26729224|accessdate=2014-09-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623015430/http://www.wfmz.com/news/Regional-Poconos-Coal/Local/special-traffic-patterns-planned-for-pocono-race/26729224|archive-date=2015-06-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cooling vest''' is a piece of specially made clothing designed to lower or stabilize body temperature and make exposure to warm climates or environments more bearable. Cooling vests are used by many athletes, construction workers, and welders, as well as individuals suffering from [[multiple sclerosis]], [[hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia]], or various types of [[sports injuries]].

==Types ==
Cooling vests range in weight from around two to eight pounds, depending on the model. While many sub-types do exist, cooling vests fall into one of 5 primary types:

*Evaporative cooling vests are typically submersed in water for around 3 – 5 minutes and lightly wrung out or blot dried. They are usually worn outside the clothing and as the water in the vest interacts with specially treated cooling crystals or other cooling agents, the water evaporates which then causes body temperature to be reduced. They are light weight, easy to use and no electricity is required making them perfect for people on the move. They are also the most affordable form of cooling vest.
*Ice chilled cooling vests make use of cooling energy packs that are activated inside of a freezer and then placed in pockets inside of the cooling vest. Because they are very cold to the touch, this type of cooling vest is always worn outside the clothes. 
*A phase change cooling vest makes use of cooling packs that maintain much higher temperatures when refrigerated, frozen, or placed in water. These phase-change packs often contain liquids (typically nontoxic oils and fats) that solidify (like wax) typically between 55 and 65 degrees and usually last between 1.5 – 4 hours. This flexible cooled pack will then help reduce the wearers’ temperature for up to 4 hours.
*A cool flow cooling vest makes use of a water flow system that pumps water through the vest using hoses.
*Thermoelectric cooling vest works on peltier effect and cools down the inner surface of the vest. It is powered by a portable battery.

== Uses ==
The effects of cooling vests on [[athlete]]s to improve their performance has been evaluated on several occasions; at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] several Americans and Australians were fitted with cooling vests supplied by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and Arctic Heat 2004,2008,2012,2016 Olympics, used prior to their events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warming Up With an Ice Vest: Core Body Temperature Before and After Cross-Country Racing|pmc=1748408|publisher=NATA Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooling vests are also used by persons with [[multiple sclerosis]]. In multiple sclerosis, nerve fibers become demyelinated which leads to pain and discomfort when temperature is elevated. Nerve fibers may also be remyelinating or in the process of repairing themselves and still be sensitive to elevated temperatures. The cooling vest keeps the patient's temperature down, reducing the pain symptoms. In 2005, a 12-week study at the [[University of Buffalo]] was funded by the [[National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research]], a division of the [[U.S. Department of Education]], to determine if people with multiple sclerosis could exercise longer with the help of a cooling vest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/news/fast-execute.cgi/article-page.html?article=76110009 |title=Can Cooling Affect Exercise for Those with MS? - UB NewsCenter |publisher=Buffalo.edu |date=2005-10-31 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Androgens increased in response to exercise, particularly resistance, while cortisol only increased with resistance. DHEA increased with resistance exercise and remained elevated during recovery in resistance-trained subjects.

==Aerobic==

A year long, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program increased DHT and SHBG in sedentary men age 40–75, but had no effect on other androgens. Both DHT and SHBG increased 14% in exercisers at 3 months, and at 12 months they remained 9% above baseline. SHBG is protective against DHT as it binds free androgen.&lt;ref name="Hawkins"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hawkins VN, Foster-Schubert K, Chubak J, Sorensen B, Ulrich CM, Stancyzk FZ, Plymate S, Stanford J, White E, Potter JD, McTiernan A | title = Effect of Exercise on Serum Sex Hormones in Men | journal = Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 223–233 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18202581 | pmc = 3040039 | doi = 10.1249/mss.0b013e31815bbba9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In acute assessment of hormone levels in soccer players before, during and after a game, DHT and testosterone increased during the match, but returned to baseline after 45 minutes rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lupo C, Baldi L, Bonifazi M, Lodi L, Martelli G, Viti A, Carli G | title = Androgen levels following a football match | journal = European journal of applied physiology and occupational physiology | volume = 54 | issue = 5 | pages = 494–496 | year = 1985 | pmid = 4085477 | doi = 10.1007/bf00422958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerobic exercise in Japanese rats done on a rodent treadmill doubled local concentrations of DHT in calf muscles as assessed by protein assay.&lt;ref name="fatrats"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sato K, Iemitsu M, Aizawa K, Mesaki N, Ajisaka R, Fujita S | title = DHEA administration and exercise training improves insulin resistance in obese rats | journal = Nutrition &amp; Metabolism | volume = 9 | pages = 47 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22647230 | pmc = 3433349 | doi = 10.1186/1743-7075-9-47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After intense aerobic effort, high endurance athletes were also found to have lower free testosterone the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Daly W, Seegers CA, Rubin DA, Dobridge JD, Hackney AC | title = Relationship between stress hormones and testosterone with prolonged endurance exercise | journal = European Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 375–380 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15618989 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00421-004-1223-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In prolonged endurance exercise, such as a marathon, levels ultimately decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dressendorfer RH, Wade CE | title = Effects of a 15-d race on plasma steroid levels and leg muscle fitness in runners | journal = Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 954–958 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1956271 | doi=10.1249/00005768-199108000-00012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, DHT drops, while adrenal androgen and cortisol will increase with the stress response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morville R, Pesquies PC, Guezennec CY, Serrurier BD, Guignard M | title = Plasma variations in testicular and adrenal androgens during prolonged physical exercise in man | journal = Annales d'endocrinologie | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 501–510 | year = 1979 | pmid = 518032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anaerobic==
[[File:TwoDumbbells.JPG|thumb|right|Effects of anaerobic exercise also vary with length of time.]]
It is unknown if anaerobic training changes individual hormone profiles, or if conditioned athletes in studies self-selected because of physiologic predisposition to athletic conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bunt JC | title = Hormonal alterations due to exercise | journal = Sports Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 331–345 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3529282 | doi = 10.2165/00007256-198603050-00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is variation of response to anaerobic stress depending on exercise intensity, age, gender, length of time studied, and time at which serum indices were drawn. Most studies report that testosterone increases or is unchanged acutely, though some even report it to decrease. Anaerobic exercisers have testosterone levels below sedentary controls in cross sectional analysis. Over months to years, levels are stable to slightly increased.

Interval and quality of exercise also affect hormonal response. Sessions of moderate to high intensity with multiple sets and short time intervals, during which energy is derived from glycolytic lactate metabolism, appear to be the greatest stimulus for steroid hormone response. Hormonal response in young men varies with the number of sets in the exercise session. However, when the number increased from 4 to 6, anabolic levels stabilized and cortisol continued to rise, suggesting that alterations in anaerobic volume could alter anabolic and catabolic hormonal balance.&lt;ref name="Smil2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smilios I, Pilianidis T, Karamouzis M, Tokmakidis SP | title = Hormonal Responses after Various Resistance Exercise Protocols | journal = Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 644–654 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12673149 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1249/01.MSS.0000058366.04460.5F }}&lt;/ref&gt; When sets are performed at maximum repetitions, interval has no influence at a certain intensity range, with no acute hormone response difference between protocols at 10 maximum reps with 2- and 5-minute intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ahtiainen JP, Pakarinen A, Alen M, Kraemer WJ, Häkkinen K | title = Short vs. Long Rest Period Between the Sets in Hypertrophic Resistance Training: Influence on Muscle Strength, Size, and Hormonal Adaptations in Trained Men | journal = The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 572–582 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16095405 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1519/15604.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a higher total testosterone response in hypertrophy protocols compared to those for strength and power, despite equalization of total work load (defined as load x sets x repetitions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McCaulley GO, McBride JM, Cormie P, Hudson MB, Nuzzo JL, Quindry JC, Travis Triplett N | title = Acute hormonal and neuromuscular responses to hypertrophy, strength and power type resistance exercise | journal = European Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 105 | issue = 5 | pages = 695–704 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19066934 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00421-008-0951-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a 27% greater testosterone response using protocols with simultaneous use of all four limbs.

The '''Football War''' ({{lang-es|La guerra del fútbol}}; [[colloquial]]: '''Soccer War''' or the '''100 Hours War''') was a brief [[war]] fought between [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]] in 1969. Existing tensions between the two countries coincided with rioting during a [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|1970 FIFA World Cup qualifier]]. The war began on 14 July 1969, when the Salvadoran military launched an attack against Honduras. The [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) negotiated a cease-fire on the night of 18 July (hence "100 Hour War"), which took full effect on 20 July. Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in early August.

==Context==
Although the nickname "Football War" implies that the conflict was due to a football match, the causes of the war go much deeper. The roots were issues over land reform in [[Honduras]] and immigration and demographic problems in [[El Salvador]]. Honduras is more than five times the size of neighboring El Salvador, but in 1969 the population of El Salvador (3.7 million) was some 40% higher than that of Honduras (2.6 million). At the beginning of the 20th century, Salvadorans had begun migrating to Honduras in large numbers. By 1969 more than 300,000 Salvadorans were living in Honduras. These Salvadorans made up 20% of the present population of Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;Acker, Allison. ''Honduras: The Making of a Banana Republic''. Toronto: Between the Lines, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Honduras, as in much of Central America, a large majority of the land was owned by large landowners or big corporations. The [[United Fruit Company]] owned 10% of the land, making it hard for the average landowner to compete. In 1966  United Fruit banded together with many other large companies to create la Federación Nacional de Agricultores y Ganaderos de Honduras (FENAGH; the National Federation of Farmers and Livestock-Farmers of Honduras). FENAGH was anti-peasantry (against the [[Tenant farmer|campesino]]) as well as anti-Salvadoran. This group put pressure on the Honduran president, Gen. [[Oswaldo López Arellano]], to protect the property rights of wealthy landowners.&lt;ref name=Anderson-1981&gt;Anderson, Thomas P. ''The War of the Dispossessed: Honduras and El Salvador 1969''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|64-75}}

In 1962 Honduras successfully enacted a new [[land reform]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb5.loc.gov/glin/jurisdictions/Honduras/pdfs/155709-206648.pdf|title=La Gaceta Dec. 5, 1962 (Library of Congress) |publisher=Content.glin.gov |date= |accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fully enforced by 1967, this law gave the central government and municipalities much of the land occupied illegally by Salvadoran immigrants and redistributed it to native-born Hondurans as specified by the Land Reform Law. The land was taken from both immigrant farmers and squatters regardless of their claims to ownership or immigration status. This created problems for Salvadorans and Hondurans who were married. Thousands of Salvadoran laborers were expelled from Honduras, including both migrant workers and longer-term settlers. This general rise in tensions ultimately led to a military conflict.

==Buildup==
In June 1969, [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] and [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] met in a two-leg [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|1970 FIFA World Cup qualifier]]. There was fighting between fans at the first game in the Honduran capital of [[Tegucigalpa]] on 8 June 1969, which Honduras won {{nowrap|1–0}}. The second game, on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of [[San Salvador]], which was won 3–0 by El Salvador, was followed by even greater violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wars and Peace Treaties, 1816-1991 |last=Goldstein |first=Erik |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=978-0-203-97682-1 |pages=195–6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjWnMm53xQ8C&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=football+war+honduras+el+salvador# |accessdate=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 June 1969, the day the play-off match took place in [[Mexico City]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=djft3U1LymYC&amp;dat=19690628&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en| "Soccer 'War' Won By El Salvador, 3-2]; Troops Still Alerted", ''Pittsburgh Press'', June 28, 1969, p1&lt;/ref&gt;, El Salvador dissolved all diplomatic ties with Honduras, stating that in the ten days since the game in El Salvador 11,700 Salvadorans had been forced to flee Honduras. It said that as Honduras had "done nothing to prevent murder, oppression, rape, plundering and the mass expulsion of Salvadoreans", there was little point in maintaining relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football's diplomatic penalty|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 June 1969|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It further claimed that "the government of Honduras has not taken any effective measures to punish these crimes which constitute genocide, nor has it given assurances of indemnification or reparations for the damages caused to Salvadorans".&lt;ref name=Anderson-1981/&gt;{{RP|105}} El Salvador won the decisive third game 3–2 after [[extra time]].

Late in the afternoon of 14 July 1969, the concerted military action began. El Salvador was put on a blackout and the [[Salvadoran Air Force]], using passenger airplanes with explosives strapped to their sides as bombers, attacked targets inside Honduras. Salvadoran air-raid targets included [[Toncontín International Airport]], which left the [[Honduran Air Force]] unable to react quickly. The larger [[Salvadoran Army]] launched major offensives along the two main roads connecting the two nations and invaded Honduras. The invasion phase was perpetrated by three main contingents: the Chalatenago Theater, the North Theater, and the East Theater. The Chalatenango Theater was based on the northwest side of El Salvador, including the departments of [[Santa Ana Department|Santa Ana]] and [[Chalatenango Department|Chalatenango]], across the mountain range close to the border, and the [[Sumpul River]]. This was a strategic region due to its rich soil and climate; however, this Theater would not see any fighting as it was to deploy only in case of Honduran penetration into El Salvador. The North Theater was composed of a small unit of armored vehicles and a large amount of manpower. The East Theater was to deploy in the departments of [[La Unión Department|La Unión]] and [[Morazán Department|Morazán]]. This Theater was composed of a large mechanized division, [[armored fighting vehicle]]s such as the [[M3 Stuart]] and a large amount of artillery such as the [[105mm M101]].

Nicaraguan dictator [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] helped Honduras by providing weapons and ammunition{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

Initially, rapid progress was made by the Salvadoran army. By the evening of 15 July, the [[Military of Honduras|Honduran army]] had been pushed back over eight kilometers. The departmental capital of [[Nueva Ocotepeque]] fell shortly after along with eight other cities, placing the Salvadoran army within striking distance of the Honduran capital [[Tegucigalpa]]. The momentum of the advance did not last, however.

The Honduran air force reacted by striking the Salvadoran [[Ilopango International Airport|Ilopango airbase]]. Honduran bombers attacked for the first time in the morning of 16 July. When the bombs began to fall, Salvadoran anti-air artillery started firing, repelling some of the bombers. The bombers had orders to attack the [[Acajutla]] Port, where the main oil facilities of El Salvador were based. Honduran air-raid targets also included minor oil facilities such as the ones in {{illm|Cutuco|es|Puerto Cutuco|ceb|Puerto Cutuco}}. By the evening of 16 July, huge pillars of smoke arose in the Salvadoran coastline from the burning oil depots that had been bombed.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Both sides deployed [[World War II]] era design aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Spencer C. |editor-last=Tucker |title=A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East |publisher=ABC-CLIO |date=2009 |page=2463}}&lt;/ref&gt; All planes in the engagement were of U.S. origin.  [[North American P-51|Cavalier P-51D Mustangs]], [[Vought F4U Corsair|F4U-1, -4 and -5 Corsairs]], [[North American T-28 Trojan|T-28A Trojans]], [[North American T-6 Texan|AT-6C Texans]] and even [[Douglas C-47|C-47 Skytrains]] converted into bombers saw action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Overall |first=Mario |title=The Hundred Hour War: Honduras versus El Salvador |journal=[[Air Enthusiast]] |issue=118 |date=July–August 2005 |pages=8–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 17, Honduran Vought F4U Corsairs engaged a flight of Salvadorian Goodyear FG-1D Corsairs and Cavalier Mustangs — militarized versions of civilian air racing P-51s. During the duel, a Honduran pilot named Fernando Soto shot down three of the Salvadorian planes. El Salvador continued to fly its surviving Corsairs into 1975; Honduras didn’t retire its fleet until 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://militaryhistorynow.com/2013/10/16/the-last-gunfighters-historys-final-piston-engine-interceptors/|title=The Last Gunfighters – History’s Final Piston-Engine Interceptors|website=Military History Now|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war was the last conflict in which piston-engined fighters fought each other.

==Cease-fire==
The Honduran government called on the OAS to intervene, fearing that the nearing Salvadoran Army would invade the capital Tegucigalpa. The OAS met in an urgent session on 15 July and called for an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal of El Salvador's forces from Honduras. El Salvador resisted the pressures from the OAS for several days, demanding that Honduras first agree to pay reparations for the attacks on Salvadoran citizens and guarantee the safety of those Salvadorans remaining in Honduras. A cease-fire was arranged on the night of 18 July; it took full effect only on 20 July. El Salvador continued until 29 July to resist pressures to withdraw its troops. Then a combination of pressures led El Salvador to agree to a withdrawal in the first days of August. Those persuasive pressures included the possibility of OAS economic sanctions against El Salvador and the dispatch of OAS observers to Honduras to oversee the security of Salvadorans remaining in that country. The actual war had lasted just over four days, but it would take more than a decade to arrive at a final peace settlement.

==Withdrawal==
[[File:Lynn Garrison F4U-7 Corsair 133693 N693M.png|thumb| F4U Corsair, one of the piston types flown in the war]] 
[[El Salvador]] finally withdrew its troops on 2 August 1969. On that date, [[Honduras]] guaranteed Salvadoran President [[Fidel Sánchez Hernández]] that the Honduran government would provide adequate safety for the Salvadorans still living in Honduras. Sánchez had also asked that reparations be paid to the Salvadoran citizens as well, but that was never accepted by Hondurans. There were also heavy pressures from the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] and the debilitating repercussions that would take place if El Salvador continued to resist withdrawing their troops from Honduras.

==Consequences==
Both sides of the Football War suffered extensive casualties. Some 300,000 Salvadorans were displaced, many had been forcibly exiled or had fled from war-torn Honduras, only to enter an El Salvador in which the government was not welcoming. Most of these refugees were forced to provide for themselves with very little assistance. Over the next few years, more Salvadorans returned to their native land, where they encountered overpopulation and extreme poverty.&lt;ref name=Anderson-1981/&gt;{{RP|145-155}}

El Salvador suffered about 900 mostly civilian dead. Honduras lost 250 combat troops, and over 2,000 civilians during the four-day war. Most of the war was fought on Honduran soil and thousands more were made homeless. Trade between Honduras and El Salvador had been greatly disrupted, and the border officially closed. This damaged the economies of these nations tremendously and threatened the [[Central American Common Market]] (CACM).
*The war resulted in a 22-year suspension of the CACM, a regional integration project that had been set up by the United States largely as a means of counteracting the effects of the [[Cuban Revolution]].
*The political power of the military in both countries was reinforced. In the Salvadoran legislative elections that followed, candidates of the governing [[National Conciliation Party]] (''Partido de Conciliación Nacional'', PCN), were largely drawn from the ranks of the military. Having apologized for their role in the conflict, they proved very successful in elections at the national and local levels. In contrast to the gradual democratization process that had characterized the 1960s, the military establishment would exercise increasing control
*The social situation in El Salvador worsened, as the government proved unable to satisfy the economic needs of its citizens deported from Honduras. The resulting social unrest was one of the causes of the [[El Salvador Civil War]], which followed approximately a decade later

==Aftermath==
Eleven years after the war the two nations signed a peace treaty on 30 October 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb5.loc.gov/glin/jurisdictions/El_Salvador/pdfs/12624-26952.pdf |title=Diario Oficial Nov. 13, 1980(Library of Congress) |publisher=Content.glin.gov |date= |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and agreed to resolve the border dispute over the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] and five sections of land boundary through the [[International Court of Justice]]. In 1992, the Court awarded most of the disputed territory to Honduras, and in 1998, Honduras and El Salvador signed a border demarcation treaty to implement the terms of the ICJ decree. The total disputed land area given to Honduras after the court's ruling was around {{convert|374.5|sqkm|sqmi|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}. In the Gulf of Fonseca the court found that Honduras held sovereignty over the island of [[Tiger Island|El Tigre]], and El Salvador over the islands of [[Meanguera del Golfo|Meanguera]] and Meanguerita.&lt;ref name="Kawas"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kawas, Jorge|title=El Salvador: Sovereignty issues over Gulf of Fonseca|date=18 March 2013|work=Pulsa Merica|url=http://www.pulsamerica.co.uk/2013/03/18/el-salvador-sovereignty-issues-over-gulf-of-fonseca/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute continued despite the ICJ ruling. At a meeting in March 2012 President [[Porfirio Lobo]] of Honduras, President [[Otto Pérez]] of Guatemala, and President [[Daniel Ortega]] of Nicaragua all agreed that the Gulf of Fonseca would be designated as a peace zone. El Salvador was not at the meeting.  However, in December 2012, El Salvador agreed to a tripartite commission of government representatives from El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua that was to take care of territorial disputes through peaceful means and come up with a solution by 1 March 2013. The commission did not meet after December, and in March 2013 stiff letters threatening military action were exchanged between Honduras and El Salvador.&lt;ref name="Kawas" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3969">The '''Deutsche Kampfspiele''' ([[English language|English]]: German Combat Games) were a [[Multi-sport event|national multi-sport event]] established in 1922 by the [[:de:Deutscher Reichsausschuss für Leibesübungen|Deutscher Reichsausschuss für Leibesübungen]] under [[Carl Diem]].

== Deutsche Kampfspiele ==

The events lasted from 1922 to 1934. According to Diem the games should promote "[[German art]], [[German song]] and German [[Volksgemeinschaft]]". In 1938 they were replaced by the [[Deutsches Turn- und Sportfest 1938]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Zentner]] and [[Friedeman Bedurftig]] ''[[The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich]]'' New York: Macmillan 1991 p.329&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary film was made of the 1922 games, ''Die deutschen Kampfspiele 1922'', produced by [[Arnold Fanck]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmportal.de/film/die-deutschen-kampfspiele-1922_4d6a6df07687478fbc89f91c516a7c47  Die deutschen Kampfspiele 1922]&lt;/ref&gt; A two part documentary ''Zweite Deutsche Kampfspiele. 1.

== NS-Kampspiele ==
During the Nazi regime, the fighting games continued as NS-fighting games. Since Germany had been allowed to participate in the Olympics since 1928, these games were no longer to be understood as a counter-movement to the Olympic idea, but rather as a propaganda platform for the regime. When, in 1935, the international boycott movement against the Olympic Games in Berlin in 1936 grew markedly, the replacement of German combat games in Berlin was Plan B of the [[Reichssportführer]]. On the order of Adolf Hitler on November 30, 1936, these games were held during the [[Reichsparteitage]] in Nuremberg from 1937 to 1938, with regional preliminary decisions for the main games. In addition to the NSDAP, the SA, SS, NSKK and HJ also participated in the predominantly military sports competitions, such as hand grenade targets, 30-meter swimming in a drizzle suit with a pack or 15-kilometer baggage in closed formations Wehrmacht and the police. The SA had the responsibility for these paramilitary events. The outbreak of war in 1939 ended the short episode of the NS combat games.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eckart Dietzfelbinger]] ''Nürnberg - Ort der Massen: Das Reichsparteitagsgelände.

'''Glasses''', also known as '''eyeglasses''' or '''spectacles''', are devices consisting of glass or hard plastic [[lens (optics)|lenses]] mounted in a frame that holds them in front of a person's [[Human eye|eyes]], typically using a bridge over the nose and arms which rest over the ears.

Glasses are typically used for [[Corrective lens|vision correction]], such as with reading glasses and glasses used for [[nearsightedness]].

Safety glasses provide [[eye protection]] against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses may have protection for the sides of the eyes as well as in the lenses. Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible [[light]] or [[radiation]]. Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports, such as [[squash (sport)|squash]].

Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off during movement or sports. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck, to prevent the loss of the glasses and breaking.

[[Sunglasses]] allow better vision in bright daylight, and may protect one's eyes against damage from high levels of [[ultraviolet light]]. Typical sunglasses are darkened for protection against bright light or glare; some specialized glasses are clear in dark or indoor conditions, but turn into sunglasses when in bright light. Most sunglasses do not have corrective power in the lenses; however, special prescription sunglasses can be ordered.

Specialized glasses may be used for viewing specific visual information, for example [[3D glasses]] for [[3D films]] ([[stereoscopy]]). Sometimes glasses are worn purely for fashion or aesthetic purposes. Even with glasses used for vision correction, a wide range of fashions are available, using plastic, wire, and other materials.

People are more likely to need glasses the older they get with 93% of people between the age of 65-75 wearing corrective lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2011/06/22/good-question-why-do-so-many-of-us-need-glasses/|title=Good Question: Why Do So Many Of Us Need Glasses?|first=Liz|last=Collin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.essilorusa.com/stories/detail/vision-impact-institute-releases-study-on-corrective-lens-wearers-in-the-u|title=Newsroom|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Glasses can be marked or found by their primary function, but also appear in combinations such as prescription sunglasses or safety glasses with enhanced magnification.

=== Corrective ===
{{Main|Corrective lens|Refractive error}}
[[File:Refraction through glasses 090306.jpg|thumb|[[Seattle]] [[skyline]] as seen through a corrective lens, showing the effect of [[refraction]]]]

Corrective lenses are used to correct [[refractive error]]s by bending the light entering the eye in order to alleviate the effects of conditions such as [[myopia|nearsightedness (myopia)]], [[hypermetropia|farsightedness (hypermetropia)]] or [[astigmatism]]. The ability of one's eyes to accommodate their focus to near and distant focus alters over time. A common condition in people over forty years old is [[presbyopia]], which is caused by the eye's [[lens (anatomy)|crystalline lens]] losing elasticity, progressively reducing the ability of the lens to [[accommodation (eye)|accommodate]] (i.e. to focus on objects close to the eye). Few people have a pair of eyes that show exactly equal refractive characteristics; one eye may need a "stronger" (i.e. more refracting) lens than the other.

Corrective lenses bring the image back into focus on the retina. They are made to conform to the [[Eyeglass prescription|prescription]] of an [[ophthalmologist]] or [[optometrist]]. A [[lensmeter]] can be used to verify the specifications of an existing pair of glasses. Corrective eyeglasses can significantly improve the [[life quality]] of the wearer. Not only do they enhance the wearer's visual experience, but can also reduce problems that result from eye strain, such as [[headaches]] or squinting.

The most common type of corrective lens is "single vision", which has a uniform [[refractive index]]. For people with [[presbyopia]] and [[hyperopia]], [[bifocals|bifocal]] and [[trifocal]] glasses provide two or three different refractive indices, respectively, and [[progressive lenses]] have a continuous gradient.

[[Reading glasses]] provide a separate set of glasses for focusing on close-by objects. Reading glasses are available without prescription from [[drugstore]]s, and offer a cheap, practical solution, though these have a pair of simple lenses of equal power, so will not correct refraction problems like [[astigmatism]] or refractive or prismatic variations between the left and right eye. For total correction of the individual's sight, glasses complying to a recent ophthalmic prescription are required.

[[Adjustable-focus eyeglasses]] might be used to replace bifocals or trifocals, or might be used to produce cheaper single-vision glasses (since they don't have to be custom-manufactured for every person).

[[Pinhole glasses]] are a type of corrective glasses that do not use a lens. Pinhole glasses do not actually refract the light or change focal length. Instead, they create a [[diffraction]] limited system, which has an increased depth of field, similar to using a small [[aperture]] in [[photography]].  This form of correction has many limitations that prevent it from gaining popularity in everyday use. Pinhole glasses can be made in a [[DIY]] fashion by making small holes in a piece of card which is then held in front of the eyes with a strap or cardboard arms.

=== Safety ===
{{See also|Eye protection}}
[[File:SafetyGlassesShield.jpg|thumb|[[Eye protection|Safety glasses]] with side shields]]

Safety glasses are worn to protect the eyes in different situations.  They are made with break-proof plastic lenses to protect the eye from flying debris or other matter. Construction workers, factory workers, machinists and lab technicians are often required to wear safety glasses to shield the eyes from flying debris or hazardous splatters such as blood or chemicals. As of 2017, dentists and surgeons in Canada and other countries are required to wear safety glasses to protect against infection from patients' blood or other body fluids. There are also safety glasses for [[welding]], which are styled like wraparound sunglasses, but with much darker lenses, for use in welding where a full sized [[welding helmet]] is inconvenient or uncomfortable. These are often called "flash goggles", because they provide protection from welding flash. [[Nylon]] frames are usually used for protection eyewear for sports because of their lightweight and flexible properties. Unlike most regular glasses, safety glasses often include protection beside the eyes as well as in front of the eyes.

=== Sunglasses ===
{{Main|Sunglasses}}

Sunglasses provide improved comfort and protection against bright [[visible light|light]] and often against [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light. To properly protect the eyes from the dangers of UV light, sunglasses should have UV-400 blocker to provide good coverage against the entire light spectrum that poses a danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/brandpublishing/sfl-sunglasses-not-just-an-accessory-in-the-sunshine-state-20180312-story.html|title=Sunglasses not just an accessory in the Sunshine State|last=Solutions|first=Sun Sentinel Content|work=Sun-Sentinel.com|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Photochromic lens]]es, which are [[Photosensitivity|photosensitive]], darken when struck by UV light.  The dark tint of the lenses in a pair of sunglasses blocks the transmission of light through the lens.

Light [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] is an added feature that can be applied to sunglass lenses. Polarization filters are positioned to remove horizontally polarized rays of light, which eliminates glare from horizontal surfaces (allowing wearers to see into water when reflected light would otherwise overwhelm the scene). Polarized sunglasses may present some difficulties for pilots since reflections from water and other structures often used to gauge altitude may be removed.  [[Liquid-crystal display]]s often emit polarized light making them sometimes difficult to view with polarized sunglasses. Sunglasses may be worn just for aesthetic purposes, or simply to hide the eyes. Examples of sunglasses that were popular for these reasons include teashades and [[Mirrorshades (fashion)|mirrorshades]]. Many [[blindness|blind]] people wear nearly opaque glasses to hide their eyes for cosmetic reasons.

Sunglasses may also have corrective lenses, which requires a prescription.  Clip-on sunglasses or sunglass clips can be attached to another pair of glasses.  Some wrap-around sunglasses are large enough to be worn over top of another pair of glasses.  Otherwise, many people opt to wear [[contact lens]]es to correct their vision so that standard sunglasses can be used.

=== Mixed doubleframe ===
[[File:Doubleframe uplifting eyewear - Nella.gif|thumb|left|Doubleframe eyewear with one set of lenses on the moving frame and another pair of lenses on fixed frame (optional).]]
The doubleframe uplifting glasses have one moving frame with one pair of lenses and the basic fixed frame with another pair of lenses (optional), that are connected by [[four-bar linkage]]. For example, sunlenses could be easily lifted up and down while mixed with [[myopia]] lenses that always stay on. [[Presbyopia]] lenses could be also combined and easily removed from field of view if needed without taking off glasses.

=== 3D glasses ===
{{Main|Stereoscopy#3D viewers|l1=3D Viewers}}
The [[Stereoscopy|illusion of three dimensions]] on a two dimensional surface can be created by providing each eye with different visual information. 3D glasses create the illusion of three dimensions by filtering a signal containing information for both eyes.  The signal, often light reflected off a movie screen or emitted from an electronic display, is filtered so that each eye receives a slightly different image. The filters only work for the type of signal they were designed for.

[[Anaglyph 3D]] glasses have a different colored filter for each eye, typically red and blue or red and green. A [[polarized 3D system]] on the other hand uses [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] filters. Polarized 3D glasses allow for color 3D, while the red-blue lenses produce an image with distorted coloration. An [[active shutter 3D system]] uses electronic [[Shutter (photography)|shutters]]. [[Head-mounted display]]s can filter the signal electronically and then transmit light directly into the viewers eyes.

Anaglyph and polarized glasses are distributed to audiences at [[3D film|3D movies]].  Polarized and active shutter glasses are used with many home theaters.  Head-mounted displays are used by a single person, but the input signal can be shared between multiple units.

=== Magnification (bioptics) ===
Glasses can also provide magnification that is useful for people with vision impairments or specific occupational demands.  An example would be ''[[Bioptics (device)|bioptics]]'' or  ''bioptic telescopes'' which have small [[telescope]]s mounted on, in, or behind their regular lenses. Newer designs use smaller lightweight telescopes, which can be embedded into the corrective glass and improve aesthetic appearance (mini telescopic spectacles). They may take the form of self-contained glasses that resemble [[goggles]] or [[binoculars]], or may be attached to existing glasses.

=== Yellow-tinted computer/gaming glasses ===
Yellow tinted glasses are a type of glasses with a minor yellow tint. They perform minor color correction, on top of reducing headaches due to lack of blinking. They may also be considered minor corrective unprescribed glasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/blue-blocking-glasses-science-screens-not-destroying-vision-2017-2|title=Computer glasses that claim to protect your eyes from screens are selling like crazy, but they probably aren't doing you much good|last=Loria|first=Kevin|date=21 February 2017|website=Business Insider|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the company, these computer or gaming glasses can also filter out high energy blue and ultra-violet light from LCD screens, fluorescent lighting, and other sources of light. This allows for reduced eye-strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutvision.com/cvs/irritated.htm|title=Computer Eye Strain: 10 Steps For Relief|last=Heiting|first=Gary|date=|website=All about vision.com|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These glasses can be ordered as standard or prescription lenses that fit into standard optical frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blutechlenses.com/technology/|title=BluTech Lenses – Technology, The story behind BluTech Lenses|work=BluTech Lenses}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the ultra-violet light blocking nature of these lenses, they also help users sleep at night along with reducing age-related macular degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.essilorusa.com/stories/detail/new-eyeglass-lenses-block-harmful-blue-light-and-uv-raysM|title=Expert Healthy Vision &amp; Eye Care Tips, News, Articles &amp; Information – Essilor USA|work=essilorusa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=protect your vision|url=http://www.bluelightexposed.com/protect-our-vision/#how-can-you-protect-your-vision-against-the-harmful-effects-of-blue-light-exposure|website=Blue light exposed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-glare protection glasses ===
Anti-glare protection glasses, or anti-reflective glasses, can reduce the reflection of light that enters our eyes. The lenses are given an anti-glare coating to prevent reflections of light under different lighting conditions. By reducing the amount of glare on your eyes, vision can be improved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The anti-glare also applies to the outer glass, thus allowing for better eye contact.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-glare Coating|url=http://www.allaboutvision.com/lenses/anti-reflective.htm|website=All about Vision.com|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frames ==
[[File:Szemüveg - 1920-as évek.JPG|thumb|Glasses, {{circa|lk=no|1920s}}, with springy cable temples]]
The ophthalmic frame is the part of a pair of glasses which is designed to hold the lenses in proper position.
Ophthalmic frames come in a variety of styles, sizes, materials, shapes, and colors.&lt;ref name="Optical Course"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.harisingh.com/OpticalCourse.htm | title=Optical Course | publisher=OpticalCourse.com | accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parts ===
* pair of eye wires or rims surrounding and holding the lenses in place
* bridge which connects the two eye wires
* chassis, the combination of the eye wires and the bridge
* top bar or brow bar, a bar just above the bridge providing structural support and/or style enhancement. The addition of a top bar makes a pair of glasses [[Ray-Ban Aviator|aviator eyeglasses]]
* pair of brows or caps, plastic or metal caps which fit over the top of the eye wires for style enhancement and to provide additional support for the lenses. The addition of brows makes a pair of glasses [[browline glasses]]
* pair of nose pads that allows a comfortable resting of the eye wires on the nose
* pair of pad arms connects the nose pads to the eye wires
* pair of temples (earpieces) on either side of the skull
* pair of temple tips at the ends of the temples
* pair of end pieces connects the eye wires via the hinges to the temples
* pair of frame-front end pieces
* pair of hinges connects the end pieces to the temples, allowing a swivel movement. Spring-loaded flex hinges are a variant that are equipped with a small spring that affords the temples a greater range of movement and does not limit them to the traditional, 90 degree angle. Repairs can be made by using Self Aligning Spring Hinge Screws. Use screw insertion pliers to push the tip beyond the first barrel of a spring hinge at a 45 degree angle and use a standard screwdriver to tighten. As the screw moves down the barrel, it will move to a 90 degree angle. When finished, use a plier to break off the excess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vigoroptical.com/sealsphi.html|title=Self Aligning Spring Hinge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temple types ===
* Skull temples: bend down behind the ears, follow the contour of the skull and rest evenly against the skull
* Library temples: generally straight and do not bend down behind the ears. Hold the glasses primarily through light pressure against the side of the skull
* Convertible temples: used either as library or skull temples depending on the bent
* Riding bow temples: curve around the ear and extend down to the level of the ear lobe. Used mostly on athletic, children's, and industrial safety frames;
* Comfort cable temples: similar to the riding bow, but made from a [[Elasticity (physics)|springy]] cable of coiled metal, sometimes inside a plastic or silicone sleeve. The tightness of the curl can be adjusted along its whole length, allowing the frame to fit the wearer's ear curve perfectly. Used for physically active wearers, children, and people with high prescriptions (heavy lenses).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eyeglasseswarehouse.com/replacementcabletemples.html |title=Cable Temples |access-date=27 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127174407/http://www.eyeglasseswarehouse.com/replacementcabletemples.html |archive-date=27 January 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.optiboard.com/forums/showthread.php/21175-Cable-conversion-temple-covers|title=Cable conversion temple covers|website=www.optiboard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the image of 1920s frames above.

== Corrective lens shape ==
[[File:Brille eingeklappt fcm.jpg|thumb|Modern glasses with a rectangular lens shape]]

Corrective lenses can be produced in many different shapes from a circular lens called a lens blank.  Lens blanks are cut to fit the shape of the frame that will hold them.  Frame styles vary and fashion trends change over time, resulting in a multitude of lens shapes.  For lower power lenses, there are few restrictions which allows for many trendy and fashionable shapes.  Higher power lenses can cause distortion of peripheral vision and may become thick and heavy if a large lens shape is used.  However, if the lens becomes too small, the field of view can be drastically reduced.

[[Bifocals|Bifocal]], [[Trifocal lenses|trifocal]], and [[progressive lens]]es generally require a taller lens shape to leave room for the different segments while preserving an adequate field of view through each segment. Frames with rounded edges are the most efficient for correcting [[myopia|myopic]] prescriptions, with perfectly round frames being the most efficient. Before the advent of eyeglasses as a fashion item, when frames were constructed with only functionality in mind, virtually all eyeglasses were either round, oval, or curved octagons. It was not until glasses began to be seen as an accessory that different shapes were introduced to be more aesthetically pleasing than functional.

=== Precursors ===
{{see|Reading stone}}
[[File:Hugh specs.jpg|thumb|Detail of a portrait of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Cardinal and renowned biblical scholar [[Hugh of Saint-Cher]] painted by [[Tommaso da Modena]] in 1352]]
[[File:El Greco 048.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of cardinal [[Fernando Niño de Guevara]] by [[El Greco]] circa 1600 shows glasses with temples passing over and beyond the ears]]

Scattered evidence exists for use of vision aid devices in Greek and Roman times, most prominently the use of an emerald by emperor Nero as mentioned by Pliny the Elder.&lt;ref&gt;The Natural History, Book 37, Chpt.16. Pliny the Elder. John Bostock, M.D., F.R.S. H.T. Riley, Esq., B.A. London. Taylor and Francis, Red Lion Court, Fleet Street. 1855&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of a [[Lens (optics)|convex lens]] to form an enlarged/magnified image was most likely described in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Optics'' (which however only survives in a poor Arabic translation). Ptolemy's description of lenses was commented upon and improved by [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]] (10th century) and most notably by [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]] (''[[Book of Optics]]'', ca. 1021). [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Latin translations]] of Ptolemy's ''Optics'' and of Alhazen became available in Europe in the 12th century, coinciding with the development of "[[reading stone]]s".

[[Robert Grosseteste]]'s treatise ''De iride'' ("On the Rainbow"), written between 1220 and 1235, mentions using optics to "read the smallest letters at incredible distances". A few years later in 1262, [[Roger Bacon]] is also known to have written on the magnifying properties of lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=...Optics Highlights: II. Spectacles | publisher =University of Maryland, Department of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering |url=http://www.ece.umd.edu/~taylor/optics2.htm |accessdate=2007-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The development of the first eyeglasses took place in Northern Italy in the second half of the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Kriss"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Kriss|first1 = Timothy C|last2 = Kriss|first2 = Vesna Martich|title = History of the Operating Microscope: From Magnifying Glass to Microneurosurgery|journal = Neurosurgery|volume = 42|issue = 4|pages = 899–907|date = April 1998|doi = 10.1097/00006123-199804000-00116|pmid = 9574655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently of the development of optical lenses, some cultures developed "[[sunglasses]]" for eye protection, without any corrective properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/sunglasses.htm |title= Sunglasses History – The Invention of Sunglasses |accessdate= 2007-06-28 |last=Ament |first=Phil |date= 4 December 2006 | work =The Great Idea Finder |publisher=Vaunt Design Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus,  flat panes of [[smoky quartz]], were used in 12th-century China.{{Refn | group="lower-alpha" | Chinese judges wore dark glasses to hide their facial expressions during court proceedings.{{Sfn | Needham | 1962 | p = 121}}}} Similarly, the [[Inuit]] have used [[Inuit snow goggles|snow goggles]] for eye protection.

=== Invention ===
[[File:Conrad von Soest, 'Brillenapostel' (1403).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The ''Glasses Apostle'' by [[Conrad von Soest]] (1403)]]
The first eyeglasses were made in Northern Italy, most likely in [[Pisa]], by about 1290:
In a sermon delivered on 23 February 1306, the Dominican friar [[Jordan of Pisa|Giordano da Pisa]] (ca. 1255–1311) wrote "It is not yet twenty years since there was found the art of making eyeglasses, which make for good vision... And it is so short a time that this new art, never before extant, was discovered.&amp;nbsp;... I saw the one who first discovered and practiced it, and I talked to him."{{Sfn | Ilardi | 2007 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=peIL7hVQUmwC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 5]}}

Giordano's colleague Friar Alessandro della Spina of Pisa (d. 1313) was soon making eyeglasses. The ''Ancient Chronicle of the Dominican Monastery of St. Catherine in Pisa'' records: "Eyeglasses, having first been made by someone else, who was unwilling to share them, he [Spina] made them and shared them with everyone with a cheerful and willing heart."{{Sfn | Ilardi | 2007 | p = 6}} By 1301, there were guild regulations in Venice governing the sale of eyeglasses.{{Sfn | Ilardi | 2007 | p = 9}}

[[File:Medieval Spectacles.jpg|thumb|left|Seated apostle holding lenses in position for reading. Detail from ''[[Death of the Virgin]]'', by the [[Master of Heiligenkreuz]], ca. 1400–30 ([[Getty Center]]).]][[File:Scissors glasses.jpg|thumb|French Empire gilt [[Scissors-glasses|scissors glasses]] (with one lens missing), {{circa|lk=no|1805}}]]
The earliest pictorial evidence for the use of eyeglasses is [[Tommaso da Modena]]'s 1352 portrait of the cardinal Hugh de Provence reading in a [[scriptorium]]. Another early example would be a depiction of eyeglasses found north of the [[Alps]] in an altarpiece of the church of [[Bad Wildungen]], [[Germany]], in 1403. These early glasses had [[convex lenses]] that could correct both [[hyperopia]] (farsightedness), and the [[presbyopia]] that commonly develops as a symptom of [[aging]]. It was not until 1604 that [[Johannes Kepler]] published the first correct explanation as to why convex and concave lenses could correct presbyopia and [[myopia]].{{Refn | group="lower-alpha" | In his treatise ''Ad Vitellionem paralipomena'' [Emendations (or Supplement) to Witelo] (1604), Kepler explained how eyeglass lenses compensate for the distortions that are caused by presbyopia or myopia, so that the image is once again properly focused on the retina.{{Sfn|Ilardi|2007|p=244}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1=Vasco |last1=Ronchi |last2=Rosen |first2=Edward |title=Optics: The Science of Vision |place=Mineola, [[New York (state)|NY]] |publisher=Dover Publications |year=1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ht695-SFJYoC&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early frames for glasses consisted of two magnifying glasses [[rivet]]ed together by the handles so that they could grip the nose. These are referred to as "rivet spectacles". The earliest surviving examples were found under the floorboards at [[Kloster Wienhausen]], a [[convent]] near [[Celle]] in Germany; they have been dated to ''circa'' 1400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/college/museyeum/online_exhibitions/spectacles/rivet.cfm |title=Rivet spectacles |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2015 |website=www.college-optometrists.org |publisher=The College of Optometrists |access-date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other claims ====
Claims that [[Salvino degli Armati]] of Florence invented eyeglasses have been exposed as hoaxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Edward | last = Rosen | year = 1956 | title = The invention of eyeglasses | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences | volume = 11 | pages = 13–46 (part 1), 183–218 (part 2) | doi=10.1093/jhmas/xi.2.183}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Ilardi | 2007 | pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=peIL7hVQUmwC&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 13-18]}}

[[Marco Polo]] is sometimes claimed to have encountered eyeglasses during his travels in China in the 13th century. However, no such statement appears in his accounts.{{Sfn | Needham | 1962 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=oJ9nayZZ2oEC&amp;pg=119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 119, footnote c]}}&lt;ref name="Hirschberg 1911 265"&gt;{{Citation | first = Julius | last = Hirschberg | chapter = Geschichte der Augenheilkunde |trans-chapter=History of Ophthamology | page = 265 | editor1-first = Alfred K | editor1-last = Graef | editor2-first = Theodor | editor2-last = Saemisch | title = Handbuch der gesamten Augenheilkunde |trans-title=Handbook of all ophthalmology | place = Leipzig, [[Germany|DE]] | publisher = Wilhelm Engelmann | year = 1911 | volume = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the earliest mentions of eyeglasses in China occur in the 15th century and those Chinese sources state that eyeglasses were imported.{{Sfn | Needham | 1962 | p = 119}}

It is also sometimes claimed that glasses were first invented in India. In 1907 Professor [[Berthold Laufer]] stated in his history of glasses that ''"the opinion that spectacles originated in India is of the greatest probability and that spectacles must have been known in India earlier than in Europe"''.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, Berthold (1907) [https://books.google.com/books?id=UgGgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA379#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Geschichte der Brille"] (History of eyeglasses), ''Mitteilungen zur Geschichte der Medizin und der Naturwissenschaften'' (Communications on the History of Medicine and the Sciences), '''6''' (4) :  379-385.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Joseph Needham showed that the mention of glasses in the manuscript Laufer used to justify the prior invention of them in Asia did not exist in older versions of that manuscript, and the reference to them in later versions was added during the Ming dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Science and Civilization in China Vol 4.1 | pages=118–119 | url=http://monoskop.org/images/7/70/Needham_Joseph_Science_and_Civilisation_in_China_Vol_4-1_Physics_and_Physical_Technology_Physics.pdf | accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1971 article in the British Journal of Ophthalmology it was argued that it: ''"...is therefore most likely that the use of lenses reached Europe via the Arabs, as did Hindu mathematics and the ophthalmological works of the ancient Hindu surgeon Susruta"'',&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R. K. (1971) "Origin of spectacles in India," ''[[British Journal of Ophthalmology]]'', '''55''' (2) : 128-129.

=== Later developments ===

[[File:Harry S. Truman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Harry S. Truman]], 33rd [[President of the United States]], was known to have poor vision.]]

The [[United States|American]] scientist [[Benjamin Franklin]], who suffered from both [[myopia]] and [[presbyopia]], invented [[bifocals]]. Serious historians have from time to time produced evidence to suggest that others may have preceded him in the invention; however, a correspondence between [[George Whatley]] and [[John Fenno]], editor of ''[[The Gazette of the United States]]'', suggested that Franklin had indeed invented bifocals, and perhaps 50 years earlier than had been originally thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'Inventor' of Bifocals?|publisher=The College of Optometrists|url=http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/knowledge-centre/museyeum/online_exhibitions/artgallery/bifocals.cfm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613044912/http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/knowledge-centre/museyeum/online_exhibitions/artgallery/bifocals.cfm|archivedate=13 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first lenses for correcting astigmatism were designed by the [[United Kingdom|British]] astronomer [[George Airy]] in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lucasianchair.org/19/airy.html|title=Sir George Biddell Airy|last=Bruen|first=Robert|work=The Lucasian Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge University|publisher=Robert Bruen|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the construction of frames for glasses also evolved. Early eyepieces were designed to be either held in place by hand or by exerting pressure on the nose (''[[pince-nez]]''). [[Girolamo Savonarola]] suggested that eyepieces could be held in place by a ribbon passed over the wearer's head, this in turn secured by the weight of a [[hat]]. The modern style of glasses, held by temples passing over the ears, was developed some time before 1727, possibly by the British optician [[Edward Scarlett]]. These designs were not immediately successful, however, and various styles with attached handles such as "[[scissors-glasses]]" and [[lorgnette]]s were also fashionable from the second half of the 18th century and into the early 19th century.

In the early 20th century, [[Moritz von Rohr]] and [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] (with the assistance of H. Boegehold and A. Sonnefeld&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.zeiss.com/C12567A100537AB9/Contents-Frame/6B49EEA709EAE719C1256919003DAE2B |title=Eyeglass Lenses and Visual Aids from Industrial Production |publisher= Zeiss | accessdate =2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;), developed the Zeiss Punktal spherical point-focus lenses that dominated the eyeglass lens field for many years. In 2008, [[Joshua Silver]] designed eyewear with adjustable corrective glasses. They work by silicone liquid, a syringe, and a pressure mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/adspecs-eyeglasses-could-provide-sight-for-a-billion.html|title=Adspecs Eyeglasses Could Provide Sight for a Billion|work=TreeHugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the increasing popularity of [[contact lenses]] and [[laser]] [[Refractive surgery|corrective eye surgery]], glasses remain very common, as their technology has improved. For instance, it is now possible to purchase frames made of special [[memory metal]] alloys that return to their correct shape after being bent. Other frames have spring-loaded hinges. Either of these designs offers dramatically better ability to withstand the stresses of daily wear and the occasional accident. Modern frames are also often made from strong, light-weight materials such as [[titanium]] alloys, which were not available in earlier times.

===In fashion===
In the 1930s, "spectacles" were described as "medical appliances."&lt;ref name="pullin"&gt;{{cite book | author = Pullin, Graham et al. | date = 2009 | chapter = Fashion Meets Discretion | title = Design Meets Disability | location = Cambridge | publisher = MIT Press | pages = 13–64 | isbn = 9780262162555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing spectacles was sometimes considered socially humiliating. 
In the 1970s, fashionable glasses started to become available through manufacturers, and governments also recognized the demand for stylized eyewear.&lt;ref name="pullin" /&gt;

Graham Pullin describes how devices for disability, like glasses, have traditionally been designed to camouflage against the skin and restore ability without being visible.&lt;ref name="pullin" /&gt; In the past, design for disability has "been less about projecting a positive image as about trying not to project an image at all."&lt;ref name="pullin" /&gt; Pullin uses the example of spectacles, traditionally categorized as a medical device for "patients", and outlines how they are now described as eyewear: a fashionable accessory.&lt;ref name="pullin" /&gt; Much like other fashion designs and accessories, eyewear is created by designers, has reputable labels, and comes in collections, by season and designer.&lt;ref name="pullin" /&gt; It is becoming more common for consumers purchase eyewear with clear, non-prescription lenses, illustrating that glasses are no longer a social stigma, but a fashionable accessory that "frames your face."&lt;ref name="pullin" /&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Market===
The market for spectacles has been characterized as having highly [[inelastic demand]], and advertising restrictions in the USA have correlated with higher prices, suggesting that adverts make the spectacles market more [[Price competition|price-competitive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24100330 |doi=10.1086/466740|title=The Effects of Advertising on the Price of Eye Glasses|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|volume=15|issue=2|pages=337–52|year=&lt;!--October or February, depending on source --&gt;1972|last1=Benham|first1=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be [[monopolistically competitive]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

There are claims that insufficiently free [[market competition]] inflates the prices of frames, which cost an average of $25-$50 US to make, to an average retail price of $300 in the United States. This claim is disputed by some in the industry.&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/does-luxottica-own-80-of-the-eyeglass-industry/|title=Does Luxottica Own 80% of the Eyeglass Industry?|work=snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sticker-shock-why-are-glasses-so-expensive-07-10-2012/1/|title=Why are glasses so expensive?|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIXTYMINUTES2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sticker shock: Why are glasses so expensive?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57527151/sticker-shock-why-are-glasses-so-expensive/|newspaper=[[60 Minutes]]|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=7 October 2012|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Luxottica#Criticism]].)

Many people require glasses for the reasons listed above.  There are many shapes, colors, and materials that can be used when designing frames and lenses that can be utilized in various combinations.  Oftentimes, the selection of a frame is made based on how it will affect the appearance of the wearer.  Some people with good natural eyesight like to wear eyeglasses as a style accessory.

==== Personal image ====
For most of their history, eyeglasses were seen as unfashionable, and carried several potentially negative connotations: wearing glasses caused individuals to be stigmatized and stereotyped as pious clergymen (as those in religious vocation were the most likely to be literate and therefore the most likely to need reading glasses), elderly, or physically weak and passive.&lt;ref name=mount&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.seikoeyewear.com/CE/CECourse.cfm?ceID=6 | title = Eyewear | contribution = Understanding Three-Piece Mounting | publisher = Seiko | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081028204353/http://www.seikoeyewear.com/CE/CECourse.cfm?ceID=6 | archivedate = 28 October 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = har&gt;{{Citation | url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:ZFCwrjE3p_IJ:www.haroldlloyd.us/index2.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26do_pdf%3D1%26id%3D28+harold+lloyd+glasses&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESj_MCop6_2_lT0-IZxl98FMNlCqvG0K49hJEesJFSUHGeSYJ1JXJjadjDH3wCKD3odO6TDmtBQEeaKRbEONoEtEO56bfmnl8YuqswoBnveM9drSRQyxrwqAKSBZvwEetYF0bP6K&amp;sig=AHIEtbS_WjGJbmXTL_p3fxf9uf474ksuJA | last = Lloyd | first = Annette | title = The Fashion of Harold Lloyd | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stigma began to fall away in the early 1900s when the popular [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was regularly photographed wearing eyeglasses, and in the 1910s when popular comedian [[Harold Lloyd]] began wearing a pair of [[horn-rimmed glasses]] as the "Glasses" character in his films.&lt;ref name = mount /&gt;&lt;ref name=har /&gt;

[[File:BarryGoldwater.jpg|thumb|left|Former United States senator [[Barry Goldwater]] in [[horn-rimmed glasses]]]]
Since, eyeglasses have become an acceptable fashion item and often act as a key component in individuals' personal image. Musicians [[Buddy Holly]] and [[John Lennon]] became synonymous with the styles of eye-glasses they wore to the point that thick, black horn-rimmed glasses are often called "Buddy Holly glasses" and perfectly round metal eyeglass frames called "John Lennon (or [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]) Glasses." [[United Kingdom|British]] comedic actor [[Eric Sykes]] was known in the United Kingdom for wearing thick, square, horn-rimmed glasses, which were in fact a sophisticated [[hearing aid]] that alleviated his [[deafness]] by allowing him to "hear" vibrations.&lt;ref name= eric&gt;{{Citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4134965.stm | publisher = BBC | title = News | first = Eric | last = Sykes | contribution = Comedy Great | date = 31 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some celebrities have become so associated with their eyeglasses that they continued to wear them even after taking alternate measures against vision problems: United States Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] and comedian [[Drew Carey]] continued to wear non-prescription glasses after being fitted for [[contacts]] and getting [[LASIK|laser eye surgery]], respectively.

Other celebrities have used glasses to differentiate themselves from the characters they play, such as [[Anne Kirkbride]], who wore oversized, 1980s-style round horn-rimmed glasses as [[Deirdre Barlow]] in the soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'', and [[Masaharu Morimoto]], who wears glasses to separate his professional persona as a [[chef]] from his stage persona as [[Iron Chef]] [[Japan]]ese. In 2012 some [[NBA]] players wear [[lensless glasses]] with thick plastic frames like [[horn-rimmed glasses]] during [[Post-game show|post-game interviews]], [[geek chic]] that draws comparisons to [[Steve Urkel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0330Drfkk |title=Whacky NBA Playoff Fashion! |publisher= Google | work = YouTube | accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-nba"&gt;{{citation |last= Cacciola |first= Scott |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303822204577466402604980564?mod=WSJ_article_MoreIn_TheA-Hed |title=NBA Finals: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Other Fashion Plates of the NBA Make Specs of Themselves | edition = oline | newspaper = The Wall Street Journal |date=14 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[superhero]] fiction, eyeglasses have become a standard component of various heroes' disguises (as masks), allowing them to adopt a nondescript demeanor when they are not in their superhero personae: [[Superman]] is well known for wearing 1950s style horn-rimmed glasses as [[Clark Kent]], while [[Wonder Woman]] wears either round, Harold Lloyd style glasses or 1970s style [[bug-eye glasses]] as [[Diana Prince]]. An example of the [[halo effect]] is seen in the [[stereotype]] that those who wear glasses are intelligent.

'''Groundshare''' is the principle of sharing a stadium between two local sport teams. This is usually done for the purpose of reducing the costs of either construction of two separate facilities and related maintenance.&lt;ref name="main"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/tottenham/article2821147.ece Main Article]-Main Article&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of groundshare==

===Intersport Groundshares===
Given sufficient compatibility between facility requirements, two teams that do not play the same sport may share a ground or a stadium. North American indoor arenas commonly feature [[basketball]] and [[ice hockey]] teams sharing the facility during their common fall-to-spring season; a layer of insulation and a basketball floor can easily be laid over or removed from the hockey rink, and dasherboards disassembled or reconfigured, in a matter of hours.  Historically [[baseball]] and [[American football]] teams often shared a large general-purpose outdoor or domed stadium, particularly during the [[multi-purpose stadium]] era of the 1960s-1990s, despite the dissimilarity of their fields.&lt;ref name="main" /&gt; This practice fell out of fashion in the 1990s as baseball teams constructed highly specialized stadia in which football fields fit awkwardly if at all.  Football teams in turn built more specifically rectangular stadia, often with a floor slightly wider than American football requirements to comfortably accommodate domestic or international soccer as American spectator interest in that sport grew.

A variation on the groundshare concept exists commonly within the [[NBA]] and the [[NHL]].  As the requirements for a regulation NHL hockey rink and a regulation NBA basketball court do not differ significantly, in the majority of cases where a metropolitan area has both an NBA and an NHL franchise, the teams share the same arena.

===Intrasport Groundshares===
This is two teams that play the same sport share the same ground. These may be two non-competing teams who play at different levels, such as [[Bury F.C.]], renting [[Gigg Lane]] to [[F.C. United of Manchester]] in [[England]].&lt;ref name="main" /&gt;

===Intraleague Groundshare===
This is where two teams in the same league share the same ground, such as the [[New York Giants]] and [[New York Jets]] sharing [[MetLife Stadium]].

In the American [[NBA]], only two franchises share one arena: both the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] share [[Staples Center]].

{{International opposition to Apartheid}}
'''Halt All Racist Tours''' ('''HART''') was a protest group set up in New Zealand in 1969 to protest against [[rugby union]] tours to and from [[South Africa]].

==Chronology==
Up until 1970, South Africa refused to allow mixed-race sports teams to tour South Africa, and they were not happy about having to play against "natives" in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao67TeA/c16.html|title=In Support of the New Zealand Maori Councils Decision in Favour of the 1970 All Black Tour|last=Magee|first=Eve J.|journal=Te Ao Hou|issue=67|date=July 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protest movement against the [[1960 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa]] used the slogan "No Maoris, No Tour", but it was unsuccessful at stopping the tour. In 1967, the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] decided to cancel the proposed 1967 tour over the issue.

Trevor Richards, [[Tom Newnham]] and others formed HART in 1969 to protest against the proposed [[1970 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|1970 tour]]. The tour went ahead after the South Africans agreed to accept a mixed-race team.

In 1973, HART promised a campaign of civil disruption if the [[Springboks]] toured New Zealand. The [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] Prime Minister, [[Norman Kirk]], prohibited the tour. Rugby supporters objected, complaining that politics should not interfere in sport.

The [[All Blacks]] were next due to [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|tour South Africa in 1976]]. Newly elected [[New Zealand National Party|National]] Prime Minister [[Rob Muldoon]] refused to cancel the tour, which went ahead. Subsequently Commonwealth leaders adopted the [[Gleneagles Agreement]] whereby they agreed to discourage sporting contact with South Africa. 21 African nations boycotted the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]] in protest against the [[All Black]] tour of South Africa.

HART merged with the National Anti-Apartheid Council in 1980 to become HART: NZAAM (Halt All Racist Tours: New Zealand Anti-Apartheid Movement). After ten years as National Chairperson, Richards was replaced by [[John Minto]].

The high point of protest was around the [[1981 Springbok Tour]] in which thousands of New Zealanders protested, invaded pitches, and were involved in [[civil disobedience]] to stretch police resources. HART was not the leading body in these protests, as broader organisations were set up in each major centre to coordinate protests, but HART members played a leading role in these organisations.

In 1985, a planned All Black tour of South Africa was stopped by the [[New Zealand High Court]] after [[Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union|two lawyers sued the NZRFU]], claiming such a tour would breach the NZRFU's constitution. An unofficial tour did take place in 1986 by a team including the majority of the All Blacks players selected for the previous year's cancelled tour. These were known as the [[New Zealand Cavaliers]], but often advertised inside the Republic as the All Blacks or alternatively depicted with the [[Silver Fern]]. HART organised nationwide protests, but they were much smaller than the 1981 protests.

HART's reason for existence ended with the [[dismantling of apartheid]] by the South African government. &lt;!--- Anyone know when it was formally wound up? ----&gt;

[[File:Ice hockey puck - 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A standard hockey puck]]

A '''hockey puck''' is a disk made of [[vulcanized]] [[rubber]] that serves the same functions in various games as a [[ball]] does in ball games. The best-known use of pucks is in [[ice hockey]], a major international sport.

==Origins==
Ice hockey and its various precursor games utilized balls until the late 19th century. By the 1870s, flat pucks were made of wood as well as rubber. At first, pucks were square. The [[First indoor ice hockey game|first recorded organized game]] of ice hockey used a wooden puck, to prevent it from leaving the rink of play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Hockey: A People's History |last = McKinley |first = Michael |publisher = McClelland &amp; Stewart |year = 2006 |isbn = 0-7710-5769-5 |location = Toronto |page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubber pucks were first made by slicing a rubber ball, then trimming the disc square. The [[Montreal Victorias|Victoria Hockey Club]] of Montreal is credited with making and using the first round pucks, in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work = The Gazette |location = Montreal |title = McGill Man Tells of How First Rules for Hockey Were Written |date = December 17, 1936 |page = 17 |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0b0tAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oZgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=1883%20montreal%20winter%20carnival&amp;pg=5799%2C2185856 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many indigenous persons throughout North America played a version of field hockey which involved some type of "puck" or ball, and curved wooden sticks. It was first observed by Europeans being played by [[Mi'kmaq]]s in [[Nova Scotia]] in the late 17th century. It was called "ricket" by the Mi'kmaqs. Eventually, they began to carve pucks from cherrywood, which was the puck of preference until late in the century when rubber imported by Euro-Americans replaced the wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nativehockey.com/history/ |title = History of Native Hockey |publisher = Nativehockey.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The origin of the word ''puck'' is obscure. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] suggests the name is related to the verb ''to puck'' (a [[cognate]] of ''poke'') used in the game of [[hurling]] for striking or pushing the ball, from the Scottish Gaelic ''puc'' or the Irish ''poc'', meaning "to poke, punch or deliver a blow":&lt;ref name="Beauchamp 1943"&gt;{{cite news |first = J. Clem |last = Beauchamp |title = &lt;!--Give the title--&gt; |work = Montreal Star |date = September 1943 }}, citing Joyce 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joyce 1910"&gt;{{Cite book |title = English as We Speak It in Ireland |first = P.W. |last = Joyce |year = 1910 |location =  |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that settlers of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], many of whom were Irish and played [[hurling]], may have introduced the word to Canada. The first known printed reference was in Montreal, in 1876 (''Montreal Gazette'' of February 7, 1876), just a year after the [[First indoor hockey game|first indoor game]] was played there.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

A hockey puck is also referred to colloquially as a "biscuit". To put the "biscuit in the basket" (colloquial for the goal) is to score a goal.

==In ice hockey==
Ice hockey requires a hard disk of vulcanized rubber. A standard ice hockey puck is black, {{convert|1|in|mm}} thick, {{convert|3|in|mm}} in diameter, and weighs between {{convert|5.5|and|6|oz|g|0}};&lt;ref name="eNotes"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/hockey-puck |title = Hockey Puck: How Products are Made |publisher = eNotes |accessdate = October 29, 2009 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110404043526/http://www.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/hockey-puck |archivedate = April 4, 2011 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; some pucks are heavier or lighter than standard ''(see [[#Variations|below]])''. Pucks are often marked with [[Silkscreening|silkscreened]] team or league logos on one or both faces.&lt;ref name="eNotes" /&gt; Pucks are frozen before the game to reduce bouncing during play.&lt;ref name="eNotes"/&gt;

===Variations===
There are several variations on the standard black, {{convert|6|oz|g|adj=on}} hockey puck. One of the most common is a blue, {{convert|4|oz|g|adj=on}} puck that is used for training younger players who are not yet able to use a standard puck. Heavier {{convert|10|oz|g|adj=on}} training pucks, typically reddish pink or reddish orange in colour, are also available for players looking to develop the strength of their shots or improve their stick handling skills. Players looking to increase wrist strength often practice with steel pucks that weigh {{convert|2|lb|g}}; these pucks are not used for shooting, as they could seriously harm other players. White pucks are used for [[Goaltender (ice hockey)|goaltender]] practice. These are regulation size and weight, but made from white rubber. A hollow, light-weight fluorescent orange puck is available for road or floor hockey. Other variants, some with plastic ball-bearings or glides, are available for use for road or roller hockey.{{Citation needed|date = October 2017}}

Two major developments have been devised to create better puck visibility on [[television]] broadcasts, but both were short-lived:

====Firepuck====

The use of a "Firepuck" in the early 1990s was the first attempt to improve the visibility of hockey pucks as seen on television. This invention incorporated coloured retro reflective materials of either embedded lens elements or prismatic reflectors laminated into recesses on the flat surfaces and the vertical edge of a standard hockey puck. Yellow was the preferred reflected colour. A spotlight was required to be positioned on the TV camera and focused at the centre of the viewing area.

A short demonstration tape of the [[Minnesota North Stars]] skating with the Firepuck was shown during the period break at the [[1993 NHL All-Star Game]] in Montreal. The [[International Hockey League (1945–2001)|International Hockey League]] (IHL) pursued testing the Firepuck with its inventor, Donald Klassen. The next television viewing was the IHL All-Star Game in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], January 1994, where the Firepuck was used for the entire game. The IHL tested the Firepuck in two more games, and finally the [[East Coast Hockey League]] used it January 17, 1997, for their all-star game.

The use of the Firepuck was discontinued because of these reasons:
* The slight structural change increased the tendency for the puck to bounce on the ice. This made it more difficult for the goaltender and resulted in increased scoring.
* The skaters objected to the use of camera spotlights which reflected off the ice.
* The television viewing contrast of the Firepuck was not noticeably enhanced when the camera view was of the entire rink, this being the most common camera shot.

The Firepuck name was branded during the 1990s but has since been discontinued.

====Smart puck====
{{See also|FoxTrax}}

The [[FoxTrax]] "smart puck" was developed by the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox television network]] when it held [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) broadcasting rights for the United States. The puck had integrated electronics to track its position on screen; a blue streak traced the path of the puck across the ice. The streak would turn red if the puck was shot especially hard. This was an experiment in broadcasting intended to help viewers unfamiliar with hockey to better follow the game by making the puck more visible. It was ill-received by many traditional hockey fans, but appreciated by many of the more casual viewers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The system debuted with much publicity in the NHL All-Star game at the Boston [[FleetCenter (Boston)|Fleet Center]] on January 20, 1996, but the system was shelved when Fox Sports lost the NHL broadcast rights three years later.{{citation need|date = October 2017}}

===In game play===
During a game, pucks can reach speeds of {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} or more when struck. [[Zdeno Chára]], whose [[slapshot]] clocked {{convert|108.8|mph|km/h}} in the [[2013 NHL All-Star Game]] SuperSkills competition, broke his own earlier record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/Video-Chara-breaks-own-Hardest-Shot-record-hit?urn=nhl-314198 |title = Chara breaks own Hardest Shot record, hits 105.9 mph |publisher = Yahoo! Sports Puck Daddy |accessdate = March 4, 2011 |date = January 29, 2011 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The current world record is held by [[Denis Kulyash]] of [[KHL]]'s [[Avangard Omsk]], who slapped a puck at the 2011 KHL All-Star Game skills competition in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]] with a speed of {{convert|110|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://rt.com/sport/hockey/khl-star-jagr/ |title = World record for fastest slap shot beaten at KHL All-Star game |publisher = RT |accessdate = March 4, 2011 |date = February 6, 2011 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120715071952/http://rt.com/sport/hockey/khl-star-jagr/ |archivedate = July 15, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Fast-flying pucks are potentially dangerous to players and spectators. Puck-related injuries at hockey games are not uncommon. This led to the evolution of various types of protective gear for players, most notably the [[goaltender mask]]. The most serious incident involving a spectator took place on March 18, 2002, when a 13-year-old girl, [[Brittanie Cecil]], died two days after being struck on the head by a hockey puck deflected into the crowd at a NHL game between the [[Calgary Flames]] and [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. This is the only known incident of this type to have occurred in the history of the league. Partly as a result of this event, the glass or [[Acrylic glass|plexiglass]] panels that sit atop the boards of hockey rinks to protect spectators have been supplemented with mesh nets that extend above the upper edge of the glass.

===Manufacture===
NHL regulation pucks were not ''required'' for professional play until the 1990–91 season, but were standardized for consistent play and ease of manufacture half a century earlier, by [[Art Ross]], in 1940.&lt;ref name="eNotes" /&gt; Major manufacturers of pucks exist in Canada, Russia, the [[Czech Republic]], the [[People's Republic of China]],&lt;ref name="eNotes" /&gt;{{Better source|date=February 2014}} and [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Vestenice |first = Dolne |url = http://www.slovakheritage.org/Misc/pucksvegum.htm |title = Hockey Pucks from Vegum |magazine = Slovak Heritage Live |volume =  6 |issue = 3 |date = Fall 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The black rubber of the puck is made up of a mix of natural rubber, antioxidants, bonding materials and other chemicals to achieve a balance of [[hardness]] and [[tensile strength|resilience]].&lt;ref name="QNHL.com video"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://sciencehack.com/videos/view/0xFbO4sQjPw |title = How it's made: Hockey Pucks |publisher = ScienceHack |accessdate = October 29, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This mixture is then turned in a machine with metal rollers, where workers add extra natural rubber, and ensure that the mixing is even. Samples are then put into a machine that analyses if the rubber will harden at the right temperature. An automated apparatus, called a [[pultrusion]] machine,&lt;ref name="eNotes" /&gt; extrudes the rubber into long circular logs that are {{convert|3|in|cm}} in diameter and then cut into {{convert|1|in|cm}} thick pieces while still soft. These pre-forms are then manually put into moulds that are the exact size of a finished puck.&lt;ref name="QNHL.com video" /&gt; There are up to 200 mould cavities per moulding palette, capable of producing up to 5,000 pucks per week.&lt;ref name="eNotes" /&gt; The moulds are then compressed. This compression may be done cold&lt;ref name="eNotes" /&gt; or with the moulds heated to {{convert|300|°F|°C|abbr=on}} for 18 minutes,&lt;ref name="QNHL.com video" /&gt; depending on the proprietary methods of the manufacturer. They come out hard and then are allowed to sit for 24 hours. Each puck is manually cleaned with a trimmer machine to remove excess rubber. The moulding process adds a diamond cross-hatch texture around the edge of the puck for more friction between the stick and puck for better control and puck handling.&lt;ref name="QNHL.com video" /&gt;

The practice pucks are made by a similar but faster process that uses larger pre-forms, {{convert|4|–|5|in|cm|abbr=on}} thick, puts them into moulds automatically, and applies more pressure and heat over a shorter period of time to compress the puck into the standard size. This allows approximately twice as many pucks to be manufactured in the same time period as the more exacting production of NHL regulation pucks. People sometimes freeze pucks to prevent them from sticking to the ice.&lt;ref name="eNotes" /&gt;

==In roller hockey==
[[Roller hockey]] pucks are similar to ice-hockey pucks, but made from plastic and thus lighter. They have small ribs protruding from their tops and bottoms which limit contact with the surface, allowing better sliding motion and less [[friction]].

Most commonly red, roller hockey pucks can be found in almost any colour, although light, visible colours such as red, orange, yellow, pink, and green are typical.

Roller hockey pucks were created so [[inline hockey]] and [[street hockey]] players could play with a puck instead of a ball on surfaces such as [[hardwood]], [[concrete]], and [[asphalt]].

==In underwater hockey==
[[Image:Glove-stick-puck.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Underwater Hockey puck pushed by stick]]
An [[underwater hockey]] puck (originally but now rarely referred to as a "squid" in the United Kingdom), while similar in appearance to an ice hockey puck, differs in that it has a [[lead]] core weighing approximately {{convert|3|lb|kg}} within a [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|teflon]], plastic or [[elastomer|rubber]] [[coating and printing processes|coating]]. This makes the puck [[density|dense]] enough to sink in a swimming pool, though it can be lofted during passes, while affording some protection to the pool tiles.

A smaller and lighter version of the standard puck exists for junior competition and is approximately 1&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]] 12&amp;nbsp;[[ounce|oz]] (0.80–0.85&amp;nbsp;kg) and of similar construction to the standard puck.

While there are numerous regional variations in colour, construction and materials all must conform to international regulations stipulating overall dimensions and weight. The regulations state that pucks should be a bright distinctive colour, for example high-visibility pink or orange, and that for World Championships these are the only acceptable colours.

==In other sports and games==
The term "puck" is sometimes also applied to similar (though often smaller) gaming discs in other sports and games, including [[novuss]], [[shuffleboard]], [[table shuffleboard]], [[box hockey]] and [[air hockey]].

==Alternative uses==
Ice hockey pucks of regulation {{convert|3|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter and {{convert|1|in|cm|adj=on}} thickness may be used as mechanical vibration dampening isolators in places such as feet for light industrial air compressors, and air conditioning units because they are of regulation materials and therefore consistent manufacture, size and shape, and are constructed of a repeatable and consistent vulcanized rubber material.  Since the material is rubber, it may be drilled out or milled easily to a fixed depth as rubber feet or used as rubber spacer or gasket material.  A very common use of a slotted hockey puck is as an adaptor between the metal foot of a [[trolley jack]] and the sill (rocker panel) of an automobile.  The sill has a spot-welded lip which fits into the slot of the puck and would otherwise be bent or marked by the metal foot.  Hockey pucks have been used to level furniture, beverage refrigeration systems, wedding mementos, and as paper weights or door stops.  The hockey puck has many uses other than its original, intended purpose by virtue of its consistent physical properties.

In November 2018, faculty of [[Oakland University]] in Michigan received hockey pucks and training to throw them as a possible last-ditch defense against [[active shooter]]s.  The [[American Association of University Professors]] distributed pucks to its 800 members, and is working with student groups to distribute an additional 1,700 pucks to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

"'''Hospital pass'''" is a term originally used in football codes to describe a pass that subjects the recipient to heavy contact, usually unavoidable, from an opposing player — the expression implying that the recipient of the pass could end up in [[hospital]]. The term may be applied to passes between teammates in several [[sport]]s[[sport| ]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;including [[ice hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]], [[Australian rules football]], and [[American football]] &amp;mdash; and is now widely used [[metaphor]]ically.

==Rugby league and rugby union==
A hospital pass is usually made in an attempt to avoid being tackled. The pass is often made under pressure and without considering the situation of the receiver, who is often stationary and thus presents an easy target. Alternatively, the passer is under little pressure but misreads the play and passes to a player who is already heavily marked and has little time to avoid contact.

==Australian rules football==
To be considered a hospital pass, the ball is passed with minimal [[accuracy]] or timing and likely to result in injury to the receiver due to heavy contact. Hospital passes are typically made by [[handball (Australian rules football)|handballing]] or kicking the ball towards a teammate in a high, looping [[trajectory]] or very slowly across the ground. This can enable opponents to contest for possession, resulting in heavy contact that is often, but not always, legitimate. The high, lobbed pass is considered particularly undesirable, because it gives opponents the chance to make very strong tackles.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==American football==
A "hospital pass" in American football is a pass thrown high to a receiver, generally one that is running sideways rather than running downfield. The receiver is forced to jump while running at full speed to catch the ball. A defender coming the other way, attempting to tackle the receiver, can cause a collision where both players are moving at full speed and the receiver is unable to move out of the way.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

'''Kaatsu''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: [[加圧]], often styled as '''KAATSU''' or '''K&lt;small&gt;A&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;small&gt;SU&lt;/small&gt;'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.par-golf.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/par_img/main/kaatsu/kaatsu_logo.jpg |format=JPG |title=Photographic image of Kaatsu Training Logo |website=Par-golf.co.jp |accessdate=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a patented [[Physical exercise|exercise]] method developed by Dr. Yoshiaki Sato that is based on [[blood flow moderation exercise]] (or [[vascular occlusion moderation training]]) involving compression of the [[vasculature]] proximal to the exercising [[muscle]]s by the Kaatsu Master device.

==Invention==
In 1966 at the age of 18 while Yoshiaki Sato was attending a Buddhist ceremony in his native Japan, his legs went numb while sitting in [[Seiza|the traditional Japanese posture]] on the floor.  He could barely stand the pain any longer with his legs bent underneath him.  Out of desperation, he began to massage his calves in an attempt to relieve the discomfort during the long ceremony.  He realized that his blood circulation was blocked in his calves as he was sitting directly on his feet.  This was when he conceived the original idea of blood flow moderation training.

Over the next 7 years, he experimented on himself by applying different bicycle tubes, ropes and bands at different pressures on various parts of his body.  He methodically kept track of what type of bands and pressures worked and what experiments did not.  With years of detailed trial and error, Sato gradually developed effective protocols to safely modify blood flow in his limbs.  By 1973 at the age of 25, Sato developed the details of Kaatsu as it is currently practiced.  At that time, on a ski trip, he fractured his ankle and damaged the ligaments around his knee.  The injuries were diagnosed and the doctors told Sato that it would take 6 months to heal.

With a plaster cast on, Sato rehabilitated himself with Kaatsu Bands applied to his upper leg.  He repeatedly applied Kaatsu pressure on and off while doing [[isometric exercise]]s for 30 seconds on and a few seconds off three times per day.  The results of his regimen shocked his doctor when his muscles did not atrophy and he fully recovered within 6 weeks.

Between 1973 and 1982, Sato conducted Kaatsu Training and developed protocols that worked best for people of all ages and with various kinds of afflictions.

==Patents==
In 1994, Sato applied for his first patents in Japan (Patent No. 2670421), U.S.A. (Patent No. 6149618), and Europe (UK, Germany, France, Italy with 94206403.0) as he produced the first Kaatsu Training bands.  In 1997, Sato introduced the Kaatsu Instructor educational program where his defined protocols were shared with coaches, trainers, physical therapists and physicians throughout Japan.  Over 3,000 Kaatsu Instructors were certified.

==Research==
Kaatsu Training was named one of the collaborative projects of the University of Tokyo Hospital’s 22nd Century Medical and Research Center.  Sato also began to offer an ischemic circulatory physiology course at the University of Tokyo Hospital and conducted joint development work with the Japan Manned Space Systems Corporation.

In the 1990s, Sato began joint research with Professor Naokata Ishii of the Department of Life Sciences, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, at The University of Tokyo.  Other researchers in Japan started to explore the benefits of Kaatsu and various research results were submitted to peer-review publications.  In 2009, Dr. Sato signed a joint development agreement at China’s Jilin University and the National Research Institute of Sports Science of China.  In 2014, Dr Sato established the Kaatsu Research Foundation.

==Equipment==
The second generation of KAATSU equipment was launched in 2004 with the introduction of the KAATSU Master and the KAATSU Air Bands.  The KAATSU Master device quantified and monitored the precise pressure applied to users’ legs and arms.

In 2006, Sato completed the design of a smaller, portable, programmable KAATSU device called the KAATSU Master Mini. Sato developed other applications for KAATSU users like KAATSU for speed and stamina as well as KAATSU Beauty and stress relief.  He also designed the KAATSU Chair.

[[Match fixing]] is when the outcome of a match in organized sports has been manipulated. The reason for fixing a match includes ensuring a certain team advances or gambling. Match fixing is seen as one of the biggest problems in organized sports. This page is a '''list of match fixing incidents'''.

==American football==
*In 1998, four [[Northwestern University]] football players were indicted for lying to a federal [[grand jury]] when they testified they had not placed wagers on their own games in 1994. Only one player—[[Halfback (American football)|tailback]] [[Dennis Lundy]]—was accused of fixing the game. Lundy denied in front of the grand jury to intentionally [[fumble|fumbling]] on a play during a game against the [[University of Iowa]] in 1994. Federal prosecutors attested the fumble was intentional for the purposes of point-shaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dedman |first=Bill |title=COLLEGE FOOTBALL; 4 Are Indicted in Northwestern Football Scandal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/04/sports/college-football-4-are-indicted-in-northwestern-football-scandal.html |accessdate=July 23, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=December 4, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2009: On May 6, a federal grand jury in [[Detroit]] indicted six former [[University of Toledo]] athletes—three each from the school's football and basketball programs—on charges of conspiracy to commit sports bribery in relation to their alleged involvement in a point shaving scheme that ran from 2003 through 2006. It is believed to be the first major U.S. gambling case involving two sports at the same college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=4146980 |title=Six ex-players charged with conspiracy |first=Mike |last=Fish |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=2009-05-06 |accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, four former Toledo athletes, including at least one not named in the original indictments, have pleaded guilty on charges related to the scheme. One of these, former Rockets running back Quinton Broussard, admitted he had deliberately fumbled during the [[2005 GMAC Bowl]] against [[UTEP Miners football|UTEP]] (a game ultimately won 45–13 by Toledo) in exchange for $500, and had been paid to provide confidential team information to one of the orchestrators of the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/6895890/former-toledo-rockets-player-quinton-broussard-pleads-guilty-sports-bribery-investigation |title=Quinton Broussard pleads guilty |author=Associated Press |work=ESPN.com |date=August 25, 2011 |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association football==
{{Further|Match fixing in association football}}

*In 1964, the great [[British betting scandal of 1964|British football betting scandal]] of the 1960s was uncovered. A betting ring organized by [[Jimmy Gauld]] and involving several Football League players had been fixing matches. The most famous incident involved three [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] players, including two England international players, who were subsequently banned from football for life and imprisoned after it was discovered they had bet against their team winning in a match against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. A [[1915 British football betting scandal|similar scandal]] had occurred in 1915.
*[[Totonero 1980|1980 Italian football scandal]] (''"Totonero"''): In May 1980, the largest match fixing scandal in the history of Italian football was uncovered by Italian [[Guardia di Finanza]], after the spalling of two Roman shopkeepers, Alvaro Trinca and Massimo Cruciani, who declared that some Italian football players sold the football-matches for money; implicating, among others, [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]] and [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]]. Teams were suspected of rigging games by selecting favorable referees, and even superstar Italian World Cup team goalkeeper [[Enrico Albertosi]] and future [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] winner Paolo Rossi banned with betting on football games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-499301/UEFA-target-betting-mob.html UEFA target betting mob], ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 2 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Both clubs were forcibly relegated to [[Serie B]] and Milan's president, [[Felice Colombo]], received a life ban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4985738.stm Italian FA under emergency rule], [[BBC Sport]], 16 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 1999 a [[Malaysia]]n-based betting syndicate was caught attempting to install a remote-control device to sabotage the floodlights at [[FA Premier League]] team [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]'s [[The Valley (London)|ground]] with the aid of a corrupt security officer. If the match had been abandoned after half-time, then the result and bets would have stood. Subsequent investigations showed that the gang had been responsible for previously unsuspected "floodlight failures" at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham's]] [[Boleyn Ground|ground]] in November 1997, and again a month later at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace's]] [[Selhurst Park|ground]] during a home match of Palace's groundsharing tenant [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/422742.stm | work=BBC News | title=Football guard 'bribed for sabotage' | date=1999-08-17 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/426148.stm | work=BBC News | title=Bad bets and blown lights | date=1999-08-20 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Italian Football Federation said in October 2000 it had found eight players guilty of match-fixing. Three were from Serie A side [[Atalanta Bergamo|Atalanta]] and the other five played for Serie B side [[Pistoiese]]. The players were [[Giacomo Banchelli]], [[Cristiano Doni]] and [[Sebastiano Siviglia]] (all Atalanta) and [[Alfredo Aglietti]], [[Massimiliano Allegri]], [[Daniele Amerini]], [[Gianluca Lillo]] and [[Girolamo Bizzarri]] (all Pistoiese). The charges related to an Italian Cup first round tie between the two sides in [[Bergamo]] on August 20, 2000 which ended 1–1. Atalanta scored at the end of the first half and Pistoiese equalised three minutes from full-time. Atalanta qualified for the second round. [[Snai]], which organises betting on Italian football, said later it had registered suspiciously heavy betting on the result and many of the bets were for a 1–0 halftime score and a full-time score of 1–1.
*In 2004, Portuguese Police launched the operation [[Apito Dourado]] and named several Portuguese club presidents and football personalities as suspects of match fixing, including [[FC Porto]]'s chairman [[Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa|Pinto da Costa]]. Some of the wiretaps used as proof, deemed unusable in court, can now be found on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/330214-fc-porto-leaked-phone-taps-proof-major-corruption-scandal|title=FC Porto: Leaked Phone Taps Proof in Major Corruption Scandal|author=Josep Vernet-Riera|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtqzgmhAOIk|title=Apito Dourado: António Araújo e Augusto Duarte|work=YouTube|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[2004 in sports|June 2004]] in [[South Africa]], thirty-three people (including nineteen [[referee (association football)|referees]], club officials, a match commissioner and an official of the [[South African Football Association]]) were arrested on match-fixing charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/4396904.stm|title=Anti-sleaze probe collapses |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the summer of 2004, [[Betfair]] provided evidence of race fixing to [[City of London Police]] that led to the arrest of [[jockey]] [[Kieren Fallon]] and fifteen others on race fixing charges.  On 7 December 2007 the judge in the case ordered the jury to find Fallon not guilty on all charges.
* [[Bundesliga scandal (2005)|2005 Bundesliga scandal]]: In [[2005 in sports|January 2005]], the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) and [[Germany|German]] prosecutors launched separate probes into charges that referee [[Robert Hoyzer]] bet on and fixed several matches that he worked, including a [[German Cup]] tie.  Hoyzer later admitted to the allegations; it has been reported that he was involved with [[Croatia|Croat]] gambling syndicates. He also implicated other referees and players in the match fixing scheme. The first arrests in the Hoyzer investigation were made on January 28 in [[Berlin]], and Hoyzer himself was arrested on February 12 after new evidence apparently emerged to suggest that he had been involved in fixing more matches than he had admitted to. Hoyzer has been banned for life from football by the DFB. On March 10, a second referee, Dominik Marks, was arrested after being implicated in the scheme by Hoyzer. Still later (March 24), it was reported that Hoyzer had told investigators that the gambling ring he was involved with had access to [[UEFA]]'s referee assignments for international matches and [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and [[UEFA Cup]] fixtures several days before UEFA publicly announced them. Ultimately, Hoyzer was sentenced to serve 2 years and 5 months in prison.
* In July 2005, [[Italy|Italian]] [[Serie B]] champions [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]] was placed last in the division by the sporting justice, and therefore condemned to relegation in [[Lega Pro Prima Divisione|Serie C1]], after it was revealed that they bribed their opponents in the final match of the season, [[Venezia A.C.|Venezia]] to throw the match. His president Enrico Preziozi was banned for five years after being guilty by the sporting justice. Genoa won the match 3–2 and had apparently secured promotion to [[Serie A]].
*[[Brazilian football match-fixing scandal]]: In September 2005, a [[Brazil]]ian magazine revealed that two football referees, [[Edílson Pereira de Carvalho]] (a member of [[FIFA]]'s referee staff) and Paulo José Danelon, had accepted bribes to fix matches. Soon afterwards, sport authorities ordered the replaying of 11 matches in the country's top competition, the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Campeonato Brasileiro]], that had been worked by Edílson. Both referees have been banned for life from football and face possible criminal charges. Brazilian supporters have taken to shout "Edílson" at a referee who they consider to have made a bad call against their team, in a reference to the scandal.
*2008 ''The Fix'': Book by [[Declan Hill]] alleges that in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], the group game between Ghana and Italy, the round-of-16 game between Ghana and Brazil, and the Italy-Ukraine quarter-final were all fixed by Asian gambling syndicates to whom the final scores were known in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/sport/world-cup-matches-fixed-says-author/2008/08/31/1220121049179.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=World Cup matches fixed, says author | date=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[German Football Federation]] (DFB) and [[German Football League]] (DFL) looked into claims made in a ''[[Der Spiegel]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,575586,00.html|title=Interview with Match-Fixing Investigator Declan Hill: 'I Am Sure the Game Was Manipulated'|author=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany|date=1 September 2008|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; interview with Hill that two [[Bundesliga]] matches were fixed by [[William Bee Wah Lim]] a fugitive with a 2004 conviction for match-fixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerpro.com/the-fix/ |title=Declan Hill "The Fix" match fixing interview |publisher=SoccerPro.com |accessdate=2009-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131075803/http://soccerpro.com/the-fix/ |archivedate=January 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*2008: On October 1, it was reported that a [[Spain|Spanish]] judge who headed an investigation against [[Russian Mafia]] figures uncovered information alleging that the mobsters may have attempted to fix the [[2007–08 UEFA Cup]] [[2007–08 UEFA Cup knockout stage#Semi-finals|semi-final]] between [[2008 UEFA Cup Final|eventual champion]] [[FC Zenit St. Petersburg|Zenit St. Petersburg]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]].

==Baseball==
*A game in September 1865 which resulted in a 23–11 victory for the [[Eckford of Brooklyn]] over the [[New York Mutuals]] was fixed according to confessions by those involved. Mutuals [[catcher (baseball)|catcher]] [[Bill Wansley]] was approached by gambler Kane McLoughlin to throw the game for $100. Wansley enlisted the help of the Mutuals [[third baseman]] [[Ed Duffy]] who agreed to participate if they included [[shortstop]] [[Tom Devyr]]. Wansley took the two players by [[wagon]] to the [[Hoboken Ferry]] where the payment was divided. Duffy and Devyr both received $30 each and Wansley kept $40 for himself. The fielding of those in on the fix—particularly Wansley's performance—was so poor that rumors of a fix began almost instantly. Wansley had so many [[passed ball]]s during the game that he was moved to [[right field]] in the seventh inning. [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]] wrote about the game for the ''[[New York Clipper]]'' and defended Wansley against the fixing allegations. Mutuals players who were not in on the fix became suspicious of Wansley and accused him of "wilful and designated inattention". After a formal investigation, Wansley admitted to the fix and the three players were banned from organized baseball. Devyr was allowed to return in 1867 for a short time before two complaints from opposing teams were filed against the Mutuals. In December 1867 the baseball's [[Commissioner of Baseball|National Commission]] voted to reinstate Devyr. Duffy returned to the Mutuals in 1868, but was not reinstated by the National Commission, which led to one of the Mutuals opponents to file a complaint to void the games Duffy appeared in. The complaint was successful and the Mutuals were briefly expelled from organized baseball. The final convention of the amateur baseball National Commission was held on November 30, 1870. At the convention, Mutuals president John Wildly motioned to reinstate Wansley to good standing which was approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Daniel E. |title=The Fix Is In: A History of Baseball Gambling and Game Fixing Scandals |date=2004 |publisher=McFarland |location=North Carolina |isbn=0786419202 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOjvggO19joC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson went into the stands to confront the gamblers following the game and then went back down to the field to confront players he believed were in on the fix. Two of the Mutuals players—[[John Hatfield (baseball)|John Hatfield]] and [[Nat Hicks]]—began accusing each other of being in on the fix. Hicks eventually grabbed a [[baseball bat]] and struck Ferguson in the arm which caused it to break. Ferguson, who was also a player as well as an umpire, was unable to play for one year because of the injury. No actions were taken against Hicks or any other player.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsburg, pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1877, four players for the [[Louisville Grays]] were banned from organized baseball for [[1877 Louisville Grays scandal|throwing games]]. ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' sports writer [[John Haldeman]], whose father [[Walter Haldeman]] owned the team, became suspicious of the play of the four members of the Grays and began writing in his columns that he believed the players were purposefully losing. His columns led to a formal investigation and four players—[[Jim Devlin]], [[George Hall (baseball)|George Hall]], [[Al Nichols]] and [[Bill Craver]]—were banned from organized professional baseball for life.

*An [[American League]] game on September 25, 1919 between the [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[Cleveland Indians]] was fixed according to letters ascertained by league president [[Ban Johnson]] in 1926. The letters were between Detroit [[outfielder]] [[Ty Cobb]] and Cleveland outfielder [[Smokey Joe Wood]]. They were sold to Johnson by [[pitcher (baseball)|pitcher]] [[Dutch Leonard (left-handed pitcher)|Dutch Leonard]] who was one of the four players in on the fix along with Cobb, Wood and Cleveland [[player-manager]] [[Tris Speaker]]. According to Leonard, Cobb suggested the players place bets on the game which they had already agreed to fix. Cobb denied placing any bets, but did confess to being involved in the fix. According to a retrospective of events by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in 1989, Leonard went to Johnson with the letters in 1926 after he became embittered at Cobb and Wood whom he felt had a hand in ending his career early. Johnson initially turned Leonard away and he went to Detroit owner [[Frank Navin]] with the letters. Navin advised Johnson to make a payment to Leonard to keep the letters from going public. Johnson then agreed to pay Leonard $20,000 for the letters. Following the 1926 season, Johnson called a secret meeting with Cobb and Speaker, who were the managers of their respective teams. Johnson laid out the facts and advised the men to resign their positions as managers, which both did. Cobb and Speaker both retired from playing in 1928 and neither took another managerial job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Holtzman |first1=Jerome |title=Cobb And Speaker Got Themselves Into A Real Fix |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-05-21/sports/8902030567_1_betting-dutch-leonard-ty-cobb |accessdate=July 23, 2018 |work=Chicago Tribune |date=May 21, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] broke the story on December 21, 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cobb and Speaker Named in Baseball Expose |url=http://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn84024315/1926-12-22/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=01%2F01%2F1910&amp;index=1&amp;date2=12%2F31%2F1950&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;SearchType=prox10&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Fixed+fixed+fixing+Game+game&amp;proxdistance=10&amp;to_year=1950&amp;rows=20&amp;ortext=&amp;from_year=1910&amp;proxtext=fixed+game&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=range&amp;page=1 |accessdate=July 23, 2018 |work=The Republican-Journal |date=December 22, 1926 |location=Ogdensburg, New York |page=1|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1919, gamblers bribed several members of the [[Chicago White Sox]] to throw the [[World Series]].  This became known as the [[Black Sox Scandal]] and was recounted in book and movie form as ''[[Eight Men Out]]''.
*Following the 1919 [[Pacific Coast League]] (PCL) season, [[first baseman]] [[Babe Borton]] alleged that as a member of the pennant winning [[Vernon Tigers]], he was party to pay-offs to all other PCL teams to ensure they would lose to Vernon. Borton alleged that every member of the Tigers pooled their money to make the pay-offs. Nate Raymond of [[Seattle, Washington]] was responsible for the payments according to Borton. [[Seattle Indians]] first baseman Rod Murphy alleged that Raymond offered him a $2,000 bribe during the 1920 season and confided that during the 1919 season he won $50,000 from gambling on fixed PCL games. Ultimately no player was charged with fixing games because there were no state statutes that were violated. The PCL banned several players for life, but some like [[Bill Rumler]] was reinstated after several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Figone |first1=Al |title=The 1919 Pacific Coast League Fixing Scandal: The "Black Sox" Had Nothing on Babe Borton |journal=North American Society for Sport History |date=1996 |url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP1996/NP1996zh.pdf |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For their role in the alleged plot, the five players—Bill Thomas, Lanny Pecou, Alvin W. Kaiser, Paul Fugit and Don Vettorel—were banned from [[professional baseball]] for life. An investigation of the alleged actions of the five players by [[Society for American Baseball Research]] writer George W. Hilton found little proof that there was any match-fixing. One of the accused players, Bill Thomas, [[pitcher|pitched]] a perfect 5–0 record in the playoffs. Hilton conducted an interview with an unnamed player in the Evangeline League who claimed he was approached to be a part of the fixing scheme, but declined.

In an interview with Garbey, ''Herald'' writer Peter Richmond brought up match-fixing allegations and Garbey admitted to playing a part in the scheme. Garbey was allowed to continue his minor league career, but the Tigers were prevented from calling him up by ruling of the [[Commissioner of Baseball|National Commission]] president [[John H.

This plan was not motivated by gambling, but was instead meant to manipulate tie-breaking rules for Somerset's benefit and assure qualification for the quarterfinals of the tournament. Although the plan was not against the letter of the rules, it was widely condemned by both media and cricket officials, and Somerset was expelled from that year's tournament in response.

He also named [[Saleem Malik]] ([[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]]), [[Mohammed Azharuddin]] and [[Ajay Jadeja]] ([[Indian cricket team|India]]). Jadeja was banned for 4 years.

==Handball==
*In 2012, several [[French people|French]] [[handball]] players from the [[Montpellier Handball|Montpellier]] club were arrested on allegations they fixed matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Montpellier players arrested over match-fixing |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-handball-montpellier/montpellier-players-arrested-over-match-fixing-idUSBRE88T0EN20120930?feedType=RSSandamp;feedName=sportsNews |accessdate=26 July 2018 |work=Reuters |date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, the French government pressed charges against the alleged Montpellier fixers who included [[Olympic medal]]ist [[Nikola Karabatic]], his brother [[Luka Karabatic]] and six others Montpellier players. Prosecutors alleged Montpellier, who had already sealed the French handball championship, purposefully lost to [[Cesson Rennes MHB|Cesson]] in May 2012. French authorities were tipped off to the alleged fix when discovering that over 100,000 [[euros]] in bets had been placed on the low-stakes game that prosecutors contend should have only garnered a few thousand euros in wagers. In July 2015, the 16 people indicted by French authorities for their part in the match fixing scandal—including the Karabatic brothers—were found guilty. Nikola Karabatic was fined 10,000 euros and the largest fine on 30,000 euros went to [[Mladen Bojinovic]]. None of the people were given jail sentences, despite the prosecutors request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=French handball star Karabatic found guilty of match-fixing |url=http://en.rfi.fr/sports/20150711-french-handball-player-found-guilty-match-fixing |accessdate=26 July 2018 |work=Radio France Internationale |date=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Karabatic brothers appealed the decision and in 2017, but lost and a new ruling made by the Disciplinary Committee of the [[French Handball Federation]] required Nikola Karabatic to sit out six games and Luka Karabatic to sit out two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Szekeres |first1=Ibolya |title=New verdict in match-fixing case of Karabatic brothers |url=http://timeoutmag.com/2017/11/12/new-verdict-in-match-fixing-case-of-karabatic-brothers/ |website=timeoutmag.com |publisher=Time Out Magazine |accessdate=July 26, 2018 |date=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motorsport==
[[File:Nelson Piquet 2009 Australia.jpg|thumb|[[Nelson Piquet Jr.]] admitted to [[Renault Formula One crash controversy|intentionally wrecking his Formula One car]] during a 2008 race.]]
*In September 2009, [[Formula 1]] driver [[Nelson Piquet Jr.]] admitted to have intentionally wrecked his race-car during the [[2008 Singapore Grand Prix]] due to team orders. It gave an advantage to his teammate [[Fernando Alonso]] who went on to win the race. Following a lawsuit by the [[Renault F1|Renault Formula 1 team]] against the Piquet family, a judge ruled in Piquet's favor due to overwhelming evidence against the team; fining the Renault Formula 1 team millions, lliquidating various employees, banning the team from Formula 1 for 2 years (on suspended sentence) and various key members of Renault Formula 1 team being banned for life (which was later appealed).

*In the [[NASCAR]] [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Cup Series]], the [[2013 Federated Auto Parts 400]] was scandalized by [[2013 Federated Auto Parts 400#Race manipulation controversy|extensive manipulation of the race results]] by three teams—[[Michael Waltrip Racing]], [[Penske Racing]], and [[Front Row Motorsports]]—in an attempt to ensure that MWR and Penske drivers would earn places in the [[NASCAR playoffs|Chase for the Sprint Cup]]. When the manipulation was discovered, NASCAR imposed unprecedented penalties that knocked [[Martin Truex Jr.]], one of the intended beneficiaries, out of the Chase, and also gave [[Jeff Gordon]], an unwitting victim of the manipulation, a 13th place in the normally 12-driver Chase.

*In 2016, [[Ireland|Irish]] snooker player [[Leo Fernandez]] was banned from the sport for 15 months by the [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] (WPBSA) for manipulating part of a match. While it was not a full manipulation of the match's outcome, Fernandez had contact with people that placed a [[prop bet]] which said he would chose to shoot the first foul shot of the game. Fernandez did opt to take first foul shot, thus making the bet successful. The WPBSA ruled that was a violation of their corruption bylaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leo Fernandez handed 15-month ban after admitting corruption charge |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/36722680 |accessdate=27 July 2018 |work=BBC Sport |date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Femke van den driessche-1454767232.jpg|thumb|right|Van den Driessche, the first cyclist to be sanctioned for mechanical doping.]]
'''Motor doping''', or '''mechanical doping''', in [[competitive cycling]] terminology, is a method of cheating by using a hidden [[motor]] to help propel a [[racing bicycle]]. The term is an analogy to chemical [[doping in sport]], cheating by using [[performance-enhancing drugs]]. As a form of "[[technology doping|technological fraud]]" it is banned by the {{lang|fr|[[Union Cycliste Internationale]]}}, the international governing body of cycling.

==History==
One of the first allegations of mechanical doping goes back to the [[2010 Tour of Flanders]] when [[Fabian Cancellara]] attacked [[Tom Boonen]] on a steep part of [[Muur van Geraardsbergen|Kapelmuur]] whilst unusually seated, leading to allegations that there was an electric motor hidden in Cancellara's bike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/mechanical-doping-a-brief-history/|title=Mechanical doping: A brief history|website=Cyclingnews.com|access-date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later the issue was raised again when [[Ryder Hesjedal]] was the subject of allegations of mechanical doping during the [[2014 Vuelta a España]]: Hesjedal crashed on stage seven of the race, and video footage of the crash showed his bicycle's rear wheel continuing to spin after it had fallen onto the road, leading to a number of media outlets including the website of French sports newspaper ''[[L'Equipe]]'' questioning whether the bike contained a motor, although it was suggested by ''[[Cycling Weekly]]'' that the bicycle's movement could have simply been due to it sliding on a downward gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/fresh-motorised-doping-claims-ryder-hesjedals-bike-moves-134745 |title=Fresh 'motorised doping' claims as Ryder Hesjedal's bike 'moves on its own' |last1=Wynn |first1=Nigel |date=4 September 2014 |website=[[Cycling Weekly]]|access-date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public pressure on the UCI led to the race [[Commissaire (cycling)|commissaires]] examining the bikes of Hesjedal's {{ct|GRS|2014}} team the following morning: no motors were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/ryder-hesjedals-clockwork-cervelo-uci-checks-garmin-sharp-bikes-134803 |title=Ryder Hesjedal's clockwork Cervelo: UCI checks Garmin-Sharp bikes |last1=Pryde |first1=Kenny|date=4 September 2014 |website=[[Cycling Weekly]] |access-date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following spring, checks for bike motors were carried out at [[2015 Paris–Nice|Paris–Nice]], [[2015 Milan–San Remo|Milan–San Remo]], and the [[2015 Giro d'Italia|Giro d'Italia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/uci-checks-bikes-of-contador-hesjedal-and-gilbert-for-motors-at-giro-ditalia/ |title=UCI checks bikes of Contador, Hesjedal and Gilbert for motors at Giro d'Italia |last1=Farrand |first1=Stephen |date=29 May 2015 |website=[[cyclingnews.com]] |access-date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016 – almost six years after initial allegations of a pro cyclist doping mechanically – the first confirmed use of "mechanical doping" in the sport was discovered at the [[2016 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships]] when one of the bikes of Belgian cyclist [[Femke Van den Driessche]] was found to have a secret motor inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/pro-cyclist-caught-hidden-motor-bike-race-article-1.2516543 |title=Cyclist Femke Van den Driessche caught with hidden motor inside bike during race |first1=Nathaniel |last1=Vinton |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |date=1 February 2016 |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-motorised-doping-scandal-209635 |newspaper=[[Cycling Weekly]] |title=Everything you need to know about the motorised doping scandal |first1=Stuart |last1=Clarke |date=1 February 2016 |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mobile.businessinsider.com/hidden-motor-found-attached-to-her-cyclists-bike-2016-2 |title=A cyclist has been barred from the world championships after a hidden motor was found attached to her bike |work=[[Business Insider Australia]] |first1=Peter |last1=Farquhar |date=1 February 2016 |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mah"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/cycling-what-is/2496110.html |title=Cycling: What is mechanical doping? |format=Video |publisher=Channel News Asia |location=Singapore |first1=Ewan |last1=Mah |date=7 February 2016 |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources claim that motorized doping has occurred before in professional cycling, but that it has gone undetected or unproven. It is seen as part of a larger effort by athletes in many sports to gain mechanical advantage in competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thevarsity.ca/2016/02/29/the-technical-side-of-doping/ |title=The technical side of doping: How technology helps athletes gain an unfair advantage |first1=Isaac |last1=Consenstein |newspaper=[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]] |publisher=[[University of Toronto]] |date=29 February 2016 |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010 former rider [[Davide Cassani]] demonstrated a motorised bicycle on the Italian public broadcaster [[RAI]], claiming that similar bikes had been used by some professional cyclists since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/cassani-helps-in-sporting-fraud-investigation-of-motorised-bike-59948 |title=Cassani helps in sporting fraud investigation of motorised bike |last1=Brown |first1=Gregor |date=15 June 2010 |website=[[Cycling Weekly]]|access-date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of a motor resulted in a substantial uptick in the level of scrutiny focused on bikes. The UCI has indicated it intends to expend [[Euro|€]]40,000 to 50,000 to purchase scanning equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/belgian-federation-ready-to-buy-expensive-scanner-to-deter-mechanical-doping/ |newspaper=Cycling News |title=Bengian Federation to Buy Expensive Scanner to Deter Mechanical Doping |date=21 February 2016 |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/mechanical-doping-checks-carried-out-at-omloop-het-nieuwsblad/ |newspaper=Cycling News |date=27 February 2016 |title=Race: Omloop Het Nieuwsblad Elite Mechanical doping checks carried out at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad: LottoNL-Jumbo among those subject to UCI checks |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter van de Abele of the UCI, it also has an app and tablet with which to scan bikes in seconds. The scandal spread, and is the worst in this sport since the doping scandal that engulfed [[Lance Armstrong]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="McMahon3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/cycling-mechanical-doping-scandal-2016-2 |title='Mechanical doping,' the biggest scandal to rock pro cycling since Lance Armstrong, is very real — here's what we know so far |first1=Daniel |last1=McMahon |date=12 February 2016 |work=Business Insider |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UCI regulations==
The federation's technological fraud article 12.1.013 fully states:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Technological fraud is an infringement to article 1.3.010. Technological fraud is materialised by:

"The presence, within or on the margins of a cycling competition, of a bicycle that does not comply with the provisions of article 1.3.010. The use by a rider, within or on the margins of a cycling competition, of a bicycle that does not comply with the provisions of article 1.3.010. All teams must ensure that all their bicycles are in compliance with the provisions of article 1.3.010. Any presence of a bicycle that does not comply with the provisions of article 1.3.010, within or on the margins of a cycling competition, constitutes a technological fraud by the team and the rider. All riders must ensure that any bicycle that they use is in compliance with the provisions of article 1.3.010. Any use by a rider of a bicycle that does not comply with the provisions of article 1.3.010, within or on the margins of a cycling competition, constitutes a technological fraud by the team and the rider.&lt;br/&gt;

Any technological fraud shall be sanctioned as follows:
# Rider: disqualification, suspension of a minimum of six months and a fine of between CHF 20,000 and CHF 200,000.&lt;br/&gt;
# Team: disqualification, suspension of a minimum of six months and a fine of between CHF 100,000 and CHF 1,000,000."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In pertinent part, the technical regulation plainly states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The bicycle shall be propelled solely, through a chainset, by the legs (inferior muscular chain) moving in a circular movement, without electric or other assistance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uci.ch/mm/Document/News/Rulesandregulation/16/51/61/Clarificationguideofrules2012-ENG_English.PDF |page=7 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Union Cycliste Internationale]] |title=Clarification Guide of the UCI Technical Regulation 23.04.2014 version |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''net sport''' is a [[sports|sport]] where a [[net (device)|net]] is a standard part of the game, especially where the net separates the opponents. The basic goal in these sports is to hit the [[ball]] or [[Badminton#Shuttlecock|bird]] over the net back to the opponent. Players score points whenever the opponent fails to return the ball or bird back over the net. The criteria on what is considered a valid return varies between each sport (such as the number of times the ball may be touched or bounced on a player's side before it must go back over the net).

Net sports usually include:&lt;ref name=spokesman-review&gt;{{cite news

* [[racquet sports]] such as [[tennis]], [[badminton]], [[pickleball]] and [[table tennis]] (but not [[Squash (sport)|squash]] or [[racquetball]], where players must hit the ball towards a wall).
* [[volleyball]], [[footvolley]], [[headis]] or [[sepak takraw]], where players must hit the ball with body.

Although [[basketball]], [[hockey]], [[water polo]] and other sports have netting around the [[Goal (sport)|goal]] area designed to more clearly indicate when goals are scored, they are not usually considered "net sports". Similarly, [[lacrosse stick]]s have a loose netting that is used to catch and fling the ball, but again [[lacrosse]] is not usually considered a "net sport".

The [[Los Angeles Daily Times]] reports: "Net sports are unique in that the equipment is light, portable and affordable, and partners and opponents are easy to find. The sports are easy to learn, and the social aspect of the game[s] appeals to those who find the health club to be an isolationist palace of mirrors."&lt;ref name=spokesman-review/&gt;

The three "favorite" net sports (tennis, badminton, and volleyball) usually involve arching of the [[human back|back]] when [[Serve (tennis)|serving]] or [[Volleyball#Attack|spiking]]/[[Smash (tennis)|smashing]] the ball or bird.&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2326">'''Open chain exercises''' (OKC) are exercises that are performed where the [[hand]] or foot is free to move. The opposite of OKC are [[closed kinetic chain exercises]] (CKC). Both are effective for strengthening and rehabilitation objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Open and closed kinetic chain exercises improve shoulder joint reposition sense equally in healthy subjects. Rogol IM, Ernst G, Perrin DH. J Athl Train. 1998 Oct;33(4):315-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Closed-chain exercises tend to offer more "functional" athletic benefits because of their ability to recruit more muscle groups and require additional skeletal stabilization. &lt;ref&gt;Weight training of the thigh muscles using closed vs. open kinetic chain exercises: a comparison of performance enhancement.

Single-joint versions of these exercises are typically non-weight bearing, with the movement occurring at the hinge joints ([[Elbow-joint|elbow]] or [[knee]]).&lt;ref&gt;Closed Kinetic Chain Exercise.

Todd Ellenbecker, George Davies 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-7360-0170-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is any weight applied, it is often applied to the distal portion of the limb. Open chain exercises are postulated to be advantageous in rehabilitation settings because they can be easily manipulated to selectively target specific muscles, or specific heads of certain muscles, more effectively than their closed chain counterparts, at different phases of contraction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1234">A '''personal record''' or '''personal best''' (frequently abbreviated to PR or PB) is an individual's best performance in a given [[sport]]ing discipline. It is most commonly found in [[athletic sports]], such as [[track and field]], other forms of [[running]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]].

The term "PR" came from the world of running, referring to a person's best time in a race of a specific distance. So, if someone runs their first 5K race in 28:45, that's their PR for the 5K distance. If they run faster than 28:45 in a subsequent 5K race, then they have a new PR for that distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kuehls | first1 = Dave | title = How to Run a Personal Record: Cover the Ground in Front of You Faster Than Ever Before | publisher = Penguin | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1440661877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, "PR" came to mean any new record in a sport that could be performed by a single person. [[Crossfit]] and [[powerlifting]] have popularized the term because a person's PR is used to measure their current level for a given exercise.

'''Ping-pong diplomacy''' ({{zh|乒乓外交}} ''Pīngpāng wàijiāo'') refers to the exchange of [[table tennis]] (ping-pong) players between the [[United States]] and [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in the early 1970s. The event marked a thaw in [[China–United States relations|Sino-American relations]] that paved the way to a [[1972 Nixon visit to China|visit to Beijing by President Richard Nixon]].

== History ==
=== Background ===
The United States viewed the People's Republic of China as an aggressor nation and enforced an economic containment policy including an embargo on the PRC, following its entry into the [[Korean War]] in 1950. After approximately 20 years of neither diplomatic nor economic relations, both countries finally saw an advantage in opening up to each other: China viewed closer relations with the United States as a beneficial counter to its increasingly tense relationship with the Soviet Union, while the U.S. sought closer relations with China as leverage in its peace negotiations with North Vietnam.

"[T]he thirty-first World Table Tennis Championships, held in Nagoya, Japan, provided an opportunity for both China and the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Turbulent Decade: A History of the Cultural Revolution|last=Jiaqi|first=Yan|last2=Gao|first2=Gao|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8248-1695-7|pages=433|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process ===
The U.S. Table Tennis team was in [[Nagoya, Japan]] in 1971 for the [[1971 World Table Tennis Championships|31st World Table Tennis Championships]] on April 6 when they received an invitation to visit China. From the early years of the People's Republic, sports had played an important role in diplomacy, often incorporating the slogan "Friendship First, Competition Second". During the isolationist years, athletes were among the few PRC nationals who were allowed to travel overseas.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} On April 10, 1971, the team and accompanying journalists became the first American delegation to set foot in the Chinese capital since 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was facilitated by the [[National Committee on United States – China Relations]]. Prior to the visit by the American table tennis players, eleven Americans were admitted into the PRC for one week because they all professed affiliation with the [[Black Panther Party]] which followed a [[Maoist]] political line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/workers/black-panthers/|title=History of the Black Panther Party|last=Baggins|first=Brian|date=2002|website=marxists.org|access-date=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was unusual, given that high-profile American citizens such as Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] expressed interest in visiting China after the 1968 presidential election, but even he could not have a trip arranged for him despite his office.

According to ''History of U.S. Table Tennis'' by [[Tim Boggan]], who went to China along with the U.S. Table Tennis Team, three incidents may have triggered their invitation from China. [[Wales|Welshman]] [[H. Roy Evans]], then President of the [[International Table Tennis Federation]], claimed that he visited China prior to the 31st World Table Tennis Championship and suggested to non-Chinese sports authorities and Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] that China should take steps to get in contact with the world through international sport events after the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Furthermore, the American player [[Leah Neuberger|Leah "Miss Ping" Neuberger]], the 1956 World Mixed Doubles Champion and nine-time U.S. Open Women's Singles Champion, was traveling at the time with the Canadian Table Tennis Team that had been invited by China to visit the country. China diplomatically extended its approval of Leah Neuberger's application for a visa to the entire American team. The third incident, perhaps the most likely trigger, was the unexpected but dramatic meeting between the flamboyant American player [[Glenn Cowan]] and the Chinese player [[Zhuang Zedong]], a three-time world champion and winner of many other table tennis events. Zhuang Zedong described the incident&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The events leading up to the encounter began when Glenn Cowan missed his team bus one afternoon after his practice in [[Nagoya]] during the 31st World Table Tennis Championship. Cowan had been practicing for 15 minutes with the Chinese player, [[Liang Geliang]], when a Japanese official came and wanted to close the training area. As Cowan looked in vain for his team bus, a Chinese player{{who|date=May 2014}} waved to him to get on his Chinese team bus. Moments after his casual talking through an interpreter to the Chinese players{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}, Zhuang Zedong came up from his back seat to greet him and presented him with a silk-screen portrait of [[Huangshan Mountains]], a famous product from Hangzhou. Cowan wanted to give something back, but all he could find from his bag was a comb. The American hesitantly replied, "I can't give you a comb. I wish I could give you something, but I can't." This World Table Tennis Championships marked the return of China's participation after a six-year absence. When the Chinese team and Cowan walked off the bus, journalists who were following the Chinese team took photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamusa.org/News/2008/June/12/From-Ping-Pong-Diplomacy-to-the-Beijing-Games|title=From Ping Pong Diplomacy to the Beijing Games|publisher=Team USA|date=Jun 12, 2008|accessdate=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the political climate of the 1960s, the sight of an athlete of Communist China with an athlete of the United States was sure to garner attention. Glenn Cowan later bought a T-shirt with a red, white and blue [[peace symbol|peace emblem]] flag and the words "[[Let It Be]]," which he presented to Zhuang Zedong at another chance meeting.

When a journalist asked Cowan, "Mr. Cowan, would you like to visit China?", he answered, "Well, I'd like to see any country I haven't seen before--Argentina, Australia, China, ... Any country I haven't seen before." "But what about China in particular? Would you like to go there?" "Of course," said Glenn Cowan.

During an interview in 2002 with the famous TV personality [[Chen Luyu]], [[Zhuang Zedong]] told more of the story: "The trip on the bus took 15 minutes, and I hesitated for 10 minutes. I grew up with the slogan 'Down with the American imperialism!' And during the [[Cultural Revolution]], the string of class struggle was tightened unprecedentedly, and I was asking myself, 'Is it okay to have anything to do with your No. 1 enemy?'" Zhuang recalled remembering that Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] met [[Edgar Snow]] on the Rostrum of [[Tiananmen]] on the [[National Day]] in 1970 and said to Snow that China should now place its hope on American people.
Zhuang looked in his bag and first went through some pins, [[Chairman Mao badge|badges with Mao's head]], silk handkerchiefs, and fans. But he felt these were not decent enough to be a good gift. He finally picked the silk portrait of Huangshan Mountains. On the following day, many Japanese newspapers carried photographs of Zhuang Zedong and Glenn Cowan.

When the Chinese Department of Foreign Affairs received a report that the U.S. Table Tennis Team hoped to get invited to visit China, the Department declined as usual. [[Zhou Enlai]] and [[Mao Zedong]] initially agreed with the decision, but when [[Mao Zedong]] saw the news in ''[[Dacankao]]'', a newspaper accessible only to high-ranking government officials, he decided to invite the U.S. Table Tennis Team. It was reported that Mao Zedong said, "This Zhuang Zedong not only plays table tennis well, but is good at foreign affairs, and he has a mind for politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, 1971, nine American players, four officials, and two spouses stepped across a bridge from [[Hong Kong]] to the Chinese mainland and then spent their time during April 11–17 playing fun matches, touring the [[Great Wall]] and [[Summer Palace]], and watching a [[ballet]].

===Legacy===
*During the week of July 8, 1971, a three-day ping-pong diplomacy event was held at the [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum]] in Yorba Linda, California. Original members of both the Chinese and American ping-pong teams from 1971 were present and competed again.
*In 1988, table tennis became an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport.
*Ping-pong diplomacy was referenced in the 1994 film ''[[Forrest Gump]]''. After suffering injuries in battle, Forrest develops an aptitude for the sport and joins the U.S. Army team—eventually competing against Chinese teams on a goodwill tour.

==Reactions==
Upon his return to the United States, one of the American players told reporters that the Chinese were very similar to people in the U.S. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The people are just like us. They are real, they're genuine, they got feeling. I made friends, I made genuine friends, you see. The country is similar to America, but still very different. It's beautiful. They got the Great Wall, they got plains over there. They got an ancient palace, the parks, there's streams, and they got ghosts that haunt; there's all kinds of, you know, animals. The country changes from the south to the north. The people, they have a, a unity. They really believe in their Maoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Nixon's visit==
[[File:Nixon at an athletic exhibition in Peking - NARA - 194757.tif|thumb|right|250px|Nixon attending a ping-pong exhibition in Beijing.]]
{{Main|1972 Nixon visit to China}}
Two months after Richard Nixon's visit, [[Zhuang Zedong]] visited the U.S. as the head of a Chinese table-tennis delegation, April 12–30, 1972. Also on the itinerary were [[Canada]], [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]]. However, China's attempts to reach out to countries through "ping-pong diplomacy" were not always successful, such as when the All Indonesia Table Tennis Association (PTMSI) refused China's invitation in October 1971, claiming that accepting the PRC's offer would improve the PRC's reputation. Because neither [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] athletes nor journalists appeared in China following the appearance of the American players and journalists, one speculation is that the act showed the equal scorn of both countries towards the USSR.

== Result ==
Ping-pong diplomacy was successful and resulted in opening the U.S.-PRC relationship, leading the U.S. to lift the embargo against China on June 10, 1971. On February 28, 1972, during President Nixon and Henry Kissinger's visit to Shanghai, the [[Shanghai Communiqué|Shanghai Communique]] was issued between the U.S. and the PRC. The Communique noted that both nations would work towards the normalization of their relations. Furthermore, the U.S. recognized that Taiwan is a part of China and agreed not to interfere in issues between China and Taiwan.

== 1991 united Korean Team ==
Another example of Ping Pong Diplomacy occurred during the [[World Table Tennis Championships|1991 World Table Tennis Championships in Chiba]], Japan, where a unified Korean team played together for the first time since the Korean War.

The diplomatic efforts leading to the formation of this unified team were led by then-[[International Table Tennis Federation|International Table Tennis Federation President]], [[Ichiro Ogimura]].

Prior to the championships, Ogimura visited [[South Korea]] 20 times and traveled to [[North Korea]] 15 times to plead for a unified team from the [[Korean Peninsula|Korean peninsula]]. Ogimura also worked with local Japanese government heads to create joint training camps in the cities of Nagano, Nagaoka and Chiba, and secured agreement from the [[ITTF]] for North Korea and South Korea to compete under the unified name of “Korea”.

The Korean team played under a white flag depicting the Korean peninsula in blue and used the Korean [[Folk music|folksong]], [[Arirang]], rather than the national anthem of either the North or the South.

The competition saw the Korean team win one gold medal, one silver and two bronze medals.

This action has since been repeated. At the 2018 World Team Table Tennis Championships, the two Koreas entered separate teams in the competition but, when they were paired against each other at the quarter-final of the women's event, they negotiated instead to field a joint team for the semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nippon.com/en/column/g00550/|title=Table Tennis Diplomacy that Brought the Koreas Together|date=2018-06-12|work=nippon.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In team [[sport]]s, a '''man of the match'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/man_of_the_match|title=man of the match - definition of man of the match in English - Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025173131/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/man_of_the_match|archivedate=25 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; award is often given to the outstanding player in a particular match. This can be a player from either team, although the player is generally chosen from the winning team.

Some sports have unique traditions regarding these awards, and they are especially sought-after in championship or [[all-star game|all-star]] games. In Australia, the term "[[best and fairest]]" is normally used, both for individual games and season-long awards. In some competitions, particularly in North America, the terms "[[most valuable player]]" (MVP) or "most outstanding player" (MOP) are used. In [[ice hockey]] in North America, three players of the game, called the "[[three stars (ice hockey)|three stars]]", are recognised.

In sports where playoffs are decided by series rather than individual games, such as professional basketball and baseball, MVP awards are commonly given for the series, and in ice hockey's [[National Hockey League|NHL]], for performance in the entire playoffs.

==Association football==
In football, the "man of the match" award typically goes to a player on the winning side. Players who score a [[hat-trick]], or [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]] who keep a [[Shutout#Association football|clean sheet]] under pressure often get the award. Hat-trick scorers usually receive the match ball whether or not they are officially named man of the match. 

The man of the match is often chosen by a television commentator or a sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/27/sport.comment4|title=Football: The problem with man of the match awards|first=Si|last=Hawkins|date=27 February 2008|website=the Guardian|accessdate=6 May ghg2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301170032/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/27/sport.comment4|archivedate=1 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all competitions have an official man of the match award, so sometimes accolades are given by websites or newspapers instead. In the [[Premier League]], for example, a player receives a small black and gold trophy for their man of the match performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/83956|title=How the Premier League's monthly awards work|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204082122/https://www.premierleague.com/news/83956|archivedate=4 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3742900/Premier-League-s-new-man-match-award-yellow-brick-poking-fun-new-design.html|title=Premier League's new man-of-the-match award is a gold coloured brick|author=|date=|website=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019220257/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3742900/Premier-League-s-new-man-match-award-yellow-brick-poking-fun-new-design.html|archivedate=19 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soccer-1490541 960 720.jpg|thumb|Men playing football, also known as soccer.]]

==Australian rules football==
In [[Australian rules football]], the player of the game is often referred to as having been the "best on ground" (or "BOG"). Media outlets provide immediate, unofficial recognition that is largely honorary, often on a 5–4–3–2–1 or 3–2–1 voting basis.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Players may receive a [[Tissot]] watch as an award for their "best on ground" performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richmondfc.com.au/video/2016-08-06/round-20-rance-wins-the-tissot|title=Round 20: Rance wins the Tissot - richmondfc.com.au|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019220230/http://www.richmondfc.com.au/video/2016-08-06/round-20-rance-wins-the-tissot|archivedate=19 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] recognises the player of the game as being the player awarded the maximum three votes by umpires in the [[Brownlow Medal]] count at season's end. Exceptions are made during the season for certain reserved games such as the [[Western Derby]], [[The ANZAC Day clash]], [[QClash]], and [[Showdown (AFL)|Showdown]], where medallions are officially rewarded in presentations following the conclusion of the match. On the day of the [[AFL Grand Final]], a player will be awarded the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as being the best on ground voted by an independent panel of [[Australian rules football]] experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/stats/awards/norm-smith-medal|title=Norm Smith Medal - AFL.com.au|website=afl.com.au|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016135158/http://www.afl.com.au/stats/awards/norm-smith-medal|archivedate=16 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket==
{{main article|Player of the Match awards (cricket)}}
In cricket, the man of the match award became a regular feature in Test matches in the mid 1980s.&lt;ref name="test motm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283704.html |title=Records / Test matches / Individual records (captains, players, umpires) /Most player-of-the-match awards |work=ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=ESPN Sports Media |accessdate=2 January 2014 |date= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303223723/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283704.html |archivedate=3 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The man of the match title is usually awarded to the player whose contribution is seen as the most critical in winning the game. 

In one match held on 3 April 1996, the whole team from [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] was awarded the Men of the Match award. It was the first instance when a whole team was awarded it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4th ODI: West Indies v New Zealand at Georgetown, Apr 3, 1996 &amp;#124; Cricket Scorecard &amp;#124; ESPN Cricinfo|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64524.html|website=ESPN Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=24 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404011441/http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64524.html|archivedate=4 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a test match played between 15,16,17,18 January 1999 between South Africa vs West Indies, the whole South African team was awarded man of the match &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63823.html|title=5th Test, West Indies tour of South Africa at Centurion, Jan 15-18 1999 - Match Summary - ESPNCricinfo|website=ESPNcricinfo|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106053428/http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63823.html|archivedate=6 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Test matches, [[Jacques Kallis]] holds the record for the highest number of awards won, with 23 in 166 matches played.&lt;ref name = "test motm"/&gt; In ODIs, [[Sachin Tendulkar]] holds the record for the highest number of man of the match titles, with 62 awards in 463 matches played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283705.html |title=Records / One-Day Internationals / Individual records (captains, players, umpires) /Most player-of-the-match awards |work=ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=ESPN Sports Media |accessdate=2 January 2014 |date= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304055509/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283705.html |archivedate=4 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tendulkar is followed by [[Sanath Jayasuriya]], who, along with [[Ricky Ponting]], also holds the record for the most Man of the Match titles as captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records / One-Day Internationals / Individual records (captains, players, umpires) / Most player-of-the-match awards|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283705.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902085726/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283705.html|archivedate=2 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the shortest form of the game, [[T20 International]]s, this record is held by [[Shahid Afridi]], who has won 11 awards in 99 matches.

==Gaelic games==

In the Gaelic games of [[hurling]] and [[Gaelic football]], the "man of the match" ({{Lang-ga|Laoch na hImeartha}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focloir.ie/en/dictionary/ei/man+of+the+match|title=man of the match - Translation to Irish Gaelic with audio pronunciation of translations for man of the match by New English-Irish Dictionary|website=www.focloir.ie|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817205811/http://www.focloir.ie/en/dictionary/ei/man+of+the+match|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, "hero of the game") is commonly awarded after important games. An unusual example was the [[2008 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final]], where the award was given to [[Brian Cody]], the [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] manager, rather than to a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoganstand.com/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=100900|title=Bookie pays out on man of the match bets - Hoganstand.com|website=www.hoganstand.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817204048/http://www.hoganstand.com/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=100900|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the women's sports of [[camogie]] and [[ladies' Gaelic football]], the term "player of the match" ({{Lang-ga|Laoch na hImeartha}}, "hero of the game") is used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clarechampion.ie/fiona-scoops-player-of-the-match-award/|title=Fiona scoops player of the match award – The Clare Champion|website=clarechampion.ie|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817223801/http://clarechampion.ie/fiona-scoops-player-of-the-match-award/|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickpost.ie/2017/02/14/ul-repeat-ashbourne-supremacy-ucc/ereena-fryday-receives-her-player-of-the-match-award-from-catherine-neary-1222017/|title=Ereena Fryday receives her player of the match award from Catherine Neary 12/2/2017|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817204538/http://www.limerickpost.ie/2017/02/14/ul-repeat-ashbourne-supremacy-ucc/ereena-fryday-receives-her-player-of-the-match-award-from-catherine-neary-1222017/|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/shine-hails-impact-of-teen-star-odonoghue-36028640.html|title=Shine hails impact of teen star O'Donoghue - Independent.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2017/0812/896955-dublin-overcome-plucky-waterford-to-reach-final-four/|title=Dublin overcome plucky Waterford to reach final four|first=Jackie|last=Cahill|date=12 August 2017|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817204024/https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2017/0812/896955-dublin-overcome-plucky-waterford-to-reach-final-four/|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Ice hockey==
{{main article|Three stars (ice hockey)}}
In North American [[ice hockey]], the three players who perform best in the game, often either those who accumulate the most points or outstanding goaltenders, are usually designated the '''Three stars''' of the game: the top-performing player is the ''first star'', and so on. This tradition originated in the 1930s as a promotion for a "Three Star" brand of gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/top10/hockeygimmicks.html#threestars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615075333/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/top10/hockeygimmicks.html|date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in international play (and outside North America), the ''three stars'' concept is rarely used. Instead, other leagues may issue awards to one player who performed best in the game.

==Rugby football==
Both codes of rugby, [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]], commonly have man of the match or player of the match awards. In televised or sponsored matches, a commentator or sponsor often decides who gets the award, and it is presented to the winner after the match.

Examples of man of the match awards in professional men's rugby league are the [[Clive Churchill Medal]] in the [[National Rugby League Grand Final]], the [[Karyn Murphy Medal]] in the [[NRL Women's Premiership Grand Final]] the [[Lance Todd Trophy]] in the [[Challenge Cup]] final and the [[Harry Sunderland Trophy]] in the [[Super League Grand Final]].

==College basketball and football==
In [[college basketball]] and [[college football]], the two collegiate sports with the most television coverage in the United States, a top player from each team is usually honoured as "players of the game." These athletes usually cannot collect material prizes due to [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] regulations. Instead, television companies broadcasting the game or corporate sponsors will often make donations to the scholarship funds of each school in the names of the winning players.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In college basketball's Final Four events, a [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]] award is given, for performance across both the semi-final and championship game. A Most Outstanding Player award is also given for each of the four regionals, based upon performances in the regional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen) and final (Elite Eight).

==Gridiron football==
The [[National Football League]] names an MVP for two prominent games on its schedule:
* A [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award]] has been awarded at each [[Super Bowl]] (the NFL's championship).
* The [[Pro Bowl]] has had an MVP award throughout its existence. The current Pro Bowl MVP format selects one offensive and one defensive player. From 1956–1971, two MVP awards were given, one to a [[skill position]] and the other to a [[lineman (American football)|lineman]] or [[linebacker]]. In 1972, an offensive and defensive MVP were named. From 1973–2012, a single Pro Bowl MVP was chosen.

Individual games typically have an informal player (or players) of the game chosen by the broadcast network covering the game; one prominent example of this phenomenon is the [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day#Game MVPs|Turkey Leg Award, All-Iron Award and Galloping Gobbler]] trophies awarded for games held on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]].

The [[Canadian Football League]] awards two MVP awards for its championship game, the [[Grey Cup]]. The [[Grey Cup Most Valuable Player]] award is open to all players; the [[Dick Suderman Trophy]] is limited to players with Canadian citizenship or who were raised in Canada since childhood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3520">{{Nihongo|'''Radio calisthenics'''|ラジオ体操|rajio taisō|extra=literally, "radio exercises"}} are warm-up [[calisthenics]] performed to music and guidance from radio broadcasts. They are popular in [[Japan]] and parts of Mainland [[China]] and  [[Taiwan]]. 
[[File:Rajiotaiso2013park.ogv|thumb|(video) Two men do rajio taisō in a park.]]

==Japan==
In Japan, radio calisthenics are broadcast to music on public [[NHK]] [[radio]] early in the [[morning]]. Rajio taisō were introduced to Japan in 1928 as a commemoration of the coronation of Emperor [[Hirohito]].&lt;ref name="Fukue"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090722i1.html| title = Wake up, hike out, tune in, move it | last = Fukue | first = Natsuko | publisher = Japan Times| date = 2009-07-22 | accessdate = 2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for radio broadcast [[calisthenics]] came from the US, where during the 1920s the [[MetLife|Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.]] sponsored 15-minute radio calisthenics in major cities in the US. Visiting employees of the Japanese postal insurance division brought samples of the exercises from the US back to Japan.&lt;ref name="Fukue"/&gt; The exercises were widely used to improve the health of Japanese soldiers both at home and abroad during the 1930s and 1940s. The exercises were introduced to several other pacific nations, including Taiwan, [[Hong Kong]] and [[Indonesia]] during Japan's colonization period.

After Japan's defeat in 1945, the broadcasts were banned by the occupying powers as being too militaristic in nature. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7KkQB10-Kw&amp;t=1071| title = Begin Japanology: Radio Callisthenics | publisher = NHK| date = 2015-06-25 | accessdate = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several rewrites to the exercise routine, it was reintroduced by NHK radio in 1951 with the support of the education ministry, health ministry, the Japan Gymnastic Association and the Japan Recreation Association.&lt;ref name="Fukue"/&gt;

==China==

China also has such calisthenics. They have been mandatory since 2011.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Originally they were introduced by [[Mao Zedong]] in 1951&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnakWocA3sc |accessdate = 2013-05-01 | title=Chairman Mao's 4 Minute Workout}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the broadcasts now are run by the General Administration of Sport China.

==Current status==
Radio taisō is still used at schools as a warm up for physical education classes, during [[Sports day#Japan|sports day]] activities, and by some companies as a way of building morale and a sense of group unity, as well as to raise energy levels and encourage good health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://spice.stanford.edu/publications/10064/ | title = Japanese Radio Exercises | origyear = 1977| year = 1996 | accessdate = 2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17603">The '''reserve clause''', in [[North American]] [[professional sports]], was part of a player contract which stated the rights to players were retained by the team upon the contract's expiration. Players under these contracts were not free to enter into another contract with another team. Once signed to a contract, players could, at the team's whim, be reassigned, traded, sold, or released.

The only negotiating leverage of most players was to hold out at contract time and to refuse to play unless their conditions were met. Players were bound to negotiate a new contract to play another year for the same team or to ask to be released or traded.

They had no freedom to change teams unless they were given an unconditional release. In the days of the reserve clause, that was the only way a player could be a free agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reserve Clause|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/reserve_clause|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once common in sports, the clause was abolished in [[baseball]] in 1975. The reserve clause system has, for the most part, been replaced by [[free agency]].

==History and baseball==
In the late 19th century, [[baseball]] in America became popular enough that its major teams began to be businesses worth considerable amounts of money, and the players began to be paid sums that were well above the wages earned by common workers.  To keep player salary demands in check, team owners promulgated a standardized contract for the players, in which the major variable was salary. The players unsuccessfully tried to fight the growing ''reserve system'' by forming a union, the Brotherhood, and founding their own [[Players' League]] in 1890, but the PL lasted just one season. For the next 80 years, the ''reserve system'' ruled the game.  In this era, all player contracts were for one year. There were no long-term contracts as there are today, because the reserve clause negated the need for them.

The Reserve Clause's inception was in 1879, when it was proposed as an unofficial rule known as "the Five Man Rule." It would allow teams to reserve players for each season, unless a player opted out of his contract and did not play in the league for a year. While the rule was not secret, teams started to sign other teams' "reserved players", thus encroaching the rule. These controversies caused the [[National League]] to instate the rule officially on December 6, 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Morris|first= Peter|authorlink= |title= A Game of Inches: the Stories behind the Innovations That Shaped Baseball|url= |chapter= The Reserve Clause|year= 2010|publisher= Ivan R. Dee|location= Chicago|isbn= 1-56663705-8|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teams realized that if players were free to go from team to team then salaries would escalate dramatically. Therefore, they seldom granted players (at least valuable ones) a release, but retained their rights, or traded them to other teams for the rights to other players, or sold them outright for cash. Players thus had a choice only of signing for what their team offered them, or "holding out" (refusing to play, and therefore, not being paid).

Under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] of 1890, two or more non-affiliated companies in any other interstate business were prohibited from colluding with each other to fix prices or establish schedules or rates. Enforcement of the Act reached its apotheosis in 1910 when the Supreme Court affirmed the government's order to dissolve the Standard Oil conglomerate. Yet it was argued that to keep baseball (the only large-scale professional sport in America during the 1920s) prosperous, granting it immunity from the Sherman Act was in the best interests of the game and the nation.

Thus, the [[United States Supreme Court]] had held in 1922 in ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]'' (259 U.S. 200) that baseball was an "amusement", and that organizing a schedule of games between independently owned and operated clubs operating in various states, and engaging in activities incidental thereto, did not constitute "[[interstate commerce]]" and therefore [[antitrust]] laws did not apply to such activity, a ruling that, as of now, has never been overturned, despite efforts to do in [[Toolson v. New York Yankees]] and [[Flood v. Kuhn]].

This pass on "[[trust-busting]]" essentially codified the reserve clause for many years, and gave what came to be known as Major League Baseball unprecedented power over both players and the independent organizations of the [[National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues]] (NAPBL). MLB could dictate not only how and where professional players could move between major league clubs, but as they took the opportunity of the [[Great Depression]] to establish systems of [[farm team]]s of players wholly owned by the parent clubs placed on 'independent' teams from the NA leagues around the country, they developed a way of expanding control of contracts of virtually the entire pool of professional baseball players.

When other team sports, particularly [[ice hockey]], [[American football|football]], and [[basketball]] developed professional [[sports league|leagues]], their owners essentially emulated baseball's reserve clause.  This system stood almost unchallenged, other than by the occasional holdout, for many years.

In October 1969, [[St. Louis Cardinals]] outfielder [[Curt Flood]]  unsuccessfully challenged his trade to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].  Flood sacrificed the remainder of his playing career to pursue this litigation.  Flood's case established that the reserve clause was a legitimate basis for negotiation in [[collective bargaining]] between players and owners,{{how|date=August 2017}} and that the historic baseball antitrust exemption was valid for baseball only and not applicable to any other sport.  [[Curt Flood]] unsuccessfully challenged the reserve clause in court in 1970, but [[Marvin Miller]] helped overturn it five years later in the [[Seitz decision]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flynn|first=Neal|authorlink= |title= Baseball's Reserve System: The Case and Trial of Curt Flood Vs. Major League Baseball|url= |accessdate= |year= 2006|publisher= Walnut Park Group Inc.|location= |isbn= 0-97765780-9|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Removing the reserve clause from player contracts became the primary goal of negotiations between the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] and the owners. The reserve clause was struck down in [[1975 in baseball|1975]] when arbitrator [[Seitz decision|Peter Seitz]] ruled that since pitchers [[Andy Messersmith]] and [[Dave McNally]] had played for one season without a contract, they could become free agents. This decision essentially dismantled the reserve clause and opened the door to widespread free agency within North American professional baseball.

Other sports soon followed suit.

==NFL==
On June 18, 1921, the NFL ratified its first constitution.&lt;ref name="Willis, 2010, p. 136."&gt;Willis, 2010, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The reserve clause ratified in the constitution was similar to that of baseball's at the time. The reserve clause stipulated that a team had the first opportunity to sign a player after the length of the contract had expired. If the team chose not to offer a contract, then the player could try to sign with a team of his choosing.&lt;ref name="Willis, 2010, p. 137."&gt;Willis, 2010, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, the reserve clause bound the player "...to his employer in perpetuity".&lt;ref name="Algeo, 2006, p. 150."&gt;Algeo, 2006, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The reserve clause had been abolished in the NFL constitution in 1948 when the option clause was created.
&lt;ref name="Lyons, 2010, p. 186."&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The option clause stated that a team may choose to automatically keep a player on their team for another year, at the same pay, after his contract had expired.&lt;ref name=RUCK293&gt;Ruck; Paterson and Weber, 2010, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lyons, 2010, p. 176."&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The term, option clause, was not used by the print media and it was instead referred to as the reserve clause.&lt;ref name="Lyons, 2010, p. 176."&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in the NFL's attempt to gain antitrust exemption from Congress in 1957, [[Bert Bell]] still referred to the clause as the option clause (and also as the "option and reserve clause").&lt;ref name="Lyons, 2010, p. 261."&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades later, [[National Football League|NFL]] players' mobility was limited by the so-called "[[Pete Rozelle|Rozelle Rule]]", named for the commissioner who first implemented it, which allowed the commissioner to "compensate" any team who lost a free agent to another team by taking something of equivalent value, usually [[sports draft|draft]] picks, from the team that had signed the free agent and giving it to the team the player had left.  Fear of losing several future high draft picks greatly limited free agency as no team wanted to sign a veteran player only to learn that it would lose, for example, its next two first-round draft picks.  The Rozelle Rule was eventually replaced by "Plan B", which allowed a team to name a thirty-seven man roster the reserve clause would apply to, and all players not included on this list were free agents.  Obviously, few top-echelon players were left off this thirty-seven man roster unless they happened to be injured.  Courts eventually ruled this plan to be an antitrust violation, and something resembling true free agency came to pro football.  Now, exclusive rights to a player are only for the first three years after his selection in the college draft.  At the end of the first three years, a player can be a "restricted free agent", allowing his former team to match any offer made to him by another.  After four years in the NFL all contracts end with the player becoming an unrestricted free agent without reserve.

There is a [[franchise tag]] option that is similar to the reserve clause; however, teams can only tag one player each year, although they can tag the same player for consecutive years.  Franchised players are eligible to receive at least 120% of their previous year's salary, and players tagged "non-exclusive" can accept offers from other teams; if the original team does not match the offer, they receive draft picks as compensation.  In recent years, many teams have opted not to exercise their right to designate the franchise tag.

==NBA==
The [[National Basketball Association]] went through several phases of compensation and other arcane provisions before reaching almost unrestricted free agency. The first player in that league—and the first American major-league athlete—to challenge the reserve clause was [[Rick Barry]]. In 1969, he wanted to leave the [[San Francisco Warriors]] after his second season to play for the [[Oakland Oaks (ABA)|Oakland Oaks]], who were coached by his father-in-law, [[Bruce Hale]]. After a court upheld it,{{clarify|date=April 2015}} Barry sat out a season before joining the Oaks.&lt;ref name="Slate Rick Barry article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hollander|first=Dave|title=Big Jerk, Bigger Hero|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2013/11/rick_barry_free_agency_one_of_the_biggest_jerks_in_basketball_history_is.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=November 24, 2013|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NHL==
The reserve clause was the basis for the NHL's injunction against the large number of players who had signed with the rival [[World Hockey Association]] in 1972, with all but one—against [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] star [[Bobby Hull]]—ultimately thrown out by lower courts. The appellate court, however, sided strongly with the WHA and Hull, calling the NHL's business practices monopolistic, conspiratorial, and illegal. While the reserve clause was not explicitly struck down, the court did effectively block any further injunctions based on the reserve clause, rendering it useless. (The WHA, meanwhile, voted at its founding to abolish the reserve clause.) The end of the reserve clause in hockey remains a significant part of the WHA's legacy, as it ultimately resulted in the evolution of the NHL's modern free agency system.

The highly contentious negotiations between [[National Hockey League]] owners and players that led to a [[2004–05 NHL lockout|lockout]], wiping out the entire [[2004–05 NHL season]], were in part about free agency; the previous system precluded unrestricted free agency before the player reached 31 years of age. Most younger hockey free agents were restricted free agents whose teams could retain them by matching an offer from another club or making a "qualifying offer", which usually consisted of a ten percent raise above the pay in the former contract. Following the 2004-05 lockout, owners eventually agreed to phase in a much lower age for unrestricted free agency (27 years of age or 7 years in the NHL, whichever comes first) in exchange for the players meeting owners' principal demand in the new [[NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement]]&amp;mdash;an overall [[salary cap]]. Nevertheless, the league demanded the re-imposition of the 31-year-old threshold for free agency in the [[2012–13 NHL lockout|most recent lockout]], but when union responded by threatening to disclaim interest and file antitrust suits against the league, the owners backed down.

==Major League Soccer==
Major League Soccer ([[MLS]]) is a professional [[association football|soccer]] league representing the sport's highest level in both the [[United States soccer league system|United States]] and [[Canadian soccer league system|Canada]].&lt;ref name=fraser&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Fraser v. Major League Soccer |vol=01 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1296 |court=1st Cir. |date=2002 |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-1st-circuit/1441684.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLS constitutes one of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major professional sports leagues]] of the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/haydons-soccer-pitch/2013/mar/27/mls-most-diverse-americas-big-five-team-sports/|title=MLS is most diverse of America's big five team sports|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the other four "major" leagues of North American professional sport, MLS still retains a reserve clause in every player's contract. For Major League Soccer, this was initially to prevent [[MLS#Teams|clubs]] from competing with each other for player contracts, an aspect of single-entity designed to protect it from antitrust lawsuits.&lt;ref name="NY Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/25/stoppage-time-an-mls-strike-over-free-agency-a-possibility/|title=Stoppage time: MLS players may strike over free agency|work=New York Post|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLS is a single entity in which each team is owned and controlled by the league's investors.&lt;ref name="findlaw"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Fraser v.

The league takes an additional step, imposing the reserve clause for players indefinitely, making player rights a commodity within the team structure for long after the player has left the league.&lt;ref name="US National Soccer Players Union"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/2013/05/corner-the-reserve-clause.html|title=The Reserve Clause in Soccer|work=Labor Union|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Serve and volley''' is a style of play in [[tennis]] where the player serving moves quickly towards the net after hitting a [[serve (tennis)|serve]]. The server then attempts to hit a [[volley (tennis)|volley]] (a shot where the ball is struck without allowing it to bounce), as opposed to the baseline style, where the server stays back following the serve and attempts to hit a [[groundstroke]] (a shot where the ball is allowed to bounce before contact is made). The serve and volley style of play has diminished in recent years with advances in racquet and string technologies which allow players to generate a great amount of top spin on groundstrokes and [[passing shot]]s. The slowing of court surfaces and deflation of balls, promoting longer rallies for the enjoyment of spectators, has also put a damper on the serve and volley style. Some also claim that a lack of teaching of the serve and volley to juniors, who are too small to effectively employ this method, has caused it to become obsolete in grassroots tennis.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The aim of this strategy is to put immediate pressure on the opponent with the intent of ending points quickly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.patcash.co.uk/2018/03/the-6-basic-strokes-in-tennis-explained/|title=Tennis 101: The 6 Basic Strokes Explained Step-by-Step {{!}} Pat Cash Tennis|date=2018-03-01|work=Pat Cash Tennis|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Good returns must be made, or else the server can gain the advantage. This tactic is especially useful on fast [[Tennis court|courts]] (e.g. grass courts) and less so on slow courts (e.g. clay courts). For it to be successful, the player must either have a good serve to expose an opponent's poor return or be exceptionally quick and confident in movement around the net to produce an effective returning volley. [[Ken Rosewall]], for instance, had a very feeble serve but was a very successful serve-and-volley player for two decades. [[Goran Ivanišević]], on the other hand, had success employing the serve-and-volley strategy with great serves and average volleys.

==The Serve and volley era==
Serve-and-volley is thought to have been invented by the Australian [[Norman Brookes]]. Although earlier tennis greats such as [[Bill Tilden]], [[Ellsworth Vines]], and [[Don Budge]] had been noted for their fine serves and net games, they had not played a 100% serve-and-volley style game. [[Jack Kramer]] in the late 1940s was the first world-class player to consistently come to the net after every serve, including his second serve. Kramer writes, however, in his 1979 autobiography, that it was [[Bobby Riggs]], his opponent in the 1948 Pro tennis tour who began the strategy: "When we first started touring he came at me on his first serve, on his second serve, and on my second serve.... my second serve didn't kick like Bobby's, so he could return that deep enough and follow into the net.... It forced me to think attack constantly. I would rush in and try to pound his weakest point -- his backhand. So the style I am famous for was not consciously planned: it was created out of the necessity of dealing with Bobby Riggs."

In the mid-1950s, when [[Pancho Gonzales]] was dominating professional tennis with his serve-and-volley game, occasional brief attempts were made to partially negate the power of his serve. This, it was felt, would lead to longer rallies and more spectator interest. At least three times the rules were modified:

* In several important tournaments such as the [[United States Professional Championship]]s the Van Alen Streamlined Scoring System (VASSS), devised by [[Jimmy Van Alen|James Van Alen]], was used. The match was scored as if in [[table tennis]], with 21 points per game, 5 serves per player, and no second serves. The fans preferred the traditional scoring system, however, and in any case Gonzales continued to win under VASSS rules.
* Jack Kramer, by then the professional tour promoter and no longer its dominant player, also tried a three-bounce rule, in which the server could not come to the net until the ball had been in play for at least three bounces. Gonzales won anyway, and this experiment was dropped.
* Kramer also tried marking a secondary service line one yard behind the baseline, so that the server was further away from the net when he served. Once again Gonzales was undeterred and the original rules were restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Jack|title=The Game|date=1981|publisher=André Deutsch|location=London|isbn=0233973079|page=244|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other male tennis players known for their serve-and-volley technique include [[Pancho Segura]], [[Frank Sedgman]], [[Lew Hoad]], [[Rod Laver]], [[Roy Emerson]], [[John McEnroe]], [[Stefan Edberg]], [[Pat Cash]], [[Boris Becker]], [[Patrick Rafter]], [[Pete Sampras]] and [[Tim Henman]]. Sampras, despite being known for his great serve and volley game, did not always come to the net behind the serve on slower courts, particularly on the second serve. This was especially the case when he was younger.

The serve-and-volley strategy has traditionally been less common amongst female players. An early pioneer in women's volleying was [[Elizabeth Ryan]], who was at the top of the women's game in the mid-to-late 1920s. But it was later on that serve and volley caught on in women's game. The style propelled [[Margaret Court]] to become the all-time leader in Grand Slam titles (24 in singles, 62 total). [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[Jana Novotná]] later became players well known for their serve-and-volley style. More recently, players such as [[Martina Hingis]], [[Justine Henin]], and [[Amélie Mauresmo]] were willing to come to the net, with Henin and Mauresmo playing a very heavy serve and volley style and volleying in general match during the 2006 Wimbledon Finals. Later in her career Henin was also known for serving and volleying on set and match points, such as on Championship point at the 2007 US Open Final against [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]].

==Serve and volley today==
Although the strategy has become less common in both the men's and women's game, a few players still prefer to come in on their serves. It is also commonly used as a surprise tactic. Notable examples are [[Roger Federer]], [[Feliciano López]], [[Nicolas Mahut]], [[Rajeev Ram]], [[Gilles Müller]], [[Radek Štěpánek]], [[Ivo Karlović]], [[Dustin Brown (tennis)|Dustin Brown]], [[Pierre-Hugues Herbert]], [[Sergiy Stakhovsky]], [[Sam Groth]], [[Łukasz Kubot]], [[Leander Paes]], and [[Mischa Zverev]]. The frequent use of serve-and-volley strategy enabled Zverev to upset 3-time Grand Slam champion [[Andy Murray]] at the [[2017 Australian Open]].

On the women's side, serve-and-volley has become almost extinct at the very top level. [[Roberta Vinci]] and [[Hsieh Su-wei]] are the only notable (WTA elite) players that prefer to play with this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italian Renaissance: Errani/Vinci US Open Champs|url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/match_reports/2012-09-09/201209091347217789115.html|publisher=USOpen.org|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on the serve and volley==
[[Bill Tilden]], the dominant player of the 1920s and one of the fathers of the ''cannonball'' serve, nevertheless preferred to play from the backcourt and liked nothing better than to face an opponent who threw powerful serves and groundstrokes at him and who rushed the net — one way or another Tilden would find a way to hit the ball past him. Tilden may also have spent more time analyzing the game of tennis than anyone before or since.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} His book ''Match Play and the Spin of the Ball'' (1925) is still in print and is the definitive work on the subject.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} In it, Tilden states that a perfect baseline player will always beat a perfect serve-and-volleyer 6-0 because his returns of service will be winning passing shots; however he also states that of course neither such a player can exist. Tilden used this style of play for many years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Some of the most interesting matches of all time according to Pat Cash&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Tennis-In-Mens-singles-whose-rivalry-has-been-most-interesting/answer/Pat-Cash|title=Pat Cash's answer to Tennis: In Men's singles whose rivalry has been most interesting? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; have pitted great baseliners such as [[Björn Borg]] or [[Andre Agassi]] against great serve-and-volleyers such as [[Stefan Edberg]], [[John McEnroe]] or [[Pat Rafter]]. Since Tilden's time, head-to-head results on various surfaces, such as those played out in the famous rivalry between [[Borg–McEnroe rivalry|Borg and McEnroe]], contradict his theory that great baseline players will tend to defeat great serve-and-volley ones.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/wins-mcenroe,0,3091040.photo&lt;/ref&gt;

Another perspective on the serve-and-volley game is that it is less tiring than playing constantly from the backcourt. Kramer says in his autobiography that he and [[Pancho Segura]] once tried playing three matches in which they allowed the ball to bounce three times before either could approach the net. "I don't believe I could have played tennis the way Segoo and I did for the three nights because it wore me out, running down all those groundstrokes. It was much more gruelling than putting a lot into a serve and following it in." He goes on to say that "[[Ken Rosewall|Rosewall]] was a backcourt player when he came into the pros, but he learned very quickly how to play the net.  Eventually, for that matter, he became a master of it, as much out of physical preservation as for any other reason. I guarantee you that Kenny wouldn't have lasted into his forties as a world-class player if he hadn't learned to serve and volley."

Despite the improvements in racquet technology made towards the end of the twentieth century which made serve-and-volley a rarer tool in a tennis player's skill set, players familiar with the strategy still advocate it. [[Roger Federer]] advocated up-and-coming players not to ignore the tactic's strategy of coming to the net, especially on faster surfaces and as a surprise tactic &lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2017/07/17/roger-federer-questions-people-dont-play-like/&lt;/ref&gt;. Yet other players, such as [[Mischa Zverev]], acknowledged the difficulty of mastering serve-and-volley, recalling his 36-month effort to adopt the style. As he put it: "Every point, you have to be ready. You're either going to get passed, you're going to miss an easy volley or you're going to win the point," and likened it to the [[Stochastic process|stochastic]] nature of flipping a coin&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/20971090/it-take-more-roger-federer-embrace-serve-volley-tennis-make-comeback&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''splitboard''' is a [[snowboard]] that can be separated into two ski-like parts used with [[ski skins|climbing skins]] to ascend slopes the same way [[alpine touring]] or [[Telemark skiing|telemark ski]]s are.  The two halves can then be connected to form a regular snowboard for descent.&lt;ref name="snowe"&gt;snowevolution.com, [http://www.snowevolution.com/detalle.php?id=881 Construction of a "splitboard"] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|work=Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/snowandski/features/10228093/Splitboards-where-skis-and-snowboards-collide.html|title=Splitboards: where skis and snowboards collide|first1=Jon|last1=Wyatt|first2=Ewan|last2=Wallace|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When snowboarding originated, it was often prohibited on [[piste]]s (established ski trails). Early snowboarders sought out pristine snow conditions as a necessity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc-of-snowboarding.com/offpiste.asp ABC's of Snowboarding: Backcountry snowboarding] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227192656/http://www.abc-of-snowboarding.com/offpiste.asp |date=2008-12-27 }} Retrieved March 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://snowboarding.about.com/od/backcountrysnowboarding/Backcountry_Snowboarding.htm About.com: Backcountry snowboarding] Retrieved March 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The development of splitboards has simplified [[backcountry snowboarding]] where pristine powder snow is more likely to be found.  Splitboards address the inherent weakness of snowboards of having limited backcountry range away from lift systems.  This weakness stems from snowboard riders having both feet fixed to a board, so a standard snowboard can't climb up hills the way skiers can. 

Splitboarding started in the mid-1990s and has grown in popularity. In 1991, Brett "Kowboy" Kobernik brought a crude prototype of the first splitboard to Mark "Wally" Wariakois, the founder of Voile. At the time Wally was intensely focused on innovating new backcountry ski and telemark binding designs, but he saw the future of backcountry snowboarding in Kowboy's crude design. Over the next few years, Kowboy and Wally refined this idea and in 1994 released the first DIY Voile Split Kit. This was the beginning of the splitboard revolution. For the first time riders had a truly innovative and easier way to access backcountry powder.&lt;ref&gt;http://splitboard.com/category/voile/&lt;/ref&gt;  Some companies have begun making splitboard specific bindings. These bindings are designed to reduce the weight associated with the adapter plate/standard binding combination.  The reduced weight increases the range and duration of extended uphill climbs.  The binding's lower foot bed also increases board feel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6068">A '''sports chaplain''' provides [[pastoral care]] for the [[sportsperson|sports person]] and the broader [[sports]] community including the [[Coach (sport)|coach]]es, administrators and their families.

[[Chaplain]]s to sports communities have existed since the middle of the 20th century and have significantly grown in the past 20 years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] have well established [[Christian]] sports chaplaincy [[Christian ministry|ministries]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1982 a congress held in [[Hong Kong]] on sports [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] saw sports chaplains and those interested in Mission to people engaged in sports come together from around the world including recognised representatives from North and South America, [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], the sub-continent and [[Australasia]]. It was this congress that created the inspiration to further develop or initiate national sports missions and sports chaplains.   

Sports chaplains consist of people from many different walks of life. Most commonly, the chaplains are ministers or full-time Christian workers but always, chaplaincy work is done without charge or any financial remuneration.  Often, sports chaplains to a particular sport are former participants of that sport.  This helps the chaplain to not only provide spiritual support and guidance to a player, but gives them the ability to empathize and relate to some of the challenges facing the participant with whom they are ministering.

There were 193 multi-faith sports chaplains at the London 2012 Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
The USA have various sport related chaplaincy organizations. Along with major Denominations, Ministries such as [[Athletes in Action]] and [[Fellowship of Christian Athletes]] also provide chaplains to various sports at the [[college athletics|collegiate]] and [[professional sports|professional]] levels.  Every major professional sport in the United States has at least some sports chaplaincy. Some sports are more coordinated, like Major League Baseball (see www.baseballchapel.org), but most are far more loosely structured with each chaplain having a program that best suits their team and individual situation.  Every [[MLB]], [[NFL]], [[NBA]] &amp; [[Major League Soccer]] franchise has a chaplain.  Due to financial constraints, very few chaplains travel with their teams.  In some cases, especially when an individual coach understands the value of the chaplain to their team, the coach may invite the chaplain to come on a road trip.  This happens far more frequently when a team is traveling a short distance to a neighboring city by bus or motor coach, but in some cases, coaches have paid (out of their own pocket) to bring a chaplain on a road trip. 

In recent years, much more work is being done by chaplains in specific sports to coordinate and work together so that their players can have support and encouragement from a chaplain even when they are “on the road”. 

In addition, the US Olympic Team travels with one or more chaplains, primarily to provide emotional support to the athletes.

== United Kingdom ==
Sports Chaplaincy UK, formerly known as SCORE was established in 1991 under the guidance and direction of the [[Baptist Union of Great Britain]] to use the specialist experience of one of their ministers to pioneer sports chaplaincy and sports ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportschaplaincy.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Called Sports Chaplaincy UK since 2011,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportschaplaincy.org.uk/about-us/history/&lt;/ref&gt; the Christian charity seeks to resource over 250&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt; chaplains in a variety of sports and situations. Their chaplains are mainly in [[association football|football]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], [[cricket]] and [[horseracing]].  They supplied over 40 chaplains to serve at the [[London2012]]  [[Olympics]].  All offer pastoral and spiritual support in a sensitive, non-judgement, non-sectarian way. All work with integrity and professionalism amongst the whole community of their clubs - the players, coaches, organisation and support staff. There is a real sense of affirmation and endorsement from the widest spectrum of the sports world, from the chaplains' work and involvement.

== Australia ==
As a direct result of the Hong Kong 1982 Congress on Sports Mission, pioneered by [[Mark Tronson]], the Australian Heads of Churches approved a Sports Chaplaincy mission, which was named the 'Sports and Leisure Ministry' (SLM). It was initially housed within the well established InterChurch Trade and Industry Mission (ITIM). In 1985 Australian Heads of Churches gave SLM its independence and in 1987 its Heads of Churches appointed board members adopted [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]]. In 2000 Heads of Churches released its founder, Mark Tronson, to establish Well-Being Australia, specialising in athlete [[respite care|respite]]. Five years later in 2005 SLM changed its name to Sports Chaplaincy Australia (SCA). 

As a result of its solid foundation under Australian Heads of Churches, SLM (now SCA) has seen many professional sports in [[Australia]] adopt sport chaplains. Over 180 chaplains now serve in sports and sport organizations such as [[cricket]], [[motor racing]], [[tennis]], [[rugby league]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[soccer]], [[golf]], [[yachting]], [[skiing]], [[netball]], [[rodeo]] and [[horse racing]], the [[Australian Institute of Sport]], and State Institutes of Sport.

The '''TriBalance Yoga''' Method is a form of hot yoga that integrates aspects of several styles, including [[Rāja yoga|Ashtanga Yoga]], [[Iyengar Yoga]], [[Yin yoga]], and therapeutic yoga. The style emphasizes mind-body-spirit union and action meditation.

One concept behind the TriBalance Method is self-discipline and modernization of an ancient tradition. One aspect of early yoga was as a martial art, which warriors would practice to be strong and limber for battles. Another is [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]], which is a [[Sanskrit]] word that translates literally to heat. In yogic discipline it means ecstasy, burning out negativity on the journey to enlightenment. It is an egalitarian method of yoga emphasizing modifications of poses and use of props, designed to help students gradually grow strong enough to perform the full posture on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribalanceyoga.wordpress.com |title=Tribalanceyoga |publisher=Tribalanceyoga.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes mindfulness and action-meditation. From the moment they enter the room until the moment they leave, students are asked to observe silence between classes to quiet their minds. Lastly, the TriBalance Method emphasizes helping students to uncover their practice, rather than teaching it to them.

== Differences from Bikram ==
Though TriBalance yoga is [[hot yoga]], it differs from Bikram in many ways.

*In the TriBalance classes, lights are dim, which is to remove self-consciousness and make the process more internal for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribalance.com |title=Schaumburg Yoga Studio : Welcome to Tri Balance Yoga |publisher=Tribalance.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The TriBalance classes can vary from class to class and teacher to teacher, rather than adhering to a set 26-pose sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bikramyoga.com/BikramYoga/TwentySixPostures.php |title=Bikram Yoga 26 Postures |publisher=Bikramyoga.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*TriBalance involves more poses to strengthen the core and upper body and stretch the hips and back, particularly to recover from and prevent spinal injury and discomfort. A TriBalance Hot Yoga class integrates standing, balance, core and seated poses.
*Bikram classes do not use props, blocks, or manual adjustments. TriBalance classes teach to the beginner level but use hands-on adjustments to correct for injury prevention or advance students.
*Most Bikram poses are done twice in a row; once for 60 seconds and again for 30. Tribalance poses are generally held once and for longer to stimulate more fascia release. This ties into the Yin Yoga influence; Yin referring to the deep tissues as opposed to the more superficial Yang (outer muscle) tissues &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grilley |first=Paul |url=http://www.yogajournal.com/practice/580 |title=Yoga Asana Columns - Yin Yoga |publisher=Yoga Journal |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*TriBalance discourages pregnant women from practicing heated yoga;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribalance.com |title=Schaumburg Yoga Studio : Welcome to Tri Balance Yoga |publisher=Tribalance.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bikram encourages it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bikramyoga.com/BikramYoga/PregnancyYoga.php |title=Testimonials - Bikram Yoga During Pregnancy, Bikram Yoga |publisher=Bikramyoga.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Corey Kelly and Shawnda Falvo opened TriBalance Yoga in 2007. Kelly had worked as a personal trainer for 10 years, as well as training in martial arts, before discovering yoga. He then had an intensive, year-long study with a live-in yoga instructor Shiva Kumar Madayya, the world-class yoga champion who won many competitions in India. There he was first introduced to Iyengar and therapuetic yoga.

Kelly trained in Bikram, but wasn't totally satisfied with the one sequence and monologue. He was inspired by class and conversations with Mac McHugh at Niyama Yoga,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niyamayoga.com/index.html |title=Wilmette, IL |publisher=Niyama Yoga |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel Halpern from Yoga Circle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogacircle.com |title=Celebrating 26 years! |publisher=Yoga Circle |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Paul Grilley of [[Yin yoga]]. He determined that heat is a benefit but there could be many styles of hot yoga. He gradually created the TriBalance Method, integrating different aspects of his yoga practices with his background as a personal trainer and experience with sports injuries. He and his partner Shawnda run the first TriBalance studio in Schaumburg, IL.

'''Weight training''' is a common type of  [[strength training]] for developing the [[physical strength|strength]] and size of [[skeletal muscle]]s. It utilizes the [[force of gravity]] in the form of weighted bars, dumbbells or weight stacks in order to oppose the force generated by muscle through [[Concentric contraction|concentric]] or [[eccentric contraction]]. Weight training uses a variety of specialized [[:Category:Weight training equipment|equipment]] to target specific muscle groups and types of movement.

Sports where strength training is central are [[bodybuilding]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[powerlifting]], and [[strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]], [[highland games]], [[hammer throw]], [[shot put]], [[discus throw]], and [[javelin throw]]. Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen, notably: [[American football]], [[baseball]], [[basketball]], [[association football|football]], [[hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]], [[track and field]], [[boxing]] and [[wrestling]].

==History==
[[File:EarlyBarbell.png|thumb|upright|An early plate-loading barbell and [[kettlebell]]]]
The genealogy of lifting can be traced back to the beginning of recorded history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Weightlifting/Weightlifting101/History-of-Weightlifting|title=The History of Weightlifting |work=USA Weightlifting|publisher=United States Olympic Committee|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130707092816/http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Weightlifting/Weightlifting101/History-of-Weightlifting|archive-date=7 July 2013|dead-url=|access-date=3 September 2018|quote=The genealogy of lifting traces back to the beginning of recorded history where man's fascination with physical prowess can be found among numerous ancient writings. A 5,000-year-old Chinese text tells of prospective soldiers having to pass lifting tests.}}&lt;/ref&gt; where humanity's fascination with physical abilities can be found among numerous ancient writings. In many prehistoric tribes, they would have a big rock they would try to lift, and the first one to lift it would inscribe their name into the stone. Such rocks have been found in [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] castles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/weightlifting|title=Weightlifting {{!}} sport|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progressive resistance training dates back at least to [[Ancient Greece]], when legend has it that wrestler [[Milo of Croton]] trained by carrying a newborn [[calf (animal)|calf]] on his back every day until it was fully grown. Another Greek, the physician [[Galen]], described strength training exercises using the [[halteres (ancient Greece)|halteres]] (an early form of [[dumbbell]]) in the 2nd century.

Ancient Greek sculptures also depict lifting feats. The weights were generally stones, but later gave way to dumbbells. The dumbbell was joined by the barbell in the later half of the 19th century. Early barbells had hollow globes that could be filled with [[sand]] or [[lead shot]], but by the end of the century these were replaced by the plate-loading barbell commonly used today.&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;Todd, Jan (1995). [http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/IGH/IGH0306/IGH0306c.pdf From Milo to Milo: A History of Barbells, Dumbbells, and Indian Clubs.] Iron Game History (Vol.3, No.6).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early device was the [[Indian club]], which came from ancient Persia where it was called the "meels". It subsequently became popular during the 19th century, and has recently made a comeback in the form of the clubbell.

Weightlifting was first introduced in the Olympics [[1896 Summer Olympics|in the 1896 Athens Olympic games]] as a part of track and field, and was officially recognized as its own event in 1914.[https://www.britannica.com/sports/weightlifting]

The 1960s saw the gradual introduction of [[exercise machine]]s into the still-rare strength training [[gym]]s of the time. Weight training became increasingly popular in the 1970s, following the release of the bodybuilding movie ''[[Pumping Iron]],'' and the subsequent popularity of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. Since the late 1990s increasing numbers of women have taken up weight training, influenced by programs like [[Body for Life]]; currently nearly one in five U.S. women engage in weight training on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=U.S.C.D.P.&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13956966/|title=MSNBC article on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on the prevalence of strength training|access-date=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic principles==
{{Main|Strength training}}
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
The basic principles of weight training are essentially identical to those of strength training, and involve a manipulation of the number of repetitions (reps), sets, tempo, exercise types, and weight moved to cause desired increases in strength, endurance, and size. The specific combinations of reps, sets, exercises, and weights depends on the aims of the individual performing the exercise.

In addition to the basic principles of ''strength training'', a further consideration added by weight training is the equipment used. Types of equipment include [[barbell]]s, dumbbells, pulleys and stacks in the form of [[weight machine]]s, and the body's own weight in the case of [[chin-up]]s and [[Press up|push-ups]]. Different types of weights will give different types of resistance, and often the same absolute weight can have different relative weights depending on the type of equipment used. For example, lifting 10 kilograms using a dumbbell sometimes requires more force than moving 10 kilograms on a weight stack if certain pulley arrangements are used. In other cases, the weight stack may require more force than the equivalent dumbbell weight due to additional torque or resistance in the machine. Additionally, although they may display the same weight stack, different machines may be heavier or lighter depending on the number of pulleys and their arrangements.

Weight training also requires the use of '[[Form (exercise)|good form]]', performing the movements with the appropriate muscle group, and not transferring the weight to different body parts in order to move greater weight (called '[[Cheating#Sports|cheating]]'). Failure to use good form during a training set can result in injury or a failure to meet training goals; since the desired muscle group is not challenged sufficiently, the threshold of [[strength training#Progressive overload|overload]] is never reached and the muscle does not gain in strength. At a particularly advanced level; however, "cheating" can be used to break through strength plateaus and encourage neurological and muscular adaptation.

==Safety==
Weight training is a safe form of exercise when the movements are controlled and carefully defined. However, as with any form of exercise, improper execution and the failure to take appropriate precautions can result in injury.

===Maintaining proper form===
[[File:DumbbellDeadlift.JPG|thumb|A [[dumbbell]] [[half-squat]].&lt;ref name="Rippetoe-2005"&gt;In the first picture, the knees are too close and get twisted. For appropriate muscular development and safety the knee should be in line with the foot. {{cite book|last= Rippetoe|first= Mark| name-list-format = vanc |authorlink=Mark Rippetoe|author2=Lon Kilgore |title=Starting Strength|publisher=The Aasgard Company|year=2005|isbn=0-9768054-0-5|pages=46–49|chapter=Knees}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Maintaining proper form is one of the many steps in order to perfectly perform a certain technique. Correct form in weight training improves strength, muscle tone, and maintaining a healthy weight. Proper form will prevent any strains or fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/weight-training/art-20045842?pg=2|title=Weight training: Do's and don'ts of proper technique - Mayo Clinic|website=www.mayoclinic.org|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the exercise becomes difficult towards the end of a set, there is a temptation to cheat, i.e., to use poor form to recruit other muscle groups to assist the effort. Avoid heavy weight and keep the number of repetitions to a  minimum. This may shift the effort to weaker muscles that cannot handle the weight. For example, the [[squat (exercise)|''squat'']] and the ''[[deadlift]]'' are used to exercise the largest muscles in the body—the [[Human leg|leg]] and [[buttock]] muscles—so they require substantial weight. Beginners are tempted to round their back while performing these exercises. The relaxation of the spinal erectors which allows the lower back to round can cause shearing in the vertebrae of the lumbar spine, potentially damaging the spinal discs.

===Stretching and warm-up===
Weight trainers commonly spend 5 to 20 minutes [[warming up]] their muscles before starting a workout. It is common to stretch the entire body to increase overall [[Flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]]; however, many people stretch just the area being worked that day.  The main reason for warming up is injury prevention.  Warming up increases blood flow and flexibility, which lessens the chance of a muscle pull or joint pain.

Warm up sets are also important. For example, the same lifter working on his chest would also be advised to complete at least two warm up sets prior to hitting his "core tonnage." Core tonnage refers to the heavier lifts that actually strain your muscles. For example, if the lifter's main sets were at 205&amp;nbsp;lbs, 225&amp;nbsp;lbs and 235&amp;nbsp;lbs on the bench, then a warmup of 5 reps of 135 and 5 reps of 185 would be advisable. Some lifters will warm up with a 50/50 set for example 50% of the target weight for 50% of the target repetitions. When properly warmed up the lifter will then have more strength and stamina since the blood has begun to flow to the muscle groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McMillian DJ, Moore JH, Hatler BS, Taylor DC | title = Dynamic vs. static-stretching warm up: the effect on power and agility performance | journal = Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 492–9 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16937960 | doi = 10.1519/18205.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breathing===
In weight training, as with most forms of exercise, there is a tendency for the breathing pattern to deepen. This helps to meet increased oxygen requirements. Holding the breath or breathing shallowly is avoided because it may lead to a lack of oxygen, passing out, or an excessive build up of blood pressure. Generally, the recommended breathing technique is to inhale when lowering the weight (the eccentric portion) and exhale when lifting the weight (the concentric portion). However, the reverse, inhaling when lifting and exhaling when lowering, may also be recommended. Some researchers state that there is little difference between the two techniques in terms of their influence on heart rate and blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Steven J | last1 = Fleck | first2 = William J | last2 = Kraemer | name-list-format = vanc |title=Designing resistance training programs |isbn=978-0-7360-8170-2 |edition=Fourth | location = Leeds | publisher = Human Kinetics | date = 2014 | page = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be recommended that a weight lifter simply breathes in a manner which feels appropriate.
 
Deep breathing may be specifically recommended for the lifting of heavy weights because it helps to generate intra-abdominal pressure which can help to strengthen the posture of the lifter, and especially their [[core (anatomy)|core]].&lt;ref&gt;https://vitals.lifehacker.com/the-right-way-to-breathe-for-more-powerful-weightliftin-1765146303&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular situations, a coach may advise performing the [[valsalva maneuver]] during exercises which place a load on the spine, since the risk of a stroke by aneurysm is astronomically lower than the risk of an orthopedic injury caused by inadequate rigidity of the torso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rippetoe|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Rippetoe|first2 = Lon | last2 = Kilgore | name-list-format = vanc |title=Starting Strength|publisher=The Aasgard Company|year=2005|isbn=0-9768054-0-5|pages=46–49|chapter=Squat}} &lt;!--Needs reference to page number, proper citation of "Starting Strength", and some source for the relevant statistics on the types of injuries, if possible, not from "Starting Strength" itself, to give a second source of support.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism of building "high levels of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP)...produced by breath holding using the Valsava maneuver", to "ensure spine stiffness and stability during these extraordinary demands", "should be considered only for extreme weight-lifting challenges — not for rehabilitation exercise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Stuart | last = McGill | title = Low Back Disorders | edition = 2d | publisher = Human Kinetics | date = 2007 | chapter = Breathing | pages = 186–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydration===
As with other sports, weight trainers should avoid [[dehydration]] throughout the workout by drinking sufficient water. This is particularly true in hot environments, or for those older than 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/water-water-everywhere|title=Water, Water, Everywhere|publisher=WebMD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.msn.com/blogs/healthy-diet-fit-body-post.aspx?post=1188190|title=Metabolism Myth #5|publisher=MSN Health|author= Mark Dedomenico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ACSM07"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2007/02000/Exercise_and_Fluid_Replacement.22.aspx|title=Exercise and Fluid Replacement|publisher=American College of Sports Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/04/02/eveningnews/main3991145.shtml|title=Busting The 8-Glasses-A-Day Myth|publisher=CBS|author=Nancy Cordes | date=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dms.dartmouth.edu/news/2002_h2/08aug2002_water.shtml|title="Drink at Least 8 Glasses of Water a Day" - Really?|publisher=Dartmouth Medical School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some athletic trainers advise athletes to drink about {{convert|7|impfloz|mL}} every 15 minutes while exercising, and about {{convert|80|impfloz|L}} throughout the day.&lt;ref name="Johnson-Cane 75"&gt;Johnson-Cane et al., p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Does 'dL' refer to deci-litre?? --&gt;

However, a much more accurate determination of how much fluid is necessary can be made by performing appropriate weight measurements before and after a typical exercise session, to determine how much fluid is lost during the workout. The greatest source of fluid loss during exercise is through perspiration, but as long as your fluid intake is roughly equivalent to your rate of perspiration, hydration levels will be maintained.&lt;ref name="ACSM07" /&gt;

Under most circumstances, [[sports drinks]] do not offer a physiological benefit over water during weight training.&lt;ref name="Johnson-Cane 76"&gt;Johnson-Cane et al., p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; However, high-intensity exercise for a continuous duration of at least one hour may require the replenishment of electrolytes which a sports drink may provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/hydrationandfluid/a/ProperHydration.htm |title=Hydration and Exercise - What to Drink for Proper Hydration During Exercise |publisher=Sportsmedicine.about.com |date=2011-04-15 |access-date=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some may maintain that [[energy drinks]], such as [[Red Bull]] that contain caffeine, improve performance in weight training and other physical exercise, but in fact, these energy drinks can cause dehydration, tremors, heat stroke, and heart attack when consumed in excess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/2009-07-01-Drinks_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Overuse of energy drinks worries health pros | first=Michael | last=McCarthy | name-list-format = vanc | date=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'Sports drinks' that contain simple carbohydrates &amp; water do not cause ill effects, but are most likely unnecessary for the average trainee. More recently, people have been taking [[pre-workout]] before working out to increase performance. The main ingredients      in these pre-workouts are: [[Β-Alanine|beta-alanine]], [[creatine]], BCAAs ([[Branched-chain amino acid|branched chain amino acids]]) and [[caffeine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Outlaw JJ, Wilborn CD, Smith-Ryan AE, Hayward SE, Urbina SL, Taylor LW, Foster CA | title = Acute effects of a commercially-available pre-workout supplement on markers of training: a double-blind study | journal = Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition | volume = 11 | pages = 40 | date = 2014-08-15 | pmid = 25302053 | doi = 10.1186/s12970-014-0040-0 | url = https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-014-0040-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insufficient hydration may cause lethargy, soreness or [[muscle cramps]].&lt;ref name="Johnson-Cane 153"&gt;Johnson-Cane et al., p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; The [[urine]] of well-hydrated persons should be nearly colorless, while an intense yellow color is normally a sign of insufficient hydration.&lt;ref name="Johnson-Cane 153" /&gt;

===Avoiding pain===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2011}}
An exercise should be halted if marked or sudden pain is felt, to prevent further injury. However, not all discomfort indicates injury. Weight training exercises are brief but very intense, and many people are unaccustomed to this level of effort. The expression "[[no pain, no gain]]" refers to working through the discomfort expected from such vigorous effort, rather than to willfully ignore extreme pain, which may indicate serious [[soft tissue]] injuries. The focus must be proper form, not the amount of weight lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/7-tips-for-a-safe-and-successful-strength-training-program|title=7 tips for a safe and successful strength-training program | publisher = Harvard Health|work=Harvard Health Publishing |access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discomfort can arise from other factors. Individuals who perform large numbers of repetitions, sets, and exercises for each muscle group may experience a burning sensation in their muscles. These individuals may also experience a swelling sensation in their muscles from increased blood flow (the "pump"). True [[muscle fatigue]] is experienced as a marked and uncontrollable loss of strength in a muscle, arising from the [[nervous system]] ([[motor unit]]) rather than from the muscle fibers themselves. Extreme neural fatigue can be experienced as temporary muscle failure. Some weight training programs, such as Metabolic Resistance Training, actively seek temporary muscle failure; evidence to support this type of training is mixed at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.trainingscience.net/?page_id=635|title=Is Training To Failure Necessary?|date=2012-03-27|work=Training Science|access-date=2017-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irrespective of their program, however, most athletes engaged in high-intensity weight training will experience muscle failure during their regimens.

Beginners are advised to build up slowly to a weight training program. Untrained individuals may have some muscles that are comparatively stronger than others; nevertheless, an injury can result if (in a particular exercise) the primary muscle is stronger than its stabilizing muscles. Building up slowly allows muscles time to develop appropriate strengths relative to each other. This can also help to minimize [[delayed onset muscle soreness]]. A sudden start to an intense program can cause significant muscular soreness. Unexercised muscles contain cross-linkages that are torn during intense exercise. A regimen of flexibility exercises should be implemented before weight training begins, to help avoid soft tissue pain and injuries.

===Other precautions===
Anyone beginning an intensive physical training program is typically advised to consult a [[physician]], because of possible undetected heart or other conditions for which such activity is contraindicated.

Exercises like the [[bench press]] or the [[Squat (exercise)|squat]] in which a failed lift can potentially result in the lifter becoming trapped under the weight are normally performed inside a [[Power cage|power rack]] or in the presence of one or more [[Spotting (weight training)|spotters]], who can safely re-rack the barbell if the weight trainer is unable to do so.

==Equipment==
{{Main|Exercise equipment}}
Weight training usually requires different types of equipment, most commonly [[dumbbell]]s, [[barbell]]s, [[weight plate]]s, and [[weight machine]]s.  Various combinations of [[List of weight training exercises|specific exercises]], machines, dumbbells, and barbells allow trainees to exercise body parts in numerous ways.{{Multiple image|image1 = WristStrap.JPG|image2 = LiftingBelt.JPG|caption1 = A lifting strap.|caption2 = A lifting belt.}}

Other types of equipment include:
* Lifting straps, which allow more weight to be lifted by transferring the load to the wrists and avoiding limitations in forearm muscles and [[grip strength]]
* Weightlifting belts, which are meant to brace the core through intra-abdominal pressure. Controversy exists regarding the safety of these devices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kingma I, Faber GS, Suwarganda EK, Bruijnen TB, Peters RJ, van Dieën JH | title = Effect of a stiff lifting belt on spine compression during lifting | journal = Spine | volume = 31 | issue = 22 | pages = E833-9 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17047531 | doi = 10.1097/01.brs.0000240670.50834.77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their proper use is often misunderstood.
* [[Weighted clothing]], bags of sand, [[lead shot]], or other materials that are strapped to wrists, ankles, torso or other body parts to increase the amount of work required by muscles
* Gloves can improve grip, prevent the formation of calluses on the hands, relieve pressure on the wrists, and provide support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/17819-benefits-wearing-weight-lifting-gloves/|title = The benefits of wearing weight lifting gloves}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[MgCO3|Chalk (MgCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]], which dries out sweaty hands, improving grip
* Wrist and knee wraps
* Shoes, which have a flat, rigid sole to provide a sturdy base of support, and may feature a raised heel of varying height (usually 0.5" or 0.75") to accommodate a lifter's biomechanics for more efficient squats, deadlifts, overhead presses, and [[Olympic weightlifting|Olympic lifts]].

==Types of exercises==
{{see also|List of weight training exercises}}

===Isolation exercises versus compound exercises===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
[[File:LegExtensionMachineExercise.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The ''leg extension'' is an isolation exercise.]]
An '''isolation exercise''' is one where the movement is restricted to one joint only. For example, the ''leg extension'' is an isolation exercise for the quadriceps. Specialized types of equipment are used to ensure that other muscle groups are only minimally involved—they just help the individual maintain a stable posture—and movement occurs only around the knee joint. Most isolation exercises involve machines rather than dumbbells and barbells (free weights), though free weights can be used when combined with special positions and joint bracing.

'''Compound exercises''' work several muscle groups at once, and include movement around two or more joints. For example, in the ''leg press'', movement occurs around the hip, knee and ankle joints. This exercise is primarily used to develop the quadriceps, but it also involves the hamstrings, glutes and calves. Compound exercises are generally similar to the ways that people naturally push, pull and lift objects, whereas isolation exercises often feel a little unnatural.

Each type of exercise has its uses. Compound exercises build the basic strength that is needed to perform everyday pushing, pulling and lifting activities. Isolation exercises are useful for "rounding out" a routine, by directly exercising muscle groups that cannot be fully exercised in the compound exercises.

The type of exercise performed also depends on the individual's goals. Those who seek to increase their performance in sports would focus mostly on compound exercises, with isolation exercises being used to strengthen just those muscles that are holding the athlete back. Similarly, a [[powerlifter]] would focus on the specific compound exercises that are performed at powerlifting competitions. However, those who seek to improve the look of their body without necessarily maximizing their strength gains (including [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilders]]) would put more of an emphasis on isolation exercises. Both types of athletes, however, generally make use of both compound and isolation exercises.

===Free weights versus weight machines===
[[File:SwissBallSquat.JPG|thumb|right|204x204px|Exercise balls allow a wider range of free weight exercises to be performed. They are also known as Swiss balls, stability balls, fitness balls, gym balls, sports balls, therapy balls or body balls. They are sometimes confused with [[medicine ball]]s.]]

'''Free weights''' include [[dumbbell]]s, [[barbell]]s, [[medicine ball]]s, [[sandbell]]s, and [[kettlebell]]s. Unlike [[weight machine]]s, they do not constrain users to specific, fixed movements, and therefore require more effort from the individual's stabilizer muscles. It is often argued that free weight exercises are superior for precisely this reason. For example, they are recommended for golf players, since golf is a unilateral exercise that can break body balances, requiring exercises to keep the balance in muscles.&lt;ref&gt;Ahn Hyejung (November 11, 2012), ''World Class Fitness Trainers, [[John Sitaras]]'', [[Golf Digest]] (Korean edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WeightStack.JPG|thumb|left|206x206px|The weight stack from a [[cable machine]].]]

Some free weight exercises can be performed while sitting or lying on an [[exercise ball]].

There are a number of '''weight machines''' that are commonly found in neighborhood gyms. The [[Smith machine]] is a barbell that is constrained to vertical movement. The [[cable machine]] consists of two weight stacks separated by 2.5 metres, with cables running through adjustable pulleys (that can be fixed at any height so as to select different amounts of weight) to various types of handles. There are also exercise-specific [[weight machine]]s such as the [[leg press]]. A multigym includes a variety of exercise-specific mechanisms in one apparatus.

One limitation of many free weight exercises and exercise machines is that the muscle is working maximally against gravity during only a small portion of the lift. Some exercise-specific machines feature an oval [[cam]] (first introduced by [[Nautilus, Inc.|Nautilus]]) which varies the resistance, so that the resistance, and the muscle force required, remains constant throughout the full range of motion of the exercise.

===Push-pull workout===
A push–pull workout is a method of arranging a weight training routine so that exercises alternate between push motions and pull motions.&lt;ref name=EIRM&gt;
{{cite book

  | isbn = 978-0-7360-5541-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A push–pull superset is two complementary segments (one pull/one push) done back-to-back. An example is [[bench press]] (push) / [[bent-over row]] (pull). Another push–pull technique is to arrange workout routines so that one day involves only push (usually chest, shoulders and triceps) exercises, and an alternate day only pull (usually back and biceps) exercises so the body can get adequate rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.flexonline.com/training/push-pull-training|title=Push-Pull Training|work=FLEX Online|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotonic and plyometric exercises===
These terms combine the prefix ''iso-'' (meaning "same") with ''tonic'' ("strength") and ''plio-'' ("more") with ''metric'' ("distance"). In "isotonic" exercises the force applied to the muscle does not change (while the length of the muscle [[Concentric contraction|decreases]] or [[Eccentric contraction|increases]]) while in "plyometric" exercises the length of the muscle stretches and contracts rapidly to increase the power output of a muscle.

Weight training is primarily an '''isotonic''' form of exercise, as the force produced by the muscle to push or pull weighted objects should not change (though in practice the force produced does decrease as muscles fatigue). Any object can be used for weight training, but dumbbells, barbells, and other specialised equipment are normally used because they can be adjusted to specific weights and are easily gripped. Many exercises are not strictly isotonic because the force on the muscle varies as the joint moves through its range of motion. Movements can become easier or harder depending on the angle of muscular force relative to gravity; for example, a standard biceps curl becomes easier as the hand approaches the shoulder as more of the load is taken by the structure of the elbow. Originating from [[Nautilus, Inc.]], some machines use a logarithmic-spiral [[cam]] to keep resistance constant irrespective of the joint angle.

[[Plyometrics]] exploit the stretch-shortening cycle of muscles to enhance the myotatic (stretch) reflex. This involves rapid alternation of lengthening and shortening of muscle fibers against resistance. The resistance involved is often a weighted object such as a [[medicine ball]] or sandbag, but can also be the body itself as in jumping exercises or the body with a weight vest that allows movement with resistance. Plyometrics is used to develop explosive speed, and focuses on maximal [[Power (physics)|power]] instead of maximal strength by compressing the force of muscular contraction into as short a period as possible, and may be used to improve the effectiveness of a [[boxing|boxer's]] punch, or to increase the vertical jumping ability of a [[basketball]] player. Care must be taken when performing plyometric exercises because they inflict greater stress upon the involved joints and tendons than other forms of exercise.

==Health benefits==
Benefits of weight training include increased strength, muscle mass, endurance, bone and bone mineral density, insulin sensitivity, GLUT 4 density, HDL cholesterol, improved cardiovascular health and appearance, and decreased body fat, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Westcott WL | title = Resistance training is medicine: effects of strength training on health | journal = Current Sports Medicine Reports | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 209–16 | date = July–August 2012 | pmid = 22777332 | doi = 10.1249/jsr.0b013e31825dabb8 | url = http://journals.lww.com/acsm-csmr/Abstract/2012/07000/Resistance_Training_is_Medicine___Effects_of.13.aspx | format = Abstract }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body's [[basal metabolic rate]] increases with increases in muscle mass, which promotes long-term [[dieting|fat loss]] and helps dieters avoid [[yo-yo dieting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbass.com/METABOLI.HTM|title=Fat Loss Article: Metabolism Myth|work=cbass.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, intense workouts elevate [[metabolism]] for several hours following the workout, which also promotes fat loss.&lt;ref name=De2004&gt;{{cite journal | format = PDF | author = De Mello Meirelles, C. |author2=Gomes, P.S.C.  | year = 2004 | title = Acute effects of resistance exercise on energy expenditure: revisiting the impact of the training variables | journal = Rev Bras Med Esporte | volume = 10 | pages = 131–8 | url = http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rbme/v10n2/en_a06v10n2.pdf  | access-date = 2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weight training also provides functional benefits. Stronger muscles improve posture, provide better support for [[joint]]s, and reduce the risk of [[injury]] from everyday activities. [[Old age|Older]] people who take up weight training can prevent some of the loss of muscle tissue that normally accompanies [[aging]]—and even regain some functional strength—and by doing so, become less frail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mayer F, Scharhag-Rosenberger F, Carlsohn A, Cassel M, Müller S, Scharhag J | title = The intensity and effects of strength training in the elderly | journal = Deutsches Arzteblatt International | volume = 108 | issue = 21 | pages = 359–64 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21691559 | pmc = 3117172 | doi = 10.3238/arztebl.2011.0359 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be able to avoid some types of [[physical disability]]. Weight-bearing exercise also helps to prevent [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Layne JE, Nelson ME | title = The effects of progressive resistance training on bone density: a review | journal = Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–30 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9927006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of weight training for older people have been confirmed by studies of people who began engaging in it even in their eighties and nineties.

For many people in [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]] or with an acquired [[disability]], such as following stroke or orthopaedic surgery, strength training for weak muscles is a key factor to optimise recovery.&lt;ref name="pmid17132118"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ada L, Dorsch S, Canning CG | title = Strengthening interventions increase strength and improve activity after stroke: a systematic review | journal = The Australian Journal of Physiotherapy | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 241–8 | date = 2006 | pmid = 17132118 | doi = 10.1016/S0004-9514(06)70003-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For people with such a health condition, their strength training is likely to need to be designed by an appropriate health professional, such as a [[physiotherapist]].

Stronger muscles improve performance in a variety of sports. Sport-specific training routines are used by many competitors. These often specify that the speed of [[muscle contraction]] during weight training should be the same as that of the particular sport. Sport-specific training routines also often include variations to both free weight and machine movements that may not be common for traditional weightlifting.

Though weight training can stimulate the [[cardiovascular system]], many exercise [[physiologist]]s, based on their observation of maximal [[oxygen]] uptake, argue that [[aerobics]] training is a better cardiovascular stimulus. Central [[catheter]] monitoring during resistance training reveals increased [[cardiac output]], suggesting that strength training shows potential for [[cardiovascular exercise]]. However, a 2007 meta-analysis found that, though aerobic training is an effective therapy for heart failure patients, combined aerobic and strength training is ineffective; "the favorable antiremodeling role of aerobic exercise was not confirmed when this mode of exercise was combined with strength training".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haykowsky MJ, Liang Y, Pechter D, Jones LW, McAlister FA, Clark AM | title = A meta-analysis of the effect of exercise training on left ventricular remodeling in heart failure patients: the benefit depends on the type of training performed | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 49 | issue = 24 | pages = 2329–36 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17572248 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2007.02.055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One side-effect of any intense exercise is increased levels of [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]], which can help to improve mood and counter feelings of [[depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/exercise-depression|title=Exercise and Depression|work=WebMD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weight training has also been shown to benefit dieters as it inhibits lean body mass loss (as opposed to fat loss) when under a caloric deficit. Weight training also strengthens bones, helping to prevent bone loss and [[osteoporosis]]. By increasing muscular strength and improving balance, weight training can also reduce falls by elderly persons. Weight training is also attracting attention for the benefits it can have on the brain, and in older adults, a 2017 meta analysis found that it was effective in improving cognitive performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Northey JM, Cherbuin N, Pumpa KL, Smee DJ, Rattray B | title = Exercise interventions for cognitive function in adults older than 50: a systematic review with meta-analysis | journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 154–160 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 28438770 | doi = 10.1136/bjsports-2016-096587 | url = http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2017/03/30/bjsports-2016-096587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weight training and other types of strength training==
The benefits of weight training overall are comparable to most other types of strength training: increased muscle, tendon and ligament strength, bone density, flexibility, tone, metabolic rate, and postural support. This type of training will also help prevent injury for athletes. There are benefits and limitations to weight training as compared to other types of strength training. Contrary to popular belief, weight training can be beneficial for both men and women.

===Weight training and bodybuilding===
Although weight training is similar to bodybuilding, they have different objectives. Bodybuilders use weight training to develop their muscles for size, shape, and symmetry regardless of any increase in strength for competition in bodybuilding contests; they train to maximize their muscular size and develop extremely low levels of [[adipose tissue|body fat]]. In contrast, many weight trainers train to improve their strength and anaerobic endurance while not giving special attention to reducing body fat far below normal.

The bodybuilding community has been the source of many weight training principles, techniques, vocabulary, and customs. Weight training does allow tremendous flexibility in exercises and weights which can allow bodybuilders to target specific muscles and muscle groups, as well as attain specific goals. Not all bodybuilding is undertaken to compete in bodybuilding contests and, in fact, the vast majority of bodybuilders never compete, but bodybuild for their own personal reasons.

===Complex training===
In [[complex training]], weight training is typically combined with plyometric exercises in an alternating sequence. Ideally, the weight lifting exercise and the plyometric exercise should move through similar ranges of movement i.e. a back squat at 85-95% [[1RM]] followed by a vertical jump. An advantage of this form of training is that it allows the intense activation of the nervous system and increased muscle fibre recruitment from the weight lifting exercise to be utilized in the subsequent plyometric exercise; thereby improving the power with which it can be performed. Over a period of training, this may enhance the athlete's ability to apply power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Steven J | last1 = Fleck | first2 = William J | last2 = Kraemer | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Complex Training, or Contrast Loading | title =Designing Resistance Training Programmes | publisher = Human Kinetics | location = Leeds | date = 2013 | page = 253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plyometric exercise may be replaced with a sports specific action. The intention being to utilize the neural and muscular activation from the heavy lift in the sports specific action, in order to be able to perform it more powerfully. Over a period of training this may enhance the athlete's ability to perform that sports specific action more powerfully, without a precursory heavy lift being required.

===Ballistic training===
[[Ballistic training]] incorporates weight training in such a way that the acceleration phase of the movement is maximized and the deceleration phase minimized; thereby increasing the power of the movement overall. For example, throwing a weight or jumping whilst holding a weight. This can be contrasted with a standard weight lifting exercise where there is a distinct deceleration phase at the end of the repetition which stops the weight from moving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Steven J | last1 = Fleck | first2 = William J | last2 = Kraemer | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Ballistic Training | title = Designing Resistance Training Programmes | publisher = Human Kinetics | location = Leeds | date = 2013 | page = 280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contrast loading===
Contrast loading is the alternation of heavy and light loads. Considered as sets, the heavy load is performed at about 85-95% 1 repetition max; the light load should be considerably lighter at about 30-60% [[1RM]]. Both sets should be performed fast with the lighter set being performed as fast as possible. The joints should not be locked as this inhibits muscle fibre recruitment and reduces the speed at which the exercise can be performed. The lighter set may be a [[Plyometrics#Loaded plyometrics|loaded plyometric]] exercise such as  loaded squat jumps or jumps with a trap bar.

Similarly to complex training, contrast loading relies upon the enhanced activation of the nervous system and increased muscle fibre recruitment from the heavy set, to allow the lighter set to be performed more powerfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McGuigan | first = Mike | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Contrast Training | title = Developing Power | location = Leeds | publisher = Human Kinetics | date = 2017 | pages = 196–197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a physiological effect is commonly referred to as post-activation potentiation, or the PAP effect. Contrast loading can effectively demonstrate the PAP effect: if a light weight is lifted, and then a heavy weight is lifted, and then the same light weight is lifted again, then the light weight will feel lighter the second time it has been lifted. This is due to the enhanced PAP effect which occurs as a result of the heavy lift being utilised in the subsequent lighter lift; thus making the weight feel lighter and allowing the lift to be performed more powerfully.

===Weight training versus isometric training===
{{See also|Isometric exercise#Comparison with dynamic exercises}}
[[Isometric exercise]] provides a maximum amount of resistance based on the force output of the muscle, or muscles pitted against one another. This maximum force maximally strengthens the muscles over all of the joint angles at which the isometric exercise occurs. By comparison, weight training also strengthens the muscle throughout the [[range of motion]] the [[joint]] is trained in, but only maximally at one angle, causing a lesser increase in physical strength at other angles from the initial through terminating joint angle as compared with isometric exercise. In addition, the risk of injury from weights used in weight training is greater than with isometric exercise (no weights), and the risk of asymmetric training is also greater than with isometric exercise of identical opposing muscles.

'''Women's sports''' includes [[amateur sports|amateur]] as well as [[women's professional sports]], in all varieties of [[sports]]. Female participation and popularity in sports increased dramatically in the twentieth century, especially in the last quarter-century, reflecting changes in modern societies that emphasized [[gender]] parity. Although the level of participation and performance still varies greatly by [[country]] and by [[Sports|sport]], [[women]]'s sports are widely accepted throughout the world today. In a few instances, such as [[figure skating]], female athletes rival or exceed their [[male]] counterparts in popularity. In many sports women usually do not compete on equal terms against men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ross Tucker, The Science of Sport |url=http://www.sportsscientists.com/2010/04/let-male-and-female-compete-together.html |title=Let male and female compete together &amp;#124; The Science of Sport |publisher=SportsScientists.com |date=2010-04-15 |access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there has been a rise in participation by women in sports, a large disparity still remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thesportjournal.org/article/examination-of-gender-equity-and-female-participation-in-sport/ |title=Examination of Gender Equity and Female Participation in Sport |date=2016-02-26 |newspaper=The Sport Journal |access-date=2017-02-08 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These disparities are prevalent globally and continue to hinder equality in sports. Many institutions and programs still remain conservative and do not contribute to gender equity in sports.

==History==

===Ancient civilizations===
{{expand section|date=October 2011}}
[[File:Villa romana bikini girls.JPG|thumb|Roman women engaged in sports. [[Mosaic]] at the [[Villa del Casale|Villa Romana del Casale]] near [[Piazza Armerina]] in [[Sicily]]]]
[[File:Greek Runner Maiden 2.png|thumb|A statue of a victress of the Heraean Games, represented near the start of a race]]
Before each [[ancient Olympic Games]] there was a separate women's athletic event held at the same stadium in Olympia, the [[Heraean Games]],  dedicated to the goddess [[Hera]]. Myth held that the Heraea was founded by [[Hippodameia]], the wife of the king who founded the Olympics.&lt;ref name=Scanlon&gt;{{cite web |author=Scanlon, Thomas F. |title=Games for Girls |work="Ancient Olympics Guide" |url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/olympics/girls.html |access-date=February 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to E. Norman Gardiner:

{{Quote| At the festival there were races for maidens of various ages. Their course was 500 feet, or one-sixth less than the men's stadium. The maidens ran with their hair down their backs, a short tunic reaching just below the knee, and their right shoulder bare to the breast. The victors received crowns of olive and a share of the heifer sacrificed to Hera. They had, too, the right of setting up their statues in the Heraeum.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, E. Norman, 'The Rise of the Athletic Festival' in ''Greek Athletic Sport and Festivals'', London:MacMillan, 1910, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Although married women were excluded from the Olympics even as spectators, [[Cynisca]] won an Olympic game as owner of a chariot (champions of chariot races were owners not riders), as did [[Euryleonis]], [[Belistiche]], [[Polycrates of Argos|Zeuxo, Encrateia and Hermione]], Timareta, Theodota and Cassia.

After the classical period, there was some participation by women in men's athletic festivals.&lt;ref name=Scanlon/&gt; Women in Sparta began to practice the same athletic exercises that men did, exhibiting the qualities of Spartan soldiers. Plato even supported women in sports by advocating running and sword-fighting for women.&lt;ref&gt;Swaddling, Judith. The Ancient Olympic Games. Austin: U of Texas, 1980. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, cultural representations of a pronounced female physicality were not limited to sport in Ancient Greece and can also be found in representations of a group of warrioresses known as the [[Amazons]].

===Early modern===
During the [[Song dynasty|Song]], [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]], and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties, women played in professional [[Cuju]] teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://features.cultural-china.com/cuju/index02.html |title=Cuju – Ancient Chinese Football |author= |date= |work=Cultural-China.com |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://features.cultural-china.com/cuju/ |title=Cuju – Ancient Chinese Football |author= |date= |work=Cultural-China.com |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chujutu.jpg|thumb|Chinese ladies playing ''cuju'', by the [[Ming Dynasty]] painter [[Du Jin]]]] The first Olympic games in the modern era, which were in 1896 were not open to women, but since then the number of women who have participated in the Olympic games have increased dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Olympic.org |title=Women and Sport Commission |url=http://www.olympic.org/women-sport-commission |work=Olympic.org |access-date=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th and early 20th centuries===
The educational committees of the [[French Revolution]] (1789) included intellectual, moral, and physical education for both girls and boys. With the victory of Napoleon less than twenty years later, physical education was reduced to military preparedness for boys and men. In Germany, the physical education of [[GutsMuths]] (1793) included girl's education. This included the measurement of performances of girls. This led to women's sport being more actively pursued in Germany than in most other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]] (2003): ''Germany'', in: [[James Riordan]] &amp; [[Arnd Krüger]] (eds.): ''European Cultures in Sport. Examining the Nations and Regions''. Bristol: Intellect 2003, pp. 57 – 88.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale]] was formed as an all women's international organization it had a German male vice-president in addition to German international success in elite sports.

Women's sports in the late 1800s focused on correct posture, facial and bodily beauty, muscles, and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Padgett |first1=Jessica |title=The Issues of Women in Sport |url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/scisoc/sports02/papers/jpadgett.html |website=Serendip Studio |accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1870, activities for women were recreational rather than sport-specific in nature. They were noncompetitive, informal, rule-less; they emphasized physical activity rather than competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bell |first1=Richard |title=A History of Women in Sport Prior to Title IX |url=http://thesportjournal.org/article/a-history-of-women-in-sport-prior-to-title-ix/ |website=The Sport Journal |accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports for women before the 20th century placed more emphasis on fitness rather than the competitive aspects we now associate with all sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thesportjournal.org/article/a-history-of-women-in-sport-prior-to-title-ix/ |title=A History of Women in Sport Prior to Title IX |date=2008-03-14 |newspaper=The Sport Journal |access-date=2017-02-05 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) held its first national championship for women (in swimming),{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWmCWO6SpsYC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=In+1916+the+Amateur+Athletic+Union+(AAU)+held+its+first+national+championship+for+women.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6Xh1YQtV58&amp;sig=Ec4urY3ZtRZHwkwG708ffcsqIh8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2v5WZ1vnRAhUH92MKHZBaCogQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=In%201916%20the%20Amateur%20Athletic%20Union%20(AAU)%20held%20its%20first%20national%20championship%20for%20women.&amp;f=false |title=Outstanding Women Athletes: Who They are and how They Influenced Sports in America |last=Woolum |first=Janet |date=1998-01-01 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=9781573561204 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 the AAU also sponsored the [[1923 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships|First American Track &amp; Field championships for women]]. Earlier that year the [[Women's Amateur Athletic Association]] (WAAA) held [[1923 WAAA Championships|the first WAAA Championships]].

Few women competed in sports in Europe and North America before the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as social changes favored increased female participation in society as equals with men. Although women were technically permitted to participate in many sports, relatively few did. There was often disapproval of those who did.

"Bicycling has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world." [[Susan B. Anthony]] said "I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride on a wheel. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance."

The modern [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] had female competitors from 1900 onward, though women at first participated in considerably fewer events than men. Women first made their appearance in the Olympic Games in Paris in 1900. That year, 22 women competed in tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrian, and golf.&lt;ref&gt;"Equality for Women in the Olympics." Feminist Majority Foundation. Web. November 2014. http://www.feminist.org/sports/olympics.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  As of the IOC-Congress in Paris 1914 a woman's medal had formally the same weight as a man's in the official medal table. This left the decisions about women's participation to the individual international sports federations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]]: Forgotton Decisions. The IOC on the Eve of World War I, in: ''Olympika'' 6 (1997), 85 – 98. &lt;http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/Olympika/Olympika_1997/olympika0601g.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Concern over the physical strength and stamina of women led to the discouragement of female participation in more physically intensive sports, and in some cases led to less physically demanding female versions of male sports.  Thus [[netball]] was developed out of [[basketball]] and [[softball]] out of [[baseball]].

In response to the lack of support for women's international sport the [[Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale]] was founded in France by [[Alice Milliat]]. This organization initiated the Women's Olympiad (held [[1921 Women's Olympiad|1921]], [[1922 Women's Olympiad|1922]] and [[1923 Women's Olympiad|1923]]) and the [[Women's World Games]], which attracted participation of nearly 20 countries and was held four times ([[1922 Women's World Games|1922]], [[1926 Women's World Games|1926]], [[1930 Women's World Games|1930]] and [[1934 Women's World Games|1934]]).&lt;ref name="LeighBonin"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Leigh |first=Mary H. |author2=Bonin, Thérèse M. |title=The Pioneering Role Of Madame Alice Milliat and the FSFI in Establishing International Trade and Field Competition for Women |journal=Journal of Sport History |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=72–83 |publisher=North American Society for Sport History |year=1977 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1977/JSH0401/jsh0401f.pdf |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1924 the [[1924 Women's Olympiad]] was held at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] in [[London]]. The [[International Olympic Committee]] began to incorporate greater participation of [[women at the Olympics]] in response. The number of Olympic women athletes increased over five-fold in the period, going from 65 at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] to 331 at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/antwerp-1920-summer-olympics Antwerp 1920]. IOC. Retrieved on 2014-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/berlin-1936-summer-olympics Berlin 1936]. IOC. Retrieved on 2014-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most early women's professional sports leagues foundered.  This is often attributed to a lack of spectator support.  Amateur competitions became the primary venue for women's sports. Throughout the mid-twentieth century, Communist countries dominated many [[Olympic sports]], including women's sports, due to state-sponsored athletic programs that were technically regarded as amateur.  The legacy of these programs endured, as former Communist countries continue to produce many of the top female athletes. Germany and Scandinavia also developed strong women's athletic programs in this period.

In 1972, the United States government implemented [[Title IX]], a law stating that any federally funded program cannot discriminate anyone based on their sex.&lt;ref name="Empowering Women in Sports"&gt;{{cite web |first=Femenist Majority Foundation |title=Empowering Women in Sports |url=http://www.feminist.org/research/sports/sports12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation by women in sports increased dramatically after its introduction, amid fears that this new law would jeopardize men's sports programs.&lt;ref name="Empowering Women in Sports"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenberg |first=Judith E. |title=Getting into the Game: Women and Sports |year=1997 |publisher=Franklin Watts |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Title IX has had a significant impact on athletics at the high school and collegiate level for female students. "In 1971, fewer than 295,000 girls participated in high school varsity athletics, accounting for just 7 percent of all varsity athletes; in 2001, that number leaped to 2.8 million, or 41.5 percent of all varsity athletes, according to the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education. In 1966, 16,000 females competed in intercollegiate athletics. By 2001, that number jumped to more than 150,000, accounting for 43 percent of all college athletes. In addition, a 2008 study of intercollegiate athletics showed that women's collegiate sports had grown to 9,101 teams, or 8.65 per school".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Winslow |first1=Barbara |title=The Impact of Title IX |url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/seventies/essays/impact-title-ix |website=The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the implementation of Title IX, many high schools and colleges still have huge gender disparities based on sports. According to research done by National Women's Law Center in 2011,4500 public high schools across the nation have extremely high gender inequality and are violating the Title  IX laws.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Wong, A. (2015, June 26). Where Girls Are Missing Out on High-School Sports.

There is also a huge disparity regarding sport related scholarships for men and women, with men getting 190 million more in funding than women.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Wallace, K. (2016, March 14). The real March Madness: When will women's teams get equal buzz?

This disparity shows the link between race and gender, and how it plays a significant role in the hierarchy of sports.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1990, [[Bernadette Mattox]] became the first female Division I coach of a men's basketball team, serving as an assistant at the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|University of Kentucky]]. A year later, goaltender Jenny Hanley of [[Hamline University]] became the first women to play on a men's college ice hockey team.&lt;ref name="Part 6- 1990-1997"&gt;{{cite web |first=History of Women in sports timeline |title=Part 6- 1990–1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1994, the number of females playing sports in high school had increased threefold since Title IX was implemented, and ground was broken for the [[Women's Basketball Hall of Fame]], the first such hall of fame devoted exclusively to female athletes (though men can be, and have been, inducted in non-playing roles). In 1996 the number of female high school athletes reached 2.4 million, including 819 football players, 1164 wrestlers, and 1471 ice hockey players.&lt;ref name="Part 6- 1990-1997"/&gt;

====Canada====

{{main|History of Canadian women}}
Sports are a high priority in Canadian culture, but women were long relegated to second-class status. There were also regional differences, with the eastern provinces emphasizing a more feminine "girls rule" game of basketball, while the Western provinces preferred identical rules.  Girls' and women's sport have traditionally been slowed down by a series of factors: both historically have low levels of interest and participation.  There were very few women in leadership positions in academic administration, student affairs or athletics and not many female coaches.  The media strongly emphasized men's sports as a demonstration of masculinity, suggesting that women seriously interested in sports were crossing gender lines with the male sports establishment actively hostile. Staunch feminists dismissed sports and thought of them as unworthy of their support. Women's progress was uphill; they first had to counter the common notion that women's bodies were restricted and delicate and that vigorous physical activity was dangerous. These notions where first challenged by the "new women" around 1900. These women started with bicycling; they rode into new gender spaces in education, work, and suffrage. The 1920s marked a breakthrough for women, including working-class young women in addition to the pioneering middle class sportswomen.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ann Hall, ''The Girl and the Game: A History of Women's Sport in Canada'' (Broadview Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
{{main|Sport in the United Kingdom}}
The [[United Kingdom]] has produced a range of major international sports including: association football, rugby (union and league), cricket, netball, darts, golf, tennis, table tennis, badminton, squash, bowls, rounders, modern rowing, hockey, boxing, snooker, billiards, and curling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nauright |first1=John |last2=Parrish |first2=Charles |title=Sports around the World: History, Culture, and Practice |date=2012 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781598843019 |pages=169.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, women primarily participated in the "new games" which included golf, lawn tennis, cycling, and hockey.

==United States: Title IX==
===Implementation and regulation===
In 1972 the [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the Title IX legislation as a part of the additional Amendment Act to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.&lt;ref name="Steiner 1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Steiner |first=Andy |title=A Sporting Chance: Sports and Genders |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Title IX states that: "no person shall on the basis of sex, be excluded from participating in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance...";&lt;ref name="Greenburg_1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenburg |first=Judith. E |title=Getting into the Game: Women and Sports |year=1997 |publisher=Franklin Watts |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, Title IX prohibits gender discrimination in schools that receive federal funds through grants, scholarships, or other support for students. The law states that federal funds can be withdrawn from a school engaging in intentional gender discrimination in the provision of curriculum, counseling, academic support, or general educational opportunities; this includes interscholastic or varsity sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coakley |first=Jay |title=Sports in Society |year=2007 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law from the Education Act requires that both male and female athletes have equal facilities and equal benefits. The equal benefits are the necessities such as equal equipment, uniforms, supplies, training, practice, quality in coaches and opponents, awards, cheerleaders and bands at the game.&lt;ref name="Greenburg_1997"/&gt; In practice, the difficulty{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} with Title IX is making sure schools are compliant with the law. In 1979, there was a policy interpretation that offered three ways in which schools could be compliant with Title IX; it became known as the "three-part test". 
# Providing athletic participation opportunities that are substantially proportionate to the student enrollment. This prong of the test is satisfied when participation opportunities for men and women are "substantially proportionate" to their respective undergraduate enrollment.
# Demonstrating a continual expansion of athletic opportunities for the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution has a history and continuing practice of program expansion that is responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex (typically female).
# Accommodating the interest and ability of the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution is meeting the interests and abilities of its female students even where there are disproportionately fewer females than males participating in sports.
Although schools only have to be compliant with one of the three prongs, many schools have not managed to achieve equality. Many schools attempt to achieve compliance through the first prong; however, in order to achieve that compliance schools cut men's programs, which is not the way the OCR wanted compliance achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Irons |first=Alicia |title=The Economic Inefficiency of Title IX |journal=Major Themes in Economics |date=Spring 2006 |url=http://business.uni.edu/economics/Themes/irons.pdf |access-date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equity is not the only way to be compliant with Title IX; athletic departments need to show that they are making efforts to achieve parity in participation, treatment, and athletic financial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Title IX Information |url=http://www.nacwaa.org/advocacy/title-ix/information |access-date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through implementation, Title IX provides equal opportunities for female students and athletes. However, Title IX did not fully define how governance will take place in regard to sports. Most sport teams or institutions, regardless of gender, are managed by male coaches and managers. This lack of women is because many institutions prefer a dominant male presence in order to preserve the traditional masculinity hegemony present in institutions and professional leagues, in relation to sports.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} The societal norm of masculinity in connection to sports has hindered the growth of leaders in sports.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} According to 2016 data, 33% of WNBA teams are led by women coaches or managers.&lt;ref name="Senne_2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesportjournal.org/article/examination-of-gender-equity-and-female-participation-in-sport/ |title=Examination of Gender Equity and Female Participation in Sport |author=Senne |date=February 26, 2016 |work=TheSportJournal.org |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Olympic Committee also consists of 20% female members.&lt;ref name="Senne_2016"/&gt; The data presented also showed that 15% of athletic directors in colleges nationwide were females, and that number is much less in the southern states.&lt;ref name="Senne_2016"/&gt; Although Title IX was a breakthrough for women regarding funding and sport itself, the main goal is far from achieved. The disparity of men and women sport is prevalent and a significant one at that. The more alarming instance is the lack of female leadership in the sports world. The disparity will persist if the gap within leadership it not first fixed.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}}

===Effect on women's sports===
The main objective of Title IX is to make sure there is equal treatment in sports and school, regardless of sex, in a federally funded program. It was also used to provide protection to those who are being discriminated due to their gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=The United States Department of Judgement |url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/cor/coord/titleix.php |access-date=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Title IX is most commonly associated with its impact on athletics and more specifically the impact it has had on women's participation in athletics at every age. Today{{When|date=April 2017}} there are more females participating in athletics than ever before. As of the 2007–2008 school year, females made up 41% of the participants in college athletics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Title IX Athletic Statistics |url=http://www.aauw.org/act/laf/library/athleticStatistics.cfm |accessdate=February 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114061928/http://www.aauw.org/act/laf/library/athleticStatistics.cfm |archivedate=November 14, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To see the growth of women's sports, consider the difference in participation before the passing of Title IX and today. In 1971–1972 there were 294,015 females participating in high school athletics and in 2007–2008 there were over three million females participating, meaning there has been a 940% increase in female participation in high school athletics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In 1971–1972 there were 29,972 females participating in college athletics and in 2007–2008 there were 166,728 females participating, a 456% increase in female participation in college athletics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In 1971, less than 300,000 females played in high school sports. After the law was passed many females started to get involved in sports. By 1990, eighteen years later, 1.9 million female high school students were playing sports.&lt;ref name="Steiner 1995"/&gt; Increased participation in sports has had a direct impact on other areas of women's lives; these effects can be seen in women's education and employment later on in life; a 2010 study found that the changes set in motion by Title IX explained about 20 percent of the increase in women's education and about 40 percent of the rise in employment for 25-to-34-year-old women.&lt;ref name="parker1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Parker-Pope |first=Tara |title=As Girls Become Women, Sports Pay Dividends |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/health/16well.html |publisher=New York Times |access-date=February 16, 2012 |date=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say that all women who are successful later on in life played sports, but it is saying that women who did participate in athletics received benefits in their education and employment later on in life.&lt;ref name="parker1"/&gt;

In 1971, fewer than 295,000 girls participated in high school varsity athletics, accounting for just 7 percent of all varsity athletes; in 2001, that number leaped to 2.8 million, or 41.5 percent of all varsity athletes, according to the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 1966, 16,000 females competed in intercollegiate athletics. By 2001, that number jumped to more than 150,000, accounting for 43 percent of all college athletes. In addition, a 2008 study of intercollegiate athletics showed that women's collegiate sports had grown to 9,101 teams, or 8.65 per school. The five most frequently offered college sports for women are, in order: (1) basketball, 98.8% of schools have a team, (2) volleyball, 95.7%, (3) soccer, 92.0%, (4) cross country, 90.8%, and (5) softball, 89.2%. Since 1972, women have also competed in the traditional male sports of wrestling, weightlifting, rugby, and boxing. An article in the ''New York Times'' found that there are lasting benefits for women from Title IX: participation in sports increased education as well as employment opportunities for girls.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Furthermore, the athletic participation by girls and women spurred by Title IX was associated with lower obesity rates. No other public health program can claim similar success.&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"&gt;{{cite web |last=Winslow |first=Barbara |url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/seventies/essays/impact-title-ix |title=The Impact of Title IX &amp;#124; The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History |publisher=Gilderlehrman.org |date= |access-date=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"However, as part of the backlash against the women's movement, opposition quickly organized against Title IX. Worried about how it would affect men's athletics, legislators and collegiate sports officials became concerned and looked for ways to limit its influence. One argument was that revenue-producing sports such as college football should be exempted from Title IX compliance. Another was that in order for schools and colleges to comply, they would have to cut men's sports such as wrestling. Others argued that federal legislation was not the way to achieve equality or even parity. Finally, conservative opponents of women's rights believed that feminists used Title IX as an all-purpose vehicle to advance their agenda in the schools. Since 1975, there have been twenty court challenges to Title IX in an attempt to whittle down greater gender equity in all fields of education—mirroring the ups and downs of the women's movement at large. According to the National Federation of State High School Associations, female students received 1.3 million fewer opportunities to participate in high school athletics than their male peers in the 2006–2007 school years. Yet as a result of Title IX, women have benefited from involvement in amateur and professional sports and, in turn, sports are more exciting with their participation."&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"/&gt;

In October 2018 Iran announced that, after 40 years, it will allow women to enter sport arenas&lt;ref&gt;[https://dailytimes.com.pk/312207/football-stadium-politics/ Football stadium politics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The pay gap in women sports is a controversial and significant issue.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Women athletes, in their respective fields, get paid far less than their male counterparts, and this has been the standard for a long period of time. The difference between the American men's and women's soccer teams' salaries serves as an example regarding pay inequality. Taking into consideration the revenues generated by the sport itself and the accomplishments of the athletes, the disparity in pay is extremely overwhelming.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Women on the U.S national team earned $99,000 per year, while men earned $263,320 if they were to win 20 exhibition matches.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;WALTERS, J.

Women make up 54% of enrollment at 832 schools that responded to an NCAA gender equity study in 2000; however, females at these institutions only account for 41% of the athletes. Before Title IX, 90% of women's college athletic programs were run by women, but by 1992 the number dropped to 42% since Title IX requires that there are equal opportunities for both genders.&lt;ref name="Steiner 1995"/&gt;  This violates Title IX's premise that the ratio of female athletes to male athletes should be roughly equivalent to the overall proportion of female and male students.&lt;ref name="garber1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Garber |first=Greg |title=Landmark law faces new challenges even now |url=http://espn.go.com/gen/womenandsports/020619title9.html |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the issues today often revolve around the amount of money going into men's and women's sports. According to 2000–2001 figures, men's college programs still have many advantages over women's in the average number of scholarships (60.5%), operating expenses (64.5%), recruiting expenses (68.2%) and head coaching salaries (59.5%).&lt;ref name="garber1"/&gt; Other forms of inequality are in the coaching positions. Before Title IX, women coached 90% of women's teams; in 1978 that percentage dropped to 58, and in 2004 it dropped even more to 44 percent.&lt;ref name="coakley255"&gt;{{cite book |last=Coakley |first=Jay |title=Sports in Society |year=2007 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, women administered 90 percent of women's athletic programs, and in 2004 this fell to 19 percent. Also in 2004, 18 percent of all women's programs had no women administrators.&lt;ref name="coakley255"/&gt; In 2004, there were 3,356 administrative jobs in NCAA women's athletic programs and of those jobs, women held 35 percent of them.&lt;ref name="coakley255"/&gt;

The fight for equality extends to the wallet. On March 30, 2016, five players from the U.S. women's soccer team filed a federal complaint of wage discrimination against U.S. Soccer, the governing body that pays both the men’s and women’s team. The complaint argues that U.S. Soccer pays players on the women’s team as little as forty percent of what it pays players on the men’s team. This pay discrepancy exists despite the fact that the women’s team has been much more successful in international competitions; the women’s team has won four Olympic gold medals and three of the last five Women’s World Cups, while the men’s team has never won either of these competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/sports/soccer/uswnt-us-women-carli-lloyd-alex-morgan-hope-solo-complain.html?_r=0 |title=Top Female Players Accuse U.S. Soccer of Wage Discrimination |publisher=The New York Times |author=Andrew Das |date=2016-03-31 |accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved on 2015-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly so for [[women in Arab societies]]. The traditions of [[Islamic modesty]] in dress and requirements for women's sport to take place in a [[Sex segregation|single-sex environment]] make sports participation more difficult for devout female adherents. The lack of availability of suitably modest sports clothing and sports facilities that allow women to play in private contributes to the lack of participation. Cultural norms of women's roles and responsibilities towards the family may also be a source of discouragement from time-consuming sports practice.&lt;ref name=Women1&gt;[http://sites.duke.edu/wcwp/research-projects/middle-east/muslim-women-in-sport/#_ftn7 Muslim Women in Sport].

However, Islamic tenets and religious texts suggest that women's sports in general should be promoted and are not against the values of the religion. The Quranic statements that followers of Islam should be healthy, fit and make time for leisure are not sex-specific. The prophet [[Muhammad]] is said to have raced his wife [[Aisha]] on several occasions, with Aisha beating him the first couple of times. Correspondingly, some scholars have proposed that Muslim women's lack of engagement with sport is due to cultural or societal reasons, rather than strictly religious ones.&lt;ref name=Women1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Women2/&gt;

However, besides religious testaments, there are many barriers for Muslim women in relation to sports participation. A significant barrier to Muslim women's sports participation is bans on the Islamic headscarf, commonly known as the [[hijab]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ayub |first=Awista |date=2011-04-14 |title=A Closer Look at FIFA's Hijab Ban: What it Means for Muslim Players and Lessons Learned |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/425421 |journal=SAIS Review of International Affairs |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=43–50 |doi=10.1353/sais.2011.0010 |issn=1945-4724}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA instituted such a ban in 2011, preventing the Iranian women's national football team from competing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They have since repealed the ban, but other organizations, including FIBA, maintain such regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://muslimmatters.org/2016/07/19/muslim-basketball-players-urge-fiba-to-allow-hijab/ |title=» Muslim Basketball Players Urge FIBA To Allow Hijab |access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, many Muslim female athletes have achieved significant success in athletic competitions.

Media coverage for women's sports is significantly less than the coverage for men's sports. In 1989, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of men and women's sports on popular sports commentary shows.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Michael Messner and his team in 2010 analyzed three different two-week periods by recording the amount of time that the stories were on air and the content of the stories. After recording sports news and highlights, they wrote a quantitative description of what they saw and a qualitative description of the amount of time that story received.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, Michael A., and Cheryl Cooky (2010): [https://dornsifecms.usc.edu/assets/sites/80/docs/tvsports.pdf "Gender in Televised Sports"]. n. pag. Dornsife.usc.edu. Center for Feminist Research, University of Southern California, June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During that first year that the research was conducted in 1989, it was recorded that 5% of the sports segments were based on women's sports, compared to the 92% that were based on men's sports and the 3% that was a combination of both. In 1999, women's sports coverage reached an all-time high when it was recorded at 8.7%. It maintained its higher percentages until it reached an all-time low in 2009, decreasing to 1.6%. The researchers also measured the amount of time that women's sports were reported in the [[news ticker]], the strip that displays information at the bottom of most news broadcasts. When recorded in 2009, 5% of ticker coverage was based on women's sports, compared to the 95% that was based on men's sports. These percentages were recorded in order to compare the amount of media coverage for each gender.

When researching the actual amount of time that women's sports stories were mentioned, they focused specifically on differences between the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and the [[Women's National Basketball Association]]. They recorded two different time periods: when they were in season and when they were off-season. The WNBA had 8 stories, totaling 5:31 minutes, during their season, which was less than the NBA, which had a total of 72 stories, totaling approximately 65:51 minutes. During the off-season, the WNBA did not receive any stories or time on the ticker, while the NBA received a total of 81, which were approximately 50:15 minutes. When compared, the WNBA had a total of 8 stories and 5:31 minutes while the NBA had 153 stories and 1:56:06 hours. The actual games had several differences in the way the games were presented. The findings were that WNBA games had lower sound quality, more editing mistakes, fewer views of the shot clock and fewer camera angles. There was less verbal commentary and visual statistics about the players throughout the games as well.&lt;ref&gt;"Gender Stereotyping in Televised Sports." LA 48 Foundation. June 2010. Web. November 2014. http://www.la84.org/gender-stereotyping-in-televised-sports/&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the stories has also significantly changed. In past studies, women were sexualized, portrayed as violent, or portrayed as girlfriends, wives and mothers. Female athletes were often included in gag stories that involved sexual dialogue or emphasized their bodies. In Australia, the wives of the men's cricket team members were given more media coverage than the players on the women's cricket team, who also had won more games than the men's rugby team.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Tracy.

In newspapers articles, coverage on men's sports once again had a greater number of articles than women's sports in a ratio of 23–1. In 1990, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of men and women's sports on popular newspapers. They analyzed four different sports magazines for three months and recorded the number of women's sports stories that were featured and the content of the stories. Women's sports made up 3.5%, compared to the 81% of men's coverage. The lengths of these articles were 25–27% shorter than the length of men's articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.la84.org/coverage-of-womens-sports-in-four-daily-newspapers/ |title=Coverage of Women’s Sports in Four Daily Newspapers – LA84 Foundation |author= |date= |work=LA84.org |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an international frenzy in 2012 when the first woman that represented Saudi Arabia in the 2012 Olympics competed in track. That was the most women's sports coverage that there had been in several years.Women played 90 minutes of football, 80 minutes of rugby, 18 holes of golf and ran the same distance in a marathon as men https://www.irishtimes.com.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Exactly 12 months later, the newspapers returned to featuring 4% of articles on women's sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/07/sport/olympics-women-equality-attar/index.html |title=Why has coverage of women's sport stopped post Olympics? - CNN.com |first=Amanda |last=Davies |date=August 7, 2013 |work=CNN.com |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same trend can be seen with regards to the FIFA World Cup. The 2015 Women’s World Cup Final had an average of 25.4 million American viewers throughout the duration of the match, and peaked at 30.9 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Deitsch, Richard. "USA-Japan's Women's World Cup Final Shatters American TV 
Record Ratings." Futbol Planet. Sports Illustrated, 6 July 2015. Web. 8 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most-viewed game of soccer ever in the United States–men’s or women’s–by a margin of almost 7 million viewers. Despite this jump in viewership of women’s soccer in the U.S., television broadcasting of the women’s professional soccer league in the U.S. remained much lower than that of the men’s league. Fox Sports Network (the company that owns the rights to broadcast the National Women’s Soccer League) broadcast 3 regular season NWSL games and 34 Major League Soccer regular-season games during the 2016 seasons.

Amy Godoy-Pressland conducted a study that investigated the relationship between sports reporting and gender in Great Britain. She studied Great Britain's newspapers from January 2008 to December 2009 and documented how media coverage of men's sports and women's sports was fairly equal during the Olympics and then altered after the Olympics were over. "Sportswomen are disproportionately under-represented and the sheer quantity and quality of news items on sportsmen demonstrates how male athletes are represented as dominant and superior to females." She also documented how women's bodies were sexualized in photographs and written coverage, noting that the women featured were either nude, semi-nude, or wearing revealing clothing. "The sexualization of sportswomen in Sunday reporting is commonplace and aimed at the mostly male readership. It promotes the idea of female aesthetics over achievements, while the coverage of women not directly involved in sport misrepresents the place of women in sport and inferiorizes real sportswomen's achievements."&lt;ref&gt;"Women underrepresented, sexualized in weekend sports reporting" ''Science Daily''. September 2013. Web. December 2014. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130918090756.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The media has the ability to create or prevent interest in women's sports. Excluding women's sports from the media makes it much less likely for young girls to have role models that are women athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Donna A. Lopiano, Ph.D., (2008). Media Coverage of Women's Sports is Important, (2), Sports Management Resources, http://www.sportsmanagementresources.com/library/media-coverage-womens-sports&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tucker Center for Research on Girls &amp; Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota 40% of all athletes in the United States are women but women's sports only receive about 4% of sports media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;University of Minnesota (Producer) and PBS, (2014). Media Coverage &amp; Female Athletes, http://video.tpt.org/video/2365132906/&lt;/ref&gt; This amount of coverage has decreased in the last 20 years although there has been a major increase in women athletes.

Media coverage has slightly increased and this is mostly due to social networking.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Social media has further exposed women sports out to the public world, and often at a much greater rate than traditional news media. Traditional media has also improved its coverage of women's sports through more exposure time and using better equipment to record the events. Recent research has shown that in the past twenty years, camera angles, slow motion replays, quality and graphics regarding the presentation of women sports has gradually improved.&lt;ref name="Cooky, C. 2012"&gt;Cooky, C., &amp; Lavoi, N. (2012). Playing but losing women's sports after title ix. ''Contexts,'' ''11''(1), 42–46. {{jstor|41960748}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mainstream media still is far behind in its showcasing of female sports in comparison to that of men's. A study has shown that ESPN, which began airing women NCAA tournament in 2003, aired eleven women tournament segments in comparison to one-hundred men's tournament segments.&lt;ref name="Cooky, C. 2012"/&gt; ESPN and other sports outlets are airing more female-oriented sporting events; however the length of the segments are very small. This representative data is showcases a main part of the minimal interaction the media has with women athletes. Media coverage of women sports in the United States has further justified the divisional hierarchy faced by women athletes in terms of popularity and coverage. Scholarly studies (Kane, M. J., LaVoi, N. M., Fink, J. S. (2013) also show that when women athletes were given the option to pick a photo of a picture that would increase respect for their sport, they picked an on-the-court competency picture. However, when women athletes were told to pick a picture that would increase interest in their sport, 47% picked a picture that sexualized the women athlete.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, M. J., LaVoi, N. M., Fink, J. S. (2013). Exploring elite female athletes' interpretations of sport media images: A window into the construction of social identity and "selling sex" in women's sports. Communication &amp; Sport, 1(3), 269–298. doi: 10.1177/2167479512473585&lt;/ref&gt; The UK is more representative than the United States with the BBC giving women's sports about 20% of their sports coverage (BBC spokesperson). Many women athletes in the UK do not see this as adequate coverage for the 36% of women who participate in sports.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Lewis, (2014).

[[Gender in youth sports|Girls' and boys' participation]] rates in sports vary by country and region.  In the United States, nearly all schools require student participation in sports, guaranteeing that all girls were exposed to athletics at an early age, which was generally not the case in Western Europe and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Marshall |first=J. |last2=Hardman |first2=K. |date=2016-07-24 |title=The State and Status of Physical Education in Schools in International Context |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1356336X000063001 |journal=[[European Physical Education Review]] |language=en |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=203–229 |doi=10.1177/1356336x000063001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[intramural sports]], the genders were often mixed, though for competitive sports the genders remained segregated.  [[Title IX]] legislation required colleges and universities to provide equal athletic opportunities for women. This large pool of female athletes enabled the U.S. to consistently rank among the top nations in women's Olympic sports, and female Olympians from skater [[Peggy Fleming]] (1968) to [[Mary Lou Retton]] (1986) became household names.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Tennis was the most-popular professional female sport from the 1970s onward,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} and it provided the occasion for a symbolic "battle of the sexes" between [[Billie Jean King]] and [[Bobby Riggs]], enhancing the profile of female athletics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  The success of [[Women's Tennis Association|women's tennis]], however, did little to help the fortunes of women's professional team sports.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[Women's professional sports|Women's professional team sports]] achieved popularity for the first time in the 1990s, particularly in [[basketball]] and [[football (soccer)]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  This popularity has been asymmetric, being strongest in the U.S., certain European countries and former Communist states.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Thus, [[Women's association football|women's soccer]] was originally dominated by the U.S., China, and Norway, who have historically fielded weak men's national teams. However, {{when|date=February 2011}} several nations with strong and even dominant men's national teams, such as Germany, Sweden, and Brazil, have established themselves as women's powers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Despite this increase in popularity, women's professional sports leagues continue to struggle financially. The [[WNBA]] is operated at a loss by the [[NBA]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} perhaps in the hope of creating a market that will eventually be profitable. A similar approach is used to promote [[women's boxing]], as women fighters are often [[undercard]]s on prominent male boxing events, in the hopes of attracting an audience.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The [[National Women's Hockey League]] is an American women's professional ice hockey league, and the [[United Women's Lacrosse League]] is an American professional [[women's lacrosse]] league; both were established in 2015.

Today, women compete professionally and as amateurs in virtually every major sport, though the level of participation typically decreases when it comes to the more violent contact sports;  few schools have women's programs in American football, boxing or wrestling.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}There are exceptions to this, such as the [[Utah Girls Football League]] and [[Professional Girl Wrestling Association]]. However, these typical non-participation habits may slowly be evolving as more women take real interest in the games, for example [[Katie Hnida]] became the first woman ever to score points in a [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[NCAA]] [[American football]] game when she kicked two [[extra-point]]s for the [[University of New Mexico]] in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Modern sports have seen the development of a higher profile for female athletes in other historically male sports, such as [[golf]], [[marathon]]s or [[ice hockey]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}These significant participation rise, has allowed more women to participate in traditionally male dominated sports and increased the sports popularity globally.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

As of 2013, the only sports that men, but not women play professionally in the United States are [[American football|football]], [[baseball]], and [[Ultimate Frisbee]]. Although basketball, soccer and hockey have female sports leagues, they are far behind in terms of exposure and funding compared to the men's teams.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Recently{{When|date=April 2017}} there has been much more crossover as to which sports males and females participate in, although there are still some differences. For example, at the [[1992 Winter Olympics]], both genders were allowed to participate in the sport of [[figure skating]], previously a female-only sporting event. However, the programs for the event required men to perform three triple jumps, and women only one.
