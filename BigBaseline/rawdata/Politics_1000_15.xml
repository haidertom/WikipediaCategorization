The '''2009 Malagasy political crisis''' began on 26 January 2009 with the political opposition movement led by [[Antananarivo]] mayor [[Andry Rajoelina]], which sought to oust [[President of Madagascar|President]] [[Marc Ravalomanana]] from the presidency. The crisis reached its climax on 21 March 2009 when Andry Rajoelina was declared the president of the [[High Transitional Authority]] of Madagascar, five days after Ravalomanana transferred his power to a military council and fled to South Africa.

The international community immediately condemned the leader and his ascension as unconstitutional.  Financial support and foreign investments stopped, and the country fell into one of the worst economic crises in its history. The [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] and the [[African Union]] have been designated to supervise Madagascar's political reinstatement.

Though the objective of the transitional government was to run presidential elections as soon as possible to relieve the tensions (despite regular delays), its major challenge has been to establish an agreement among Madagascar's four key political factions (Rajoelina, Ravalomanana, [[Albert Zafy|Zafy]] and [[Didier Ratsiraka|Ratsiraka]]), some of which were and still are unfriendly to the transitional government. On 11 December 2010 a new constitution was formally approved, launching the Fourth Republic. On 28 October 2011 a consensus Prime Minister, [[Omer Beriziky]], was appointed. [[Malagasy general election, 2013|Presidential and parliamentary elections]] were scheduled for 8 May and 3 July 2013.

== Origins of the conflict ==
[[File:LocationMadagascar.svg|250px|thumb|Map of Madagascar in Africa]]
In December 2007, Andry Rajoelina was elected mayor of [[Antananarivo]]. Tensions quickly grew between president Ravalomanana and the young mayor over the course of 2008 as Rajoelina became a vocal critic of a series of unpopular policies enacted by the president.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; He condemned what he called the "restriction of freedom" on the island, and criticized the president's plans to lease large parts of land to the [[South Korea|Korean]] industrial company [[Daewoo]].&lt;ref name="first" /&gt;&lt;ref name="second" /&gt;

On 13 December 2008, the Ravalomanana administration decided to shutter Viva TV, a television channel belonging to Rajoelina&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; after broadcasting an interview with the former exiled president Didier Ratsiraka. Other television and radio stations that also aired the interview were not sanctioned.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt;

Andry Rajoelina organized a series of rallies in January 2009 that took aim at the Ravalomanana administration and gave voice to growing popular resentment toward the president's increasingly authoritarian policies and a widespread perception that national development had only benefitted an elite minority of which the president was the most visible figurehead.&lt;ref name="france24" /&gt; As anti-government frustration transformed into civil unrest, two state television stations were burned by anti-government protesters.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; At least 130 people were killed in Madagascar during the crisis.&lt;ref name="135killed" /&gt; The protests were seen as the gravest challenge faced by the Ravalomanana government since he came to office in 2002.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; President Ravalomanana vowed to restore order "whatever the cost", according to a government statement.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-2" /&gt;

== Protests ==
{{Politics of Madagascar}}
[[File:Madagascar-carte.png|thumb|left|160px|The protests took place in [[Antananarivo]], the capital and largest city in [[Madagascar]].]]
Rajoelina called a general strike during the weekend of 24–25 January 2009, in the capital city, [[Antananarivo]], against Ravalomanana, whom he has called a dictator.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2" /&gt; Ravalomanana, who was in South Africa, cut short his trip to a regional summit in [[Pretoria]], and flew back to Madagascar.&lt;ref name="afp2" /&gt; In a statement Ravalomanana accused the mayor of attempting a coup saying, "The call for [[revolt]] and [[civil disobedience]]... corresponds to a coup d'état...tramples on the values of the constitution and the republic's institutions."&lt;ref name="afp2" /&gt;

On 26 January 2009, the protests turned increasingly violent.&lt;ref name="france24" /&gt; Demonstrators set fire to the Madagascar state-owned radio building, attacked a private television station owned by Ravalomanana and looted shops and businesses throughout the city.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; That same day, armed government [[security agent]]s reportedly disabled the transmitter of Viva Radio, a private radio station owned by Rajoelina.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt;

Protesters ransacked two pro-government television stations in Antananarivo. Thousands of protesters raided and looted the headquarters of the [[Radio Nationale Malgache]] and [[Télévision Nationale Malgache]] building around 1&amp;nbsp;pm local time on 26 January 2009.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; About an hour later demonstrators burned down the [[Malagasy Broadcasting System]], a private station owned by President Ravalomanana.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; A policeman and a fourteen-year-old protester were reportedly killed in the clashes at the Malagasy Broadcasting System attacks.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt;

Firefighters found the bodies of at least 25 people in the ruins of a burned out, looted [[department store]] in downtown Antananarivo.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="france24two" /&gt; The bodies were thought to be those of looters who became trapped in the burning shop when the roof caved in.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-4" /&gt; In total, 44 people died. Their bodies were taken to a morgue, and all but ten of them were found to be severely burned.

In a show of defiance against the government, Rajoelina called for all Antananarivo residents to stay home on 29 January 2009.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; This "ghost town" (''ville morte'') protest basically closed all stores and businesses in the capital city.&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt;

The [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Roman Catholic Cardinal]] [[emeritus]] of Antananarivo [[Armand Razafindratandra]] appealed for calm as the protests spread outside of the capital.&lt;ref name="cna" /&gt; All state and private radio stations in the country reportedly ceased broadcasting, with the exception of [[Radio Don Bosco]], which is run by the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] [[religious institute]].&lt;ref name=cna/&gt;

Rajoelina said on 31 January that he was taking control of the country due to the failure of Ravalomanana and the government to fulfil their responsibilities.&lt;ref name="bbcnews2" /&gt; He said that a request for Ravalomanana's "immediate resignation" would be submitted to [[Parliament of Madagascar|Parliament]] "in order to comply with the legal procedure". Furthermore, he asked that the [[central bank]] withhold money from the government, that all government ministries close, and that the security forces join him. Rajoelina said that he wanted the constitution to be respected and that it was Ravalomanana who had violated the constitution. According to Rajoelina, a new [[transitional government]] would soon be appointed under his leadership and a new presidential election would be held within two years. Speaking on the same day, Ravalomanana stated that he was "still the president of this country" and that he would "do what is necessary to develop this nation".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-5" /&gt;

The [[African Union]] (AU) immediately warned Rajoelina that it would not accept an unconstitutional power grab in Madagascar: "It's totally forbidden to take power by non-constitutional means."&lt;ref name="reuters2" /&gt;

Opposition leaders allied to Rajoelina filed a petition with the High Constitutional Court on 2 February, asking it to remove Ravalomanana from office. By that point, attendance at Rajoelina's rallies had reportedly decreased.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-6" /&gt; On 3 February, Rajoelina said at a rally that he would announce his new government on 7 February.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-7" /&gt; On the same day, the High Constitutional Court ruled that it had no power to remove the President from office, as that power belonged to Parliament.&lt;ref name="Fired" /&gt; Also on 3 February, Rajoelina was dismissed as Mayor and a special delegation, headed by [[Guy Randrianarisoa]], was appointed instead. Rajoelina denounced the decision, saying that there was "no valid reason" for it and that he was prepared to face arrest if necessary; he warned that the city would "not accept this decision".&lt;ref name="Fired" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-8" /&gt;

Rajoelina held another rally on 4 February, with about 1,500 people in attendance. On that occasion he described the appointment of Randrianarisoa as "an insult to the people of Madagascar"; he instead designated [[Michele Ratsivalaka]] to succeed him as Mayor and gave her his mayoral scarf.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-9" /&gt;

=== Shooting at opposition rally ===
On 7 February, an opposition rally was held with twenty-thousand in attendance.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-10" /&gt; The demonstrators marched towards [[Ambohitsorohitra Palace]] and crossed the "ligne rouge" (red line), the perimeter line around the palace gates that demarcates the zone off-limits to the public. The palace guards responded by firing live ammunition to disperse the crowd. Initial reports counted 83 wounded and 28 people killed, including a local reporter. Some looting was reported afterward.&lt;ref name="Three" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-11" /&gt; Ambulances took the wounded to hospitals or private clinics, and bodies were seen piled up on the streets before they were taken to the morgue. The National Police warned that the death toll could rise, as many of the wounded were in critical condition. The following day it was reported that the death toll had increased to at least 50, with doctors estimating that 180 people had arrived at the city's main [[Ravoahangy Andrianavalona Hospital]].&lt;ref name="Madagascar protesters shot dead" /&gt; Antananarivo journalist [[Fanja Saholiarisoa]] said: "The mortuary is full and the hospital is full. On TV there is a special announcement calling on people who have cars to come and pick up the injured people from the hospitals".&lt;ref name="Madagascar protesters shot dead" /&gt; This brought the number of people killed since the start of the [[political violence]] to 130, with 80 people killed before the shooting of the demonstrators, including the people who died in the burned department store.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-12" /&gt;

Also on 7 February, Rajoelina said that [[Roindefo Monja]] would be prime minister under his transitional authority. According to Rajoelina, each of Madagascar's regions would have representation in the transitional authority. Regarding Ambohitsorohitra Palace, Rajoelina alluded to its history as a mayoral residence prior to 2002 and said that it "belongs to the people and to the city", while declaring that he had decided to give the palace to Monja for his use as prime minister. On the same day, Ravalomanana urged "calm and order", accusing Rajoelina of "cross[ing] all limits", while Prime Minister [[Charles Rabemananjara]] announced a one-week extension of the curfew.&lt;ref name=Three/&gt;

While visiting hospitalized victims of the shooting on 8 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue his struggle and argued that Ravalomanana's answer to the popular call for change was gunfire. He called for a national day of mourning on 9 February.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-13" /&gt;

On 9 February, Defence Minister [[Cécile Manorohanta]] announced her resignation, saying, "After all that has happened, I decide as of now to no longer remain part of this government."&lt;ref name="AutoRI-14" /&gt; Chief of military staff [[Mamy Ranaivoniarivo]] was appointed to replace Manorohanta on the same day.&lt;ref name="Defence" /&gt;

7 February shooting was thought to have reversed the opposition's declining momentum. Newspapers published on 9 February, strongly denounced the shooting.&lt;ref name=Defence/&gt; On 10 February, speaking before a rally of about 5,000 supporters, Rajoelina urged the people to observe a general strike on the next day; he asked that everyone stay indoors and that no one go to work or attend school. Roindefo announced the appointment of four ministers to serve in his transitional government, and he said that the remainder of them would be appointed by the end of the week. Meanwhile, both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina accepted dialogue in principle; Rajoelina said that dialogue would be conditional on the holding of a new presidential election or the formation of a transitional government.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-15" /&gt;

At a 35,000-strong rally in Antananarivo on 14 February, Ravalomanana said that he would serve out his full term as president, that he was listening to the people, and that he regretted the deaths that had occurred during the protests. On the same day, Rajoelina held a rally nearby, with about 10,000 in attendance.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-16" /&gt;

At a rally on 17 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue the struggle, and later in the day several thousand of his supporters engaged in [[sit-in]]s near key ministries. Representing the government, Defense Minister Ranaivoniarivo invited Roindefo to participate in talks.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-17" /&gt; Rajoelina's supporters took over several important ministries on 19 February, changing the locks and installing Rajoelina's own ministers to work in them. Meanwhile, Ravalomanana appointed a new Minister of the Interior, [[Rabenja Sehenoarisoa]] (who had previously served as chief of police in the capital). His predecessor as Interior Minister, [[Gervais Rakotonirina]], was said to have departed the government due to poor health.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-18" /&gt; Only hours after the opposition took over the government ministries, they were removed from the ministries by security forces early on 20 February; about 50 of Rajoelina's supporters were arrested.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-19" /&gt;

Ravalomanana and Rajoelina met on 21 February; this meeting, which lasted about 45 minutes, was organized by the [[Council of Christian Churches in Madagascar]]. Both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina agreed to five points intended to calm the situation. This was intended as a prelude to more comprehensive dialogue.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-20" /&gt; On 23 February the two met again for about an hour,&lt;ref name="AutoRI-21" /&gt; and they held a third meeting, also lasting an hour, on 24 February.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-22" /&gt; However, Ravalomanana failed to appear for a planned meeting on 25 February, and Rajoelina then announced that he was withdrawing from the talks. Rajoelina criticized Ravalomanana for his absence and furthermore stated that the meetings he had held with Ravalomanana prior to that were disappointing. [[Odon Razanakolona]], who had been mediating the talks, abandoned his role shortly before Rajoelina withdrew from the talks; according to Razanakolona, the talks were fruitless and deadlocked.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-23" /&gt;

=== Post-talks ===
A protest in Antananarivo was broken up by the security forces on 26 February. Another protest in [[Fianarantsoa]] on 27 February, was also broken up; two deaths and 13 serious injuries were reported in the latter incident.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-24" /&gt; At a 10,000-strong rally in Antananarivo on 28 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue his struggle "until we end this dictatorship". He said that, beginning on 2 March, protests would be held in the 13 May Plaza on a daily basis; he also called for the army to support him.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-25" /&gt;

A protest in [[Ambositra]] was broken up by police on 4 March, and two people were killed. Also on 4 March, President Ravalomanana declared his intention to "restore order" on [[Radio Mada]]. In Antananarivo, police blocked roads on 5 March to prevent protests in the 13 May Plaza.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-26" /&gt;

The security forces unsuccessfully attempted to arrest Rajoelina at his compound late on 5 March; they also raided his Viva media network. Initially they surrounded Viva, and after 30 minutes the staff attempted to evacuate equipment, at which point the security forces stormed the building and confiscated equipment. Rajoelina told [[Agence France-Presse]] on 7 March that he was "now hiding in a safe location where I cannot be attacked";&lt;ref name="AutoRI-27" /&gt; it was later acknowledged that he had gone to the residence of the French ambassador on 6 March.&lt;ref name="Res" /&gt;

=== Mutiny and military leadership change ===
{{main article|2009 Camp Capsat mutiny}}
Soldiers at a military base in Soanierana district, near Antananarivo, mutinied on 8 March; they objected to the use of force against the opposition.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-28" /&gt; United Nations envoy [[Tiebilé Dramé]] said on 9 March that the UN was placing Rajoelina "under its protection in a diplomatic residence".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-29" /&gt; The French Foreign Ministry said on 10 March that Rajoelina had left the French ambassador's residence.&lt;ref name="Res" /&gt;

On 10 March, the chief of staff of the Malagasy army, General [[Edmond Rasolomahandry]], gave political leaders 72 hours to solve the country's problems and return peace, threatening to take over if this did not occur.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-30" /&gt; The same day, Defence Minister Ranaivoniarivo announced his resignation shortly after a number of army officers visited his office to threaten a switch of allegiances to Rajoelina.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-31" /&gt; On 11 March, pro-opposition soldiers from the CAPSAT (Army Corps of Personnel and Administrative and Technical Services) stormed the army headquarters and forced Edmond Rasolomahandry to resign. Analysts stated that civil war seemed a distinct possibility.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-32" /&gt; Andre Andriarijaona replaced Rasolomahandry, apparently as a result of internal army deliberations and not a presidential appointment, and Andriarijaona said that the military would remain neutral and not seize power, thus revoking the 72-hour ultimatum.&lt;ref name="Lifts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-33" /&gt; A spokesman for Rajoelina said on 11 March that Rajoelina would not participate in talks planned to begin the next day;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-34" /&gt; subsequently the Christian Council of Churches announced that the talks would be delayed.&lt;ref name=Lifts/&gt;

On 12 March, the opposition took over the Ministry of Finance and Budget with the support of the armed forces&lt;ref name="AutoRI-35" /&gt; while the president's prime minister held a ten-minute meeting with the opposition-designated prime minister, who later stated that Rabemananjara had agreed to give up his job to him.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-36" /&gt; The next day, the chief of the military police stated he was taking orders from Andre Andriarijaona and not from the general appointed by Ravalomanana;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-37" /&gt; this was followed by the sending of army tanks against the [[Iavoloha Palace]] of the president, while some 3,000–5,000 civilian supporters of Ravalomanana surrounded the palace to counter opposition protests further away from the area. The Ravalomanana supporters, however, were told to clear the road in case the army neared the area.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-38" /&gt;

On 14 March, Monja occupied the prime minister's office while the opposition forces controlled the building.&lt;ref name="yn-2009-03-15" /&gt; Monja announced that the opposition forces, called the High Authority of Transition, "is presiding over the destiny of Madagascar".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-39" /&gt; Rajoelina gave the president four hours, until 6&amp;nbsp;pm (1500 GMT), to voluntarily resign, after which a mass civilian march would take place on the presidential palace to put Ravalomanana out of office;&lt;ref name=yn-2009-03-15/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-40" /&gt; he explicitly ruled out a violent overthrow through military means. However, Ravalomanana later emerged from the guarded palace after the deadline had passed, asserting that he was still the legal president and calling for a national conference.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-41" /&gt;

On 15 March, Ravalomanana offered to hold a referendum on whether he should stay in power or not, which was seen as a sign of the intense pressure placed on his presidency.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-42" /&gt; The following day, Rajoelina rejected this proposal and called on the security forces to arrest Ravalomanana.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-43" /&gt;

== Capture of palace and Ravalomanana's resignation ==
{{wikinews|Coup in Madagascar; opposition leader backs army}}
On 16 March 2009, one of the palaces of President Ravalomanana, the [[Ambohitsorohitra Palace]], was stormed and taken by soldiers of the Malagasy Army. Reports also indicate the capture of the country's [[central bank]]. The president was not in the stormed palace at the time. The [[African Union]] condemned the action, calling it an "attempted coup d'état". The actions followed an earlier call from opposition leader Andry Rajoelina for the President's arrest;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-44" /&gt; Rajoelina insisted that the palace seizure was not a coup,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; although he immediately installed himself in the presidential offices of the captured palace.

Hours later, the BBC stated that Ravalomanana was to resign and hand over the powers of both the president and prime minister to a military board headed by Vice Admiral [[Hyppolite Ramaroson]].&lt;ref name="AutoRI-45" /&gt; Ravalomanana later said, "I never resigned. I was forced to hand power over, at gun point, on March the 17th."&lt;ref name="so-2009-16-04-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-46" /&gt; At the time, Ravalomanana had already moved out of the Iavoloha Palace to an undisclosed location; as of 24 March, he was reportedly in [[Swaziland]].&lt;ref name="AutoRI-47" /&gt; The military junta, consisting of senior military personnel, would have been charged with organizing elections within 24 months and re-writing the constitution for the "Fourth Republic".&lt;ref name="lough1" /&gt; However, Vice Admiral Ramaroson announced on 18 March that it would transfer power directly to Rajoelina, making him president of the opposition-dominated [[High Transitional Authority (Madagascar)|High Transitional Authority]] that he had appointed weeks earlier.&lt;ref name="bbc-2009-03-18" /&gt; With the military's backing, the authority was charged with taking up the task previously accorded to Ravalomanana's proposed military directorate.&lt;ref name=bbc-2009-03-18/&gt; Madagascar's constitutional court deemed the transfer of power, from Ravalomanana to the military board and then to Rajoelina, to be legal.&lt;ref name="aj-2009-03-19" /&gt; The court's statement did not include any justifications for its decision.&lt;ref name="cbc-2009-03-21" /&gt;

Rajoelina said that Ravalomanana should be prosecuted for allegedly using lethal force against unarmed opposition demonstrators earlier in the year.&lt;ref name=aj-2009-03-19/&gt; Rajoelina is prohibiting Ravalomanana's ministers from leaving the country.&lt;ref name=aj-2009-03-19/&gt;

On 19 March, Rajoelina suspended both chambers of [[Parliament of Madagascar|Parliament]].&lt;ref name=aj-2009-03-19/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-48" /&gt; Roindefo responded to international criticism on 20 March, saying that the government will "explain the real situation. Maybe the way Madagascar acts is not very clear. Things can be a bit specific which may be difficult to follow in every detail."&lt;ref name="AutoRI-49" /&gt; According to Roindefo, the transfer of power was not a coup d'état but instead "the direct expression of democracy, when representative democracy does not express itself through the institutions".&lt;ref name="gn-2009-03-21" /&gt; Rajoelina was sworn in as President on 21 March before a crowd of 40,000 supporters.&lt;ref name=gn-2009-03-21/&gt; No foreign diplomats were in attendance;&lt;ref name=cbc-2009-03-21/&gt; Rajoelina's foreign minister said none were invited.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-50" /&gt;

On the same day, Malagasy navy troops called for Rajoelina's resignation by 25 March, threatening to use force otherwise to protect the constitution of Madagascar.&lt;ref name="pdo-2009-30-25" /&gt; According to their statement, the navy troops "condemn all violence against civilians" committed by the army corps in March and denounce Rajoelina for the "civil war occurring in Madagascar".&lt;ref name=pdo-2009-30-25/&gt; The navy troops claimed that there was "irrefutable" evidence that Rajoelina had paid the army corps hundreds of millions of [[Malagasy ariary|ariaries]] and that they should face trials in accordance with military law.&lt;ref name=pdo-2009-30-25/&gt; The navy troops called for other nations not to get involved in what they considered a purely domestic affair.&lt;ref name=pdo-2009-30-25/&gt;

In a recorded message from Ravalomanana played to around 10,000 of supporters on 25 March, Ravalomanana encouraged people to "save the nation, defend the union and our national unity" because Rajoelina's government was "destroying our country with their coup."&lt;ref name="bbc-25-03-2009" /&gt;

Also on 25 March, Rajoelina invited Ravalomanana's political party to join other political parties, unions, and business leaders to discuss reconciliation on 2 and 3 April.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-51" /&gt; Rajoelina said the meeting would also include planning for the next elections.&lt;ref name="r-26-03-2009" /&gt; Rajoelina said he would appoint the members of the group who would organize the meeting.&lt;ref name="ap-26-03-2009" /&gt; Ravalomanana's political party, [[Tiako I Madagasikara]] (TIM), did not immediately comment on whether it would participate in those meetings.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-52" /&gt;

On 26 March, Rajoelina's justice minister said that Rajoelina had given a presidential [[pardon]] to 28 "[[political prisoner]]s" and that more would be pardoned in the future.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt; Members of TIM spoke to the crowd.&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; The names of the pardoned individuals were not made public.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt;

About 6,000 people who supported Ravalomanana assembled in a park in downtown Antananarivo on 26 March,&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; the fourth consecutive of such protests.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt; Members of TIM spoke to the crowd.&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; Referring to the reconciliation meeting proposed by Rajoelina, the speakers said that Ravalomanana would be involved only if he were recognized at the meeting as Madagascar's elected president and only if the United Nations, Southern African Development Community, or another neutral, international body organized the meeting.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; The speakers urged Ravalomanana to leave Swaziland, return to Madagascar, and call the bicameral parliament back in session.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-53" /&gt; One speaker said that elections should only be held after Ravalomanana was reinstated as president.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-54" /&gt; Following the speeches, security forces fired tear gas and shot bullets into the air to disperse the crowd.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt;

The following day, about 6,000 people who supported Ravalomanana assembled again, the fifth such demonstration in five consecutive days.&lt;ref name="r-27-03-2009" /&gt; Police used tear gas on the assembled individuals at the end of the event, as they did at the end of the previous day's demonstration.&lt;ref name=r-27-03-2009/&gt;

On 28 March, between 15,000&lt;ref name="bbc-28-03-2009" /&gt; and 20,000&lt;ref name="AutoRI-55" /&gt; protesters assembled for the sixth consecutive day.&lt;ref name="aj-28-03-2009" /&gt; In a recorded message played to the assembled crowd, Ravalomanana encouraged his supporters to continue protesting and gave assurance that he would return to Madagascar soon.&lt;ref name=aj-28-03-2009/&gt; While marching towards the 13 May Plaza, the same location that Rajoelina's supporters had assembled earlier in the year, police fired their weapons into the air&lt;ref name="AutoRI-56" /&gt; and used tear gas&lt;ref name=bbc-28-03-2009/&gt; to disperse the crowds, resulting in a stampede that injured 34 people.&lt;ref name="ap-28-03-2009" /&gt; A young protester named "Razily", who was seen in a video of 28 March protests carrying the Malagasy flag at the head of the protests before being publicly beaten and carted off by police, became a [[cause célèbre]] when the video was distributed online; he has not been seen since his arrest. Police said they were trying to keep Ravalomanana's supporters from confronting Rajoelina's supporters.&lt;ref name=ap-28-03-2009/&gt; In response to the police actions, Ravalomanana's supporters encouraged a general strike on 30 March, saying, "Students should not go to school, office workers should stop their work and the private sector should stop paying taxes so as not to support an illegal regime."&lt;ref name=ap-28-03-2009/&gt; Protests continued nearly every day thereafter.&lt;ref name="bbc-20-04-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21" /&gt;

On 31 March, Rajoelina announced the individuals who would constitute the cabinet of his transitional administration for 24 months until elections are held.&lt;ref name="bbc 2009-03-31" /&gt; Rajoelina compared himself to Ravalomanana, saying that Ravalomanana was not immediately accepted by world leaders when he came to power in 2002.&lt;ref name="bbc 2009-03-31" /&gt; Rajoelina reiterated his previous statements that other countries should not "interfere" with his rise to the presidency of Madagascar.&lt;ref name="bbc 2009-03-31" /&gt; Rajoelina also announced a freeze of all mining contracts with foreign companies, saying that the foreign companies are not paying the fees and royalties that are legally due to Madagascar.&lt;ref name="afp-30-03-2009" /&gt;

Still asserting that he was the legitimate president, Ravalomanana announced from exile that he was appointing [[Manandafy Rakotonirina]] as Prime Minister on 16 April. Ravalomanana made this announcement by telephone at a rally of his supporters in Antananarivo, with Rakotonirina in attendance.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-57" /&gt;

On 20 April, people gathered in Antananarivo to listen to Ravalomanana speak by telephone and protest the closure of two radio stations, Radio Fahazavana and Radio Mada,&lt;ref name=bbc-20-04-2009/&gt; the latter of which is owned by Ravalomanana.&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; When the protesters began marching to a courthouse in the center of the city, police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and then fired their guns.&lt;ref name=bbc-20-04-2009/&gt; A [[BBC]] reporter witnessed a protester killed after being shot in the back at close range.&lt;ref name=bbc-20-04-2009/&gt; Another protester was also killed and twenty people went to the hospital for injuries sustained during the protests.&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; The following day, thousands of people assembled to mourn the two deaths.&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; [[List of heads of government of Madagascar|Prime Minister]] [[Roindefo Monja]] announced that "all demonstrations are banned, including those in support of Andry Rajoelina, in order to restore law and order."&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; Despite the ban, a demonstration was held the following day.&lt;ref name="afp-22-04-2009" /&gt; Over a thousand people assembled to protest, fewer in number and shorter in duration as compared in previous days.&lt;ref name=afp-22-04-2009/&gt;

Cars and trucks were set on fire and people were looting in Antananarivo on 23 April.&lt;ref name="ap-23-04-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-23-04-2009" /&gt; Police used tear gas, detonators, and gun fire to break up protests.&lt;ref name=bbc-23-04-2009/&gt; Six protesters were arrested.&lt;ref name="afp-23-04-2009" /&gt;

After Ravalomanana appointed him as Prime Minister, Rakotonirina began working out of the Carlton hotel in Antananarivo, and he appointed ministers to occupy the key government portfolios on 28 April. Soldiers with a warrant for Rakotonirina's arrest stormed the Carlton and arrested him on 29 April; they found him hiding in a bathroom after searching for about an hour. A spokesperson for Rajoelina described Rakotonirina as "the mastermind of last week's violence".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-58" /&gt; Also in late April, Rajoelina's government informed the AU that it was prepared to hold an election by the end of 2009, earlier than it had previously stated.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-59" /&gt;

=== Reconciliation meeting ===
At a reconciliation meeting that included four former presidents of Madagascar and United Nations negotiators, it was announced on 3 April that a [[Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2009|constitutional referendum]] would be held in September 2009, [[Malagasy parliamentary election, 2010|parliamentary elections]] in March 2010 and [[Malagasy presidential election, 2010|presidential elections]] in October 2010.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-60" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-61" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-62" /&gt;

On 11 April, Ravalomanana's supporters ended their participation in meetings with Rajoelina's supporters.&lt;ref name="bbc-11-04-2009" /&gt; Ravalomanana's supporters saying that the meetings were not worthwhile because their condition of the Ravalomanana's return to power was not met, nor was the United Nations' special envoy to Madagascar, [[Tiébilé Dramé]], acting as an impartial mediator.&lt;ref name="afp-11-04-2009" /&gt; In response, Dramé said he was "seeking a consensus" rather than an "imposed solution".&lt;ref name=afp-11-04-2009/&gt; On the same day, more than 10,000 people assembled in Antananarivo to protest Rajoelina's government.&lt;ref name=bbc-11-04-2009/&gt;

At a meeting on 23 May 2009 a breakthrough was reached; a transitional government and a [[truth and reconciliation commission]] was agreed to be formed, and all former presidents would be allowed to stand in the presidential elections; this last point was seen as controversial, as it might increase instability.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-63" /&gt; However, on 25 May 2009 the party of [[Didier Ratsiraka]] withdrew from the talks.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-64" /&gt;

=== Mediation crisis talks ===
Former exiled president of Madagascar [[Marc Ravalomanana]], [[President of Madagascar|President of the High Authority of Transition of Madagascar]] [[Andry Rajoelina]], former exiled Madagascar president [[Didier Ratsiraka]] and former president of the Malagasy Republic [[Albert Zafy]] met on Tuesday 4 August 2009 in Maputo, Mozambican capital, for four-day-long mediation crisis talks with the former Mozambican President [[Joaquim Chissano]] acting as mediator. Representatives came from the [[African Union]] (AU), United Nations (UN), the [[Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]] and the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC). The mediation talks hoped to arrive at a way for Ravalomanana to return to Madagascar from his exile in South Africa. The talks were also a trade meeting to begin negotiations on the transition charter to seek new elections in Madagascar. Ratsiraka, who had been exiled in France, saw his amnesty issue resolved at the talks. The four leaders sought to again become a customs union (SADC), and representatives of the United Nations.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-65" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-66" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-67" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-68" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-69" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-70" /&gt;

== Unity government deal ==
On 7 November 2009, the leaders agreed to a power-sharing deal in which Rajoelina stays as president, creation of two co-presidents, [[Fetison Rakoto Andrianirina]], aide to former President Ravalomanana and [[Emmanuel Rakotovahiny]], aide to former President Zafy. Prime Minister [[Eugene Mangalaza]] who was appointed on 10 October will be retained heading the 31-member cabinet. The deal also creates a 65-member council of transitional advisers and a transitional parliament composed of 258 members.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-71" /&gt;

During the transition in the government, people have been illegally hunting and logging in [[Marojejy National Park]] and other conservation areas in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="ng" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; While the new Malagasy government is otherwise preoccupied and some park rangers have left their posts, armed groups are cutting down valuable [[rosewood]] trees.&lt;ref name=ng/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Laws prohibiting the export of rosewood were repealed in January 2009, so the illegally acquired logs can be sold and exported for profit.&lt;ref name=ng/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Thousands of local people were involved in cutting a documented 123,000 rosewood logs representing an estimated 45,000 rosewood trees from Marojejy, Masoala and Makira National Parks between January–October 2009, with at least 871 containers already exported to China between March–April 2009 alone from the [[Vohemar]] and [[Toamasina]] ports.&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Floating the rosewood logs down rivers also requires cutting of 4–5 lighter trees, and several [[rosewood]] species are endangered or occur at low densities below 1–5 trees per hectare.&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Numerous new access paths are created and some individuals built a 6-kilometer-long road into a remote northern park to transport the logs.&lt;ref name="gm-18-04-2009" /&gt; Some ships land directly on the coast to pick up the logs, rather than at government-controlled ports.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Bribery of customs officials has been reported.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Radio commercials have been aired seeking workers to help in the process.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Extracting resources from these conservation areas is likely to threaten already [[critically endangered]] species such as the [[silky sifaka]] [[lemur]],&lt;ref name=ng/&gt; one of the top 25 most endangered [[primate]]s in the world.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-72" /&gt; A statement jointly released by several [[non-governmental organizations]] criticized the logging and hunting occurring in national parks, illegal mining, and [[slash-and-burn|slash-and-burn farming]] occurring in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="fn-30-03-2009" /&gt; The joint statement said that "These deplorable acts will only further impoverish the country and deprive future generations of the Malagasy people from their unique natural heritage."&lt;ref name=fn-30-03-2009/&gt; The groups who issued the statement were [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Conservation International]], [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]], Institute for the Conservation of Tropical Environment, [[The Peregrine Fund]], ONG Fanamby, [[Madagascar Fauna Group]], L'Homme et l'Environnement, and Plant Resources for Tropical Africa.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-73" /&gt;

=== Contracts ===
In 2009, Rajoelina canceled a contract with South Korean company [[Daewoo]].&lt;ref name="ft-2009-03-19" /&gt; Under the contract, Daewoo would have leased {{convert|1300000|ha|km2}} of land, almost half of Madagascar's arable land,&lt;ref name="AutoRI-74" /&gt; for 99 years to grow corn and palm oil for export to South Korea, a project that might have created as many as 45,000 jobs.&lt;ref name=ft-2009-03-19/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-2009-03-19" /&gt; On 10 April 2009, Madagascar's Minister of Land Reform confirmed that the contract with Daewoo had been canceled because its "approach was wrong", even though "the project by itself wasn't bad and such a project is welcome".&lt;ref name="bb-10-04-2009" /&gt; As of 10 April, Daewoo said it had not been informed of the contract's cancellation&lt;ref name=bb-10-04-2009/&gt; and would proceed with the project regardless.&lt;ref name=ft-2009-03-19/&gt;

On 17 March 2009, Canadian energy company [[Sherritt International]] said its 27-year $4.5-billion nickel-mining project would still begin in 2010 and reach full production in 2013, as scheduled.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-75" /&gt; On 19 March 2009, it said it was likely the project's start date would be delayed.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-76" /&gt;

=== Economic ===
Finance Minister Benja Razafimahaleo reported a decrease in government revenue of 15 to 20 percent.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Ravalomanana owns Tiko, the largest dairy farm in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-77" /&gt; After Rajoelina became president, Rajoelina's supporters looted Tiko dairy farms, resulting in a milk shortage in Madagascar.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Revenue from foreign tourists has decreased by 70 percent, in part because some foreign countries are cautioning their citizens against visiting the country&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; About 70 percent of hotels have closed due to the sharp drop in business.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; One large hotel that has remained open temporarily laid off 150 of its 400 employees and cut the hours and wages of its other 250 employees.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Strikes, wage shortages, and cuts in foreign aid are also causing economic problems for the country.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt;

=== Sports ===
On 28 January 2009, the [[Confederation of African Football]] canceled a match between Madagascar's [[Academie Ny Antsika]] and [[Réunion]]'s [[US Stade Tamponnaise|Union Sportive Stade Tamponnaise]], which was set to be played in Antananarivo.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-78" /&gt;

The African Union suspended Madagascar's membership in the organization. The [[Peace and Security Council]] of the African Union announced that it would impose sanctions on the Madagascar government if an "unconstitutional" transfer of power were to take place, including total expulsion from the African Union.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-95" /&gt; The African Union can enact sanctions if Madagascar does not restore constitutional order within six months.&lt;ref name="tg 2009-03-20" /&gt;

The African Union's stance was corroborated by Czech Foreign Minister [[Karel Schwarzenberg]], who stated that the European Union may impose sanctions on Madagascar and not recognize the transfer of power,&lt;ref name="AutoRI-96" /&gt; and the United States Department of State, which indicated a similar response to any "extra-constitutional" regime change.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-97" /&gt; The Southern African Development Community will meet in late March to consider sanctions.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-98" /&gt;

On 31 March, the [[European Union]] said it had not suspended its aid to Madagascar, which will continue for the next three years as previously agreed, but it also had no plans for new aid.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-99" /&gt;

US President Barack Obama decided to remove Madagascar from the beneficiary of the AGOA [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]]. On 23 December of the year 2009, President Obama also terminated the program for Guinea, Niger and Madagascar because of their undemocratic changes of power.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-100" /&gt; The AGOA program has helped created ten of thousands of jobs for middle class Malagasy especially in apparel manufacturing factories, it is feared that most of these jobs will be lost in the near future. Considering the important number of business affected by this decision, the economy of the capital city Antananarivo and [[Antsirabe]] will be deeply affected fearing further social tension.

=== Government response ===
Most of the government response has been channeled through opposition prime minister [[Monja Roindefo]], who denied that the events leading to Rajoelina's gaining of the presidency was a coup, but rather a "direct expression of democracy, when representative democracy does not express itself through the institutions",&lt;ref name="tg 2009-03-20" /&gt; and called on the European Union to reconsider its reaction to the events. Rajoelina dismissed the condemnations, stating that "if they haven't understood the process, they may well react. But if they stick to their line after we have spoken, it will be annoying".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-101" /&gt;

Rajoelina has promised that the high [[cost of living]] would decrease because merchants had agreed to decrease the price of bread and cooking oil as of 30 March, and the cost of rice soon thereafter.&lt;ref name=ap-28-03-2009/&gt;

In response to the [[Southern African Development Community]]'s view that Rajoelina's rise to power was unconstitutional and its urging for elections within six months, Rajoelina said that membership in the SADC is "not in the interests of Madagascar".&lt;ref name=r-30-03-2009/&gt; He said he would confer with others to decide whether Madagascar would continue to be a member of the SADC.&lt;ref name=r-30-03-2009/&gt; "The prospect of an SADC intervention is unacceptable. Other states cannot interfere with the decision of (Madagascar's) High Constitutional Court" that the transfer of power to Rajoelina was constitutional.&lt;ref name=r-30-03-2009/&gt;

{{Cleanup|reason=the subject titles that reiterate "Arguments"...the page is already about the arguments|date=May 2012}}

Arguments about the '''[[prohibition (drugs)|prohibition of drugs]]''', and over [[drug policy]] reform, are subjects of considerable controversy. The following is a presentation of major drugs policy arguments, including those for drug law enforcement on one side of the debate, and arguments for drug law reform on the other. Arguments for and against drug prohibition discuss which system is more effective to protects human rights, prevent drug abuse and violence, and which system is more ethical.

==Efficiency==

===Drug laws are effective===
Supporters of prohibition claim that drug laws have a successful track record suppressing illicit drug use since they were introduced 100 years ago.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"&gt;Drug Free Australia {{cite web |url=http://www.drugfree.org.au/fileadmin/Media/Global/Taskforce_Arguments_for_Prohibition.pdf |title=Arguments for Prohibition |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706124952/http://www.drugfree.org.au/fileadmin/Media/Global/Taskforce_Arguments_for_Prohibition.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example see {{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/the-1912-hague-international-opium-convention.html |title=The 1912 Hague International Opium Convention |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902141513/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/the-1912-hague-international-opium-convention.html |archivedate=2010-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The licit drug alcohol has current (last 12 months) user rates as high as 80–90% in populations over 14 years of age,&lt;ref&gt;Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. 2007 National Drug Strategy Household Survey: first Results.

With illicit drug use peaking in the 1970s in the United States, the "Just Say No" campaign, initiated under the patronage of Nancy Reagan, coincided with recent (past month) illicit drug use decreases from 14.1% in 1979 to 5.8% in 1992, a drop of 60%.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2 "Any Illicit Drug Use", 1996 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse: Preliminary Results {{cite web |url= http://www.oas.samhsa.gov/nhsda/PE1996/rtst1008.htm |title= US SAMHSA Survey |accessdate= 2010-04-20 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040921083952/http://www.oas.samhsa.gov/nhsda/PE1996/rtst1008.htm |archivedate= 2004-09-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 2007, Antonio Maria Costa, former executive director of the [[UNODC|United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], drew attention to the [[drug policy of Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt;The Swedish Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (Feb 2008). [http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/09/87/50/0dcba6c7.pdf The Swedish action plan on narcotic drugs 2006–2010]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNODC (Feb 2007).

{{"|Sweden is an excellent example. Drug use is just a third of the European average while spending on drug control is three times the EU average. For three decades,&lt;ref group=nb name=Bogdan1977&gt;There were changes of course to the [[drug policy of Sweden]] prior to the period to which, on both sides of the argument, Antonio Maria Costa and Henrik Tham refer. For example, the Narcotics Penal Act of 1968 increased the maximum penalty for a grave drug offence from one to four years. It was increased again in 1969 to maximum six years (both in the Narcotics Penal Act and in the Smuggling Penal Act). The aim was to permit notable penalties for profiteers taking advantage of the inexperience, curiosity or drug dependence of others. In 1972, maximum punishment for gross offences was increased from 6 to 10 years in order to achieve parity with Finnish, Norwegian and West German law. This increase was intended to affect only the most dangerous criminals. – Source: Bogdan, Michael (1977).

There is a strong emphasis on prevention, drug laws have been progressively tightened, and extensive treatment and rehabilitation opportunities are available to users. The police take drug crime seriously. Governments and societies must keep their nerve and avoid being swayed by misguided notions of tolerance. They must not lose sight of the fact that illicit drugs are dangerous – that is why the world agreed to restrict them.|Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of [[UNODC]] (March 2007).

Criticizing governments that have relaxed their drug laws, Antonio Maria Costa, speaking in Washington before the launch of the World Drug Report in June 2006, said:

{{"|After so many years of drug control experience, we now know that a coherent, long-term strategy can reduce drug supply, demand and trafficking. If this does not happen, it will be because some nations fail to take the drug issue sufficiently seriously and pursue inadequate policies. Many countries have the drug problem they deserve.|}}

===Drug laws are ineffective===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AugustVollmer.jpg|right|thumb|250px|August Vollmer, former president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and critic of drug prohibition]] --&gt;
One of the prominent early critics of prohibition in the United States was [[August Vollmer]], founder of the School of Criminology at [[University of California, Irvine]] and former president of the [[International Association of Chiefs of Police]]. In his 1936 book ''The Police and Modern Society'', he stated his opinion that:

{{"|Stringent laws, spectacular police drives, vigorous prosecution, and imprisonment of addicts and peddlers have proved not only useless and enormously expensive as means of correcting this evil, but they are also unjustifiably and unbelievably cruel in their application to the unfortunate drug victims. Repression has driven this vice underground and produced the narcotic smugglers and supply agents, who have grown wealthy out of this evil practice and who, by devious methods, have stimulated traffic in drugs. Finally, and not the least of the evils associated with repression, the helpless addict has been forced to resort to crime in order to get money for the drug which is absolutely indispensable for his comfortable existence.

The first step in any plan to alleviate this dreadful affliction should be the establishment of Federal control and dispensation – at cost – of habit-forming drugs. With the profit motive gone, no effort would be made to encourage its use by private dispensers of narcotics, and the drug peddler would disappear. New addicts would be speedily discovered and through early treatment, some of these unfortunate victims might be saved from becoming hopelessly incurable.

Drug addiction, like prostitution, and like liquor, is not a police problem; it never has been, and never can be solved by policemen. It is first and last a medical problem, and if there is a solution it will be discovered not by policemen, but by scientific and competently trained medical experts whose sole objective will be the reduction and possible eradication of this devastating appetite. There should be intelligent treatment of the incurables in outpatient clinics, hospitalization of those not too far gone to respond to therapeutic measures, and application of the prophylactic principles which medicine applies to all scourges of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;''The Police and Modern Society'', [[August Vollmer]], Berkeley, University of California Press, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stephen Rolles, writing in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', argues:

{{"|Consensus is growing within the drugs field and beyond that the prohibition on production, supply, and use of certain drugs has not only failed to deliver its intended goals but has been counterproductive. Evidence is mounting that this policy has not only exacerbated many public health problems, such as adulterated drugs and the spread of HIV and hepatitis B and C infection among injecting drug users, but has created a much larger set of secondary harms associated with the criminal market. These now include vast networks of organised crime, endemic violence related to the drug market, corruption of law enforcement and governments.}}

These conclusions have been reached by a succession of committees and reports including, in the United Kingdom alone, the [[Police Foundation]], the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]], the [[Prime Minister's Strategy Unit]], the [[Royal Society of Arts]], and the [[UK Drug Policy Consortium]]. The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has also acknowledged the many "unintended negative consequences" of drug enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Rolles, Stephen (2010). [http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c3360.full An alternative to the war on drugs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902235541/http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c3360.full |date=2010-09-02 }} BMJ. 341:c3360. {{doi|10.1136/bmj.c3360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editor of the ''British Medical Journal'', Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir [[Ian Gilmore]], former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs "as a health issue rather than criminalising people" and "this could drastically reduce crime and improve health".

Danny Kushlik, head of external affairs at Transform, said the intervention of senior medical professionals was significant. He said: "Sir Ian's statement is yet another nail in prohibition's coffin. The Hippocratic oath says: 'First, do no harm'. Physicians are duty bound to speak out if the outcomes show that prohibition causes more harm than it reduces."

Nicholas Green, chairman of the [[Bar Council]], made comments in a report in the profession's magazine, in which he said that [[drug-related crime]] costs the UK economy about £13bn a year and that there was growing evidence that decriminalisation could free up police resources, reduce crime and recidivism and improve public health.&lt;ref&gt;Boseley, Sarah (2010).

A report sponsored by the [[New York County Lawyers' Association]], one of the largest local bar associations in the United States, argues on the subject of US drug policy:

{{"|Notwithstanding the vast public resources expended on the enforcement of penal statutes against users and distributors of controlled substances, contemporary drug policy appears to have failed, even on its own terms, in a number of notable respects. These include: minimal reduction in the consumption of controlled substances; failure to reduce violent crime; failure to markedly reduce drug importation, distribution and street-level drug sales; failure to reduce the widespread availability of drugs to potential users; failure to deter individuals from becoming involved in the drug trade; failure to impact upon the huge profits and financial opportunity available to individual "entrepreneurs" and organized underworld organizations through engaging in the illicit drug trade; the expenditure of great amounts of increasingly limited public resources in pursuit of a cost-intensive "penal" or "law-enforcement" based policy; failure to provide meaningful treatment and other assistance to substance abusers and their families; and failure to provide meaningful alternative economic opportunities to those attracted to the drug trade for lack of other available avenues for financial advancement.&lt;ref&gt;via New York County Lawyers' Association (Oct 2006). [http://www.drugtext.org/library/reports/nycla/nycla.htm#footnotes Report and Recommendations of the Drug Policy Task Force (Note 2)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622205805/http://www.drugtext.org/library/reports/nycla/nycla.htm#footnotes |date=June 22, 2008 }}. NYCLA &amp; Drug Reform Coordination Network. – see National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (1993), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which reports that 12% of the total U.S. population, or 24 million persons within the U.S., had used illicit drugs within the past year. 77 million persons had used illicit drugs sometime during their life. In a similar survey, conducted in 1994, it was found that 10.8% of the total population, or 22.6 million persons had used illicit drugs some time during the previous year. Further, a U.S. General Accounting Office report, released in 1989, noted the following findings: that drug abuse in the United States persisted at very high levels throughout the 1980s; that the amount of cocaine consumed in the U.S. doubled, while the price declined about 30%; that the price of heroin declined 20%, while the average purity of heroin sold had doubled; and that marijuana, while its use declined, continued to be readily available in most areas of the country. Thus, notwithstanding huge expenditures in waging the "war on drugs" drug use remains widespread throughout the nation, its costs have actually decreased and potency increased.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, a growing body of evidence and opinion suggests that contemporary drug policy, as pursued in recent decades, may be counterproductive and even harmful to the society whose public safety it seeks to protect. This conclusion becomes more readily apparent when one distinguishes the harms suffered by society and its members directly attributable to the pharmacological effects of drug use upon human behavior, from those harms resulting from policies attempting to eradicate drug use.&lt;ref&gt;New York County Lawyers' Association (Oct 2006). [http://www.drugtext.org/library/reports/nycla/nycla.htm#footnotes Report and Recommendations of the Drug Policy Task Force (Note 3)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622205805/http://www.drugtext.org/library/reports/nycla/nycla.htm#footnotes |date=June 22, 2008 }}. NYCLA &amp; Drug Reform Coordination Network. "In aid of more meaningful and objective analysis of what has commonly been referred to as 'the drug problem', care must be taken and appropriate distinctions made in using terms such as: 'drug use', 'substance abuse', 'drug-related crime', and 'drug-induced crime'. Definitions of these terms having been blurred in the drug policy debate thus far, has led to a failure to properly analyze and distinguish harms caused by drug use, substance abuse, the drug-trade, and drug control policies themselves."&lt;/ref&gt;

With aid of these distinctions, we see that present drug policy appears to contribute to the increase of violence in our communities. It does so by permitting and indeed, causing the drug trade to remain a lucrative source of economic opportunity for street dealers, drug kingpins and all those willing to engage in the often violent, illicit, black market trade.

Meanwhile, the effect of present policy serves to stigmatize and marginalize drug users, thereby inhibiting and undermining the efforts of many such individuals to remain or become productive, gainfully employed members of society. Furthermore, current policy has not only failed to provide adequate access to treatment for substance abuse, it has, in many ways, rendered the obtaining of such treatment, and of other medical services, more difficult and even dangerous to pursue.&lt;ref&gt;

In response to claims that prohibition can work, as argued by [[Antonio Maria Costa]], executive director of the [[UNODC|United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], who drew attention to the [[drug policy of Sweden]], Henrik Tham has written that sometimes it's domestically important to stress drug policy as successful; in the case of Sweden, where this notion is important, such claims serve "''the function of strengthening a threatened national identity in a situation where the traditional 'Swedish model' has come under increasingly hard attack from both inside and outside the country.''" Tham questions the success of the Swedish model – "''The shift in Swedish drug policy since around 1980''" ...(more difficult to receive ''[[nolle prosequi]]'' for minor drug crimes)&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Tham: Narkotikapolitiken och missbrukets utveckling, page 4, Kriminologiska institutionen, Stockholms universitet, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb name=Bogdan1977/&gt; ..."''towards a more strict model has according to the official point of view been successful by comparison with the earlier, more lenient drug policy. However, available systematic indicators show that the prevalence of drug use has increased since around 1980, that the decrease in drug incidence was particularly marked during the 1970s and that some indicators point towards an increase during the 1990s.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Leif Lenke and Börje Olsson from Stockholm University have conducted research that showed how drug use have followed the youth unemployment in close correlation. They noted that unlike most of Europe, Sweden did not have widespread and lingering youth unemployment until the [[Swedish banking rescue|early 1990s financial crisis]], suggesting that unattractive future prospects may contribute to the increase in drug use among the young.&lt;ref&gt;Lenke, L. &amp; Olsson, B.

The professor emeritus in criminology at the University of Oslo, [[Nils Christie]], pointed out Sweden as the hawk of international drug policy in a 2004 book. He said that Sweden are serving the role of being welfare alibi for, and lending legitimacy to the US [[War on Drugs|drug war]].

An editorial in [[The Economist]] argued: {{"|fear [of legalisation] is based in large part on the presumption that more people would take drugs under a legal regime. That presumption may be wrong. There is no correlation between the harshness of drug laws and the incidence of drug-taking: citizens living under tough regimes (notably America but also Britain) take more drugs, not fewer. Embarrassed drug warriors blame this on alleged cultural differences, but even in fairly similar countries tough rules make little difference to the number of addicts: harsh Sweden and more liberal Norway have precisely the same addiction rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Deterrence==

===Arguments that prohibition discourages drug use===
A 2001 Australian study, of 18- to 29-year-olds by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research suggests that prohibition deters illicit drug use.&lt;ref&gt;NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research{{cite web |url= http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/bocsar/ll_bocsar.nsf/vwFiles/mr_cjb58.pdf/$file/mr_cjb58.pdf |title= Does Prohibition Deter Cannabis Use |accessdate= 2010-04-20 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110321135719/http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/bocsar/ll_bocsar.nsf/vwFiles/mr_cjb58.pdf/$file/mr_cjb58.pdf |archivedate= 2011-03-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 29% of those who had never used cannabis cited the illegality of the substance as their reason for never using the drug, while 19% of those who had ceased use of cannabis cited its illegality as their reason.

Gil Kerlikowske, Director of the US [[ONDCP]] argues,

{{"|Controls and prohibitions help to keep prices higher, and higher prices help keep use rates relatively low, since drug use, especially among young people, is known to be sensitive to price. The relationship between pricing and rates of youth substance use is well-established with respect to alcohol and cigarette taxes. There is literature showing that increases in the price of cigarettes triggers declines in use."&lt;ref&gt;Gil Kerlikowske {{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/news/speech10/030410_Chief.pdf |pages=9, 10 |title=Why Marijuana Legalization Would Compromise Public Health and Public Safety |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The DEA argues "Legalization has been tried before—and failed miserably. Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally.

[[Drug Free Australia]] has cited the Netherlands as an example of drug policy failure because it is soft in approach. They argue that the Dutch idea of going soft on cannabis dealers, thereby creating a "separation of markets" from hard drug dealers has failed to stem the initiation to drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and amphetamines, saying that, in 1998, the Netherlands had the third highest cannabis and cocaine use in Europe.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt; According to Barry McCaffrey of the US [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], Dutch tolerance has allowed the Netherlands to become a criminal epicentre for illicit synthetic drug manufacture, particularly ecstasy, as well as the home for production and worldwide export of strains of cannabis with THC reportedly 10 times higher than normal.&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Barry McCaffrey, Director, US Office of Drug Control Policy to House Government Reform and Oversight Committee. {{cite web

[[British Crime Survey]] statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16–24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

American teenagers are drinking and smoking less and doing fewer drugs than their predecessors in more than 40 years of tracking. Use of marijuana is down among 8th- and 10th-graders, though it is flat among high school seniors, according to the annual Monitoring the Future survey of American teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/infographics/monitoring-future-2017-survey-results|title=Monitoring the Future 2017 Survey Results|date=12 December 2017|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326064207/https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/infographics/monitoring-future-2017-survey-results|archivedate=26 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gateway drug theory==
{{Main|Gateway drug theory}}

===Arguments that cannabis is a gateway drug===
The US Drug Enforcement Agency's "2008 Marijuana Sourcebook" argues that recent research supports the gateway hypothesis that certain drugs (such as cannabis) act as gateways to use of 'harder' drugs such as heroin, either because of social contact or because of an increasing search for a better high.&lt;ref&gt;US DEA{{cite web|url= http://www.justice.gov/dea/statistics/Marijuana_2008.pdf |title=2008 Marijuana Sourcebook |accessdate=2010-04-20 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100529133129/http://www.justice.gov/dea/statistics/Marijuana_2008.pdf| archivedate= 2010-05-29 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents cite studies such as that of 311 same sex twins, where only one twin smoked cannabis before age 17, and where such early cannabis smokers were five times more likely than their twin to move on to harder drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Lynskey M, Escalation of Drug Use in Early-Onset Cannabis Users vs Co-Twin Controls JAMA 289 No.4 427–433 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments that cannabis is not a gateway drug===
In the ''American Journal of Public Health'', Andrew Golub and Bruce Johnson of the [[National Development and Research Institute]] in New York wrote that young people who smoked marijuana in the generations before and after the baby boomers did not appear to be likely to move on to harder drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Drug Science.org (2006). [http://www.drugscience.org/sfu/sfu_gateway.html Cannabis as a Gateway Drug] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124084430/http://www.drugscience.org/sfu/sfu_gateway.html |date=2010-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from the independent Rand Drug Policy Research Center in Santa Monica, California, looking at data from the [[National Household Survey on Drug Abuse]] between 1982 and 1994, concluded that teenagers who took hard drugs did so whether they had first tried cannabis or not.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News (2002). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2538065.stm Cannabis 'not linked to harder drugs'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323025004/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2538065.stm |date=2009-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A twin study (of 510 same sex twin pairs) which adjusted for additional confounders such as peer drug use, found that cannabis use and associations with later hard drug use existed only for non-identical twins. The study suggested that a causal role of cannabis use in later hard drug usage is minimal, if it exists at all, and that cannabis use and hard drug use share the same influencing factors such as genetics and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cleveland|first1=HH|last2=Wiebe|first2=RP|title=Understanding the association between adolescent marijuana use and later serious drug use: gateway effect or developmental trajectory?|journal=Development and psychopathology|date=2008|volume=20|issue=2|pages=615–32|doi=10.1017/S0954579408000308|pmid=18423097|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5429788_Understanding_the_association_between_adolescent_marijuana_use_and_later_serious_drug_use_Gateway_effect_or_developmental_trajectory|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127083820/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5429788_Understanding_the_association_between_adolescent_marijuana_use_and_later_serious_drug_use_Gateway_effect_or_developmental_trajectory|archivedate=2018-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24438181"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agrawal A, Lynskey MT | title = Cannabis controversies: how genetics can inform the study of comorbidity | journal = Addiction | volume = 109 | issue = 3 | pages = 360–70 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24438181 | pmc = 3943474 | doi = 10.1111/add.12436 | url = }} (Review).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==

===Health arguments for drug laws===
Advocates of prohibition argue that particular drugs should be illegal because they are harmful. Drug Free Australia for example argues "That illicit drugs are inherently harmful substances is attested by the very nomenclature of the 'harm reduction' movement."&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt; The U.S. government has argued that illegal drugs are "''far more deadly than alcohol''" saying "''although alcohol is used by seven times as many people as drugs, the number of deaths induced by those substances is not far apart. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), during 2000, there were 15,852 drug-induced deaths; only slightly less than the 18,539 alcohol-induced deaths.''"&lt;ref name=DEA&gt;United States Drug Enforcement Administration, "[http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/demand/speakout/03so.htm Fact 3: Illegal drugs are illegal because they are harmful] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210094624/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/demand/speakout/03so.htm |date=February 10, 2007 }}".&lt;/ref&gt; Ratios of the harms of illicit opiates to licit alcohol and tobacco in Australia are similar, with 2 deaths per hundred opiate users per annum versus 0.22 deaths per hundred for alcohol (9 times less) per year and 0.3 for tobacco (7 times less).&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

The DEA has said:

{{"|Marijuana is far more powerful than it used to be. In 2000, there were six times as many emergency room mentions of marijuana use as there were in 1990, despite the fact that the number of people using marijuana is roughly the same. In 1999, a record 225,000 Americans entered substance abuse treatment primarily for marijuana dependence, second only to heroin—and not by much. ... According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, "Studies show that someone who smokes five joints per week may be taking in as many cancer-causing chemicals as someone who smokes a full pack of cigarettes every day." Marijuana contains more than 400 chemicals, including the most harmful substances found in tobacco smoke. For example, smoking one marijuana cigarette deposits about four times more tar into the lungs than a filtered tobacco cigarette. ... The short-term effects are also harmful. They include: memory loss, distorted perception, trouble with thinking and problem solving, loss of motor skills, decrease in muscle strength, increased heart rate, and anxiety. Marijuana impacts young people's mental development, their ability to concentrate in school, and their motivation and initiative to reach goals. And marijuana affects people of all ages: Harvard University researchers report that the risk of a heart attack is five times higher than usual in the hour after smoking marijuana.|US Drug Enforcement Administration (2003). "[http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/demand/speakout/index.html Speaking Out Against Drug Legalization]"&lt;ref name=DEA2003/&gt;}}

Many of the deaths from using cannabis, other than from car accidents while intoxicated or violence and aggression,&lt;ref&gt;Niveau G, Dang C,  Cannabis and Violent Crime 2003 [[Medicine, Science and the Law]] 43(2):115–121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard RC, Menkes DB,  Changes in Brain Function During Acute Cannabis Intoxication: preliminary findings suggest a mechanism for cannabis-induced violence.  2007 Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health 17 Issue 2: 113–117&lt;/ref&gt; are more likely to figure in the longer term, just as with tobacco, where both nicotine overdose and cannabis overdose are extremely rare or nonexistent.  While ecstasy may have lower rates of immediate mortality than some other illicits, there is a growing science on the already recognized considerable health harms of ecstasy.&lt;ref&gt;NIDA Info Facts {{cite web|url=http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/ecstasy.html |title=NIDA Info Facts – Ecstasy |accessdate=2010-04-20 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100416171337/http://www.nida.nih.gov/InfoFacts/ecstasy.html| archivedate= 16 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug Free Australia argues that distinctions between "soft" and "hard" drugs are entirely artificial, and titling cannabis "soft" or ecstasy "recreational" does not lessen the extensive harms of these substances.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

Gil Kerlikowske, director of the US [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] (ONDCP) argues that in the United States, illegal drugs already cost $180 billion a year in health care, lost productivity, crime, and other expenditures, and that number would only increase under legalization because of increased use.&lt;ref name="whitehousedrugpolicy.gov"&gt;See speech by Gil Kerlikowske, director of the US ONDCP {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug Free Australia claims arguments that increased health harms of illicit drugs are the result of lack of government regulation of their purity and strength are not well supported by evidence. In Australia, which has had the highest opioid mortality per capita in the OECD,&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt; studies found that "overdose fatality is not a simple function of heroin dose or purity. There is no evidence of toxicity from contaminants of street heroin in Australia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ancd.org.au/images/PDF/Researchpapers/rp1_heroin_overdose.pdf |title=Heroin overdose: prevalence, correlates, consequences and interventions |accessdate=2009-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621040123/http://ancd.org.au/images/PDF/Researchpapers/rp1_heroin_overdose.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-21 |df= }} 2001 {{ISBN|1-877018-00-7}} p vi&lt;/ref&gt; Drug Free Australia claims that other causes of death such as suicide, murder and accidents are an effect of the drug themselves, not of their purity or otherwise.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

====Addiction====
Drug Free Australia argues "Regarding the freedom of choice of those addicted to a drug, it is important to recognize that addiction is defined as compulsive by its very nature and that addictions curb individual freedom." ... "As is the case with alcohol addiction, illicit drug addictions likewise serve to keep many such users functionally in poverty and often as a continued burden on friends, family and society. Where it is argued that all disabilities are a burden on society it must be recognized that most disabilities are not the result of a choice, whereas the decision to recreationally use illicit drugs is most commonly free, and with the knowledge that they may lead to an abundance of addictions."&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

===Health arguments for drug law reform===
There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs.&lt;ref&gt;David Nutt, Prof; Leslie A King, PhD; William Saulsbury, MA; Colin Blakemore, FRS, Prof. (Mar 2007). "[http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v07/n366/a01.html Development of a Rational Scale to Assess the Harm of Drugs of Potential Misuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206083222/http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v07/n366/a01.html |date=2010-12-06 }}".

====Quality control====
According to a World Health Organisation report: "As cannabis is an illegal drug its cultivation, harvesting and distribution are not subject to quality control mechanisms to ensure the reliability and safety of the product used by consumers. It is well recognised in developing countries, such as Kenya, that illicit alcohol production can result in the contamination with toxic by-products or adulterants that can kill or seriously affect the health of users. The same may be true of illicit drugs such as opiates, cocaine and amphetamine in developed societies."&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organisation.

====Block to research====
The illegality of many recreational drugs may be dissuading research into new, more effective and perhaps safer recreational drugs. For example, it has been proposed that a drug with many of the same desired effects as alcohol could be created with fewer adverse health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg19025474.100-all-the-pleasures-of-alcohol-with-no-downsides.html|title=All the pleasures of alcohol, with no downsides|author=Graham Lawton|work=New Scientist|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211033350/http://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg19025474.100-all-the-pleasures-of-alcohol-with-no-downsides.html|archivedate=2007-02-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Misleading health statistics====
The United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has suggested that illegal drugs are "far more deadly than alcohol", arguing that "although alcohol is used by seven times as many people as drugs, the number of deaths induced by those substances is not far apart", quoting figures from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), claiming "during 2000, there were 15,852 drug-induced deaths; only slightly less than the 18,539 alcohol-induced deaths."&lt;ref name="DEA"/&gt;

The DEA's use of such figures is questionable however. An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association gave the number deaths caused by alcohol in year 2000 as 85,000 – over four and a half times greater than the DEA's preferred figure.&lt;ref name=Mokdad2004&gt;Mokdad, Ali H., PhD, James S.

===Medical uses===
A document published for the non-profit advocacy organization [[Europe Against Drugs]] (EURAD) argues that "one cannot vote for a medicine" and that a scientific approval basis is essential. It says that EU rules set out strict criteria for the acceptance of a drug for medical use:

{{Quote|All active ingredients have to be identified and their chemistry determined.  They have to be tested for purity with limits set for all impurities including pesticides, microbe &amp; fungi and their products.  These tests have to be validated and reproduced if necessary in an official laboratory.  Animal testing will include information on fertility, embryo toxicity, immuno-toxicity, mutagenic and carcinogenic potential.  Risks to humans, especially pregnant women and lactating mothers, will be evaluated.  Adequate safety and efficacy trials must be carried out.  They must state the method of administration and report on the results from different groups, i.e. healthy volunteers, patients, special groups of the elderly, people with liver and kidney problems and pregnant women.

====Arguments against medical uses of prohibited drugs====
According to Janet D. Lapey, M.D., of [[Concerned Citizens For Drug Prevention]], " Due to a placebo effect, a patient may erroneously believe a drug is helpful when it is not.  This is especially true of addictive, mind-altering drugs like marijuana. A marijuana withdrawal syndrome occurs, consisting of anxiety, depression, sleep and appetite disturbances, irritability, tremors, diaphoresis, nausea, muscle convulsions, and restlessness. Often, persons using marijuana erroneously believe that the drug is helping them combat these symptoms without realizing that actually marijuana is the cause of these effects. Therefore, when a patient anecdotally reports a drug to have medicinal value, this must be followed by objective scientific studies."&lt;ref&gt;EURAD {{cite web

The US Drug Enforcement Administration also says:{{"|There is a growing misconception that some illegal drugs can be taken safely.

====Arguments for medical uses of prohibited drugs====
Most of the psychoactive drugs now prohibited in modern societies have had medical uses in history. In natural plant drugs like opium, coca, cannabis, mescaline, and psilocybin, the medical history usually dates back thousands of years and through a variety of cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Grinspoon, Lester; Bakalar, James B. gggg"[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/medical/meduse.htm Medical Uses of Illicit Drugs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902004339/http://www.druglibrary.org/SCHAFFER/hemp/medical/meduse.htm |date=2006-09-02 }}".

Psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin (the main ingredient in most hallucinogenic mushrooms) are the subject of renewed research interest because of their therapeutic potential.

====Lack of access to controlled medications====
Under prohibition, millions of people find it very difficult to obtain controlled medications, particularly [[opiate]] pain-relievers. The [[United Nations]] 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] requires that opiates be distributed only by medical prescription, but this is impractical in many areas.

According to the [[Transnational Institute]], June 2008:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ungassondrugs.org/images/stories/brief26.pdf Rewriting history, A response to the 2008 World Drug Report], Transnational Institute, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] (INCB) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) there is now an unmet demand in opiates. Ironically, the current drug control regulations hamper access to controlled opiate medications for therapeutic use. Many patients are unable to access morphine, methadone or an equivalent opioid. Global medical morphine consumption would rise five times if countries would make morphine available at the level of the calculated need, according to a recent WHO estimate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the New York Times, September 2007:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/health/10pain.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all Drugs Banned, Many of World's Poor Suffer in Pain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603160626/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/health/10pain.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |date=2013-06-03 }}, Donald G. McNeil Jr., New York Times, 10 Sept 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under Sierra Leone law, morphine may be handled only by a pharmacist or doctor, explained Gabriel Madiye, the hospice's founder. But in all Sierra Leone there are only about 100 doctors — one for every 54,000 people, compared with one for every 350 in the United States.... "How can they say there is no demand when they don't allow it?" he [Madiye] asked. "How can they be so sure that it will get out of control when they haven't even tried it?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Economic==

===Economic arguments for prohibitive drug laws===
The DEA argues that "compared to the social costs of drug abuse and addiction—whether in taxpayer dollars or in pain and suffering—government spending on drug control is minimal."&lt;ref name=DEA2003/&gt;

Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the [[UNODC|United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], has said: {{"|The economic argument for drug legalization says: legalize drugs, and generate tax income. This argument is gaining favour, as national administrations seek new sources of revenue during the current economic crisis. This legalize and tax argument is un-ethical and uneconomical. It proposes a perverse tax, generation upon generation, on marginalized cohorts (lost to addiction) to stimulate economic recovery. Are the partisans of this cause also in favour of legalizing and taxing other seemingly intractable crimes like human trafficking? Modern-day slaves (and there are millions of them) would surely generate good tax revenue to rescue failed banks. The economic argument is also based on poor fiscal logic: any reduction in the cost of drug control (due to lower law enforcement expenditure) will be offset by much higher expenditure on public health (due to the surge of drug consumption). The moral of the story: don't make wicked transactions.|Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of [[UNODC]] (June 2009). Preface to [http://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr/WDR_2009/WDR2009_eng_web.pdf World Drug Report 2009].}}

[[Gil Kerlikowske]], current director of the US [[ONDCP]], argues that legalizing drugs, then regulating and taxing their sale, would not be effective fiscally. {{"| The tax revenue collected from alcohol pales in comparison to the costs associated with it. Federal excise taxes collected on alcohol in 2007, totaled around $9 billion; states collected around $5.5 billion. Taken together, this is less than 10 percent of the over $185 billion in alcohol-related costs from health care, lost productivity, and criminal justice. Tobacco also does not carry its economic weight when we tax it; each year we spend more than $200 billion on its social costs and collect only about $25 billion in taxes.| Gil Kerlikowske, current director of the [[ONDCP]] (April 2010).

====Prohibition of hemp industry====
Opposition to the legalization of hemp, which uses plants of the cannabis genus for commercial purposes, centres on the fact that those wanting to legalize the use of cannabis for recreational and medical purposes themselves present it as their Trojan horse for that very purpose:{{"|  Alex Shum, importers of hemp fabric, "feel that the way to legalize marijuana is to sell marijuana legally. When you can buy marijuana in your neighbourhood shopping mall, IT`S LEGAL! So, they are going to produce every conceivable thing out of hemp.| High Times, "Hemp Clothing is Here!", March 1990}}

In a ''[[Huffington Post]]'' interview, [[Mark A.R. Kleiman|Mark Kleiman]], the "Pot Czar" of [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], said he was concerned that the [[National Cannabis Industry Association]] would favor profits over public health. He also said that it could become a predatory body like the lobbying arms of the tobacco and alcohol industries. Kleiman said: "The fact that the National Cannabis Industry Association has hired itself a [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street]] [[Lobbying in the United States|suit [lobbyist]]] is not a good sign."&lt;ref name=huffpo2 /&gt;

===Economic arguments for drug law reform===
The [[United States]] [[War on Drugs|efforts at drug prohibition]] started out with a $350 million budget in 1971, and was in 2006 a $30 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugwarfacts.org/economi.htm |title=Economics |accessdate=2008-03-07 |author=Common Sense for Drug Policy |date=2007-05-21 |work=Drug War Facts | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080307053005/http://www.drugwarfacts.org/economi.htm| archivedate= 7 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers only include ''direct'' prohibition enforcement expenditures, and as such only represent ''part'' of the total cost of prohibition. This $30 billion figure rises dramatically once other issues, such as the economic impact of holding 400,000 prisoners on prohibition violations, are factored in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugwarfacts.org/prison.htm |title=Prisons, Jails and Probation – Overview |accessdate=2008-03-07 |author=Common Sense for Drug Policy |date=2007-12-31 |work=Drug War Facts | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080316025839/http://www.drugwarfacts.org/prison.htm| archivedate= 16 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war on drugs is extremely costly to such societies that outlaw drugs in terms of taxpayer money, lives, productivity, the inability of law enforcement to pursue ''[[mala in se]]'' crimes, and social inequality. Some proponents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/special/friedman/socialist.htm|title=The Drug War as a Socialist Enterprise by Milton Friedman|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613032051/http://druglibrary.org/special/friedman/socialist.htm|archivedate=2010-06-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of decriminalization say that the financial and social costs of drug law enforcement far exceed the damages that the drugs themselves cause. For instance, in 1999, close to 60,000 prisoners (3.3% of [[United States incarceration rate|the total incarcerated population]]) convicted of violating marijuana laws were behind bars at a cost to taxpayers of some $1.2 billion per year. In 1980, the total jail and prison population was 540,000, about one-quarter the size it is today. Drug offenders accounted for 6% of all prisoners. According to the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]], drug offenders now account for nearly 51%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bop.gov/news/quick.jsp#4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811084224/http://www.bop.gov/news/quick.jsp|date=2011-08-11}}, Quick Facts About the Bureau of Prisons ''Federal Bureau of Prisons'', last updated 30 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that if the US government legalised marijuana it would save $7.7 billion per year in expenditure on enforcement of prohibition. Also, that marijuana legalization would yield tax revenue of $2.4 billion annually if it were taxed like all other goods and $6.2 billion annually if it were taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Miron, Jeffrey A. |date=June 2005 |url=http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/mironreport.html |title=The Budgetary Implications of Marijuana Prohibition |publisher=The Marijuana Policy Project |accessdate=2008-05-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080512083517/http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/mironreport.html| archivedate= 12 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The creation of drug cartels====
Mass arrests of local growers of marijuana, for example, not only increase the price of local drugs, but lessens competition. Only major retailers that can handle massive shipments, have their own small fleet of aircraft, troops to defend the caravans and other sophisticated methods of eluding the police (such as lawyers), can survive by this regulation of the free market by the government
{{"|... it is because it's prohibited. See, if you look at the drug war from a purely economic point of view, the role of the government is to protect the drug cartel. That's literally true.|[[Milton Friedman]]&lt;ref name="Trebach-LibertyAndDrugs" /&gt;}}

====Effect on producer countries====
The United States' "[[War on Drugs]]" has added considerably to the political instability in [[South America]]. The huge profits to be made from cocaine and other South American-grown drugs are largely because they are illegal in the wealthy neighbouring nation. This drives people in the relatively poor countries of [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Brazil]] to break their own laws in organising the cultivation, preparation and trafficking of cocaine to the States. This has allowed criminal, [[paramilitary]] and [[guerrilla]] groups to reap huge profits, exacerbating already serious law-and-order and political problems. Within Bolivia, the political rise of current president [[Evo Morales]] is directly related to his grassroots movement against US-sponsored coca-eradication and criminalization policies. However, [[coca]] has been cultivated for centuries in the [[Andes]]. Among their various legitimate uses, coca leaves are chewed for their mild stimulant &amp; appetite suppression effects, and steeped as a tea which is known to reduce the effects of human altitude sickness. Rural farmers in the poor regions in which coca has historically been cultivated often find themselves at the difficult and potentially violent intersection of government-sponsored eradication efforts, illegal cocaine producers &amp; traffickers seeking coca supplies, anti-government paramilitary forces trafficking in cocaine as a source of revolutionary funding, and the historical hardships of rural subsistence farming (or its typical alternative – abandoning their land and fleeing to an urban slum). In some regions, farmers' coca and other crops are frequently destroyed by U.S.-sponsored eradication treatments (usually sprayed from the air with varying degrees of discrimination), whether or not the farmers directly supply the cocaine trade, thereby destroying their livelihoods. Agricultural producers in these countries are pushed further to grow coca for the cocaine trade by the [[dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]] of subsidised farming products (fruit, vegetables, grain etc.) produced by Western countries (predominantly US and EU agricultural surpluses) (see BBC reference, below), which reduces the prices they could otherwise receive for alternate crops such as maize. The net effect can be a depression of prices for all crops, which can both make the farmer's livelihood more precarious, and make the cocaine producers' coca supplies cheaper.

After providing a significant portion of the world's poppy for use in heroin production, Afghanistan went from producing practically no illegal drugs in 2000 (following banning by the [[Taliban]]), to cultivating what is now as much as 90% of the world's opium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/01/AR2006120101654.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Afghanistan Opium Crop Sets Record | first=Karen | last=DeYoung | date=2006-12-02 | accessdate=2010-04-25 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105165045/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/01/AR2006120101654.html | archivedate=2010-01-05 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban is currently believed to be heavily supported by the opium trade there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/news/afghanistan-moc/|title=Afghanistan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=bookrags.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304210341/http://www.bookrags.com/news/afghanistan-moc/|archivedate=4 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the sale of the illegal drugs produces an influx of dollars that is outside the formal economy, and puts pressure on the currency exchange keeping the dollar low and making the export of legal products more difficult.&lt;ref name="VonBuelow-ImNamenDesStaates"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Im Namen des Staates.

====Prohibition of hemp industry====
{{Main|Hemp}}
The War on Drugs has resulted in the outlawing of the entire hemp industry in the United States. Hemp, which is a special cultivar of [[Cannabis Sativa]], does not have significant amounts of [[psychoactive]] ([[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]]) substances in it, less than 1%. Without even realizing the plant had been outlawed several months prior, Popular Mechanics magazine published an article in 1938 entitled ''The New Billion-Dollar Crop'' anticipating the explosion of the hemp industry with the invention of machines to help process it. Recently, governmental refusal to take advantage of taxing hemp has been a point of criticism. Hemp has a large list of potential industrial uses including [[textile]]s, [[paper]], [[rope]], [[fuel]], construction materials, and [[biocomposite]]s (for use in cars for example). Hemp has some drawbacks, however, one being that the long fibers in hemp are only a part of the outer bast, and this has contributed to hemp having only modest commercial success in countries (for example in Canada) where it is legal to harvest hemp.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The seed of the hemp plant is highly [[nutritious]]. Rare for a plant, it contains all essential [[amino acid]]s. Rare for any food, it is a good source of [[alpha-linolenic acid]], an [[omega 3 fatty acid]] which is deficient in most [[diet (nutrition)|diets]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Crime, terrorism and social order==

===Arguments for prohibitive drug laws===
While concerns are sometimes expressed that the "war on drugs" can never be won, there is a failure to recognize that other justifiably costly policing wars such as "blitzes" on speeding can likewise never be won. Such blitzes reduce and contain speeding, as with policing of illicit drug use.  Failure to police speeding drivers simply allows inordinate harm to be inflicted on other individuals. Speeding is not legalized simply because it can never be eradicated.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

There is an argument that much crime and terrorism is drug related or drug funded and that prohibition should reduce this.

Former US president George W. Bush, in signing the [[Drug-Free Communities Act Reauthorization Bill]] in December 2001, said, "If you quit drugs, you join the fight against terror in America."&lt;ref name=Bush2001/&gt;

The US Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) says that drug-related offences may include violent behavior resulting from drug effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/crime/index.html |title=ONDCP – Drug Related Crime |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218114141/http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/crime/index.html |archivedate=2010-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Drug Enforcement Administration claims:{{"|Crime, violence and drug use go hand in hand. Six times as many homicides are committed by people under the influence of drugs, as by those who are looking for money to buy drugs. Most drug crimes aren't committed by people trying to pay for drugs; they're committed by people on drugs.|US Drug Enforcement Administration (2003).

The U.S. government began the Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program in 1987 to collect information on drug use among urban arrestees. In 1997, the National Institute of Justice expanded and reengineered the DUF study and renamed it the [[Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring]] (ADAM) program. ADAM is a network of 34 research sites in select U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/druguse/|title=Office of National Drug Control Policy|work=The White House|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119142001/http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/druguse/|archivedate=2010-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DUF research indicates that:

*  Frequent use of hard drugs is one of the strongest indicators of a criminal career.
*  Offenders who use drugs are among the most serious and active criminals, engaging in both property and violent crime.
*  Early and persistent use of cocaine or heroin in the juvenile years is an indicator of serious, persistent criminal behavior in adulthood.
*  Those arrested who are drug users are more likely than those not using drugs to be rearrested on pretrial release or fail to appear at trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paranoia.lycaeum.org/war.on.drugs/debate/crime.link|title=Summary of DUF findings|author=|date=|website=lycaeum.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828123805/http://paranoia.lycaeum.org/war.on.drugs/debate/crime.link|archivedate=28 August 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/crime/index.html|title=Office of National Drug Control Policy|work=The White House|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923202557/http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/crime/index.html|archivedate=2008-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of drugs changes behavior and causes criminal activity because people will do things they wouldn't do if they were rational and free of the drug's influence.  Cocaine-related paranoia is an example. If drug use increases with legalization, so will such forms of related violent crime as assaults, drugged driving, child abuse, and domestic violence.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

That higher prices make the trade lucrative for criminals is recognized but countered by the argument that capitulating to illicit drug use on these grounds makes no more sense than capitulating to those who continue to traffic in human lives, a more expensive business because of its illegality and therefore more lucrative for the criminal, but necessary for the rights of vulnerable citizens.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

The Office of National Drug Control Policy says that the idea that our nation's prisons are overflowing with otherwise law-abiding people convicted for nothing more than simple possession of marijuana is a myth, "an illusion conjured and aggressively perpetuated by drug advocacy groups seeking to relax or abolish America's marijuana laws." ONDCP state that the vast majority of inmates in state and federal prison for marijuana have been found guilty of much more than simple possession. Some were convicted for drug trafficking, some for marijuana possession along with one or more other offenses. And many of those serving time for marijuana pleaded down to possession in order to avoid prosecution on much more serious charges. In the US, just 1.6 percent of the state inmate population were held for offences involving only marijuana, and less than one percent of all state prisoners (0.7 percent) were incarcerated with marijuana possession as the only charge. An even smaller fraction of state prisoners were first time offenders (0.3 percent). The numbers on the US federal prisons are similar. In 2001, the overwhelming majority of offenders sentenced for marijuana crimes were convicted for trafficking and only 63 served time for simple possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Detective superintendent Eva Brännmark from the [[Swedish National Police Board]], in a speech given to Drug Free Australia's first international conference on illicit drug use, said:

{{"|The police have been able to solve other crimes, e.g. burglaries, thefts and robberies, by questioning people arrested for using drugs. Some even provide information about people who are selling drugs, and the police have seized large amounts of drugs as a result of information from people brought in for a urine test. Many interrogations of drug abusers have also resulted in search warrants and the recovery of stolen property.|Brännmark, Eva (2007).

The argument that drug addicts of certain drugs are forced into crime by prohibition should first and foremost highlight the fact that this argument presupposes and underlines the addictive nature of some illicit drugs (which legalization proponents often downplay), addictive enough to create a viable criminal supply industry.  Secondly, the harms of increased addictive drug use, which as previously outlined would be a consequence of legalization and its cheaper prices, far outweigh the current crime harms of prohibition.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt; It is worth pointing out, this argument is not useful for substances such as LSD and mescaline, with no addictive properties.

Although criminal punishments vary with rooting out drug usage, it is not the foremost eradication technique to resolve drug abuse issues. In order to combat these issues, the application of treatment and support group resources coupled with community support and understanding, has far higher long-term potential to cure the ever-growing epidemic plaguing the nation, especially in rural areas.

===Arguments for drug law reform===

====Violence and profits of drugs traffickers====
Prohibition protects the drug cartel insofar as it keeps the distribution in the [[black market]] and creates the risk that makes smuggling profitable.&lt;ref name="Trebach-LibertyAndDrugs"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Friedman and Szasz on Liberty and Drugs: Essays on the Free Market and Prohibition |last=Trebach |first=Arnold S. |authorlink= |author2=Kevin B.

:"I learned that not only did they not fear our war on drugs, they ''counted on it'' to increase the market price and to weed out the smaller, inefficient drug dealers. They found U.S. interdiction efforts laughable. The only U.S. action they feared was an effective demand reduction program. On one undercover tape-recorded conversation, a top cartel chief, Jorge Roman, expressed his gratitude for the drug war, calling it "a sham put on for the American taxpayer" that was actually "good for business".&lt;ref&gt;After Prohibition. An Adult Approach to Drug Policies in the 21st Century. p92. {{ISBN|1-882577-94-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of drug prohibition often cite the fact that the end of alcohol prohibition in 1933 led to immediate decreases in murders and robberies to support the argument that legalization of drugs could have similar effects. Once those involved in the narcotics trade have a legal method of settling business disputes, the number of murders and violent crime could drop. [[Robert W. Sweet]], a federal judge, strongly agrees: "The present policy of trying to prohibit the use of drugs through the use of criminal law is a mistake".&lt;ref&gt;Riga, Peter J. (July 1993).

Retrieved March 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; When alcohol use was outlawed during prohibition, it gave rise to gang warfare and spurred the formation of some of the most well known criminals of the era, among them the infamous [[Al Capone]]. Similarly, drug dealers today resolve their disputes through violence and intimidation, something which legal drug vendors do not do. Prohibition critics also point to the fact that [[police]] are more likely to be corrupted in a system where [[bribe]] money is so available. Police corruption due to drugs is widespread enough that one pro-legalization newsletter has made it a weekly feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopthedrugwar.org|title=StoptheDrugWar.org – raising awareness of the consequences of prohibition|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504023125/http://www.stopthedrugwar.org/|archivedate=2006-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug money has been called a major source of income for terrorist organizations.

The lack of government regulation and control over the lucrative illegal drug market has created a large population of unregulated drug dealers who lure many children into the illegal drug trade. The U.S. government's most recent 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) reported that nationwide over 800,000 adolescents ages 12–17 sold illegal drugs during the previous 12 months preceding the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oas.samhsa.gov/nsduh/2k6nsduh/2k6Results.htm|title=Data|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014180559/http://oas.samhsa.gov/nsduh/2k6nsduh/2k6Results.htm|archivedate=2007-10-14|df=|access-date=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 [[Youth Risk Behavior Survey]] by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that nationwide 25.4% of students had been offered, sold, or given an illegal drug by someone on school property. The prevalence of having been offered, sold, or given an illegal drug on school property ranged from 15.5% to 38.7% across state CDC surveys (median: 26.1%) and from 20.3% to 40.0% across local surveys (median: 29.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5505a1.htm|title=Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance --- United States, 2005|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916181902/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5505a1.htm|archivedate=2008-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite more than $7 billion spent annually towards arresting and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005, the federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey reports about 85% of high school seniors find marijuana "easy to obtain."

With respect to drug crop cultivation, eradication efforts in line with prohibitionist drug policies ultimately force coca, poppy, and marijuana growers into more remote, ecologically sensitive areas.&lt;ref name="Narco-deforestation"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McSweeney|first1=Kendra|last2=Nielsen|first2=Erik|last3=Taylor|first3=Matthew|last4=Wrathall|first4=David|last5=Pearson|first5=Zoe|last6=Wang|first6=Ophelia|last7=Plumb|first7=Spencer|title=Drug Policy as Conservation Policy: Narco-Deforestation|journal=Science|date=January 31, 2014|volume=343|pages=489–490|url=http://raisg.socioambiental.org/system/files/Science-2014-McSweeney-489-90.pdf|doi=10.1126/science.1244082|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222082809/http://raisg.socioambiental.org/system/files/Science-2014-McSweeney-489-90.pdf|archivedate=December 22, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These crops, which are generally grown away from urban centers and state presence, tend to deplete forestland and expand the agricultural frontier.  Out of fear of eradication, cultivators are incentivized to accelerate production cycles in order to obtain the highest yield in the shortest period of time; the pace and methods used by growers neglect measures to promote sustainability, exacerbating the environmental impact.  Drug cultivators typically opt to produce in areas with ecosystems with abundant plant biomass to better conceal their operations.  Ultimately, this practice leads to increased deforestation which contributes to a greater influx of [[greenhouse gas]]es into the atmosphere.  Moreover, the aerial spraying of herbicides such as [[glyphosate]] used in eradication and control efforts have been shown to have negative effects on environmental and human health.&lt;ref name="OAS Report"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Insulza|first1=José Miguel|last2=Blackwell|first2=Adam|last3=Simons|first3=Paul|last4=Briones|first4=Alvaro|last5=Cumsille|first5=Francisco|last6=Henao|first6=Adriana|last7=Pardo|first7=Bryce|title=The Drug Problem in the Americas|url=http://www.oas.org/documents/eng/press/Introduction_and_Analytical_Report.pdf|website=OAS.org|publisher=Organization of American States|accessdate=2015-12-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305010437/http://www.oas.org/documents/eng/press/Introduction_and_Analytical_Report.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[balloon effect]]" also operates further up the drug commodity chain in countries where drugs are trafficked rather than cultivated.  Like eradication programs, interdiction pushes traffickers into remote areas where they exacerbate preexisting pressures on forestland.  Traffickers use slash and burn practices to convert forest into arable land for cash crop production for the purposes of money laundering as well as the construction of clandestine roads and airstrips.  The [[War on Drugs|war on drugs]] and prohibitionist policies only serve to aggravate the already detrimental impacts of narco-trafficking on [[Deforestation in Central America|Central American forests]].  Intensified ecological devastation across cultivation and trafficking zones is yet another negative unintended consequence of emphasis on supply-side narcotic reduction borne by poor countries.&lt;ref name="Narco-deforestation"/&gt;

When the cost of drugs increases, drug users are more likely to commit crimes in order to obtain money to buy the expensive drugs.&lt;ref name=Duke1993/&gt; Legalizing drugs would make drugs reasonably cheap.&lt;ref name=Kane1992/&gt;

==Discriminatory==

===Arguments for inconsistent drug laws===
In response to the issue of consistency with regard to drug prohibition and the dangers of alcohol former director of the ONDCP [[John P. Walters]], has said, "It's ludicrous to say we have a great deal of problems from the use of alcohol so we should multiply that with marijuana".&lt;ref name=Stein2002/&gt;

===Arguments against inconsistent drug laws===
Since alcohol [[prohibition]] ended and the [[War on Drugs]] began there has been much debate over the issue of consistency among legislators with regard to drug prohibition. Many anti-prohibition activists focus on the well-documented dangers of alcohol (such as alcoholism, cystisis, domestic violence, brain and liver damage). In addition to [[anecdotal evidence]], they cite statistics to show more deaths caused by drunk driving under the influence of alcohol than by drivers under the influence of marijuana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/drving.htm |title=Impaired Driving |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=2008-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313181132/http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/drving.htm |archivedate=2008-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and research which suggests that alcohol is more harmful than all but the most "dangerous" drugs. When the level of harm associated with the other drugs includes harm that arises solely as a result of the drugs illegality rather than merely that danger which is associated with actually using the drugs, only heroin, cocaine, barbiturates and street methadone were shown to be more harmful than the legal drug alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In February 2009, the UK government was accused by its most senior expert drugs adviser Professor [[David Nutt]] of making political decisions with regard to drug classification, for example in rejecting the scientific advice to downgrade ecstasy from a class A drug. The [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] (ACMD) report on ecstasy, based on a 12-month study of 4,000 academic papers, concluded that it is nowhere near as dangerous as other class A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine, and should be downgraded to class B. The advice was not followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Travis, Alan|date=February 2009|title=Government criticised over refusal to downgrade ecstasy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/feb/11/ecstasy-downgrade-drugs-class|publisher=''The Guardian''|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202142834/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/feb/11/ecstasy-downgrade-drugs-class|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacqui Smith]], then Home Secretary, was also widely criticised by the scientific community for bullying Professor David Nutt into apologising for his comments that, in the course of a normal year, more people died from falling off horses than died from taking ecstasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kmietowicz, Zosia|date=February 2009|title=Home secretary accused of bullying drugs adviser over comments about ecstasy|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/338/feb13_1/b612|publisher=''British Medical Journal''|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215113723/http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/338/feb13_1/b612|archivedate=2009-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Nutt was later sacked by Jacqui Smith's successor as Home Secretary [[Alan Johnson]]; Johnson saying "It is important that the government's messages on drugs are clear and as an advisor you do nothing to undermine public understanding of them.

====Consistency between drugs====
In the United States, defendants convicted of selling crack cocaine receive equal sentences to those convicted of selling 100 times the same amount of powder cocaine. This disparity was lessened during the Obama administration when the [[Fair Sentencing Act 2010]] changed the ratio to 18 to 1. The majority of offenders convicted for selling crack are poor and/or [[black people|black]], while the majority of those convicted for selling cocaine are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindesmith.org/library/factsheets/effectivenes/index.cfm|title=lindesmith.org|author=|date=|website=www.lindesmith.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030101071839/http://www.lindesmith.org/library/factsheets/effectivenes/index.cfm|archivedate=1 January 2003|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Same policy for distinct drugs====
Many drug policies group all illegal drugs into a single category. Since drugs drastically vary in their effects, addictive potential, dosages, methods of production, and consumption the arguments either way could be seen as inconsistent.&lt;ref name="Weil-TheNaturalMind-17" /&gt;

====Race and enforcement of drug laws====
It has been alleged that current drug laws are enforced in such a way as to penalize non-[[white people|whites]] more harshly and more often than whites, and to penalize the poor of all races more harshly and more often than the middle and upper classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/usa/ |title=Punishment and Prejudice: Racial Disparities in the War on Drugs |accessdate=2008-03-09 |author=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=2000-05-01 |work=Report |quote=Ostensibly color blind, the war on drugs has been waged disproportionately against black Americans. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306171009/http://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/usa/ |archivedate=2008-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Treatment of Drug Abuse: Programs, Problems, Prospects &lt;!--|accessdate=2008-03-09--&gt; |last=Glasscote |first=Raymond M. |author2=Sussex, J.N.|author3=Jaffe, J.H.|author4=Ball, J.|author5=Brill, L. |year=1972 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Joint Information Service of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] and the [[Mind (charity)|National Association for Mental Health]] |quote=… as a general rule, we reserve the term drug abuse to apply to the illegal, nonmedical use of a limited number of substances, most of them drugs, which have properties of altering the mental state in ways that are considered by social norms and defined by statute to be inappropriate, undesirable, harmful, threatening, or, at minimum, culture-alien.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, up until 2012, [[crack cocaine]] carried penalties one hundred times more severe than [[cocaine]] despite the fact that these drugs are essentially identical.

==Civil rights==

===Civil rights arguments for prohibitive drug laws===
Article 33 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]] reads:

:''States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislative, administrative, social and educational measures, to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances as defined in the relevant international treaties and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances.''

Drug Free Australia argues:

:''The notion that illicit drug use is a victimless crime and that everyone should be free to do what they want with their body disregards the web of social interactions that constitute human existence. Affected by an individual's illicit drug use are children, parents, grandparents, friends, colleagues, work, victims of drugged drivers, crime victims, [[elder abuse]], sexual victims etc. Illicit drug use is no less victimless than alcoholism.''&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

Drug Free Australia gives the example that in 2007 one in every nine children under the age of 18 in the United States lived with at least one drug dependent or drug abusing parent. 2.1 million children in the United States live with at least one parent who was dependent on or abused illicit drugs.

The [[Christian Institute]] argues that there is no point in having criminal laws unless those caught breaking them will at least face prosecution.  Less serious offenses, such as failing to complete a census form, may also attract a criminal record, so the contention that criminalizing drug use is draconian can be seen as overstatement.&lt;ref name="ChristianInstitute"&gt;The Christian Institute {{cite web |url= http://www.christian.org.uk/html-publications/cannabis.htm |title= Going Soft on Cannabis |accessdate= 2010-04-20 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101227163718/http://www.christian.org.uk/html-publications/cannabis.htm |archivedate= 2010-12-27 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Parental substance dependence and abuse can have profound effects on children, including child abuse and neglect, injuries and deaths related to motor vehicle accidents, and increased odds that the children will become substance dependent or abusers themselves. Up-to-date estimates of the number of children living with substance-dependent or substance-abusing parents are needed for planning both adult treatment and prevention efforts and programs that support and protect affected children."&lt;ref name="oas.samhsa.gov"&gt;US National Survey on Drug Use and Health{{cite web |url=http://www.oas.samhsa.gov/2k9/SAparents/SAparents.htm |title=Children Living with Substance-Dependent or Substance-Abusing Parents: 2002 to 2007 |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504195452/http://oas.samhsa.gov/2k9/SAparents/SAparents.htm |archivedate=2009-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug Free Australia concludes any democratic society that deems the use of a certain drug to present unacceptable harm to the individual user, to present unacceptable harm to the users' surrounding community or to transfer too great a burden to the community will seek legislation which will curb that particular freedom of the individual.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

Sweden's centre-right alliance government [[Moderate Party]] advocates "''Zero tolerance for crime''", arguing:
{{"|Few things restrict people's freedom as much as the consequences of violence, drugs and criminality in society.
|The Swedish [[Moderate Party]] (June 2006). ''[http://www.moderat.se/material/pdffiler/moderat_13605.pdf Zero tolerance for crime]'' – policy summary published prior to the [[Swedish general election, 2006|Swedish general election in 2006]].}}

Many people argue that only drug dealers should be fought and not the drug users themselves.  But this rests on the fundamental error that big-time drugs smugglers and dealers hawk illicit drugs to new consumers.  This is most often not the case.  Rather it is the users themselves that are mostly responsible for recruiting new users through networks of friends or relatives&lt;ref&gt;Australian Institute of Health and Welfare {{cite web |url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/publications/index.cfm/title/10674 |title=2007 National Drug Strategy Household Survey – detailed findings |page=117 |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903150752/http://www.aihw.gov.au/publications/index.cfm/title/10674 |archivedate=2010-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that users need to be targeted as the recruiters of new drug use, and that an emphasis on early rehabilitation for young users is the best answer to curbing widespread dealing. Sweden's mandatory rehabilitation program has resulted in the lowest drug use levels in the developed world.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

The freedom of choice of those addicted to a drug is also questioned, recognizing that addiction is defined as compulsive by its very nature&lt;ref&gt;MedicineNet.com {{cite web|url= http://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm |title=Drug Abuse and Addiction |accessdate=2010-04-20 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100422010245/http://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm| archivedate= 22 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that addictions in and of themselves curb individual freedom. Likewise, the proposal that addictive drugs should be legalized, regulated and opened to "free market dynamics" is immediately belied by the recognition that the drug market for an addict is no longer a free market –  it is clear that they will pay any price when needing their drug.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

===Civil rights arguments for drug law reform===

====Cognitive liberty====
{{Main|Cognitive liberty}}
Authors such as [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Terence McKenna]] believed that what persons do in private should not be regulated by the government. It is argued that persons should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies, including the recreational use of drugs, as long as they do not harm others. Such arguments often cite the [[harm principle]] of philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant.' The argument is that drug use is a [[victimless crime]] and as such the government has no right to prohibit it or punish drug consumers, much like the government does not forbid overeating, which causes significantly more deaths per year. This can be equated with the quest for [[freedom of thought]].

====Spiritual and religious====
{{"|We're playing with half a deck as long as we tolerate that the cardinals of government and science should dictate where human curiosity can legitimately send its attention and where it can not. It's an essentially preposterous situation. It is essentially a civil rights issue, because what we're talking about here is the repression of a religious sensibility. In fact, not ''a'' religious sensibility, ''the'' religious sensibility.|[[Terence McKenna]] in: ''Non-Ordinary States Through Vision Plants'', Sound Photosynthesis, Mill Valley CA., 1988, {{ISBN|1-56964-709-7}}}}

Some religious groups including the ''[[União do Vegetal]]'', the [[Native American Church]], the [[Bwiti]] religion and the [[Rastafari movement]] (see [[religious and spiritual use of cannabis]]) use psychoactive substances as sacrament in religious rituals. In some religious practice, drugs are sometimes used as a conduit to an oceanic feeling or divine union, equated with [[mysticism]] or [[entheogen]]ic ('that which causes God to be within an individual') experiences. In others, the 'entactogenic' qualities of drugs are used to enhance feelings of [[empathy]] among congregations.&lt;ref name="Weil-TheNaturalMind-19"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Natural Mind—An Investigation of Drugs and the Higher Consciousness |last=Weil |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Weil |year=1985 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |pages=19–20 |isbn=0-395-91156-7 |quote=It is my belief that the desire to alter consciousness periodically is an innate, normal drive analogous to hunger or the sexual drive. Note that I do not say 'desire to alter consciousness by means of chemical agents.' Drugs a merely one means of satisfying this drive; there are many others, and I will discuss them in due course. In postulating an inborn drive of this sort, I am not advancing a proposition to be proved or disproved but simply a model to be tried out for usefulness in simplifying our understanding of our observations. The model I propose is consistent with observable evidence. In particular, the omnipresence of the phenomenon argues that we are dealing not with something socially or culturally based but rather with a biological characteristic of the species. Furthermore, the need for periods of nonordinary consciousness begins to be expressed at ages far too young for it to have much to do with social conditioning. Anyone who watches very young children without revealing his presence will find them regularly practicing techniques that induce striking changes in mental states. Three- and four-year-olds, for example, commonly whirl themselves into vertiginous stupors. They hyperventilate and have other children squeeze them around the chest until they faint. They also choke each other to produce loss of consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To my knowledge these practices appear spontaneously among children of all societies, and I suspect they have done so throughout history as well. In our society, children quickly learn to keep this sort of play out of sight of grownups, who instinctively try to stop them. The sight of a child being throttled into unconsciousness scares the parent, but the child seems to have a wonderful time; at least, he goes right off and does it again.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal development and exploration====
Some people believe that altered states of consciousness enable many people to push the boundaries of human experience, knowledge, and creativity. There is thus a moral imperative to experiment with drugs in terms of human progress, teleological development, or just increased artistic creativity; such ideas are central to [[Cognitive Liberty]], [[Terence McKenna#The "Stoned Ape" hypothesis of human evolution|Stoned Ape Hypothesis]] and [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Doors of Perception]]''.&lt;ref name="McKenna-FoodOfTheGods"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food of the Gods: The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge—A Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution |last=McKenna |first=Terence |authorlink=Terence McKenna |year=1993 |publisher=Bantam |isbn=0-553-37130-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lilly-TheCentreOfTheCyclone"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Centre of the Cyclone |last=Lilly |first=John C. |authorlink=John C.

===Moral arguments for drug law reform===
Many people, including some religious groups,&lt;ref&gt;Schabner, Dean. "[http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=91004&amp;page=1 Religious Groups Call Drug War Immoral]". ABC News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Father John Clifton Marquis. (May 1990). "[http://idpi.us/compassion/resources/writings-by-religious-leaders/drug-laws-are-immoral Drug Laws are Immoral]".

''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Richard Brunstrom]], the Chief Constable of North Wales, one of Britain's most senior police officers, said "If policy on drugs is in future to be pragmatic not moralistic, driven by ethics not dogma, then the current prohibitionist stance will have to be swept away as both unworkable and immoral, to be replaced with an evidence-based unified system (specifically including tobacco and alcohol) aimed at minimisation of harms to society."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Jonathan; Langton David (October 2007).

The author and physician [[Andrew Weil]] has commented on the peculiar attitude and emotional bias of some people who think "drug taking is bad", but who nevertheless consume alcohol, and formulate the unhelpful conception "We drink. Therefore alcohol is not a drug."&lt;ref name="Weil-TheNaturalMind-17"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Natural Mind—An Investigation of Drugs and the Higher Consciousness |last=Weil |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Weil |year=1985 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |pages=17–18 |isbn=0-395-91156-7 |quote=The use of drugs to alter consciousness is nothing new. It has been a feature of human life in all places on the earth and all ages of history. In fact, to my knowledge, the only people lacking a traditional intoxicant are the Eskimos, who had the misfortune to be unable to grow anything and had to wait for the white men to bring them alcohol. Alcohol of course, has always been the most commonly used drug simply because it does not take much effort to discover that the consumption of fermented juices produces interesting variations from ordinary consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The ubiquity of drug use is so striking that it must represent a basic human appetite. Yet many Americans seem to feel that the contemporary drug scene is something new, something qualitatively different from what has gone before. This attitude is peculiar because all that is really happening is a change in drug preference. There is no evidence that a greater percentage of Americans are taking drugs, only that younger Americans are coming to prefer illegal drugs like marijuana and hallucinogens to alcohol. Therefore, people who insist that everyone is suddenly taking drugs must not see alcohol in the category of drugs. Evidence that this is precisely the case is abundant, and it proves another example of how emotional biases lead us to formulate unhelpful conceptions. Drug taking is bad. We drink alcohol. Therefore alcohol is not a drug. It is, instead, a 'pick-me-up,' a 'thirst quencher,' a 'social lubricant,' 'an indispensable accompaniment to fine food,' and a variety of other euphemisms. Or, if it is a drug, at least it is not one of those bad drugs that the hippies use.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK drug policy reform group [[Release (agency)|Release]] believe that the stigma attached to drug use needs to be removed. Release's actions have included challenging such stigmatisation with its "Nice People Take Drugs" advertising campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.release.org.uk/nice-people-take-drugs Nice People Take Drugs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327194255/http://www.release.org.uk/nice-people-take-drugs |date=2010-03-27 }}.

===Sending out signals===

====Arguments for sending out signals====
Some argue that sending out signals should be a consideration of drug policy. Previous UK Home Office Minister [[Vernon Coaker]] argued "is not part of any system with respect to drugs ... not only trying to send messages out to people who misuse drugs but also about trying to send messages out to people out there in the community?"&lt;ref name="5thReport"&gt;House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology (2006). [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmsctech/1031/103109.htm#a24 Fifth Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414234018/https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmsctech/1031/103109.htm |date=2018-04-14 }}. UK Parliament.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: "I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers – and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers – that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There's a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it's unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;Batty, David (2008). [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/apr/03/drugspolicy PM keen to reclassify cannabis despite committee advice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313133523/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/apr/03/drugspolicy |date=2016-03-13 }}. ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arguments against sending out signals====
The [[Science and Technology Select Committee]] appointed by the House of Commons to inquire into the Government's handling of scientific advice, risk and evidence in policy making agreed with [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]]'s view that "Criminal law is supposed to prevent crime, not 'send out' public health messages". Transform warned that sending out signals could backfire by "fostering distrust of police and public health messages amongst young people". The Select Committee's report said "The Government's desire to use the Class of a particular drug to send out a signal to potential users or dealers does not sit comfortably with the claim that the primary objective of the classification system is to categorise drugs according to the comparative harm associated with their misuse. It is also incompatible with the Government's stated commitment to evidence based policy making since it has never undertaken research to establish the relationship between the Class of a drug and the signal sent out and there is, therefore, no evidence base on which to draw in making these policy decisions."&lt;ref name="5thReport"/&gt;

===Political calculation===

====Arguments for political calculation====
John Donnelly, writing for the Boston Globe on the presidential race of 2000, suggested that the candidates' silence on drug policy may stem from a widely shared belief that any position even hinting at reducing penalties for drug use would be political suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Drug policy academic [[Mark A.R. Kleiman]] has argued: {{"|There are things we can do about drug policy that would reduce the number of people in prison, and the extent of drug abuse and drug related crime. Legalization isn't one of them because there's not public support for it. And if we acknowledge the fact that, from the point of view of the majority of the population it's a loser, then it's not as if we can talk them out of that, so I think the legalization debate is mostly a distraction from doing the real work of fixing our drug policies|Scott Morgan, quoting Mark Kleiman, [http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle_blog/2008/feb/18/rule_1_of_drug_legalization_is_d Rule #1 of Drug Legalization is Don't Talk About Drug Legalization], Drug Reform Coordination Network, February 2008.}}

Scott Morgan reports how he once attended a discussion of Peter Reuter and David Boyum's book ''An Analytic Assessment of U.S. Drug Policy'', in which the authors admitted ignoring the legalization option in their analysis. Boyum claimed that there was no legitimate political support for ending the drug war and that he and Reuter had therefore confined themselves to recommendations that they thought were politically viable.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Scott.

====Arguments against political calculation====
Two teenagers deaths in March 2010 triggered nationwide concern about the drug [[mephedrone]] in the UK. The [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] (ACMD) recommended a ban on 29 March, which was quickly passed into law, but the decision was criticised for being politically rather than scientifically driven and led to the resignation of the ACMD's Eric Carlin, the eighth member of the council to leave in five months in protest at what was seen as political interference. Toxicology reports released later in May 2010 revealed that the boys had never taken the drug.

Professor [[Colin Blakemore]], professor of neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said: "This shocking news should be a salutary lesson to tabloid journalists and prejudiced politicians who held a gun to the heads of the ACMD and demanded that this drug should be banned before a single autopsy had been completed ... The politicians talk about using drug classification as a way of sending 'messages' to young people. I fear that the only message that will be sent by the hasty decision on mephedrone is that the drug laws deserve no respect."

Professor David Nutt, the former chairman of the ACMD, said: "the previous government's rush to ban mephedrone never had any serious scientific credibility – it looks much more like a decision based on a short-term electoral calculation. This news demonstrates why it's so important to base drug classification on the evidence, not fear, and why the police, media and politicians should only make public pronouncements once the facts are clear."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Laurance, Health Editor, "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/mephedrone-did-not-kill-youths-tests-reveal-1986193.html ''Mephedrone did not kill youths, tests reveal''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212204211/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/mephedrone-did-not-kill-youths-tests-reveal-1986193.html |date=2017-02-12 }}", ''The Independent'' (UK), May 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==

===Public opinion on prohibitive drug laws===
A direct example of societal attitudes driving the [[International Drug Conventions (disambiguation)|International Drug Conventions]] is the 1925 speech by the Egyptian delegate M. El Guindy to the 1925 Geneva Convention forum which prohibited cannabis – largely reproduced in Willoughby, W. W.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} 1928&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the view of those who could not control their use of the licit drug alcohol. The use of illicit drugs has been prohibited internationally since 1912, an entire century, because of international agreement that the general community has a greater right to protect itself from the harms of illicit drug use than does an individual user to use a harmful substance recreationally.

Currently there is still greater public support for the continued prohibiting of illicit drug use than there is for legalizing and regulating the use of these substances. In the United States 82% of those polled by the Family Research Association in 1998 were opposed to the legalization of heroin and cocaine in the same manner as alcohol is legal.&lt;ref name="drugwatch.org"/&gt;  In October 2009 a Gallup poll found that 54% of those polled were against the legalization of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gallup.com/poll/123728/u.s.-support-legalizing-marijuana-reaches-new-high.aspx |title=US Support For Legalizing Marijuana Reaches New High |accessdate=2009-11-08 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091104163117/http://www.gallup.com/poll/123728/U.S.-Support-Legalizing-Marijuana-Reaches-New-High.aspx| archivedate=2009-11-04 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |year=1999 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, which has had the highest levels of illicit drug use in [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (or OECD) countries for more than a decade,&lt;ref&gt;see for example UNODC {{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/WDR-2000.html |title= World Drug Report 2000 |accessdate=2010-05-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100417180244/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/WDR-2000.html| archivedate=2010-04-17 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} 2001 pp 162–165 (see aggregated average for each OECD country in Harm Reduction Discussion page)&lt;/ref&gt; according to a 2007 survey, 95% of Australians do not support the legalization of heroin, cocaine and amphetamines, and 79% do not support the legalization of cannabis.&lt;ref name=AIHW2008&gt;{{cite report

It can be argued that the negative attitudes to illicit drug use which issued in the international drug Conventions, with prohibitions against their use 100 years ago, still exist today. Taking again statistics from Australia, 97% disapprove of the regular use of heroin, 96% disapprove the regular use of amphetamines or cocaine, and 76.5% disapprove of the regular use of cannabis. In any democracy where "the will of the people" is respected by its political representatives, the prohibition of these substance might well be expected to remain intact.&lt;ref name="AIHW2008"/&gt;

===Public opinion on drug law reform===
According to [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]], over the past decade there has been strong shift in public opinion in favour of drug policy reform. This shift has taken place ''despite'' successive government's reluctance to consider or debate the subject, or even call to for an independent inquiry.

A national telephone survey conducted in 1993 found that between 52% and 55% of Australians believed that growing and possessing cannabis for personal use should be legalised.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Russell Newcombe (December 2004). [http://www.tdpf.org.uk/newcombe2004.pdf Attitudes to Drug Policy and Drug Laws; a review of the international evidence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928122416/http://www.tdpf.org.uk/newcombe2004.pdf |date=September 28, 2011 }}. School of Psychology, Faculty of Science Liverpool John Moore's University.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ICM poll of 1201 people for ''The Guardian'' in 1998 found that 47% believed that the illegality of drugs actually encourages young people to try them.

46% of UK adults in a 2002 Guardian poll (of 1075) felt that drug addicts who register themselves as such should have access to certain illegal drugs via prescription.

An ICM poll of 1008 UK adults (aged 16+) for ''The Guardian'' in 2008 found that 38% would support a scheme, similar to that established in Portugal and Spain, whereby it is not a criminal offence to possess and use drugs privately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tdpf.org.uk/MediaNews_FactResearchGuide_public_opinion.htm Public opinion on drugs and drug policy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724002325/http://www.tdpf.org.uk/MediaNews_FactResearchGuide_public_opinion.htm |date=July 24, 2010 }}.

Following [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s win of the 2008 [[presidential election]], [[Change.gov]] hosted a service on their website named the [[Citizen's Briefing Book]] allowing United States citizens to give their opinion on the most important issues in America, and allow others to vote up or down on those ideas. The top ten ideas are to be given to Obama on the day of his inauguration, January 20, 2009. The most popular idea according to respondents was "Ending Marijuana Prohibition", earning 92,970 points and obtaining a total of 3,550 comments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090114023405/http://citizensbriefingbook.change.gov/ideas/viewIdea.apexp?id=087800000004lrP Most popular argument on citizensbriefingbook.change.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;
The second most popular hope, by contrast, was "Commit to becoming the "Greenest" country in the world." with 70,470 points.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090114030238/http://citizensbriefingbook.change.gov/ideas/viewIdea.apexp?id=087800000004muZ Commit to becoming the greenest country in the world, citizensbriefingbook.change.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marijuana has seen a renaissance in its utopian representation in films such as the suburban satire ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' (1999, dir. Sam Mendes) and the stoner comedy ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'' (2008, dir. David Gordon Green). Another venue for contemporary criticism of marijuana prohibition is television, such as the SHOWTIME series ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'' (2005–2012, dev. Jenji Kohan); the HBO series ''[[True Blood (TV series)|True Blood]]'' (2008–2014, dev. Alan Ball); and adult animation shows such as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[American Dad!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braun|first1=James R|last2=Lavoie|first2=Dusty|title=Marijuanatopia?|year=2011|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations|location=ProQuest Dissertations|isbn=978-1-243-67119-6|page=333|url=http://gradworks.umi.com/34/84/3484680.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528083717/http://gradworks.umi.com/34/84/3484680.html|archivedate=2014-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Simon]], creator of the television series ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]'', in 2011 told [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] that he'd "give him another season of the [[HBO]] show for an end to the [[war on drugs]]." Holder had invited show stars [[Wendell Pierce]], [[Sonja Sohn]], and [[Jim True-Frost]] to Washington on behalf of an anti-drug public relations campaign and at the time called on Simon and [[Ed Burns]] for another season or a movie of the show.

The '''Australian Conservatives''' is an Australian [[political party]] formed and led by [[Cory Bernardi]] as a breakaway from the [[Liberal Party of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservatives.org.au/about|title=About|work=conservatives.org.au|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party had been established as a conservative political activist group in July 2016, as response to the results of the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]]. It was formed as a political party after Bernardi's resignation from the Liberals, following disagreements with the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal/National Coalition]], its policies and leadership under [[Malcolm Turnbull]]. The [[Family First Party]] and their two state incumbents [[Dennis Hood]] and [[Robert Brokenshire]] joined and merged with the Australian Conservatives in April 2017. Brokenshire was not re-elected at the [[South Australian state election, 2018|2018 state election]]; Hood left the Conservatives to join the [[Liberal Party of Australia (South Australian Division)|Liberal Party of Australia]] on 26 March 2018.&lt;ref name="Hood"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-26/australian-conservatives-mp-dennis-hood-joins-liberals/9586822 |title=Dennis Hood dumps Cory Bernardi's Australian Conservatives to join SA Liberals |first=Nick |last=Harmsen |newspaper=ABC News |date=26 March 2018 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Activist group===
The Australian Conservatives were established by Senator Bernardi as a conservative [[activism|political activist]] group on 6 July 2016.&lt;ref name="guardian-1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karp|first1=Paul|title=Cory Bernardi establishes rightwing movement Australian Conservatives|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/06/cory-bernardi-establishes-rightwing-movement-australian-conservatives|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=7 February 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207030534/https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/06/cory-bernardi-establishes-rightwing-movement-australian-conservatives|archivedate=7 February 2017|date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was announced by Bernardi on his [[blog|personal blog]] as a conservative "[[Political movement|movement]]" to "help change politics and to give common sense a united voice".&lt;ref name="guardian-1"/&gt; Bernardi cited the results of the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]] as a motivator for the group's establishment, stating that "over 1.7m votes were cast for right-of-centre or conservative parties rather than the Liberals", and that "the clear mission now is to bring people together for the good of the country."&lt;ref name="guardian-1"/&gt;

===Merger with Family First===
On 25 April 2017, it was announced that the [[Family First Party]] would merge with the Australian Conservatives, with its two members of the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] joining the party.&lt;ref name="merger-aus"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Antony|title=The Urge to merge – Family First and the Australian Conservatives |url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2017/04/the-urge-to-merge-family-first-and-the-australian-conservatives.html |accessdate=4 May 2017 |work=ABC |date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newly-appointed Family First senator [[Lucy Gichuhi]] did not join the Conservatives, and became an independent senator when Family First was disbanded.&lt;ref name="merger-abc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bernardi's Australian Conservatives to merge with Family First|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-25/cory-bernardi-australian-conservatices-to-merge-with-family/8471244?smid=abcnews-Twitter_Organic&amp;WT.tsrc=Twitter_Organic&amp;sf73113548=1|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=ABC News|date=25 April 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gichuhi was invited to join the Australian Conservatives' voting bloc in the Senate,&lt;ref name="bloc"/&gt; but ultimately chose to join the Liberal Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/australian-success-story-pm-welcomes-gichuhi-to-liberals|title='Australian success story': PM welcomes Gichuhi to Liberals|work=SBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family First was generally considered to be part of the [[Christian right]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Though it had no formal affiliation with any particular religious organisation, Family First was strongly linked to the [[Pentecostal church]] in South Australia, and nationally with smaller Christian denominations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Family First in South Australia was viewed as an infusion of ex-[[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberals]] via [[Robert Brokenshire]] and [[Bob Day]]. The party advocated a moral and family values agenda, but Day, who would become Family First's major donor, later reoriented Family First to emphasise issues such as industrial relations reform, free speech and smaller government, which brought Family First closer to Bernardi's Conservatives.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

However,according to John Macaulay, an executive of the Australian Conservatives Board, and the dissolution document of Family First, the Party did not merge with the Australian Conservtives. The Family First executive voted to dissolve the party, and in accordance with Australian law, they donated all their assets to the Australian Conservative Party. &lt;ref&gt;Family First Dissolution Document&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2018}}

===Electoral performance===
The party made modest showings at the [[Bennelong by-election, 2017| 2017 Bennelong]] and [[Batman by-election, 2018|2018 Batman]] by-elections, achieving primary vote of 4.29% and 6.41%, respectively, the latter in the absence of [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] candidate, failing to elect a candidate in either instance. In March 2018, the party lost both upper house representatives in the [[South Australian Legislative Council]], with the failure to reelect [[Robert Brokenshire]], and the defection of parliamentary leader [[Dennis Hood]] to the Liberal Party, which nine days prior had won government in the [[South Australian state election, 2018|state election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cory Bernardi lashes out at former colleagues over 'plans to defect to Liberals'|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-28/bernardi-feels-whiteanted-by-former-conservative-colleagues/9598048|accessdate=28 March 2018|work=ABC News|date=28 March 2018|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the election, the Australian Conservatives suffered a −3.2% swing (from a Family First vote of 6.2% in [[South Australian state election, 2014|2014]]) for a lower house primary vote of 3.0%, and a −0.9% swing (from a Family First vote of 4.4% in 2014) for an upper house primary vote of 3.5%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/sa-election-2018/results/ 2018 SA election results: ABC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://results.ecsa.sa.gov.au 2018 SA election results: ECSA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Labor Party split of 1931''' was caused by severe divisions within the [[Australian Labor Party]] over their economic response to the [[Great Depression in Australia]]. Amidst intense disagreement between economically conservative and radical elements of the party, two senior ministers in the [[James Scullin|Scullin]] Labor government, [[Joseph Lyons]] and [[James Fenton (Australian politician)|James Fenton]], resigned from Cabinet in January 1931. Lyons, Fenton and their supporters would subsequently merge with the conservative opposition [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] to form the new [[United Australia Party]], led by Lyons with the last Nationalist leader, [[John Latham (judge)|John Latham]], as his deputy.&lt;ref name="scullinpm"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/scullin/in-office.aspx | title=James Scullin: In office | publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] | work=Australia's Prime Ministers | accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1931, the Labor Party split on the left as well, when [[Eddie Ward]], a supporter of radical anti-austerity [[Premier of New South Wales]] [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], won a by-election, and was refused entry to the Labor caucus, resulting in six Lang supporters forming a [[Lang Labor]] party on the crossbench. In November, the United Australia Party and Lang Labor succeeded in defeating the Scullin government, resulting in the [[Australian federal election, 1931|1931 federal election]] in December. The election resulted in a landslide victory for the United Australia Party and the election of Lyons as [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="scullinpm" /&gt;

While Lang Labor would eventually be largely reabsorbed into the Labor Party, the United Australia Party continued to be the main conservative force in Australia until replaced by the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="scullinpm" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15792">{{Governance}}

Governance is a broader concept than government and also includes the roles played by the community sector and the private sector in managing and planning countries, regions and cities.&lt;ref&gt;Phares, Donald (ed) (2004) ''Metropolitan Governance without Metropolitan Government? As''hgate Publishing, Aldershot UK.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Collaborative Governance''' involves the government, community and private sectors communicating with each other and working together to achieve more than any one sector could achieve on its own. Ansell and Gash (2008) have explored the conditions required for effective collaborative governance. They say “The ultimate goal is to develop a contingency approach of collaboration that can highlight conditions under which collaborative governance will be more or less effective as an approach to policy making and public management” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sites.duke.edu/niou/files/2011/05/Ansell-and-Gash-Collaborative-Governance-in-Theory-and-Practice.pdf|title = 'Collaborative Governance in Theory and Practice' Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 18(4): 543-571|date = 2008|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Ansell, Chris &amp;|first = Alison Gash}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative governance covers both the informal and formal relationships in problem solving and decision-making. Conventional government policy processes can be embedded in wider policy processes by facilitating collaboration between the public, private and community sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Quintin. “A ‘Performative’ Social Movement: The Emergence of Collective Contentions within Collaborative Governance” Space and Polity. 16.2. (2012): 215-232. EBSCO. Web. 14 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative Governance requires three things, namely: support; leadership; and a forum. The support identifies the policy problem to be fixed. The leadership gathers the sectors into a forum. Then, the members of the forum collaborate to develop policies, solutions and answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Collaborative Governance?|url=http://www.policyconsensus.org/publicsolutions/ps_2.html|website=NPCC|publisher=Policy Consensus Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different forms of collaborative governance as such as '''Consensus Building''' and a '''Collaborative Network:'''
* '''Consensus Building''' – "A process where stakeholders build consensus on actions to address specific public policy problems; Community visioning is a process where members of a community build consensus on a descriptions of the community’s desired future and on actions to help make goals for the future a reality."&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Quintin. “A ‘Performative’ Social Movement: The Emergence of Collective Contentions within Collaborative Governance” Space and Polity. 16.2. (2012): 215-232. EBSCO. Web. 14 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Collaborative network|'''Collaborative Network''']] – “This system is meant to accomplish more alignment among community needs, strategies of service agencies, priority outcomes, and resource allocation. It’s also meant to accomplish building social capital; integration of human service delivery; and interconnected strategies for relationship building, learning processes, and measurement and modeling among the participants.” &lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Quintin. “A ‘Performative’ Social Movement: The Emergence of Collective Contentions within Collaborative Governance” Space and Polity. 16.2. (2012): 215-232. EBSCO. Web. 14 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Over the past two decades new collaborative approaches to governing and managing have developed in a range of fields, including: urban and regional planning; public administration and law; natural resource management; and environmental management. '''Collaborative governance''' has emerged as a response to the failures of government policy implementation and to the high cost and politicization of regulation and as an alternative to [[managerialism]] and adversarial approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, C., &amp; Gash, A. (2008). Collaborative Governance in Theory and Practice. Retrieved October 16, 2015, from [http://sites.duke.edu/niou/files/2011/05/Ansell-and-Gash-Collaborative-Governance-in-Theory-and-Practice.pdf http://sites.duke.edu/niou/files/2011/05/Ansell-and-Gash]&lt;/ref&gt; The field of [[public administration]] has changed its focus from [[bureaucracy]] to that of collaboration in the context of the [[network society]]. Public administrators have blurred the lines between the people, the private sector and the government. Although bureaucracies still remain, public administrators have begun to recognize that more can potentially be achieved by collaboration and networking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morse|first1=Ricardo|last2=Stephens|first2=John|title=Teaching Collaborative Governance: Phases, Competencies, and Case-Based Learning|journal=Journal of Public Affairs Education|date=Summer 2012|volume=18|issue=3|page=565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaboration and partnerships are nothing new in the political realm, however the wider use of this leadership style has gained momentum in recent years. In part, this is a response to [[neoliberalism]] with its focus on the primacy of the free-market economy and the private sector.

== Definitions  ==
Ansell and Gash (2008) define collaborative governance as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Collaborative Governance in Theory and Practice|last = Ansell, Chris &amp;|first = Alison Gash|date = 2008|journal = Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=544|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'A governing arrangement where one or more public agencies directly engage non-state stakeholders in a collective decision-making process that is formal, consensus-oriented, and deliberative and that aims to make or implement public policy or manage public programs or assets'.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;This definition involves six criteria:: (1) the forum is initiated by public agencies; (2) participants in the forum include non-state actors; (3) participants engage in decision making and are not merely ‘‘consulted’’; (4) the forum is formally organized; (5) the forum aims to make decisions by consensus; and (6) the focus of collaboration is on public policy or public management.

Emerson, Nabatchi and Balogh (2012) have developed a less normative and less restrictive definition, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = An Integrative Framework for Collaborative Governance|last = Emerson, Kirk, Tina Nabatchi|first = Stephen Balogh|date = 2012|journal = Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–29|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The processes and structures of public policy decision making and management that engage people constructively across the boundaries of public agencies, levels of government, and/or the public, private and civic spheres in order to carry out a public purpose that could not otherwise be accomplished.'.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;This framework definition is a broader analytic concept and does not limit collaborative governance to state-initiated arrangements and to engagement between government and non-government sectors. For example, the definition encompasses collaboration between governments at different levels and hybrid partnerships initiated by the private or community sectors.

== Advantages of Collaborative Governance  ==
The intent of collaborative governance is to improve the overall practice and effectiveness of public administration. The advantages of effective collaborative governance are that it enables a better and shared understanding of complex problems involving many stakeholders and allows these stakeholders to work together and agree on solutions. It can help policy makers identify and target problems and deliver action more effectively. Stakeholders that are involved in developing a solution are more inclined to accept directions given or decisions made. It can thus serve as a way to identify policy solutions that have greater traction in the community. Additionally, it can contribute new perspectives on issues and policy solutions and thus offer new ways to implement strategies for change. For public officials who work in administration and management, collaborative governance can serve as a way of genuinely allowing a wider array of ideas and suggestions in the policy process. It may also be used to test ideas and analyze responses before implementation. For those who are not involved in formal government, it allows them to better understand the inner workings of government and carry more influence in the decision making process. For both public and private sectors, a commitment to collaboration is likely to drive organizational change and affect resource reallocation. Other advantages include combining relevant skills and capacities, as well as allowing specialization. Overall, collaborative governance can lead to mutual learning and shared experiences, while also providing direction for institutional capacity building inside and outside agencies and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Collaborative Governance: A New Era of Public Policy in Australia?|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kUlsWMq6VBEC|publisher = ANU E Press|date = 2008-01-01|isbn = 9781921536410|first = John|last = Wanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages of Collaborative Governance ==
The disadvantages of collaborative governance in relation to complex problems are that the process is time consuming, it may not reach agreement on solutions, and the relevant government agencies may not implement the agreed solutions. In a complex structure with many entities working together, individual roles can become unclear and confusing. Some individuals act largely in a personal capacity, while others may act on behalf of agencies or organizations. Powerful stakeholder groups may seek to manipulate the process. Structural issues also affect agendas and outcomes. Open structures with loose leadership and membership allow multiple participants to gain access to a fast expanding agenda. Achieving goals in such a wide agenda becomes more difficult as an increasing number of players struggle to resolve differences and coordinate actions. Furthermore, challenges arise for implementation when representatives are allowed to come and go with no real obligations to other collaborators. Accountability of participating members, unequal or hidden agendas, trust between members, power imbalances, and language and cultural barriers are all issues that can arise in collaborative government regimes. Critics argue that collaborative governance does not provide the institutional stability and consistency required, and therefore deters progress.&lt;ref&gt;Huxham, C., Vangen, S., Huxham, C., &amp; Eden, C. (2000). ''The Challenge of Collaborative Governance.'' Public Management: An International Journal of Research and Theory, 2:3, 337-358&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Ansell and Gash (2008) and Emerson, Nabatchi and Balogh (2012) seeks to understand these issues and challenges and identify the social and process conditions required for effective collaborative governance.

== Social Applications ==
Collaborative governance has been used to address many complex social, environmental and urban planning issues, including: flood crisis management and urban growth management in Australia; community visioning and planning in New Zealand; and public participation in the redesign of the Ground Zero site in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Power of Co: The Smart Leader's Guide to Collaborative Governance|last = Twyfords|first = |publisher = Twyfords, Wollongong, Australia.|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the USA and countries across much of Western Europe, governments have attempted to shift the focus towards various forms of co-production with other agencies and sectors and with citizens themselves in order to increase civic participation.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Janet; Barnes, Marian; Sullivan, Helen and Knops, Andrew (2004). Public participation and collaborative governance. Journal of Social Policy, 33(2), pp. 203–223.&lt;/ref&gt; The classic forms of hierarchical governance and representative democracy are seen as inefficient when it comes to engaging citizens and making them a part of the decision making process. Large projects and initiatives require involvement and communication with not only citizens but partnerships with other government and non-government agencies and, in some instances, international cooperation with foreign governments and organizations. For example, managing the growing number of official and non-official crossings of the US-Mexico border has required input from all levels of US and Mexican governments, multiple government agencies (like U.S Forest Services and U.S. Border Patrol), land management, and other non-federal agencies for social affairs. All of these parties had to communicate and collaborate to address issues of border security and protecting natural resources. As a result, the U.S.Border Patrol and Forest Service successfully enacted the terms of the 2006 memorandum of understanding, creating inter-agency forums, increasing field coordination and joint operations, and constructing fences and other tactical infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evaluating the Productivity of Collaborative Governance Regimes: A Performance Matrix|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15309576.2015.1031016|journal = Public Performance &amp; Management Review|date = 2015|issn = 1530-9576|pages = 717–747|volume = 38|issue = 4|doi = |first = Kirk|last = Emerson|first2 = Tina|last2 = and Nabatchi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governing and managing large and growing metropolitan urban areas, covering numerous local governments and various levels of State and National governments, provides many governance challenges and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Metropolitan Governance without Metropolitan Government?|last = Phares|first = Donald|publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Aldershot, UK.|year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbott has reviewed metropolitan planning in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia where collaborative governance arrangements, between State and local governments and the regional community, have evolved over a 20-year period leading to positive outputs and outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Collaborative Governance and Metropolitan Planning in South East Queensland - 1990 to 2010: From a voluntary to a Statutory Model|last = Abbott|first = John|publisher = Australian Centre of Excellence for Local Government (ACELG), Sydney|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = http://www.acelg.org.au/news/collaborative-governance-and-metropolitan-planning-south-east-queensland-1990-2010-voluntary}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;''The positive outputs and outcomes of collaborative governance and metropolitan planning in SEQ have been extensive and broad and extend well beyond statutory regional land use planning.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;These include: three endorsed non-statutory regional plans; two endorsed statutory regional plans; an infrastructure program linked to the State budget; regional sectoral plans for transport, water supply, natural resource management, etc.; new legislation and institutional arrangements for metropolitan governance; and capital works such as the SEQ busway network..

The '''Congress of the People (COPE)''' is a South African political party formed in 2008 by former members of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7784763.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=New party to challenge ANC rule|date=16 December 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was founded by former ANC members [[Mosiuoa Lekota]], [[Mbhazima Shilowa]] and [[Mluleki George]] to contest the [[South African general election, 2009|2009 general election]]. The party was announced following a national convention held in [[Sandton]] on 1 November 2008, and was founded at a congress held in [[Bloemfontein]] on 16 December 2008. The name echoes the 1955 [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]] at which the [[Freedom Charter]] was adopted by the ANC and other parties, a name strongly contested by the ANC in a legal move dismissed by the [[Pretoria]] High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=904235|title=Cope wins name battle|work=The Times|location=UK|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221011535/http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=904235|archivedate=21 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 general election, the party received 1,311,027 votes and a 7.42% share of the vote. Following the 2009 elections, COPE experienced a leadership dispute between factions supporting Mosiuoa Lekota and others supporting Mbhazima Shilowa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2011/05/13/infighting-necessary---cope|title='Infighting necessary' - Cope|date=13 May 2011|website=www.sowetanlive.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; that led to a 2013 court battle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/shilowa-row-goes-back-to-court-1598059|title=Shilowa row goes back to court|publisher=IOL News|author=Shanti Aboobaker|date=27 October 2013|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued into 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/politics/2014/01/07/cope-factions-headed-for-court-battle|author=Khulekani Magubane|title=COPE factions headed for court battle|website=www.bdlive.co.za|date=7 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114000244/http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/politics/2014/01/07/cope-factions-headed-for-court-battle|archivedate=14 January 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[South African general election, 2014|2014 election]], COPE was left with only three seats in the National Assembly, down from 30 seats in 2009.&lt;ref name=bdlive&gt;{{cite web|title=Only COPE has lost more seats than ANC|publisher=BDlive|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/politics/2014/05/09/only-cope-has-lost-more-seats-than-anc|date=9 May 2014|accessdate=11 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archivedate=11 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140511030029/http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/politics/2014/05/09/only-cope-has-lost-more-seats-than-anc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its reduced stature, the party has joined with the much larger [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA) and several other smaller parties to co-govern [[Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality|Nelson Mandela Bay]], [[City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality|Johannesburg]] and [[City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality|Tshwane]] after the 2016 municipal elections. 

==History==

===52nd ANC national conference===
{{Main|52nd National Conference of the African National Congress}}
The birth of the party can be traced back to the 52nd ANC national conference held at Polokwane in December 2007. The conference resulted in the election of [[Jacob Zuma]] and his supporters, ahead of [[Thabo Mbeki]] and his supporters, to the ANC's governing body, the [[National Executive Committee]]. Zuma was elected ANC president ahead of Mbeki. The conference highlighted the different factions within the ANC and brought to the fore the diametrically opposed philosophies between Mbeki and Zuma. This included differences in both style and economic policy – the former pursued [[neoliberal]] economic policies and was known for an aloof personality and plotting against his political opponents,&lt;ref name=burn&gt;{{cite news|title=Hundreds burn ANC cards in Paarl|author=Lynnette Johns|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/hundreds-burn-anc-cards-in-paarl-421807|publisher=Independent Online (IOL)|date=26 October 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his successor is more left-wing and populist, and has a closer relationship with the [[South African Communist Party]] and [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Plaut, Martin|accessdate=21 November 2018|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7627882.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Why Mbeki had to go|date=21 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The split also revealed underlying ethnic tensions between [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] speakers, represented by Jacob Zuma and Thabo Mbeki respectively, as they jostled for political predominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Plaut, Martin|accessdate=21 November 2018|title=S Africa's ANC on brink of split|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7695492.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zuma corruption trial and recall of Mbeki===
Jacob Zuma, now elected president of the ANC and ANC candidate for President in the South Africa at the 2009 election, was facing corruption charges in relation to a [[South African Arms Deal|multi-billion rand arms deal]] with French manufacturer [[Thint]]. Zuma had previously been dismissed by Mbeki as South Africa's vice-president at the start of the arms deal trial.

In 2008 a landmark ruling by high court judge [[Christopher Robert Nicholson|Chris Nicholson]] found that the re-charging of Zuma by the [[National Prosecuting Authority]] was illegal and was unduly influenced by Mbeki due to political motives. The case against Zuma was thus dismissed. As a consequence of the judge's findings of political interference, the ANC's National Executive Committee requested the recall of Mbeki as the country's president. Mbeki tendered his resignation on 21 September 2008 and the resignation became official on 25 September. Many members of Mbeki's cabinet resigned their posts at the same time in solidarity, including vice-president [[Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka]] and other senior cabinet ministers.

The recall of Mbeki brought to the fore simmering tensions within the ANC. On 23 September Mosiuoa Lekota announced that he had served the ANC with "divorce papers" and on 8 October announced that a national convention would be held to discuss the future of South African politics and the possible formation of a new political movement.

Lekota's call resounded with many Mbeki supporters who started handing in their resignations to the ANC to join Lekota's movement. Notable resignations include those of former [[Gauteng]] premier [[Mbhazima Shilowa]], former [[Western Cape]] minister of safety and security [[Leonard Ramatlakane]] and [[Mluleki George]]. Across the country many regular ANC members also handed in their resignations in public demonstrations, burning their ANC membership cards.&lt;ref name=burn/&gt; The resignation movement resounded particularly in provinces in which there were already splits in the ANC structure, such as the [[Western Cape]].

===Convention and formation of new party===
The convention called by Lekota was held in [[Sandton]] on 1 November 2008. Planned for 4,000 delegates over two days, the conference eventually hosted over 5,000, with some people not able to get into the venue, and was shortened to one day to avoid inconvenience to those delegates who had nowhere to stay overnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/shikota-convention-oversubscribed-422704|title='Shikota' convention oversubscribed|publisher=IOL News|date=1 November 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The conference was attended by major political figures, including delegates from other political parties. The ANC did not send a delegation to the conference.

Following the conference Lekota announced that a new party would be formed on 16 December. In Western Cape municipal by-elections on 11 December 2008, COPE won 10 of 27 wards (with its candidates running as independents, as it was not yet registered); the ANC won only three wards, with twelve of its candidates disqualified due to missing the registration deadline. The DA won nine seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7777998.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=ANC breakaway scores poll upset|date=11 December 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was formally launched at a three-day conference from 14 to 16 December 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/16/AR2008121600130.html?wprss=rss_world|title=New Party Formally Launched in South Africa|work=The Washington Post}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; at which Lekota was named president.

The president and provincial premiers and mayors (after municipal elections) are subsequently elected by the members of the relevant assembly.

==Reactions==

===Reaction from the ANC and alliance partners===
The ANC leadership reacted by offering a reconciliation meeting between treasurer [[Mathews Phosa]] and Lekota and his former deputy defense minister Mluleki George on 13 October. However, the meeting ended without resolution. On 14 October, Lekota and George were suspended from membership in the ANC by the [[National Executive Committee (African National Congress)|National Executive Committee]], with threats of suspension against any other members who sought to join Lekota and George. Both Zuma and then [[ANC Youth League]] president [[Julius Malema]] ridiculed Lekota for the announcement.&lt;!-- The [[South African Communist Party]] and its Young Communist League also ridiculed Lekota and George, referring to them as "right-wing beasts".&lt;ref&gt;SA National Convention http://www.sanationalconvention.com/27.html&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===Support from within the ANC===
On 15 October, former [[Gauteng]] premier [[Mbhazima Shilowa]], who resigned from his position soon after Mbeki and the cabinet resigned, announced that he had resigned his membership from the ANC and thrown his support behind Lekota's convention, which he announced would be held on 2 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7671292.stm|title=ANC heavyweight joins rebellion|publisher=BBC News|date=15 October 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership between Lekota and Shilowa led the press to nickname the proposed new party "Shikota". Former Western Cape community safety minister [[Leonard Ramatlakane]] resigned from the ANC on 22 October to join Lekota's initiative. On 3 November, former Eastern Cape premier [[Nosimo Balindlela]] announced her resignation from the ANC in order to join the proposed new party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Balindlela-resigns-from-ANC-20081103|title=Balindlela resigns from ANC|publisher=News24|date=3 November 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2008, [[Smuts Ngonyama]], the former head of communications for ANC, joined the breakaway movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7727278.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=S Africa's ANC loses top official|date=13 November 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction from other parties===
[[Helen Zille]] of the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]], [[Bantu Holomisa]] of the [[United Democratic Movement]] and [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] of the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] all welcomed the announcement, saying that a new party in opposition to the ANC would diversify the political landscape and pull South Africa from being an effectively [[dominant-party system]].

==Prominent supporters==
COPE has attracted the support of a wide range of well-known South Africans from various sectors, including Sipho Ngwema, former head of communications for the [[Scorpions (South Africa)|Scorpions]] who is now the party's media liaison chief,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Fiona Forde|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/ex-scorpion-bigwig-joins-cope-info-team-427415|title=Ex-Scorpion bigwig joins COPE info team|publisher=Independent Online|date=1 December 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cleric [[Allan Boesak]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/boesak-joins-cope-429091|title=Boesak joins COPE|publisher=Independent Online|date=16 December 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who ran in the 2009 election as COPE's Western Cape premier candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/boesak-for-western-cape-premier-429173|author=Gaye Davis|author2=Andisiwe Makinana|title=Boesak for Western Cape premier?|publisher=Independent Online|date=17 December 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent supporters include the wife of [[Vusi Pikoli]], the former head of the National Prosecuting Authority, and [[Simon Grindrod]], former deputy president of the [[Independent Democrats]].

[[Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka]], former deputy president under [[Thabo Mbeki]], and [[Saki Macozoma]], a prominent South African billionnaire and close ally of Mbeki, joined COPE in late February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-03-01-phumzile-macozoma-throw-lot-in-with-cope|title=Phumzile, Macozoma defect to Cope|work=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=1 March 2009|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macozoma's affiliation to the party was accidentally leaked by Mbhazima Shilowa himself in London, United Kingdom, in the third week of January 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2009/01/22/SK/13/vryburger22jan.html Onkundige kundiges en kansvatters – Media24 Archive] (in Afrikaans) ''Die Burger''. 22 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Mlambo-Ngcuka who is best known for her statement that South Africa could learn from Zimbabwe with regard to land reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2005-08-10-land-reform-sa-should-learn-from-zimbabwe|title=Land reform: SA should 'learn from Zimbabwe'|work=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=10 August 2005|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy==
In an interview with ''The Sunday Times'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mosiuoa-terror-lekota-threatens-to-topple-the-anc-wmt7ttt3fgz|title=Mosiuoa 'Terror' Lekota threatens to topple the ANC|author=RW Johnson|work=The Sunday Times|location=London|date=19 October 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lekota stated that the ideology of the party will be one that embraces multiracial and multicultural participation in governance, promoting of the free market and disavowed themselves from any connection to [[Marxism]]. He has also indicated that the party would be willing to ally itself with the Democratic Alliance, a historically liberal party, in the case that the DA ever enters government.

According to the party's manifesto flyer,&lt;ref name="party manifesto"&gt;http://www.copewebsite.co.za/documents/cope_manifesto.pdf {{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; COPE's campaign topics for the 2009 elections are maintaining the constitutional status quo, unemployment, job satisfaction, poverty, the environment, secondary and tertiary education, health care in general, crime, women empowerment, youth development, family values, and future [[non-racialism]].

A main distinction between COPE and the ruling ANC party is that COPE favours a system in which top-level government officials are elected directly, by public election, and officials can be removed only by courts of justice, whereas the current situation in South Africa is that top-level government officials are appointed and can be removed from office by the political parties themselves.&lt;ref name="party manifesto"/&gt;

==Controversies==

===Party name===
Before settling on the name ''Congress of the People'' and the abbreviation ''COPE'', several possible names were used or suggested by the party founders themselves and through speculation in the media.

During a public meeting on 12 October 2008 in Langa, where Lekota was the speaker, membership forms for a possible new party, bearing the name ''African National Congress of South Africa (ANCSA)'', were distributed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2008/10/13/KS/5/sslekota.html ANC-afstigters maak stem dik, kry naam, organiseer – Media24 Archive] (in Afrikaans) ''Die Burger'' {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529061959/http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2008/10/13/KS/5/sslekota.html |date=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October 2008, one day prior to the new party's convention in Sandton, the ANC made an urgent application to the high court to prevent the new party from using names such as ''South Africa National Convention'', ''South Africa National Congress'', ''SANC'' or any other name or trademark that is similar to its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stage.dieburger.com/Stories/News/18.0.1035528913.aspx|title=Nasionale konvensie vandag: Dis ANC teen (S)ANC|work=Die Burger|author=Verslagspan Pretoria|language=Afrikaans|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge ruled that the convention may go ahead, but did make a ruling on the names issue until 6 November.&lt;ref name="nov-15-2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jv.dieburger.com//Stories/Opinion/18.0.1077588798.aspx|title=As partye naam wil maak|work=Die Burger|author=Carien du Plessis|language=Afrikaans|date=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the new party's Sandton convention, the name ''South African Democratic Congress (SADC)'' was also proposed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2008/11/04/KS/6/SSshikota.html Party soek nog naam – Media24 Archive] ''Die Burger'' (in Afrikaans){{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529062006/http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2008/11/04/KS/6/SSshikota.html|date=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was later discovered by them that this was already being used by [[South African Democratic Congress|another party]] that was due to contest the 2009 election.&lt;ref name=nameproblems&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/name-problems-for-shikota-422832|title=Name problems for Shikota|publisher=Independent Online|date=3 November 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 15 November, the name ''Congress of the People'' was chosen,&lt;ref name="nov-15-2008"/&gt; and its official abbreviation was chosen to be ''COPE'', not ''COP''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jv.dieburger.com//Stories/News/18.0.1067100773.aspx|title=Nuwe party kan nog struikel op pad na registrasie|author=Pieter du Toit|work=Die Burger|language=Afrikaans|date=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the name settled on was the ''Congress of the People'', the ANC announced they would challenge this name as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ANC takes issue with COP over name|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2008-11-11-anc-takes-issue-with-cop-over-name|work=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=11 November 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ANC's application to the Pretoria Provincial Division of the High Court for an interdict to prevent COPE from using the name Congress of the People, cited that the ANC itself was affiliated to the [[Congress of the People (1955)|1955 Congress of the People]], held in [[Kliptown]]. On 12 December 2008, the court ruled that COPE would not be barred from using its present name.

===Allan Boesak===
The elevation of Boesak to the COPE leadership, given his record as a convicted malefactor, drew considerable censure from press and public alike. It was intimated that the party's self-projection as a morally pure alternative had been sullied. On 5 February 2009, on his [[Facebook]] page, Lekota urged supporters:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We should also not be distracted now by who serves in the interim leadership, because ultimately the people's voice will be heard. They will vote for their leaders, and everyone else will apply for a job and be interviewed to obtain any position. So, you see, I am not bothered by who joins COPE, or if the individual has a criminal record, or not. Is it not so, that if a gangster goes to church, he expects to dance to [[gospel music]], not [[kwaito]]? He's fully aware of what music determines the song and dance in church. No-one is forced to join COPE – people join voluntarily, fully aware of what the organisation stands for. So, why worry about who joins? Let them; they'll dance to our music!&lt;ref&gt;Lekota, Mosiuoa. "[http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=39661395138&amp;topic=6331&amp;ref=mf What does COPE need to do, to win the coming elections?]", [[Facebook]]. 5 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Britain in the era 1680–1740, especially in the days of [[Robert Walpole]] (1720s to 1740s), the '''country Party''' was a coalition of [[Tories]] and disaffected [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]]. It was a movement rather than an organised party and had no formal structure or leaders. It claimed to be a nonpartisan force fighting for the nation's interest—the whole "country"—against the self-interested actions of the '''court party''', that is the politicians in power in London. Country men believed the court party was corrupting Britain by using [[patronage]] to buy support and was threatening English and Scottish liberties and the proper balance of authority by shifting power from Parliament to the prime minister. It sought to constrain the court by opposing standing armies, calling for annual elections to Parliament (instead of the seven-year term in effect), and wanted to fix power in the hands of the [[landed gentry]] rather than the royal officials, urban merchants or bankers. It opposed any practices it saw as corruption.

The Country Party attracted a number of influential writers (such as [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Samuel Johnson]], and [[Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun]]) and political theorists.  The ideology of the party faded away in England but became a powerful force in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]], where its tracts strongly motivated the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] to oppose what the country party had cast as British monarchical tyranny and to develop a powerful political philosophy of [[republicanism in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;See Bernard Bailyn, ''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1967); Gordon S. Wood, ''The Creation of the American Republic'' (1969); and J.G.A. Pocock, ''The Machiavellian Moment: Florentine  Political Thought and the Atlantic Republican Tradition'' (1975). &lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the name "country party" was used by what became the Whig Party itself in its initial stages, when headed by the [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]] during the [[Exclusion Crisis]] of 1679-1681. Then, the term "[[Whiggamore Raid|whiggamor]]", shortened to "Whig", started being applied to the party - first as a pejorative term, then adopted and taken up by the party itself. The name "country party" was thus discarded - to be taken up later by opponents of the Whig Party itself, once it had come to dominate British politics following the [[Glorious Revolution]]. 

==Country persuasion==
{{See also|Patriot Whigs|The Craftsman (newspaper)}}
The historian Hoppit has interpreted that around 1700 instead of a country "party", the English electorate, its Lords and its elected representatives had a country persuasion with key consensus demands that the government should be frugal and efficient, opposition to high taxes, a concern for personal liberty, a quest for more frequent elections, a faith that the local militia would substitute for a dangerous standing army, a desire for such moral reforms as temperance in an age of drunkenness, and less Sabbath breaking. The country leaders stressed the civic duty of the upper class to engage in politics to strengthen the national interest.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2000) p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;  Such views amount to the main counter to extreme [[High Tory]] [[hegemony]] and the similar [[wikt:bigwig|bigwig]] [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]] [[Cabal ministry|cabal]] which in its estimation morphed via other executives into the [[Robert Walpole|Walpole executive]] [[wikt:placeman|placemen]].

==Bolingbroke==
[[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]] was especially influential in stating the need and outlining the machinery of a systematic [[parliamentary opposition]]. Such an opposition he called a "country party" which he opposed to the court party. Country parties had been formed before, for instance after the king's speech to Parliament in November 1685, but Bolingbroke was the first to state the need for a continual opposition to the government. To his mind the spirit of liberty was threatened by the court party's lust for power.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Robbins, "'Discordant Parties": A Study of the Acceptance of Party by Englishmen,'" ''Political Science Quarterly'' Vol. 73, No. 4 (Dec. 1958), pp. 505–529 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2146028 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberty could only be safeguarded by an opposition party that used "constitutional methods and a legal course of opposition to the excesses of legal and ministerial power…".&lt;ref&gt;Bolingbroke, ''On the Idea of a Patriot King'' p.&amp;nbsp;117&lt;/ref&gt; He instructed the opposition party to "Wrest the power of government, if you can, out of the hands that employed it weakly and wickedly"&lt;ref&gt;Bolingbroke, ''On the Spirit of Patriotism'' p.&amp;nbsp;42&lt;/ref&gt; This work could be done only by a homogeneous party "…because such a party alone will submit to a drudgery of this kind".&lt;ref&gt;Bolingbroke, ''On the idea of a Patriot King'' p.&amp;nbsp;170&lt;/ref&gt; It did not suffice to be eager to speak, keen to act. "They who affect to head an opposition, …, must be equal, at least, to those whom they oppose…".&lt;ref&gt;Bolingbroke, ''On the Spirit of Patriotism'' p.&amp;nbsp;58&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition had to be of a permanent nature to make sure that it would be looked at as a part of daily politics. It had to contrast, on every occasion, the government.&lt;ref&gt;Bolingbroke, ''On the Spirit of Patriotism'' p.&amp;nbsp;61&lt;/ref&gt; He considered a party that systematically opposed the government to be more appealing than a party that occasionally opposed the government. This opposition had to prepare itself to control government.&lt;ref&gt;Bolingbroke, ''On the Spirit of Patriotism'' pp.&amp;nbsp;61–3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Americans==
The writings of the country party were eagerly devoured by some American colonists who came to fear the corruption of the English court as the greatest threat to the colonies’ desired liberties. They formed a [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot cause]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and used the country party ideas to help form [[Republicanism in the United States]]. Hutson identified country ideology as a major influence on the [[Antifederalists]] during the debate over the [[ratification of the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hutson |first1=James H. |title=Country, Court, and Constitution: Antifederalism and the Historians |journal=The William and Mary Quarterly |date=July 1981 |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=337–368 |jstor=1921952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonianism]] inherited the country party attack on elitism, centralization, and distant government during the ascent of [[Alexander Hamilton]] and other [[Federalists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilson |first1=Clyde |title=American Populism and the Power of the State |url=http://www.theimaginativeconservative.org/2017/02/american-populism-power-state-clyde-wilson.html |website=theimaginativeconservative.org |publisher=The Imaginative Conservative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Criminalization of politics"''' is a political [[buzzword]] in the [[United States]] used in the media, by commentators, bloggers as well as by defenders of high-ranking government officials who have been indicted or have faced criminal or ethical investigations.

Most recently, the term has been applied to proceedings against [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s advisers and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] leadership in [[United States Congress|Congress]], including [[Tom DeLay]], [[Bill Frist]], and [[Karl Rove]] (see [[Plame affair]]). The position of their defenders, who include [[Robert Novak]], [[William Kristol]] and [[Rush Limbaugh]], is that the accusations against these officials lack substance and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] partisans seek to weaken them for political reasons, perhaps to the point of retaking Congress in 2006.

The position of many Democrats is that the cause of the plethora of investigations is the "[[2006 Republican party scandals|culture of corruption]]" established by the Republicans in power, and that anyone who has broken laws or rules must face the consequences. The opponents also point out that some of the politicians denouncing the current pursuit of alleged Republican misconduct have in the past called for vigorous pursuit of alleged Democratic misconduct.

The phrase was previously used by supporters of President [[Bill Clinton]] in reference to legal action against members of his administration, including [[Henry Cisneros]]. During the [[Watergate scandal]], supporters of [[Richard Nixon]] claimed that he was guilty of nothing more than "hard-ball politics."

The term '''culture war''' or '''culture conflict''' has different meanings depending on the time and place where it is used, as it relates to conflicts relevant to a specific area and era.
Originally, it refers to the conflict between [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]], [[Classical Liberalism|classical liberal]], or [[conservative]] values and [[social democratic]], [[Progressivism|progressive]] or [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] values in the [[Western world]], as well as other countries.  Culture wars have influenced the debate over history, science and other curricula in all societies around the world.

It has come to signify different matters in modern United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, and generally, all over the world.

==Origins==
[[File:Kladderadatsch 1875 - Zwischen Berlin und Rom.png|thumb|200px|Bismarck (left) and the Pope, from the German satirical magazine ''[[Kladderadatsch]]'', 1875]]
The phrase "culture war" represents a loan translation ([[calque]]) from the German ''[[Kulturkampf]]''. The German word ''Kulturkampf'' (culture struggle) refers to the clash between cultural and religious groups in the campaign from 1871 to 1878 under [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] of the [[German Empire]] against the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Kulturkampf |encyclopedia=[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]] |year=1910 |publisher=[[Robert Appleton Company]] |location=New York |volume=8 |accessdate=March 27, 2015 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08703b.htm |last=Spahn |first=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{further information|Ethnocultural politics in the United States}}

The expression "culture war" entered the vocabulary of United States politics with the publication of ''[[Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America]]'' by [[James Davison Hunter]] in 1991. Hunter perceived a dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed [[politics of the United States|United States politics]] and [[culture of the United States|culture]], including the issues of [[abortion]], [[Gun law in the United States|federal]] and [[Gun laws in the United States by state|state gun laws]], [[global warming]], [[immigration]], [[separation of church and state]], [[Privacy laws of the United States|privacy]], [[recreational drug use]], [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]], and [[censorship]].

In American usage the term "culture war" may imply a conflict between those values considered [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or [[Conservativism in the United States|conservative]] and those considered [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] or [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. It originated in the 1920s when urban and rural American values came into clear conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assumption.edu/users/McClymer/his394/ |title=Seminar on the Culture Wars of the 1920s |date=Fall 2001 |accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This followed several decades of immigration to the States by people who earlier European immigrants considered "alien". It was also a result of the cultural shifts and modernizing trends of the [[Roaring 20s]], culminating in the presidential campaign of [[Al Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/03/reclaiming_faith_and_politics.html |title= Culture Wars: How 2004 |last=Dionne |first=E. J. |authorlink=E. J. Dionne}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1928. However, [[James Davison Hunter]]'s 1991 book ''Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America'' redefined the "culture war" in the United States of America.  Hunter traces the concept to the 1960s.&lt;ref name=CultStrat&gt;{{cite book |last=Holt |first=Douglas |last2= Cameron |first2=Douglas |year=2010 |title= Cultural Strategy |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 978-0-19-958740-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived focus of the American culture war and its definition have taken various forms since then.&lt;ref name="Andrew Hartman 2015"&gt;Andrew Hartman, ''A War for the Soul of America: A History of the Culture Wars'' (University of Chicago Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
[[James Davison Hunter]], a [[sociologist]] at the [[University of Virginia]], introduced the expression again in his 1991 publication, ''Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America''. Hunter described what he saw as a dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed [[politics of the United States|American politics]] and [[American culture|culture]].

He argued that on an increasing number of "hot-button" defining issues—[[abortion]], [[gun politics]], [[separation of church and state]], [[privacy]], [[recreational drug use]], [[homosexuality]], [[censorship]]—there existed two definable polarities. Furthermore, not only were there a number of divisive issues, but society had divided along essentially the same lines on these issues, so as to constitute two warring groups, defined primarily not by nominal religion, ethnicity, social class, or even political affiliation, but rather by ideological [[world-view]]s.

Hunter characterized this polarity as stemming from opposite impulses, toward what he referred to as ''Progressivism'' and as ''Orthodoxy''. Others have adopted the dichotomy with varying labels. For example, [[Fox News]] commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] emphasizes differences between "Secular-Progressives" and "Traditionalists".

[[File:Patrickjbuchanan.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Patrick Buchanan in 2008]]

In 1990, commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] mounted a campaign for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for President against incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]] in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]]. He received a prime-time speech-slot at the [[1992 Republican National Convention]], to give his speech on the culture war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Not since Pat Buchanan's famous 'culture war' speech in 1992 has a major speaker at a national political convention spoken so hatefully, at such length, about the opposition. |title=Dogs of War |url=http://www.newdonkey.com/2004/09/dogs-of-war.html |deadurl=yes |publisher=New Donkey |date=September 2, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308043424/http://www.newdonkey.com/2004/09/dogs-of-war.html |archivedate=March 8, 2005 |accessdate=August 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued: "There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the Cold War itself."&lt;ref name="1992-GOP"&gt;{{Cite speech |authorlink=Patrick Buchanan |first=Patrick |last=Buchanan |title=1992 Republican National Convention Speech |date=August 17, 1992 |url=http://buchanan.org/blog/1992-republican-national-convention-speech-148 |accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to criticizing environmentalists and feminism, he portrayed [[public morality]] as a [[defining issue]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The agenda [Bill] Clinton and [Hillary] Clinton would impose on America—abortion on demand, a [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] for the Supreme Court, homosexual rights, discrimination against religious schools, women in combat units—that's change, all right. But it is not the kind of change America wants. It is not the kind of change America needs. And it is not the kind of change we can tolerate in a nation that we still call God's country.&lt;ref name="1992-GOP" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A month later, Buchanan characterized the conflict as about power over society's definition of right and wrong. He named abortion, sexual orientation and popular culture as major fronts—and mentioned other controversies, including clashes over the [[Confederate flag]], Christmas and taxpayer-funded art. He also said that the negative attention his "culture war" speech received was itself evidence of America's polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buchanan.org/blog/the-cultural-war-for-the-soul-of-america-149 |title=The Cultural War for the Soul of America |last=Buchanan |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Buchanan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture war had significant impact on national politics in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Andrew Hartman 2015" /&gt; The rhetoric of the [[Christian Coalition of America]] may have weakened president George H. W. Bush's chances for reelection in 1992 and helped his successor, [[Bill Clinton]], win reelection in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Roger |title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices |year=2010 |publisher=M.

The culture wars influenced the debate over state-school history curricula in the United States in the 1990s. In particular, debates over the development of national educational standards in 1994 revolved around whether the study of American history should be a "celebratory" or "critical" undertaking and involved such prominent public figures as [[Lynne Cheney]], [[Rush Limbaugh]], and historian [[Gary Nash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{google book |title=Who Owns History: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World |last=Foner |first=Eric |id=H3I-Z8KW5REC |location=New York |publisher=Hill &amp; Wang |year=2002 |isbn=1-4299-2392-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{google book |title=History on Trial: Culture Wars and the Teaching of the Past |last1=Nash |first1=Gary B. |authorlink1=Gary B.

[[File:Bush War Budget 2003-crop.jpg|thumb|[[George W. Bush]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and [[Paul Wolfowitz]] were prominent neo-conservatives of the 2000s.]]
A worldview called [[neo-conservatism]] shifted the terms of the debate in the early 2000s.  Neo-conservatives differed from their opponents in that they interpreted problems facing the nation as moral issues rather than economic or political issues.  For example, the decline of the traditional family structure was seen as a spiritual crisis by neo-conservatives that required a spiritual response.  Critics accused neo-conservatives of [[Correlation does not imply causation|confusing cause and effect]].&lt;ref&gt; Zafirovski, Milan.

Interpretations of Aboriginal history became part of the wider political debate sometimes called the "[[History wars#History wars and culture wars|culture wars]]" during the tenure of the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] government from 1996–2007, with the [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[John Howard]] publicly championing the views of some of those associated with ''Quadrant''.&lt;ref name="Manne11/08"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2008/november/1277253191/robert-manne/what-rudd-s-agenda |last=Manne |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Manne |title=What is Rudd’s Agenda? |work=[[The Monthly]] |date=November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate extended into [[#National Museum of Australia controversy|a controversy]] over the way history was presented in the [[National Museum of Australia]] and in high school history curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rundle |first=Guy |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2007/06/28/1915-and-all-that-history-in-a-holding-pattern/ |title=1915 and all that: History in a holding pattern |work=Crikey |date=June 28, 2007 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ferrari |first=Justine&lt;!--Education writer--&gt; |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24492542-13881,00.html |title=History curriculum author defies his critics to find bias |work=The Australian |date=October 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also migrated into the general Australian media, with regular opinion pieces being published in major broadsheets such as ''[[The Australian]]'', ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]''. [[Marcia Langton]] has referred to much of this wider debate as 'war porn'&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard J. War porn. ''Journal of Visual Culture'', Vol. 5, No. 1, 86-88 (2006) {{doi|10.1177/147041290600500107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an 'intellectual dead end'.&lt;ref name=Langton&gt;Langton M. Essay: Trapped in the aboriginal reality show. ''Griffith Review 2007'', 19:Re-imagining Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Australian Prime Ministers, Paul Keating and John Howard, were major participants in the "wars". According to the analysis for the Australian Parliamentary Library of Mark McKenna,&lt;ref name=McKenna&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/RP9798/98RP05 |title=Different Perspectives on Black Armband History |author=Mark McKenna |series=Parliamentary Library: Research Paper 5 1997-98 |publisher=The Parliament of Australia |date=November 10, 1997 |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Keating]] (1991–1996) was believed by John Howard (1996–2007) to portray Australia pre-[[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] in an unduly negative light; while Keating sought to distance the modern [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] movement from its historical support for the monarchy and the [[White Australia policy]] by arguing that it was the conservative Australian parties who had been barriers to national progress and excessively loyal to the British Empire. He accused Britain of having abandoned Australia during World War II. Keating was a staunch advocate of a symbolic apology to indigenous people for the misdeeds of past governments, and outlined his view of the origins and potential solutions to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage in his [[Redfern Park Speech]] (drafted with the assistance of historian [[Don Watson]]). In 1999, following the release of the 1998 ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' Report, Howard passed a Parliamentary [[Motion of Reconciliation]] describing treatment of Aborigines as the "most blemished chapter" in Australian history, but he did not make a Parliamentary apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |title=The History of Apologies Down Under &amp;#124; Thinking Faith |publisher=thinkingfaith.org |date=February 21, 2008 |accessdate=March 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202000730/http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |archivedate=December 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard argued that an apology was inappropriate as it would imply "intergeneration guilt" and said that "practical" measures were a better response to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage. Keating has argued for the eradication of remaining symbols linked to British origins: including deference for [[ANZAC Day]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smh.com.au/national/a-nation-reborn-at-anzac-cove-utter-nonsense-keating-20081030-5enw.html&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Australian flag]] and the [[monarchy in Australia]], while Howard was a supporter of these institutions. Unlike fellow Labor leaders and contemporaries, [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Kim Beazley]], Keating never traveled to [[Gallipoli]] for ANZAC Day ceremonies. In 2008 he described those who gathered there as "misguided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/a-nation-reborn-at-anzac-cove-utter-nonsense-keating-20081030-5enw.html |title=A nation reborn at Anzac Cove? Utter nonsense: Keating |work=The Age |date=October 31, 2008 |accessdate=March 5, 2010 |location=Melbourne |first=Tony |last=Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, John Howard said in a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of ''Quadrant'' that "Political Correctness" was dead in Australia but: "we should not underestimate the degree to which the soft-left still holds sway, even dominance, especially in Australia's universities"; and in 2006, ''Sydney Morning Herald'' political editor [[Peter Hartcher]] reported that Opposition foreign affairs spokesman [[Kevin Rudd]] was entering the philosophical debate by arguing in response that "John Howard, is guilty of perpetrating 'a fraud' in his so-called culture wars... designed not to make real change but to mask the damage inflicted by the Government's economic policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pms-culture-wars-a-fraud-rudd/2006/10/27/1161749320974.html |title=PM's culture wars a fraud: Rudd - National |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=October 28, 2006 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the Howard government in the Australian Federal election of 2007, and its replacement by the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Labor government]], altered the dynamic of the debate. Rudd made an official apology to the ''[[Stolen Generation]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/12/australia.text/index.html |title=Full text of Australia's apology to Aborigines |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=February 12, 2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with bi-partisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/brendan-nelsons-sorry-speech/2008/02/13/1202760366050.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |title=Brendan Nelson's sorry speech |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=February 13, 2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Keating, Rudd supported an Australian republic, but in contrast to Keating, Rudd declared support for the [[Australian flag]] and supported the commemoration of ANZAC Day and expressed admiration for Liberal Party founder [[Robert Menzies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/keating-utterly-wrong-on-gallipoli-pm/story-0-1111117908459 |title=Paul Keating 'utterly wrong' to reject Gallipoli identity, says Kevin Rudd |date=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/is-rudd-having-a-bob-each-way/2007/04/12/1175971263000.html |title=Is Rudd having a Bob each way? - Opinion |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=October 28, 2004 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the change of government, and the passage, with support from all parties, of a Parliamentary apology to indigenous Australians, Professor of Australian Studies Richard Nile has argued: "the culture and history wars are over and with them should also go the adversarial nature of intellectual debate",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/richardnile/index.php/theaustralian/comments/end_of_the_culture_wars |title=End of the culture wars &amp;#124; Richard Nile Blog, ''The Australian'' |publisher=blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au |date=November 28, 2007 |accessdate=April 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309215605/http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/richardnile/index.php/theaustralian/comments/end_of_the_culture_wars/ |archivedate=March 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a view contested by others, including conservative commentator [[Janet Albrechtsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/orwellian-left-quick-to-unveil-totalitarian-heart/story-e6frg6n6-1111115088194 |title=Orwellian Left quick to unveil totalitarian heart |work=The Australian |date=December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intention to reengage in the history wars has been indicated by the Federal Opposition's [[Christopher Pyne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?&amp;docID=SMH130427114V71OBPNC Julia Baird, (April 27, 2013), Don't dismiss nation's blemishes ''Sydney Morning Herald'', Sydney, p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2397">'''Cymru Annibynnol, the Independent Wales Party''' is a small [[political party]] operating in [[Wales]].  They were formed as a splinter from [[Plaid Cymru]] in January 2000, when that party's leader [[Ieuan Wyn Jones]] distanced Plaid from supporting [[Welsh independence]].

Cymru Annibynnol are an expressly [[republicanism|republican]] organisation seeking full independence for Wales from the [[United Kingdom]].  They contested various seats in the [[Welsh Assembly]] elections of 2003.  The party describes their aims and methods as being:

: ''People voluntarily organising and pursuing their aims by peaceful political activity freely associating together according to the provisions of the Party's Constitution. The party is non-[[sectarian]] and inclusive of all people who consider themselves Welsh.''

: ''Our aim is to secure full Independence for Wales as a democratic and sovereign state ensuring economic prosperity and social harmony for the people of Wales and safeguarding our common Welsh [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], [[Welsh language|language]], culture and identity.''

Broadly they are like Plaid Cymru: a left-leaning party that favours independence as a means to combatting what they perceive as the negative effects of [[globalisation]], also favouring [[redistribution (economics)|wealth redistributive measures]].

They have stated that they do not intend to contest elections to the [[British House of Commons]] and will instead contest only local elections, and those to the Welsh Assembly.  They contested the [[Welsh Assembly Election, 2003|2003 Assembly elections]] but did not poll highly.  They have thus far to make much impact politically.

Cymru Annibynnol changed its name in 2004 when it became [[Cymru Rydd]] - Welsh Republicans. Its tag line is "Fe godwn ni eto! We shall rise again"

The '''Dark Enlightenment''', or the '''neoreactionary movement'''—also known simply as '''neoreaction''' and abbreviated '''NRx''' by its proponents—is an [[Anti-democratic thought|anti-democratic]] and [[reactionary]] movement that considers itself to be the antithesis to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. It broadly rejects [[egalitarianism]] and the view that history shows inevitable progression towards greater liberty and enlightenment, thus it is in part a reaction against "[[Whig history|Whig historiography]]".&lt;ref name="TB"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pein|first=Corey|date=19 May 2014|title=Mouthbreathing Machiavellis Dream of a Silicon Reich|url=http://thebaffler.com/blog/mouthbreathing-machiavellis|newspaper=The Baffler|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209130630/http://thebaffler.com/blog/mouthbreathing-machiavellis|archivedate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TDT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bartlett|first=Jamie|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/jamiebartlett/100012093/meet-the-dark-enlightenment-sophisticated-neo-fascism-thats-spreading-fast-on-the-net/|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Meet The Dark Enlightenment: sophisticated neo-fascism that's spreading fast on the net|date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement favors a return to older [[Social constructionism|societal constructs]] and forms of government, including support for [[monarchism]] and other forms of leadership such as a "neo[[Cameralism|cameralist]] CEO"&lt;ref name=behind&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/behind-the-internets-dark-anti-democracy-movement/516243/|title=Behind the Internet's Anti-Democracy Movement|date=10 February 2017|website=The Atlantic|last=Gray|first=Rosie}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock]] republic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448230/problems-mencius-moldbug-neoreaction|title=Against Mencius Moldbug's 'Neoreaction'|author=Steorts, Jason Lee|date=5 June 2017|publisher=National Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; coupled with a [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]], [[Conservatism|conservative]] or [[Economic nationalism|economic nationalist]] approach to economics.&lt;ref name="AS"&gt;{{cite web|first=Matthew|last=Walther|url=http://spectator.org/blog/57516/dark-enlightenment-silly-not-scary|title=The Dark Enlightenment Is Silly Not Scary|website=[[The American Spectator]]|date=23 January 2014|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents generally also espouse [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] views on such matters as [[gender role]]s, [[Sociology of race and ethnic relations|race relations]] and [[Human migration|migration]].

Some of the impetus for the neoreactionary movement comes from libertarians like [[Peter Thiel]] as indicated by [[Nick Land]]'s essay "The Dark Enlightenment", which noted how libertarian thinkers at an April 2009 ''[[Cato Unbound]]'' discussion expressed skepticism about the compatibility of freedom and democracy.&lt;ref name="land-tde"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedarkenlightenment.com/the-dark-enlightenment-by-nick-land/|title=The Dark Enlightenment|author=Land, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yarvin's preferred system—named '''neocameralism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; after [[Frederick William I of Prussia]]'s system of [[Prussian cameralism]]&lt;ref name="unhappy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/journal/81/125815/on-the-unhappy-consciousness-of-neoreactionaries/|title=On the Unhappy Consciousness of Neoreactionaries|author=Hui, Yuk|date=April 2017|publisher=e-flux}}&lt;/ref&gt;—is a system in which a business owns the country,&lt;ref name="behind"/&gt; which is structured as a joint stock corporation divvied up into shares and run by a CEO to maximize profit.&lt;ref name="bears"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leapleapleap.com/2015/06/bears-will-never-steal-your-car-reacting-to-the-neoreactionaries/|title=Bears Will Never Steal Your Car|author=Goodman, Matthew Shen|date=9 June 2015|publisher=Leap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Thiel and [[Patri Friedman]] have backed the [[Seasteading Institute]] as one possible way of building fiefdoms free of outside regulation and law.&lt;ref name="TB"/&gt;

Neoreactionary Michael Perilloux proposes that President [[Donald Trump]] seize more power by canceling the [[United States Constitution]], declaring [[martial law]] and replacing the government with [[The Trump Organization]].&lt;ref name="warmed"/&gt; Similarly, Google engineer [[Justine Tunney]] [[Justine Tunney#Petition to install a .22CEO of America.22|circulated a petition]] to appoint Google chairman [[Eric Schmidt]] as CEO of America.&lt;ref name="TB" /&gt;

Some neoreactionary futurists focus more on the use of technology to defeat the state, for example, through transhumanist [[accelerationism]] in which the select few free themselves from the bonds of the state by evolving into superintelligent human-computer hybrids.&lt;ref name="terrifying" /&gt; One proponent of such ideas is Michael Anissimov, an advocate of [[eugenics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Specter of Eugenics: IQ, White Supremacy, and Human Enhancement|author=Abbott, Benjamin|date=5 June 2013|publisher=Ethical Technology|url=https://ieet.org/index.php/IEET2/more/abbott20130605}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in the words of Mark O'Connell "has in recent years basically cornered the [[white supremacy|white-supremacy]]–[[technological singularity|singularity]] crossover market" and become "something of a pariah from the transhumanist movement". Rejecting the notion that all humans are created equal, Anissimov believes that there are already [[race and intelligence|disparities in intelligence between existing races]] and that transhuman technologies will create further disparities in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/04/the-techno-libertarians-praying-for-dystopia.html|title=The Techno-Libertarians Praying for Dystopia|author=O'Connell, Mark|publisher=New York Magazine|date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that aristocratic systems are more financially stable and less wasteful than democratic or communist systems.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch: Geeks for Monarchy"/&gt;

== History and etymology&lt;!--'Formalism (Yarvin)' redirects here--&gt;==
Dylan Matthews argues that neoreaction draws on the racialist, traditionalist and isolationist arguments of [[paleoconservatism]] as well as paleoconservatives' belief that the mainstream is trying to crush them. Differences between the two movements are that paleoconservatives are more religious and have more faith in the United States Constitution and republican ideals generally.&lt;ref name=warmed&gt;{{cite web|title=The alt-right is more than warmed-over white supremacy.

In 2007 and 2008, [[Curtis Yarvin]]—writing under the [[pen name]] Mencius Moldbug—articulated what would develop into Dark Enlightenment thinking. Yarvin's theories were later the subject of Nick Land, who first coined the term "Dark Enlightenment" in his essay of the same name.&lt;ref name="land-tde" /&gt; The term "Dark Enlightenment" is a play-on-words for the knowledge supposedly gained in the Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="TDT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch: Geeks for Monarchy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jon|last=Phillips|url=https://secure.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2014/fall/Troublesome-Sources|title=Troublesome Sources|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=Fall 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Land: "Where the progressive enlightenment sees political ideals, the dark enlightenment sees appetites"&lt;ref name="land-tde"/&gt;—on the view that the tendency of sovereign power (in democracies) is to devour society.

Yarvin had originally called his ideology '''formalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (a term inspired from [[legal formalism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A formalist manifesto|url = http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/04/formalist-manifesto-originally-posted.html|website = Unqualified Reservations|accessdate = 21 June 2015|date = 23 April 2007|last = Moldbug|first = Mencius}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Arnold Kling]] used the term "The Neo-Reactionaries" as a noun in July 2010 to describe Moldbug and fellows and the term was quickly adopted by the subculture.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch: Geeks for Monarchy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/07/the_neo-reactio.html|first=Arnold|last=Kling|authorlink=Arnold Kling|title=The Neo-Reactionaries|work=EconLog|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty|date=18 July 2010|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adam Riggio, the embryo of the neoreactionary movement lived in the community pages of [[LessWrong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://social-epistemology.com/2016/09/23/the-violence-of-pure-reason-neoreaction-a-basilisk-adam-riggio/|title=The Violence of Pure Reason|author=Riggio, Adam|publisher=Social Epistemology Review &amp; Reply Collective|date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Social Matter'' is a major online publication and thought machine for neoreaction.&lt;ref name=risealt&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Rise of the Alt-Right Movement|author=Summers, Ryan T.|journal=Media and Communication Studies Summer Fellows|url=http://digitalcommons.ursinus.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=media_com_sum|date=2017|number=11| page=6 | quote=The ideology is also enthralled with hyper-masculine visions of men. In Post-Anathema, a Tumblr page, common images depict soldiers with guns, tanks, spacecraft, and Greek Gods.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoreactionaries have often declined reporters' requests for interviews, explaining that journalists—as [[Manufacturing Consent|manufacturers of consent]]—are their mortal enemy. When ''[[The Atlantic]]'' political affairs reporter [[Rosie Gray]] attempted to interview neoreactionary leaders, Yarvin suggested she instead "speak directly to my WH [[Cut-out (espionage)|cutout]] / [[Clandestine cell system|cell]] leader"—a sarcastic reference to widely reported yet unsubstantiated rumors that Yarvin had ties to [[White House Chief Strategist]] [[Steve Bannon]]—while Nick B. Steves told her she was ill-suited to write about neo-reaction because "115 IQ people are not generally well equipped to summarize 160 IQ people".&lt;ref name=behind/&gt;

Neoreactionary writings, particularly those by Yarvin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/steve-bannon-books-reading-list-214745|title=What Steve Bannon Wants You to Read|author=Johnson, Eliana|publisher=Politico|date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/06/17/the-right-stupid/co8uvp1VN8G6aSVZDCUbzN/story.html|title=The right to be stupid|author=Beam, Alex|date=18 June 2015|publisher=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Land, are sometimes viewed as so verbose, dense, discursive, detached and "edgy"&lt;ref name=behind/&gt; as to be inaccessible and self-marginalizing.&lt;ref name=viewpoint&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.viewpointmag.com/2017/03/28/the-darkness-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-artificial-intelligence-and-neoreaction/|title=The Darkness at the End of the Tunnel: Artificial Intelligence and Neoreaction|author=Haider, Shuja|date=28 March 2017|publisher=Viewpoint Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fueled&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/how-2015-fueled-the-rise-of-the-freewheeling-white-nationali|title=How 2015 Fueled The Rise Of The Freewheeling, White Nationalist Alt- Movement|author=Gray, Rosie|publisher=Buzzfeed|date=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan Summers wrote that neoreactionary imagery is often infused with hyper-masculine ideas of men, such as tanks, spacecraft, Greek Gods and soldiers with guns.&lt;ref name=risealt/&gt;

== Relation to other movements ==
=== Relation to the alt-right ===
Some consider the Dark Enlightenment as an early school of thought in the [[alt-right]],&lt;ref name="qz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/how-2015-fueled-the-rise-of-the-freewheeling-white-nationali|title=How 2015 Fueled The Rise Of The Freewheeling, White Nationalist Alt Right Movement|last=Gray|first=Rosie|date=28 December 2015|website=BuzzFeed|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as its most theoretically minded branch.&lt;ref name=warmed/&gt; In particular, one philosopher with Landian ideas, [[Jason Reza Jorjani]], co-founded AltRight.com and spoke at the 2016 [[National Policy Institute]] conference led by white supremacist [[Richard B. Spencer|Richard Spencer]].&lt;ref name=goldhill&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1007144/the-neo-fascist-philosophy-that-underpins-both-the-alt-right-and-silicon-valley-technophiles/|title=The neo-fascist philosophy that underpins both the alt-right and Silicon Valley technophiles|author=Goldhill, Olivia|date=18 June 2017|publisher=Quartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have also labeled the Dark Enlightenment as "[[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]]"&lt;ref name="TDT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=vocativ&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217072334/http://www.vocativ.com/12-2013/dark-enlightenment-creepy-internet-movement-youd-better-take-seriously/|url=http://www.vocativ.com/12-2013/dark-enlightenment-creepy-internet-movement-youd-better-take-seriously/|archivedate=17 December 2013|date=2 December 2013|first=Matt|last=Sigl|work=Vocativ|title=The Dark Enlightenment: The Creepy Internet Movement You’d Better Take Seriously}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as "an acceleration of capitalism to a fascist point", although Land argues this is inaccurate because fascism "is a mass [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] movement".&lt;ref name=goldhill/&gt; Land states:&lt;ref name="behind" /&gt;{{quotation|NRx doesn't think the Alt-Right (in America) is very serious. It's an essentially Anti-Anglo-American philosophy, in its ([[Aleksandr Dugin|Duginist]]) core, which puts a firm ceiling on its potential. But then, the NRx analysis is that the age of the masses is virtually over. Riled-up populist movements are part of what is passing, rather than of what is slouching toward Bethlehem to be born.}}
James Kirchick notes that although neoreactionary thinkers disdain the masses and claim to despise populism and people more generally, what ties them to the rest of the alt-right is their unapologetically racist element, their shared [[misanthropy]] and their resentment of mismanagement by the ruling elites.&lt;ref name=terrifying&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/trumps-terrifying-online-brigades/|title=Trump’s Terrifying Online Brigades|author=Kirchick, James|date=16 May 2016|publisher=Commentary Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duesterberg observes: "As a rule the alt right is scattered, anonymous and obscure—thriving, as the curious metaphor has it, in the 'dark corners of the internet.' By contrast, neoreaction is centralized and public: darkness enlightened".&lt;ref name=final&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thepointmag.com/2017/politics/final-fantasy-neoreactionary-politics-liberal-imagination|title=Final Fantasy|author=Duesterberg, James|publisher=The Point|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
A criticism of neoreaction is that its pessimistic appraisal of [[progressivism]]'s results dismisses many advances that have been made, including greater freedom for women, racial minorities and homosexuals; increased security for the elderly and unemployed; greater access to health care by the poor; steep declines in world [[poverty]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ieet.org/index.php/IEET2/more/brin20131130|author=Brin, David|publisher=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|date=30 November 2013|title="Neo-Reactionaries" drop all pretense: End democracy and bring back lords!}}&lt;/ref&gt; improved [[air quality]]; greater [[religious tolerance]] and [[racial integration]]; lower [[crime rate]]s; and an absence of [[world war]]s since 1945. They also point to the culture of London, whose population is 40 percent nonwhite; and the high standard of living and continental peace in the [[European Union]]. Another criticism is that [[Economic globalization#Global supply chain|global manufacturing patterns]] limit the economic independence that sovereign states can have from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sullivan, Andrew|date=30 April 2017|title=Why the reactionary right must be taken seriously|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/04/andrew-sullivan-why-the-reactionary-right-must-be-taken-seriously.html|publisher=New York Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the critics who felt the Dark Enlightenment's pessimistic assessment was unsupported by economic data formed the Grey Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/19/eigenmorality-and-the-dark-enlightenment/|date=19 July 2014|publisher=TechCrunch|author=Evans, Jon|title=Eigenmorality And The Dark Enlightenment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan T. Summers observes: "For the most part, neoreactionaries do not emphasize anti-Semitic views as other alt-right counterparts".&lt;ref name="risealt" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3358">A '''deliberative referendum''' is a [[referendum]] that increases public deliberation through purposeful institutional design.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Ron (2013) ″Deliberative Voting: Realising Constitutional Referendum Democracy″ Public Law p.557. &lt;/ref&gt; The term ‵deliberative referendum′ stems from [[deliberative democracy]],&lt;ref&gt;Tierney, Stephen (2013) ″Using Electoral Law to Construct a Deliberative Referendum Moving Beyond the Democratic Paradox″12(4) Election Law Journal p.509. &lt;/ref&gt; which emphasises that ″the legitimacy of decisions can be increased if ... decisions are preceded by authentic deliberation.″&lt;ref&gt;Leib, Ethan J (2006) ″Can Direct Democracy Be Made Deliberative?″ 54 Buffalo Law Review p.903.&lt;/ref&gt; Deliberative design features can promote public deliberation prior to and during the referendum vote to increase its actual and perceived legitimacy.&lt;ref name=Leib910&gt;Leib, Ethan J (2006) ″Can Direct Democracy Be Made Deliberative?″ 54 Buffalo Law Review p.910.&lt;/ref&gt; Deliberative referendums encourage open-minded and informed reasoning, rather than rigid ″pre-formed opinions.″&lt;ref&gt; Tierney, Stephen (2013) ″Using Electoral Law to Construct a Deliberative Referendum Moving Beyond the Democratic Paradox″ 12(4) Election Law Journal pp.508-512.&lt;/ref&gt; ″[A]fter deliberations, citizens routinely alter their preferences″.&lt;ref name=Leib910/&gt;

In practice, a deliberative referendum includes a variety of institutional design features. These include using a [[citizens' jury]] to set referendum questions and educate the public, further public education via mandatory interactive tutorials before voting, and focusing referendums on broad values rather than technicalities.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Ron (2017) ″The Deliberative Case for Constitutional Referenda ″ Election Journal p. 214-215. &lt;/ref&gt;  Some authors note how legal regulation can also aid referendum deliberation.&lt;ref&gt; Tierney, Stephen (2013) ″Using Electoral Law to Construct a Deliberative Referendum Moving Beyond the Democratic Paradox″ 12(4) Election Law Journal p.523.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One deliberative referendum method increasingly in use is the [[Citizens' Initiative Review]]; this is a randomly-selected body, similar to a citizen's jury, convened specifically to deliberate on a ballot [[initiative]] or [[referendum]] that voters in the same jurisdiction (such as a city, state, province, or country) will later vote on.&lt;ref&gt; John Gastil and Robert Richards, ‘Making Direct Democracy Deliberative Through Random Assemblies’ (2013) 41(2) , Politics &amp; Society  (2013) 41 (2).&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Constitutional]] deliberative referendums can ″provide citizens with a meaningful say in determining the most fundamental constitutional decisions that affect their lives.″&lt;ref&gt; Tierney, Stephen (2013) ″Using Electoral Law to Construct a Deliberative Referendum Moving Beyond the Democratic Paradox″ 12(4) Election Law Journal p.510.&lt;/ref&gt; Voter deliberation is significant here as the referendum result could change the state’s political status or impact the enjoyment of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Ron (2013) ″Deliberative Voting: Realising Constitutional Referendum Democracy″ Public Law p.559.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Forms of government}}
'''Demokratia''' ({{lang-el|δημοκρατία}}) is a [[direct democracy]], as opposed to the modern [[representative democracy]].

It was used in ancient [[Greece]], most notably [[Athens]], and began its use around 500 BCE. In a participant government, citizens who wish to have a say in government can participate in it. Demokratia excluded women, foreigners, and slaves. It barred between 80 and 90 percent of the population from political rights.&lt;ref&gt;Morris &amp; Raaflaub ''Democracy 2500?: Questions and Challenges''&lt;/ref&gt;

The word demokratia comes from δῆμος ''demos'' "people" and ''kratos'' "power": "the people hold power." ''Demos'', including the lower classes, had political equality and notwhile respecting laws and institutions, was given full and absolute control of power and government."&lt;ref&gt;Morris &amp; Raaflaub ''Democracy 2500?: Questions and Challenges''p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

In some languages, including Finnish, Demokratia is a word simply meaning democracy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In classical Athens, religion suffused every aspect of public life, from the theater to the military to the political assembly. The state (that is, the citizens) sponsored religious festivals and actively participated in the propitiation and worship of the gods. This fact well illustrates the way the various aspects of Athenian society&amp;nbsp;— religious, political, economic, and social&amp;nbsp;— overlapped with and affected one another, and the way every Athenian found himself set firmly within a matrix of duties to the gods, to his family, and to his fellow citizens. The principle of necessary duties (especially to protect the family, to serve the polis, and to propitiate the gods) formed the basic structure of Athenian society, and gave meaning to each religious, economic, military, and political act. In such an environment, it was impossible for the Athenians abjectly to worship a form of government, demokratia, even after they had made it a goddess. The idea that the "freedom to make choices" or "diversity" were absolute goods and thus could serve as goals or ideals (on a level with, much less above, family, gods, or polis) contradicted the very premises of Athenian society. Thus while democratic practices ultimately had a marked and deleterious effect on Athenian national strength and public morale and arguably contributed to the loss of Athenian independence, Athenian society managed to stave off the most harmful aspects of democratic theory. Even after they lost their democracy and autonomy, there is little evidence that the Athenians completely lost their fundamental conception of a society based on the principle of duties.

[[File:Domino theory.svg|thumb|350px|An illustration of the domino theory as it had been predicted]]

The '''domino theory''' was a theory prominent from the 1950s to the 1980s that posited that if one country in a region came under the influence of  [[communism]], then the surrounding countries would follow in a '''[[domino effect]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leeson|first1=Peter T.|last2=Dean|first2=Andrea|title=The Democratic Domino Theory|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=2009|volume=53|issue=3|pages=533–551|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00385.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The domino theory was used by successive United States administrations during the [[Cold War]] to justify the need for [[Overseas interventions of the United States|American intervention]] around the world.

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] described the theory during an April 7, 1954, news conference, when referring to communism in [[Indochina]]:

In 1949, a Communist-backed government, led by [[Mao Zedong]], was instated in China (officially becoming the [[China|People's Republic of China]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mao-zedong-outlines-the-new-chinese-government | title =Mao Zedong outlines the new Chinese government | publisher =[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] | date =December 5, 2013 | access-date =2013-12-05 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20131102093822/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mao-zedong-outlines-the-new-chinese-government# | archive-date =2013-11-02 | dead-url =no | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation of the new government was established after the [[People's Liberation Army]] defeated the [[Nationalist government|Nationalist Republican Government of China]] in the aftermath of the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927-1949).&lt;ref name="ChineseRev"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev | title =The Chinese Revolution of 1949 | publisher =[[United States Department of State]] [[Office of the Historian]], [[Bureau of Public Affairs]] | access-date =2017-06-14 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170519004017/https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev# | archive-date =2017-05-19 | dead-url =no | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Chinas were formed - mainland 'Communist China' (People's Republic of China) and 'Nationalist China' Taiwan ([[Taiwan|Republic of China]]). The takeover by Communists of the world's most populous nation was seen in the West as a great strategic loss, prompting the popular question at the time, "Who lost China?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n3oay_KTHwoC&amp;pg=PA230&amp;lpg=PA230&amp;source=web&amp;ots=zJEMhUw3FQ&amp;sig=Hv-UEoi7Otexk7nArwaotvulO9E&amp;hl=en#PPA230,M1 Rogue Regimes: Terrorism and Proliferation, pg. 230], Raymond Tanter, Macmillan, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The United States subsequently ended diplomatic relations with China in response to the communist takeover in 1949.&lt;ref name ="ChineseRev"/&gt;

[[Korea]] had also partially fallen under Soviet domination at the end of World War II, split from the south of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] where U.S. forces subsequently moved into. By 1948, as a result of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the U.S., Korea was split into two regions, with separate governments, each claiming to be the legitimate government of Korea, and neither side accepting the border as permanent. In 1950 fighting broke out between Communists and Republicans that soon involved troops from China (on the Communists' side), and the United States and 15 allied countries (on the Republicans' side). Though the [[Korean War|war]] never officially ended, the fighting ended in 1953 with an [[Korean Armistice Agreement|armistice]] that left Korea divided into two nations, [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]].
Mao Zedong's decision to take on the U.S. in the Korean War was a direct attempt to confront what the Communist bloc viewed as the strongest anti-Communist power in the world, undertaken at a time when the Chinese Communist regime was still consolidating its own power after winning the Chinese Civil War.

President Eisenhower was the first to refer to countries in danger of Communist takeover as dominoes, in response to a journalist's question about Indochina in an April 7, 1954 news conference, though he did not use the term "domino theory".&lt;ref&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower: "[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=10202 The President's News Conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033903/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=10202# |date=2017-12-01 }}," April 7, 1954. Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, ''The Presidency Project.'' Retrieved 28 Nov. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; If Communists succeeded in taking over the rest of Indochina, Eisenhower argued, local groups would then have the encouragement, material support and momentum to take over [[Post-independence Burma, 1948–62|Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Indonesia]]; all of these countries had large popular Communist movements and insurgencies within their borders at the time.

In May 1954, the [[Viet Minh]], a Communist and nationalist army, defeated French troops in the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] and took control of what became [[North Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://uca.edu/politicalscience/dadm-project/asiapacific-region/french-indochinavietnam-1941-1954/ | title =11.

This would give them a geographical and economic strategic advantage, and it would make Japan, [[Taiwan]], the [[Philippines]], Australia, and New Zealand the front-line defensive states. The loss of regions traditionally within the vital regional trading area of countries like Japan would encourage the front-line countries to compromise politically with communism.

Eisenhower's domino theory of 1954 was a specific description of the situation and conditions within [[Southeast Asia]] at the time, and he did not suggest a generalized domino theory as others did afterward.

The [[John F. Kennedy]] administration intervened in Vietnam in the early 1960s to, among other reasons, keep the South Vietnamese "domino" from falling. When Kennedy came to power there was concern that the communist-led [[Pathet Lao]] in Laos would provide the [[Viet Cong]] with bases, and that eventually they could take over Laos.

==Arguments in favor of the domino theory==
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2018}}
The primary evidence for the domino theory is the spread of communist rule in three Southeast Asian countries in 1975, following the [[Vietnam War|communist takeover of Vietnam]]: South Vietnam (by the Viet Cong), Laos (by the Pathet Lao), and Cambodia (by the [[Khmer Rouge]]). It can further be argued that before they finished taking Vietnam prior to the 1950s, the communist campaigns did not succeed in Southeast Asia.  Note the [[Malayan Emergency]], the [[Hukbalahap Rebellion]] in the [[Philippines]], and the increasing involvement with [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Communists]] by [[Sukarno]] of Indonesia from the late 1950s until he was deposed in 1967.  All of these were unsuccessful Communist attempts to take over Southeast Asian countries which stalled when communist forces were still focused in Vietnam.

[[Walt Whitman Rostow]] and the then [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] have argued that the U.S. intervention in Indochina, by giving the nations of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] time to consolidate and engage in economic growth, prevented a wider domino effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Kuan Yew |date=2000 |title=From Third World to First: The Singapore Story - 1965-2000 |location=New York |publisher=Harper Collins |page=467,573 |isbn=0-06-019776-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meeting with President [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1975, Lee Kuan Yew argued that "there is a tendency in the U.S. Congress not to want to export jobs. But we have to have the jobs if we are to stop Communism. We have done that, moving from simple to more complex skilled labor. If we stop this process, it will do more harm than you can every[sic] repair with aid. Don't cut off imports from Southeast Asia."&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975(Gerald Ford Library)(1553067).pdf|Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975 (Gerald Ford Library)]], pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[McGeorge Bundy]] argued that the prospects for a domino effect, though high in the 1950s and early 1960s, were weakened in 1965 when the [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|Indonesian Communist Party was destroyed]] via CIA-supported death squads in the Indonesian genocide.  However, proponents believe that the efforts during the containment (i.e. Domino Theory) period ultimately led to the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.

Some supporters of the domino theory note the history of communist governments supplying aid to communist revolutionaries in neighboring countries. For instance, China supplied the [[Viet Minh]], the North Vietnamese army, with troops and supplies, and the Soviet Union supplied them with tanks and heavy weapons. The fact that the Pathet Lao and Khmer Rouge were both originally part of the Vietminh, not to mention Hanoi's support for both in conjunction with the Viet Cong, also give credence to the theory.  The Soviet Union also heavily supplied Sukarno with military supplies and advisors from the time of the [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia]], especially during and after the 1958 civil war in Sumatra.

Linguist and political theorist [[Noam Chomsky]] wrote that he believes that the domino theory is roughly accurate, although he put a more positive spin on the threat, writing that communist and socialist movements became popular in poorer countries because they brought economic improvements to those countries in which they took power. For this reason, he wrote, the U.S. put so much effort into suppressing so-called "people's movements" in [[Chile]], Vietnam, [[Nicaragua]], Laos, [[Grenada]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], etc. "The weaker and poorer a country is, the more dangerous it is as an example. If a tiny, poor country like Grenada can succeed in bringing about a better life for its people, some other place that has more resources will ask, 'Why not us?'" Chomsky refers to this as the "threat of a good example".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm "The Threat of a Good Example"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724125605/http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm# |date=2015-07-24 }}, [[Noam Chomsky]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications to communism outside Southeast Asia==
[[Michael Lind]] has argued that though the domino theory failed regionally, there was a global wave, as communist or [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] regimes came to power in [[People's Republic of Benin|Benin]], [[Derg|Ethiopia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar|Madagascar]], [[Cape Verde]], [[People's Republic of Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Angola]], [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|Grenada]], and [[Nicaragua]] during the 1970s. The global interpretation of the domino effect relies heavily upon the "prestige" interpretation of the theory, meaning that the success of Communist revolutions in some countries, though it did not provide material support to revolutionary forces in other countries, did contribute morale and rhetorical support.

In this vein, Argentine revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] wrote an essay, the "Message to the Tricontinental", in 1967, calling for "two, three ... many Vietnams" across the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm "Rough Draft of History: 'All Right, Let's Get the  @#!*%  Out of Here'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126071737/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm |date=2005-11-26 }}, Richard Gott, August 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Max Boot]] wrote, "In the late 1970s, America's enemies seized power in countries from Mozambique to Iran to Nicaragua. American hostages were seized aboard the SS ''Mayaguez'' (off Cambodia) and in Tehran. The [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Army invaded Afghanistan]]. There is no obvious connection with the Vietnam War, but there is little doubt that the defeat of a superpower encouraged our enemies to undertake acts of aggression that they might otherwise have shied away from."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118792232818807567 "Another Vietnam?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709153053/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118792232818807567# |date=2017-07-09 }}, Max Boot, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', August 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, this theory can be further bolstered by the rise in terrorist incidents by left-wing terrorist groups in Western Europe, funded in part by Communist governments, between the 1960s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/russia/kgb/su0523.htm# |title=KGB Active Measures |access-date=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629193045/https://fas.org/irp/world/russia/kgb/su0523.htm# |archive-date=2015-06-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/raf.htm# |title=Red Army Faction |access-date=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629203451/https://fas.org/irp/world/para/raf.htm# |archive-date=2015-06-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/br.htm# |title=Brigate Rosse |access-date=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629232055/https://fas.org/irp/world/para/br.htm# |archive-date=2015-06-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, this includes the kidnapping and assassination of former Italian Prime Minister [[Aldo Moro]], and the kidnapping of former US Brigadier General [[James L. Dozier]], by the [[Red Brigades]].

In West Germany, this includes the terrorist actions of the [[Red Army Faction]]. In the far east the [[Japanese Red Army]] carried out similar acts. All four, as well as others worked with various Arab and Palestinian terrorists, which like the red brigades were backed by the Soviet Bloc.

In the 1977 [[The Nixon Interviews|Frost/Nixon interviews]], [[Richard Nixon]] defended America's destabilization of the [[Salvador Allende]] regime in Chile on domino theory grounds.  Borrowing a metaphor he had heard, he stated that a Communist Chile and [[Cuba]] would create a "red sandwich" that could entrap Latin America between them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5mUrNoWa7J0C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=Chile%2Bcuba%2Bred+sandwich&amp;source=web&amp;ots=495XIVdXHA&amp;sig=-Cxk0QCxL6Ab82RqdR_fJINZ2mg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result The Last Years of the Monroe Doctrine, 1945-1993, p. 133] Gaddis Smith&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s, the domino theory was used again to justify the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]'s interventions in Central America and the [[Invasion of Grenada|Caribbean region]].

In his memoirs, former [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia|Rhodesian Prime Minister]] [[Ian Smith]] described the successive rise of authoritarian left-wing governments in Sub-Saharan Africa during [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonization]] as "the communists' domino tactic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Great Betrayal: The Memoirs of Ian Douglas Smith|Bitter Harvest: Zimbabwe and the Aftermath of Its Independence]] |last=Smith |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Smith |year=2008 |publisher=[[John Blake Publishing]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-84358-548-0 |page=280 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of pro-communist governments in [[Tanzania]] (1961–64) and [[Zambia]] (1964) and explicitly Marxist–Leninist governments in Angola (1975), Mozambique (1975), and eventually [[Rhodesia]] itself (in 1980)&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2008: 147&lt;/ref&gt; are cited by Smith as evidence of "the insidious encroachment of Soviet imperialism down the continent".&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2008: 183&lt;/ref&gt;

Some foreign policy analysts in the United States have referred to the potential spread of both Islamic theocracy and liberal democracy in the Middle East as two different possibilities for a domino theory. During the [[Iran–Iraq War]] the United States and other western nations supported [[Ba'athist Iraq]], fearing the spread of Iran's radical theocracy throughout the region. In the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], some [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]]s argued that when a democratic government is implemented, it would then help spread democracy and [[liberalism]] across the Middle East. This has been referred to as a "reverse domino theory,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2080976/nav/navoa/ "The War and the Peace"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624135941/http://www.slate.com/id/2080976/nav/navoa/# |date=2007-06-24 }}, Robert Wright, ''Slate'', April 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; or a "democratic domino theory,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reynolds|first1=Paul|title=The 'democratic domino' theory|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2935969.stm|agency=BBC News|date=April 10, 2003|access-date=2016-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003074026/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2935969.stm#|archive-date=2016-10-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so called because its effects are considered positive, not negative, by Western democratic states.

== Mission and objectives ==
The East Stratcom Team is intended to develop dedicated communication material on priority issues, where EU [[strategic communication]] needs to be improved or the EU is subject to [[disinformation]] campaigns. Such products will be put at the disposal of the EU's political leadership, press services, EU [[delegation]]s and EU Member States and are intended for the widest possible public audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-Homepage/2116/questions-and-answers-about-east-stratcom-task-force_en|title=Questions and Answers about the East StratCom Task Force - EEAS - European External Action Service - European Commission|website=EEAS - European External Action Service|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Team is designated to develop communication campaigns, targeting key [[audience]]s and focused on specific issues of relevance to those audiences, including local issues. The actions of the East Stratcom Team are built on existing work and coherent with wider EU communication efforts, including activities of the EU institutions and EU Member States.&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt;

== Key Task Force products ==
The team's positive communications products are mainly focused on the countries of the Eastern Neighbourhood and produced in the local languages of those countries. They are distributed via social media channels of the EU Delegations in the region, and are also carried on television and via other media and public events.&lt;ref name="Q &amp; A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions and Answers about the East StratCom Task Force|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-Homepage/2116/questions-and-answers-about-east-stratcom-task-force_en|publisher=EEAS - European External Action Service|language=en}} Material has been copied from this source. Reuse is authorised, provided the source is acknowledged.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Task Force, in cooperation with the European Commission, led the EU's six month Eastern Partnership communications campaign culminating in the November 2017 Eastern Partnership Summit in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/36233/eastern-partnership-summit-24112017_en|title=Eastern Partnership summit, 24/11/2017 - EEAS - European External Action Service - European Commission|website=EEAS - European External Action Service|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team's main product to raise awareness of disinformation is the weekly Disinformation Review (in English and Russian languages). This can provide valuable data for analysts, journalists and officials dealing with this issue. The Disinformation Review also brings the latest news and analyses of pro-Kremlin disinformation.&lt;ref name="Q &amp; A"/&gt; Launched in November 2015, the Disinformation Review has been described as "the best weekly disinformation bulletin anywhere in the West"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|title=Lecture by Edward Lucas|date=2016-07-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx_cqNR3bJA%7Clanguage=en%7Caccessdate=2018-03-19|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The full record of the Task Force's work on disinformation is available on its website [https://euvsdisinfo.eu/ EUvsDisinfo.eu] (in [https://euvsdisinfo.eu/news/ English], [https://euvsdisinfo.eu/ru/ Russian] and [https://euvsdisinfo.eu/de/ German] languages). The team also runs the European External Action Service's [https://eeas.europa.eu/ru/eu-information-russian_ru Russian language website]. It is also possible to follow the team on Twitter and Facebook. This communicates primarily about the EU's foreign policy by publishing information about EU activities, as well as EU statements and press releases with relevance to the Eastern Neighbourhood in particular.&lt;ref name="Q &amp; A"/&gt;

== Reception and criticism ==
EU Member State Governments have strongly supported the Task Force since its inception and provide the majority of its staff.

The European Parliament has consistently supported the Task Force and called for adequate staffing and resourcing. An EP preparatory action for 2018 – "StratCom Plus" - has allocated €1.1m for the team to focus on how to counter disinformation on the EU more systematically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/25/eu-anti-propaganda-unit-gets-1m-a-year-to-counter-russian-fake-news|title=EU anti-propaganda unit gets €1m a year to counter Russian fake news|last=Rankin|first=Jennifer|date=2017-11-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of its operation, East StratCom has identified over 3,500 disinformation cases (…) These statistics highlight the global nature of the problem, and the benefit of having a body working on disinformation beyond a single country’s borders. East StratCom’s supranational view also allows it to provide valuable insights into the broader strategy and goals of pro-Kremlin disinformation operations because it can see them as a cohesive whole, rather than isolated incidents in individual countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lawfareblog.com/european-union-steps-its-fight-against-fake-news|title=The European Union Steps Up its Fight Against Fake News|date=2017-11-14|work=Lawfare|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
An article published October 2016 on Kommunikations Forum analyses the sources East StratCom use for debunking alleged disinformation. It criticizes the top three sites, Ukrainian StopFake, EU and NATO, for not being objective credible sources in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kommunikationsforum.dk/artikler/Hvad-er-EU-s-anti-propaganda-task-forces-ideologiske-fundament|title=EU tilbageviser propaganda med objektiv sandhed|last=|first=|date=26 October 2016|work=Kommunikations Forum|access-date=28 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/29394520/Analysis_of_East_StratCom_sources_for_debunking_pro-Kremlin_misinformation|title=Analysis of East StratCom sources for debunking pro-Kremlin misinformation|last=Jesper|first=Larsen|date=24 October 2016|website=Academia|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opinion piece written by Danish commentator, Iben Thranholm, published on Russia Insider October 2015, were listed by East StratCom as pro-Kremlin disinformation. Member of the Danish Parliament, Marie Krarup, upon discovery raised the issue in January 2017, demanding Foreign Minister, Anders Samuelsen, to take action and stop ‘black listing’ of opinions, which he declined as the listing in his view was correctly labeled 'disinformation in support for Russia'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.altinget.dk/eu/artikel/udenrigsminister-dansk-debattoer-er-korrekt-opfoert-paa-propaganda-liste|title=Minister: Dansk debattør er korrekt opført på propaganda-liste|last=|first=|date=12 January 2017|website=Altinget|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response 28 commentators wrote a joint critique stressing their concern that ‘anybody with a critical view on mass immigration could end up in the black book of EU’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b.dk/kommentarer/28-kommentatorer-udenrigsministeren-stoetter-sortlistning-af-iben-thranholm|title=28 kommentatorer: Udenrigsministeren støtter sortlistning af Iben Thranholm|last=|first=|date=16 January 2017|website=Berlingske Tidende|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published October 2016 on Folkets Avis, lists several instances, where East StratCom has labelled critique of non Western immigration to EU as pro-Kremlin disinformation, regardless that neither the media or the content has any relation to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.folkets.dk/c/russisk-propaganda-EU-islamkritik|title=EU's East Stratcom: Islamkritik er russisk propaganda|last=|first=|date=6 October 2016|website=Folkets Avis|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19733">{{History of the Jews in England}}
The '''Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom''' was the culmination in the 19th century of efforts over several hundred years to loosen the legal restrictions set in place on [[History of the Jews in England|England's Jewish]] population. The nation's mercantile class had long recognised Jews as an economic asset, and they and their allies in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] sought and eventually won the passage of laws that placed male Jews in the United Kingdom on an equal legal footing with the kingdom's other emancipated males.

==Freedom for Catholics bodes well for Jews==
When in 1829 the [[Roman Catholic]]s of the United Kingdom were freed from all their [[civil disabilities]], the hopes of the Jews rose high; and the first step toward a similar alleviation in their case was taken in 1830 when [[William Huskisson]] presented a petition signed by 2,000 merchants and others of [[Liverpool]]. This was immediately followed by a bill presented by [[Robert Grant (MP)|Robert Grant]] on 15 April that year which was destined to engage the British [[legislature]] in one form or another for the next thirty years. [[Thomas Macaulay]], later a well-known and influential historian, was elected to Parliament in 1830 and – among other issues he took up – distinguished himself by attacking the exclusion of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertystory.net/LSDOCMACAULAYJEWS.htm Macaulay's speech on the exclusion of Jews from parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;

At first the bill failed to get through the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Against the opposition of [[Sir Robert Inglis, 2nd Baronet|Sir Robert Inglis]], the first reading was passed by 115 to 97 votes. But the second reading, on 17 May, notwithstanding a sizable petition in its favour from 14,000 citizens of London, was rejected by 265 to 228 votes. The next year, 1833, however, it passed its third reading in the Commons on 22 July by a majority of 189 to 52, and was read for the first time in the [[House of Lords|Lords]]. On the second reading in the Lords on 1 August it was rejected by 104 to 54, with the [[Duke of Wellington]] speaking and voting against the Bill, though the [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Duke of Sussex]], a constant friend to the Jews, presented a petition in its favour signed by 1,000 distinguished citizens of [[Westminster]]. The same thing happened in 1834, the bill being lost in the House of Lords by a majority of 92 votes. The whole force of the Tory Party and the personal antagonism of King [[William IV of England|William IV]] was against the bill. In the following year it was deemed inadvisable{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} to make the annual appeal to [[British Parliament|Parliament]], as the battle for religious liberty was going on in another part of the field{{Vague|date=November 2015}}; but by the passing of the [[Sheriffs' Declaration Act]]{{Dubious |Transferring accuracy challenge from hidden comment to talk page |reason=Hidden comment on page asserts that there is no such act and the link is a redlink |date=November 2015}} on 21 August 1835, Jews were allowed to hold the ancient and important office of sheriff.{{fact|date=April 2014}} In the following year the [[Jew Bill]] was introduced late in the session, and succeeded in passing its first reading in the Lords on 19 August but was then dropped owing to the lateness of the session.

==Membership of parliament==
[[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], who was born Jewish and  baptised aged 12 into the [[Church of England]], was a member of parliament from 1837, served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1852, 1858–1859 and 1867–1868 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] governments. He went on to become, in 1868 and again in 1874, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].  He was elevated to the House of Lords in 1876. His willingness to take Christian oaths meant there were no barriers to his political career; for Jews who had not converted to Christianity the oath remained the key obstacle. The oath of office included the words “and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian”.

For a time the advocates of Jewish emancipation seemed to have lost heart. The chief supporters of the bill, R. Grant in the Commons, and [[Henry Richard Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland|Lord Holland]] in the Lords, died within a few months of each other in 1840, and during the next four years the political activity of the English Jews was concentrated on the attempt to obtain admission to municipal office. A bill to that effect got as far as a first reading in the Lords by one vote, in 1841, but was lost on a second reading. It was not until 31 July 1845 that the bill was carried. On 18 August 1846, the [[Religious Opinions Relief Act]] removed some of minor disabilities that affected British Jews and dissenters from the [[Established Church]]; the only state office that still remained closed to Jews was Parliament.

The success with which British Jews had induced Parliament to admit them to the shrievalty and to municipal offices had been because Jews had been actual candidates, and had been elected to those offices before any parliamentary relief was asked. It was now decided to adopt the same policy in regard to a seat in Parliament itself.

A Jewish candidate, [[Lionel de Rothschild]], was elected as one of the four members of Parliament for the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]] in 1847 but could not take his seat without taking an oath of office, and the bill that was introduced on 16 December that year was intended to carry out the wishes of a definite English constituency. This passed its third reading in the Commons on 4 May 1848, by a majority of 62 votes, but was rejected in the Lords by 163 non-contents to 128 contents. The same thing happened in 1849 when Lionel de Rothschild was again elected, but in the following year the struggle took on another and more dramatic form.

[[David Salomons]], who had successfully fought the battle for the shrievalty and the aldermanic chair, had been elected member for [[Greenwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenwich]] and insisted on taking his seat, refusing to withdraw on being ordered to do so by the speaker, and adding to his offence by voting in the division on the motion for adjournment which was made to still the uproar caused by his bold course of action. The [[Prime minister]], [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], moved that Salomons be ordered to withdraw, and on that motion Salomons spoke in a dignified and forcible manner, and won the sympathy of the House, which nevertheless passed the Prime Minister's motion. The matter was then referred to the law courts, which decided that Salomons had no right to vote without having taken the oath of abjuration in the form appointed by Parliament, and fined him £500 for each vote he had recorded in the Commons. The government then brought in another bill in 1853, which was also rejected by the Lords. In 1855, Salomons was elected [[Lord Mayor of London]].

In the following two years, bills were introduced by the government to modify the parliamentary oath, but they failed to obtain the assent of the Lords. In 1858 when the Oath Bill reached the Lords they eliminated the clause relating to Jews; but when the bill was referred again to the Commons, the lower house refused to accept it as amended, and appointed a committee to formulate its reasons, upon which committee, as if to show the absurdity of the situation, the member for the City of London, Lionel de Rothschild, was appointed to serve, something which he could legally do, even though he had not taken his seat. A conference was appointed between the two houses, and ultimately a compromise was reached with the passage of the ''[[Jews Relief Act 1858]]'' by which either house might admit Jews by resolution, allowing them to omit the words "on the true faith of a Christian."

As a consequence, on Monday, 26 July 1858, Lionel de Rothschild took the oath with covered head, substituting "so help me, [[Jehovah]]" for the ordinary form of oath, and thereupon took his seat as the first Jewish member of Parliament; David Salomons was re-elected for Greenwich in a by-election and took his seat in early 1859.  Two years later a more general form of oath for all members of Parliament was introduced, which freed the Jews from all cause of exclusion.

==Reforms and political freedoms==
The [[Reform Act 1867]] granted every adult male householder the right to vote. Before this legislation only very few men in Britain could vote. In 1871, in the wake of the case of [[Numa Edward Hartog]], the [[Universities Tests Act]] removed the difficulties in the way of a Jew becoming a scholar or a fellow in an English university. In 1885, [[Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Sir Nathaniel de Rothschild]] was raised to the upper house as Lord Rothschild, the first Jewish Lord. In 1876 Disraeli was made [[Earl of Beaconsfield]]. They were followed within a few years by [[Henry de Worms, 1st Baron Pirbright|Henry de Worms]] as Lord Pirbright and [[Sydney Stern, 1st Baron Wandsworth|Sydney Stern]] as Lord Wandsworth. In 1890 all restrictions for every position in the [[British Empire]]  were removed being thrown open to every British subject without distinction of creed, except for that of monarch and the offices of [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor]] and of [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].

For some time after their admission to Parliament, the Jewish MPs belonged to the party that had given them that privilege, the Liberal Party, and Sir [[George Jessel (jurist)|George Jessel]] acted as solicitor-general in [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s first ministry. But from the time of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] reaction in 1874 Jewish voters and candidates showed an increasing tendency toward the Conservatives. The influence of [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]] may have had some effect on this change, but it was in the main due to the altered politics of the middle and commercial classes, to which the Jews chiefly belonged. Baron Henry de Worms acted as under [[Secretary of State]] in one of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]'s ministries, while Sir [[Julian Goldsmid]], a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]] after the [[Home Rule]] policy of Gladstone was declared, made a marked impression as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons]].

Altogether the struggle had lasted for sixty years; nearly all that was contended for had been gained in half that period, but complete equality was not granted to Roman Catholics and Jews until 1890. The many political friendships made during the process had facilitated social intercourse{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}.

==Communal organisations and disunity==
The pause which occurred between 1840 and 1847 in the [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] struggle was due in large measure to a schism, which at the time seemed unfortunate, which had split the Jewish community in two and which prevented the members acting in unison for the defence of their rights. The Reform movement had reached England in a mild form under the influence of the [[Goldsmid family]], which had been touched by the [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohnian movement]]. In 1841 a [[Reform Jew|Reform]] congregation was established in London, and was practically excommunicated by both the [[Spanish haham]] and the German chief rabbi. The effect of these differences was to delay common action as regards emancipation and other affairs; and it was not until 1859 that the charity organisation was put on a firm footing by the creation of the [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]]. Ten years later the congregations were brought under one rule by the formation of the [[United Synagogue]] (1870), in the charter of which an attempt was made to give the [[Chief Rabbi]] autocratic powers over the doctrines to be taught in the Jewish communities throughout the [[British empire]]. But Parliament, which had recently disestablished the [[Church of Ireland|Irish Church]], did not feel disposed to establish the Jewish Synagogue, and the clause was stricken out. The chief rabbi's salary is paid partly out of contributions from the provincial synagogues, and this gives him a certain amount of authority over all the Jews of the empire with the exception of the 3,000 or more Sephardim, who have a separate [[haham]], and of the dwindling band of Reformers, who number about 2,000, scattered in London, Manchester, and Bradford. In 1871 the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] was established to take the place, so far as regards the British empire, of the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle|Alliance Israélite]], which had been weakened by the [[Franco-German war]]. The Jews of England felt that they should be organised to take their proper part in Jewish affairs in general. For many years they, together with the French Jews, were the only members of the religion who were unhampered by disabilities; and this enabled them to act more freely in cases where the whole body of Israel was concerned.

==Fighting false "blood libels"==
As early as 1840, when the [[blood libel against Jews|blood accusation]] was revived with regard to the [[Damascus affair]], and Jewish matters were for the first time treated on an international basis, the Jews of England took by far the most prominent position in the general protest of the European Jewries against the charge. Not only was the [[Board of Deputies]] at London the sole Jewish body in Europe to hold public meetings, but owing to their influence a meeting of protest was held by eminent Christians at the [[Mansion House, London]] (3 July 1840), which formed a precedent for subsequent distinguished gatherings. [[Sir Moses Montefiore]], after aiding the Damascus Jews by obtaining, in an interview with the [[Sultan]] at [[Constantinople]], a [[firman (decree)|firman]] repudiating the blood accusation, visited Russia in 1846 to intercede for his coreligionists there. In 1860 he went to Rome in connection with the [[Edgardo Mortara|Mortara]] affair; and in 1863 he led a mission to [[Morocco]] on behalf of Jews of that country. Action was likewise taken by the chief English Jews in behalf of the unfortunate [[Hebrews]] of the [[Danubian principalities]]. [[Francis Goldsmid]] made an interpellation in the House of Commons with regard to the Jews of [[Serbia]] (29 March 1867), and started a debate in that assembly (19 April 1872) on the subject of the persecutions of the Jews in [[Romania]]. As a consequence a Romanian committee was formed, which watched the activities of the illiberal government of that country.

==Pogroms in Russia==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pogrom]] --&gt;
When in 1881 the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|outburst of violence in Russia]] brought the position of the Russian Jews prominently before the world, it was their coreligionists in England who took the lead in organising measures for their relief. Articles in "[[The Times]]" of 11 and 13 January 1882, drew the attention of the whole world to the extent of the persecutions, and a meeting of the most prominent citizens of London was held at the Mansion House on 1 February 1882 (see Mansion House Meeting). As a consequence a fund was raised amounting to more than £108,000, and a complete scheme of distributing in the United States the Russian [[refugee]]s from Brody was organised by the committee of the [[Mansion House Fund]]. Similarly, when a revival of the persecutions took place in 1891, another meeting was held at the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], and a further sum of over £100,000 was collected and devoted to facilitating the westward movement of the Russian exodus. An attempt was made this time to obtain access directly to the czar by the delivery of a petition from the lord mayor and citizens of London; but this was contemptuously rejected, and the [[Russian Jews|Russo-Jewish]] committee which carried out the work of the Mansion House Fund was obliged to confine its activity to measures outside Russia. When [[Maurice de Hirsch]] formed his elaborate scheme for the amelioration of the condition of the persecuted Jews, headquarters were established by him in London, though the administration was practically directed from Paris. The [[immigrant]]s being excluded from most of the cities of the Continent, the burden of receiving most of the Russian refugees moving westward fell on England, as well as America.&lt;ref&gt;http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=602&amp;letter=M#2023&lt;/ref&gt;

===Result of the Russian exodus===
"The advent of such a large number of Jews, unprovided with capital, and often without a definite occupation, brought with it difficulties. It was only natural that the newcomers should arouse a certain amount of prejudice by their foreign habits, by the economic pressure they brought to bear upon certain trades, especially on that of clothing, and by their overcrowding in certain localities. While [[the Continent]] had seen the rise of strong [[anti-Semitic]] feeling, England had been comparatively free from any exhibition of this kind. During Lord Beaconsfield's ministry, a few murmurs had been heard from the more advanced Liberals against the "Semitic" tendencies of the prime minister and his brethren in the race, but as a rule social had followed political emancipation almost automatically. The Russian influx threatened to disturb this natural process, and soon after 1891 protests began to be heard against the "alien immigrants. Bills were even introduced into Parliament to check their entry into England. Nothing came of these protests, however, till the year 1902, when the question had reached such a point that it was deemed desirable to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the whole subject. The commission heard evidence both from those favouring and from those opposed to restricted immigration. Reports were made to the House of Commons that the arrival, in the [[East End of London]], of Eastern European Jews, had brought [[smallpox]] and [[scarlet fever]]. The evidence, however, does not appear to have supported these accusations. "&lt;ref&gt;'Parliamentary Debates, 4th series, vol. 145, col.711.'' and ''L.Marks.

In American politics, '''fusionism''' is the philosophical and political combination or "fusion" of [[Traditionalist conservatism in the United States|traditionalist]] and [[Social conservatism in the United States|social conservatism]] with political and economic [[right-libertarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;E.J. Dionne, Jr., ''Why Americans Hate Politics'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991, 161&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy is most closely associated with [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank S. Meyer, ''In Defense of Freedom and Other Essays'', Indianapolis, Liberty Fund, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual founding and positions==
The philosophy of "fusionism" was developed at ''[[National Review]]'' magazine during the 1950s under the editorship of William F. Buckley, Jr. and is most identified with his associate editor [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]]. As Buckley recounted the founding he "brokered" between "an extraordinary mix" of libertarians, traditional conservatives, anti-communists and even an anarchist to produce the ideas and writings that produced modern conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rago. "Interview: William F. Buckley, Jr." ''The Wall Street Journal'', November 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He identified Meyer's synthesis as the most likely best solution of defining conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Buckley, Jr. ''Did You Ever See a Dream Walking: American Conservative Thought in the 20th Century'' (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merriall Books, 1970), p. xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his most influential book, ''In Defense of Freedom'', Meyer defined freedom in what [[Isaiah Berlin]] would label "negative" terms as the minimization of the use of coercion by the state in its essential role of preventing one person's freedom from intruding upon another's. The state should protect freedom but otherwise leave virtue to individuals. The state has only three legitimate functions – police, military and operating a legal system, all necessary to control coercion, which is immoral if not restricted. Virtue is critical for society and freedom must be balanced by responsibility but both are inherently individual in form. Coerced values cannot be virtuous. Freedom by itself has no goal, no intrinsic end. Freedom is not abstract or utopian as with the utilitarians, who also make freedom an end rather than a means. In a real society traditional order and freedom can only exist together.  The solution is a philosophical synthesis of both freedom and tradition, the solution to the dilemma is "grasping it by both horns" and accepting the tension between the two.&lt;ref&gt;''In Defense of Freedom'', pp. 74–121&lt;/ref&gt;

Fusionism's most famous advocate was Ronald Reagan as an early admirer of National Review and associate of both editors. On assuming the presidency in 1981, he met with conservative leaders around the country in Washington and reminded them of their intellectual roots. After listing "intellectual leaders like Russell Kirk, Friedrich Hayek, Henry Hazlitt, Milton Friedman, James Burnham, [and] Ludwig von Mises" as the ones who "shaped so much of our thoughts," he discussed only one of these influences at length:

{{quote|It's especially hard to believe that it was only a decade ago, on a cold April day on a small hill in upstate New York, that another of these great thinkers, Frank Meyer, was buried. He'd made the awful journey that so many others had: he pulled himself from the clutches of 'The [communist] God That Failed,' and then in his writing fashioned a vigorous new synthesis of traditional and libertarian thought – a synthesis that is today recognized by many as modern conservatism.}}

As he recalled him, the new president outlined the ideas Meyer synthesized as the principles for this new conservative movement.

{{quote|It was Frank Meyer who reminded us that the robust individualism of the American experience was part of the deeper current of Western learning and culture. He pointed out that a respect for law, an appreciation for tradition, and regard for the social consensus that gives stability to our public and private institutions, these civilized ideas must still motivate us even as we seek a new economic prosperity based on reducing government interference in the marketplace. Our goals complement each other. We're not cutting the budget simply for the sake of sounder financial management. This is only a first step toward returning power to the states and communities, only a first step toward reordering the relationship between citizen and government.

We can make government again responsive to the people by cutting its size and scope and thereby ensuring that its legitimate functions are performed efficiently and justly. Because ours is a consistent philosophy of government,  we can be very clear: We do not have a separate social agenda, separate economic agenda, and a separate foreign agenda. We have one agenda. Just as surely as we seek to put our financial house in order and rebuild our nation's defenses, so too we seek to protect the unborn, to end the manipulation of schoolchildren by utopian planners, and permit the acknowledgement of a Supreme Being in our classrooms just as we allow such acknowledgements in other public institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Reagan, "Address to the Conservative Political Action Conference," March 20, 1981, {{cite web |url=http://www.conservative.org/acuf/our-philosophy/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110134608/http://www.conservative.org/acuf/our-philosophy/ |archivedate=2012-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Political history==
Fusionism saw its height during the [[Reagan administration|presidency]] of [[Ronald Reagan]], who had brought together the divided factions after [[Gerald Ford]]'s loss in the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 election]]. [[Rich Lowry]] has argued that Reagan maintained a fusionist 'sweet spot' of both ideological flexibility and respect for conservative principles.&lt;ref name=boat/&gt; In the immediate aftermath of the [[Republican Revolution|Republican takeover of Congress in 1994]], fusionism was also at its height. The [[social conservatism|social conservative]] element of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was seen on the ascent (at least with respect to domestic politics) during the presidency of [[George W Bush]]. Increased spending angered traditional conservatives, [[fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservatives]], and libertarians.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/03/the_end_of_republican_fusionis.html]{{cite news |publisher=[[realclear politics]] |title=The end of republican fusionism?|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/03/the_end_of_republican_fusionis.html |date=March 1, 2008 |accessdate=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the long-standing tensions between [[neoconservatism|neoconservatives]] and [[paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]] bubbled over in the wake of the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan said during a June 2009 [[Hudson Institute]] conference speech:

{{quote|A "libertarian" who wants limited government should embrace the means to his freedom: thriving mediating institutions that create the moral preconditions for economic markets and choice. A "social issues" conservative with a zeal for righteousness should insist on a free market economy to supply the material needs for families, schools, and churches that inspire moral and spiritual life. In a nutshell, the notion of separating the social from the economic issues is a false choice. They stem from the same root.&lt;ref name=boat&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Pajamas Media]] |title=We're Going to Need a Bigger Tent |url=http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/were-going-to-need-a-bigger-tent/ |date=June 13, 2009 |accessdate=June 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

While both these principles are traditionally conservative, the equal emphasis of traditional morality and free markets is a characteristic of fusionism.

Following the Republican Party's defeat in the [[United States House elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], some were calling for a new "fusionism" between libertarians and liberals in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to address what is seen as increasing governmental interference in private activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2006_12_03-2006_12_09.shtml#1165588046 What Is (or Was) "Fusionism"?]&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 elections]] and the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] have brought renewed tension between the  libertarians and the social conservatives with centrist economic views.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Fusionists tend to see the unpopularity of George W. Bush's Keynesian economic stimulus policies, his "compassionate conservatism," such as in his new entitlement prescription drug program, and his party's following defeat by President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, as reasons requiring a fusionist renewal if conservatism was ever to regain the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald J. Devine]], ''America's Way Back: Reconciling Freedom, Tradition and Constitution'' (Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, 2013); Brandon James Smith, "Time for a Return to Fusionism," Public Discourse, February 19, 2014, http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2014/02/11937/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In a polemic, the [[Traditionalist conservatism in the United States|traditional]] conservative philosopher [[Russell Kirk]], quoting [[T. S. Eliot]]'s expression called libertarians ''"chirping sectaries"''. Adding that although conservatives and libertarians share opposition to collectivism, the totalist state and bureaucracy, have otherwise nothing in common. He called the libertarian movement "an ideological clique forever splitting into sects still smaller and odder, but rarely conjugating." Stating that a line of division exists between believers in "some sort of transcendent moral order" and "utilitarians admitting no transcendent sanctions for conduct." He included libertarians in the latter category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirk|first=Russell|title=Libertarians: the Chirping Sectaries|url=http://www.mmisi.org/ma/25_04/kirk.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902193037/http://www.mmisi.org/ma/25_04/kirk.pdf|dead-url=no|archive-date=2009-09-02|work=Modern Age|publisher=Intercollegiate Studies Institute|location=Wilmington, DE|pages=345–51|date=Fall 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk had questioned fusionism between libertarians and traditional conservatives that marked much of post-World War II conservatism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/posts/1165701072.shtml|title=The Volokh Conspiracy – Russell Kirk, Libertarianism, and Fusionism:|work=volokh.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Elections}}

'''Gerrymandering''' is a practice intended to establish a political advantage for a particular party or group by manipulating [[boundary delimitation|district boundaries]]. The resulting district is known as a '''gerrymander''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛr|i|ˌ|m|æ|n|d|ər|,_|ˈ|ɡ|ɛr|i|-}}); however, that word is also a verb for the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elster|first=Charles|title=The Big Book of Beastly Mispronunciations|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|year=2005|page=224|isbn=9780618423156|oclc=317828351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict | gerrymander}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''gerrymandering'' has negative connotations. Two principal tactics are used in gerrymandering: "cracking" (i.e. diluting the voting power of the opposing party's supporters across many districts) and "packing" (concentrating the opposing party's voting power in one district to reduce their voting power in other districts).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redistrictinggame.org/learnaboutmission2.php|title=The ReDistricting Game|last=|first=|date=|website=www.redistrictinggame.org|publisher=USCAnnenbergCenter|language=en|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third tactic, shown in the top-left diagram in the diagrams to the right, is that of [[homogenisation|homogenization]] of all districts.

In addition to its use achieving desired electoral results for a particular party, gerrymandering may be used to help or hinder a particular [[demographic]], such as a political, ethnic, racial, linguistic, religious, or class group, such as in U.S. federal voting district boundaries that produce a majority of constituents representative of African-American or other racial minorities, known as "[[majority-minority districts]]". Gerrymandering can also be used to protect [[incumbent]]s.

==Difference from malapportionment==

Gerrymandering should not be confused with [[malapportionment]], whereby the number of eligible voters per elected representative can vary widely without relation to how the boundaries are drawn. Nevertheless, the ''-mander'' suffix has been applied to particular malapportionments. Sometimes political representatives use both gerrymandering and malapportionment to try to maintain power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/gerrymandering|title=gerrymandering {{!}} politics|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/the-twisted-history-of-gerrymandering-in-american-politics/262369/|title=The Twisted History of Gerrymandering in American Politics|last=Barasch|first=Emily|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:The Gerry-Mander Edit.png|thumb|250px|Printed in March 1812, this political cartoon was drawn in reaction to the newly drawn state senate election district of South Essex created by the Massachusetts legislature to favor the Democratic-Republican Party candidates of Governor Elbridge Gerry over the Federalists. The caricature satirizes the bizarre shape of a district in [[Essex County, Massachusetts]], as a dragon-like "monster". Federalist newspaper editors and others at the time likened the district shape to a salamander, and the word ''gerrymander'' was a blend of that word and Governor Gerry's last name.]]

The word gerrymander (originally written Gerry-mander) was used for the first time in the Boston Gazette (not to be confused with the original ''[[Boston Gazette]]'') on 26 March 1812. The word was created in reaction to a redrawing of [[Massachusetts]] state senate election districts under Governor [[Elbridge Gerry]]. In 1812, Gerry signed a bill that redistricted Massachusetts to benefit his [[Democratic-Republican Party]]. When mapped, one of the contorted districts in the Boston area was said to resemble the shape of a mythological [[salamander (legendary creature)|salamander]].&lt;ref name="Griffith 1907 72–73"&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffith|first=Elmer|title=The Rise and Development of the Gerrymander |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=6o2HAAAAMAAJ |page=73 }} |pages=72–73|location=Chicago |publisher=Scott, Foresman and Co |year=1907 |oclc=45790508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original gerrymander, and original 1812 gerrymander cartoon, depict the Essex South state senatorial district for the legislature of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=Martis&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martis |first=Kenneth C. |title=The Original Gerrymander |journal=[[Political Geography (journal)|Political Geography]] |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=833–839 |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2008.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---and not a US congressional district--&gt;

Gerrymander is a [[portmanteau]] of the governor's last name and the word ''salamander''.

The redistricting was a notable success for Gerry's Democratic-Republican Party. Although in the 1812 election both the Massachusetts House and governorship were won by Federalists by a comfortable margin and cost Gerry his job, the redistricted state senate remained firmly in Democratic-Republican hands.&lt;ref name="Griffith 1907 72–73"/&gt;{{clarify|This doesn't relate the above statement that the gerrymandering was done to Congressional districts. The state senate is not mentioned there and the U.S. House is not mentioned here.|date=January 2015}}

The author of the term gerrymander may never be definitively established. Historians widely believe that the [[Federalist]] newspaper editors [[Nathan Hale (journalist)|Nathan Hale]], and Benjamin and John Russell coined the term, but the historical record does not have definitive evidence as to who created or uttered the word for the first time.&lt;ref name=Martis/&gt;

Appearing with the term, and helping spread and sustain its popularity, was a [[political cartoon]] depicting a strange animal with claws, wings and a dragon-like head satirizing the map of the oddly shaped district. This cartoon was most likely drawn by [[Elkanah Tisdale]], an early 19th-century painter, designer, and engraver who was living in Boston at the time.&lt;ref&gt;There is no evidence that the famous American portrait painter [[Gilbert Stuart]] had any involvement with either the design, drawing, or naming of the cartoon, or with the coining of the term. Detailed biographies and academic journal articles about Stuart make no reference to gerrymandering. The myth of Stuart's association with the original gerrymander has been reproduced and spread without verification or sources, from one reference book and Internet site to another. Modern scholars of Stuart agree that no proof exists to credit him with the term or cartoon and that he tended not to be involved with such issues. {{cite journal |first=Kenneth C. |last=Martis |title=The Original Gerrymander |journal=Political Geography |volume=27 |issue=4 |year=2008 |pages=833–839 |doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2008.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tisdale had the engraving skills to cut the woodblocks to print the original cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Brien |first=D. C. |title=Elkanah Tisdale: Designer, Engraver and Miniature Painter |journal=Connecticut Historical Bulletin |volume=49 |issue=2 |year=1984 |pages=83–96 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These woodblocks survive and are preserved in the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress. Original woodblocks for printing "Gerrymander" political cartoon. Geography and Map Reading Room. LCCN Permalink: http://lccn.loc.gov/2003620165.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''gerrymander'' was reprinted numerous times in Federalist newspapers in Massachusetts, New England, and nationwide during the remainder of 1812.&lt;ref&gt;The word ''gerrymander'' was used again in two Boston-area papers the next day. The first usage outside of the immediate Boston area appeared in the ''[[Newburyport Herald]]'' (Massachusetts) on 31 March, and the first use outside of Massachusetts came in the ''Concord Gazette'' (New Hampshire) on 14 April 1812.

The first use outside of New England was published in the ''New York Gazette &amp; General Advertiser'' on 19 May. What may be the first use of the term to describe the [[redistricting]] in another state (Maryland) occurred in the ''Federal Republican'' (Georgetown, D.C.)&lt;!-- Georgetown was technically distinct from the city of Washington until 1871. --&gt; on 12 October 1812. All in all, there are at least 80 known citations of the word from March through December 1812 in American newspapers. {{cite journal |first=Kenneth C. |last=Martis |title=The Original Gerrymander |journal=Political Geography |volume=27 |issue=4 |year=2008 |pages=833–839 |doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2008.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests some organized activity of the Federalists to disparage Governor Gerry in particular, and the growing Democratic-Republican party in general. ''Gerrymandering'' soon began to be used to describe not only the original Massachusetts example, but also other cases of district shape manipulation for partisan gain in other states. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]],'' the word's acceptance was marked by its publication in a dictionary (1848) and in an encyclopedia (1868).&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, J. A., Weiner, E. S. C.  "Gerrymander",  ''Oxford English Dictionary.''  New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the letter ''g'' of the eponymous ''Gerry'' is pronounced with a hard g {{IPA|/ɡ/}} as in ''get'', the word ''gerrymander'' was originally pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ɛr|i|m|æ|n|d|ər}}. However, pronunciation as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛr|i|m|æ|n|d|ər}}, with a soft g {{IPA|/dʒ/}} as in ''gentle,'' has become the accepted pronunciation.

From time to time, other names are given the "-mander" suffix to tie a particular effort to a particular politician or group. These include the 1852 [[Andrew Johnson#Congressman (1843–1853)|"Henry-mandering"]], "Jerrymander" (referring to California Governor [[Jerry Brown]]),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Hofeller, "[http://www.politico.com/pdf/PPM116_rnc_hofeller_memo_051010.pdf The Looming Redistricting Reform; How will the Republican Party Fare?]", ''Politico'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; "Perrymander" (a reference to Texas Governor [[Rick Perry]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=David Wasserman |date=19 August 2011 |title='Perrymander': Redistricting Map That Rick Perry Signed Has Texas Hispanics Up in Arms |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/-perrymander-redistricting-map-that-rick-perry-signed-has-texas-hispanics-up-in-arms-20110819 |magazine=National Journal |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509195817/http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/-perrymander-redistricting-map-that-rick-perry-signed-has-texas-hispanics-up-in-arms-20110819 |archive-date=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark Gersh |date=21 September 2011 |title=Redistricting Journal: Showdown in Texas—reasons and implications for the House, and Hispanic vote |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20109665-503544.html |work=CBS News |access-date= 2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and "[[Tullymander]]" (after the Irish politician [[James Tully (Irish politician)|James Tully]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Voting systems==
Gerrymandering is used most often in favor of ruling incumbents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Michel Balinski]] |date=2008 |title=Fair Majority Voting (or How to Eliminate Gerrymandering) |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |volume=115 |doi=10.1080/00029890.2008.11920503 |pages=97 |quote=Incumbent candidates, in tailored districts, are almost certain of reelection (over 98% in 2002, over 94% in 2006).}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a specific political party—the one drawing the map. Societies whose legislatures use a single-winner [[electoral system]] are the most likely to have political parties that gerrymander for advantage.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Most notably, gerrymandering is particularly effective in non-proportional systems that tend towards fewer parties, such as ''[[first past the post]]''.

In [[Proportional representation|proportional-election systems]], where political parties are represented in proportion to the total numbers of votes they receive, gerrymandering has little or less significance.  In voting systems where an electorate is not divided into individual constituencies, but is instead polled as one district (for instance, elections to the Israeli [[Knesset]], or to the [[European Parliament]] in [[Germany]]) gerrymandering is entirely irrelevant.  Note, however, that it is possible to gerrymander the result of an election to a national/electorate-wide office where that election's electoral system is not based on a direct suffrage, but instead operates some form of constituent-parts voting system; for example national elections in the [[Roman Republic]] (consular etc.) saw voters placed into "tribes" (constituent voting blocks), with each tribe voting as a unit to endorse particular candidates.  The poor voters tended to be huddled together in a few tribes whilst the rich interest was spread out across many.  The effect was a structure which explicitly benefited the [[Optimates]] (traditionalist) faction over the more progressive [[Populares]] alignment, since the former tended to draw more of its support from the Roman aristocracy and equestrian classes, whilst candidates for the latter drew their strength from the lower plebeian orders.

Some countries, such as Australia, [[Canada]], and the UK, authorize non-partisan organizations to set constituency boundaries in an attempt to prevent gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is most common in countries where elected politicians are responsible for defining constituency boundaries. They have an obvious and immediate interest in the outcome of the process.

===Introduction of inadvertent bias in voting systems over time===

Where an electoral system has not changed over time, it is possible that the interplay between a static voting structure and changing demographics will introduce disproportionality into the system.  Most obviously, this can manifest itself by a simple transfer of the population; for instance in Japan the constituencies for the [[National Diet]] have failed to reflect the growth in urban areas in recent decades; in a circumstance such as this the boundaries will need to be re-homogenised to effect equal voting power across electors.

A more complicated example is where a system is specifically designed (even on a good faith basis) to ensure that it has modifications to the principle of one person, one (equal) vote: for instance by granting multiple votes to a certain demographic, or to certain geographical areas.  If the circumstances which led to such rules being adopted have changed, it can inadvertently prejudice the outcome.  A real world illustration of this is the system for electing the [[President of the United States]], which unlike most other directly-elected heads of state (such as the [[President of France|Presidency]] of [[France]]) operates through an electorate college rather than simple suffrage by the voting population.  The American [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] grants a disproportionate benefit in favour of rural voters because each [[US State|state]] is entitled to a minimum proportion of votes in the electoral college total.  Note that this example is inadvertent, having arisen by the forces of history and not design, since the relevant [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|constitutional provision]] was adopted prior to the [[Industrial Revolution in the United States|industrial revolution]] in that country, which altered the demographics to create the bias.

It should, however, be noted that where a system is created on a good faith basis to have modifications to a basic one person one vote structure, it is possible that changing circumstances will inadvertently (from the basis of the structure's designers) lead to gerrymandering. For example, in Northern Ireland local government elections prior to the 1960s, the voting system was designed to allow those who paid higher amounts of [[Rates in the United Kingdom|rates]] to have more than one vote, with additional votes per amount paid (up to a cap). This system was designed with a bias in mind: to advance the interests of the wealthy. The system's originator, (the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]), which was by background and inclination primarily an upper middle-class party, was quite open about this and were of the view that it was a proper goal in and of itself (the thinking being that those who contributed more had more of a stake). In this sense, though politically contentious, the system was introduced on a good faith basis - in such sense not being a true gerrymander.  However, by the 1960s changing demographics through movement of sectarian minorities into previously uniform districts, coupled with rising minority awareness in Northern Ireland, had revealed a more latent bias: that [[Protestantism|Protestants]] tended to be wealthier (in part, possibly, due to wider discrimination in society), and thus had more votes per capita. The result was that Catholics had reduced influence on local government elections, even in those districts where they might be expected to exert control. As such, they were de facto discriminated against, though this was not the primary intention ab initio.

Both the American and Northern Irish examples show that, as a system becomes biased as a passive process, such changes have the capacity to alter the attitude of operatives within it from good to bad faith actors. In America, factions approve the outsized voting strength of rural voters, because they tend to be more conservative which suits the inclination of some Republicans. In Northern Ireland, the system which kept Protestants in a position of advantage was defended on that basis, though it was known to be for discriminatory purposes only.

The primary goals of gerrymandering are to maximize the effect of supporters' votes and to minimize the effect of opponents' votes.  A partisan gerrymander's main purpose is to influence not only the districting statute but the entire corpus of legislative decisions enacted in its path.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schuck|first=Peter H.|date=1987|title=The Thickest Thicket: Partisan Gerrymandering and Judicial Regulation of Politics|jstor=1122527|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=87|issue=7|pages=1325–1384|doi=10.2307/1122527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These can be accomplished through a number of ways:&lt;ref name="ProP201111022"&gt;{{cite web

* "Cracking" involves spreading voters of a particular type among many districts in order to deny them a sufficiently large [[voting bloc]] in any particular district.&lt;ref name="ProP201111022"/&gt; Political parties in charge of redrawing district lines may create more "cracked" districts as a means of retaining, and possibly even expanding, their legislative power. By "cracking" districts, a political party would be able to maintain, or gain, legislative control by ensuring that the opposing party's voters are not the majority in specific districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/packing-cracking-supreme-court-takes-partisan-gerrymandering-090050994.html?_tsrc=jtc_news_index|title=Packing and cracking: The Supreme Court takes up partisan gerrymandering|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.policymap.com/2017/08/a-deeper-look-at-gerrymandering/|title=A Deeper Look at Gerrymandering {{!}} PolicyMap|date=2017-08-01|work=PolicyMap|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be to split the voters in an urban area among several districts wherein the majority of voters are suburban, on the presumption that the two groups would vote differently, and the suburban voters would be far more likely to get their way in the elections.
* "Packing" is to concentrate as many voters of one type into a single electoral district to reduce their influence in other districts.&lt;ref name="ProP201111022" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In some cases, this may be done to obtain representation for a community of common interest (such as to create a [[majority-minority district]]), rather than to dilute that interest over several districts to a point of ineffectiveness (and, when minority groups are involved, to avoid likely lawsuits charging racial discrimination). When the party controlling the districting process has a statewide majority, packing is usually not necessary to attain partisan advantage; the minority party can generally be "cracked" everywhere. Packing is therefore more likely to be used for partisan advantage when the party controlling the districting process has a statewide minority, because by forfeiting a few districts packed with the opposition, cracking can be used in forming the remaining districts.
* "Hijacking" redraws two districts in such a way as to force two incumbents to run against each other in one district, ensuring that one of them will be eliminated.&lt;ref name="ProP201111022" /&gt;
* "Kidnapping" moves an incumbent's home address into another district.&lt;ref name="ProP201111022" /&gt; Reelection can become more difficult when the incumbent no longer resides in the district, or possibly faces reelection from a new district with a new voter base. This is often employed against politicians who represent multiple urban areas, in which larger cities will be removed from the district in order to make the district more rural.

These tactics are typically combined in some form, creating a few "forfeit" seats for packed voters of one type in order to secure more seats and greater representation for voters of another type. This results in candidates of one party (the one responsible for the gerrymandering) winning by small majorities in most of the districts, and another party winning by a large majority in only a few of the districts.

==Effects==

Gerrymandering is effective because of the [[wasted vote|wasted vote effect]]. ''Wasted votes'' are votes that did not contribute to electing a candidate, either because they were in excess of the bare minimum needed for victory or because the candidate lost. By moving geographic boundaries, the incumbent party packs opposition voters into a few districts they will already win, wasting the extra votes. Other districts are more tightly constructed with the opposition party allowed a bare minority count, thereby wasting all the minority votes for the losing candidate. These districts constitute the majority of districts and are drawn to produce a result favoring the incumbent party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/231865/gerrymandering|title=gerrymandering - politics|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quantitative measure of the effect of gerrymandering is the [[wasted vote#Efficiency gap|efficiency gap]], computed from the difference in the wasted votes for two different political parties summed over all the districts. When the parties win district elections in rough proportion to their electoral popularity, the efficiency gap is near zero.&lt;ref name="82UofCLawReview"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stephanopoulos |first=Nicholas |last2=McGhee |first2=Eric |year=2014 |title=Partisan Gerrymandering and the Efficiency Gap |ssrn=2457468 |journal=University of Chicago Law Review |volume=82 |page=831 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewRepublic20140702"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Stephanopoulos |first=Nicholas |date=July 2, 2014 |title=Here's How We Can End Gerrymandering Once and for All |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118534/gerrymandering-efficiency-gap-better-way-measure-gerrymandering |magazine=The New Republic |access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Citing in part an efficiency gap of 11.69% to 13%, a U.S. District Court in 2016 ruled against the 2011 drawing of Wisconsin legislative districts. In the 2012 election for the state legislature, that gap in wasted votes meant that one party had 48.6% of the two-party votes but won 61% of the 99 districts.&lt;ref name="nyt20161121"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/wisconsin-redistricting-found-to-unfairly-favor-republicans.html |title=Judges Find Wisconsin Redistricting Unfairly Favored Republicans |last=Wines |first=Michael |newspaper=New York Times |publication-date=Nov 21, 2016 |access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the wasted vote effect is strongest when a party wins by narrow margins across multiple districts, gerrymandering narrow margins can be risky when voters are less predictable. To minimize the risk of demographic or political shifts swinging a district to the opposition, politicians can create more packed districts, leading to more comfortable margins in unpacked ones.

===Effect on electoral competition===

[[File:Gerrymandering 9-6.png|thumb|How gerrymandering can influence electoral results on a [[Voting system#Nonproportional and semiproportional methods|non-proportional system]]. For a state with 3 equally sized districts, 15 voters and 2 parties: ''Plum'' (squares) and ''Orange'' (circles).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In '''(a)''', creating 3 mixed-type districts yields a 3–0 win to ''Plum''—a disproportional result considering the statewide 9:6 ''Plum'' majority.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In '''(b)''', ''Orange'' wins the urban district while ''Plum'' wins the rural districts—the 2–1 result reflects the statewide vote ratio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In '''(c)''', gerrymandering techniques ensure a 2–1 win to the statewide minority ''Orange'' party.]]
&lt;!-- We should mention the claim that contention over districts creates a major distraction for the legislature --&gt;

Some political science research suggests that, contrary to common belief, gerrymandering does not decrease electoral competition, and can even increase it. Some say that, rather than packing the voters of their party into uncompetitive districts, party leaders tend to prefer to spread their party's voters into multiple districts, so that their party can win a larger number of races.&lt;ref&gt;Seth E. Masket, Jonathan Winburn and Gerald C. Wright, [https://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8469145&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S1049096511001703 The Gerrymanderers Are Coming! Legislative Redistricting Won't Affect Competition or Polarization Much, No Matter Who Does It].&lt;/ref&gt; (See scenario '''(c)''' in the box.) This may lead to increased competition. Instead of gerrymandering, some researchers find that other factors, such as partisan polarization and the incumbency advantage, have driven the recent decreases in electoral competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forgette|first1=Richard|last2=Winkle|first2=John W.|title=Partisan Gerrymandering and the Voting Rights Act*|journal=Social Science Quarterly|date=March 2006|volume=87|issue=1|pages=155–173|doi=10.1111/j.0038-4941.2006.00374.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 2009 study found that "congressional polarization is primarily a function of the differences in how Democrats and Republicans represent the same districts rather than a function of which districts each party represents or the distribution of constituency preferences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCarty|first1=Nolan|last2=Poole|first2=Keith T.|last3=Rosenthal|first3=Howard|title=Does Gerrymandering Cause Polarization?|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=July 2009|volume=53|issue=3|pages=666–680|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00393.x|url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~miaryc/PEW/Nolan_McCarty_PEWCaltech.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings are, however, a matter of some dispute. While gerrymandering may not decrease electoral competition in all cases, there are certainly instances where gerrymandering does reduce such competition.

One state in which gerrymandering has arguably had an adverse effect on electoral competition is California. In 2000, a bipartisan redistricting effort redrew congressional district lines in ways that all but guaranteed incumbent victories; as a result, California saw only one congressional seat change hands between 2000 and 2010. In response to this obvious gerrymandering, a 2010 referendum in California gave the power to redraw congressional district lines to the [[California Citizens Redistricting Commission]], which had been created to draw California State Senate and Assembly districts by another referendum in 2008. In stark contrast to the redistricting efforts that followed the 2000 census, the redistricting commission has created a number of the most competitive congressional districts in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nagourney |first=Adam |date=14 February 2012 |title=New Faces Set For California in the Capitol  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/us/california-congressional-delegation-braces-for-change.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased incumbent advantage and campaign costs===
The effect of gerrymandering for incumbents is particularly advantageous, as incumbents are far more likely to be reelected under conditions of gerrymandering. For example, in 2002, according to political scientists [[Norman Ornstein]] and [[Thomas E. Mann|Thomas Mann]], only four challengers were able to defeat incumbent members of the U.S. Congress, the lowest number in modern American history.&lt;ref name="7_buck_trust.html"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrists.org/pages/2004/07/7_buck_trust.html |title=Iowa's Redistricting Process: An Example of the Right Way to Draw Legislative |publisher=Centrists.Org |date=22 July 2004 |accessdate=5 August 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107114029/http://www.centrists.org/pages/2004/07/7_buck_trust.html |archivedate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incumbents are likely to be of the majority party orchestrating a gerrymander, and incumbents are usually easily renominated in subsequent elections, including incumbents among the minority.

Mann, a Senior Fellow of Governance Studies at the [[Brookings Institution]], has also noted that "Redistricting is a deeply political process, with incumbents actively seeking to minimize the risk to themselves (via bipartisan gerrymanders) or to gain additional seats for their party (via partisan gerrymanders)".&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Thomas E. "Redistricting Reform." The Brookings Institution. Brookings.edu, 1 June 2005. Web. 5 February 2013. &lt;http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2005/06/01politics-mann&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The bipartisan gerrymandering that Mann mentions refers to the fact that legislators often also draw distorted legislative districts even when such redistricting does not provide an advantage to their party.

Gerrymandering of state legislative districts can effectively guarantee an incumbent's victory by 'shoring up' a district with higher levels of partisan support, without disproportionately benefiting a particular political party. This can be highly problematic from a governance perspective, because forming districts to ensure high levels of partisanship often leads to higher levels of partisanship in legislative bodies. If a substantial number of districts are designed to be polarized, then those districts' representation will also likely act in a heavily partisan manner, which can create and perpetuate partisan gridlock.

This demonstrates that gerrymandering can have a deleterious effect on the principle of democratic accountability. With uncompetitive seats/districts reducing the fear that incumbent politicians may lose office, they have less incentive to represent the interests of their constituents, even when those interests conform to majority support for an issue across the electorate as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Incumbent politicians may look out more for their party's interests than for those of their constituents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Gerrymandering can affect campaign costs for district elections. If districts become increasingly stretched out, candidates must pay increased costs for transportation and trying to develop and present [[campaign advertising]] across a district.{{Citation needed|reason=April 2008|date=April 2008}} The incumbent's advantage in securing campaign funds is another benefit of his or her having a gerrymandered secure seat.

===Less descriptive representation===
Gerrymandering also has significant effects on the [[representation (politics)|representation]] received by voters in gerrymandered districts. Because gerrymandering can be designed to increase the number of wasted votes among the electorate, the relative representation of particular groups can be drastically altered from their actual share of the voting population. This effect can significantly prevent a gerrymandered system from achieving proportional and [[descriptive representation]], as the winners of elections are increasingly determined by who is drawing the districts rather than the preferences of the voters.

Gerrymandering may be advocated to improve representation within the legislature among otherwise underrepresented minority groups by packing them into a single district. This can be controversial, as it may lead to those groups' remaining marginalised in the government as they become confined to a single district. Candidates outside that district no longer need to represent them to win elections.

As an example, much of the redistricting conducted in the United States in the early 1990s involved the intentional creation of additional "majority-minority" districts where racial minorities such as African Americans were packed into the majority. This "maximization policy" drew support by both the Republican Party (who had limited support among African Americans and could concentrate their power elsewhere) and by minority representatives elected as Democrats from these constituencies, who then had safe seats. &lt;!-- cite a famous politician or political scientist that has a good quote of this here --&gt;

The 2012 election provides a number of examples as to how partisan gerrymandering can adversely affect the descriptive function of states' congressional delegations. In Pennsylvania, for example, Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives received 83,000 more votes than Republican candidates, yet the Republican-controlled redistricting process in 2010 resulted in Democrats losing to their Republican counterparts in 13 out of Pennsylvania's 18 districts.&lt;ref&gt;Ting, Jan C. "Boehner and House Republicans Lack Mandate to Oppose Obama." NewsWorks. NewsWorks.Org, 14 December 2012. Web. 5 February 2013.
[https://whyy.org/articles/boehner-and-house-republicans-lack-mandate-to-oppose-obama/]
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seven states where Republicans had complete control over the redistricting process, Republican House candidates received 16.7 million votes and Democratic House candidates received 16.4 million votes. The redistricting resulted in Republican victories in 73 out of the 107 affected seats; in those 7 states, Republicans received 50.4% of the votes but won in over 68% of the congressional districts.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Sam. "The Great Gerrymander of 2012." The New York Times. 2 February 2013. Web. 5 February 2013.
[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sunday/the-great-gerrymander-of-2012.html]
&lt;/ref&gt; While it is but one example of how gerrymandering can have a significant effect on election outcomes, this kind of disproportional representation of the public will seems to be problematic for the legitimacy of democratic systems, regardless of one's political affiliation.

In [[Michigan]], redistricting was constructed by a Republican Legislature in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ballotpedia.org/Redistricting_in_Michigan|title=Redistricting in Michigan|work=ballotpedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Federal congressional districts were so designed that cities such as [[Battle Creek]], [[Grand Rapids]], [[Jackson, Michigan|Jackson]], [[Kalamazoo]], [[Lansing]], and [[East Lansing]] were separated into districts with large conservative-leaning hinterlands that essentially diluted the Democratic votes in those cities in Congressional elections.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Since 2010 not one of those cities is within a district in which a Democratic nominee for the House of Representatives has a reasonable chance of winning, short of Democratic [[Landslide victory|landslide]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}{{clarify|reason=needs rewording. If only a Democratic landslide were needed, why wouldn't a majority vote do the trick? I think editor means "landslide in the respective cities to offset the outlying vote."|date=December 2014}}

===Incumbent gerrymandering===
Gerrymandering can also be done to help incumbents as a whole, effectively turning every district into a packed one and greatly reducing the potential for competitive elections. This is particularly likely to occur when the minority party has significant obstruction power—unable to enact a partisan gerrymander, the legislature instead agrees on ensuring their own mutual reelection.

In an unusual occurrence in 2000, for example, the two dominant parties in the state of California [[Redistricting in California|cooperatively redrew]] both state and Federal legislative districts to preserve the status quo, ensuring the electoral safety of the politicians from unpredictable voting by the electorate. This move proved completely effective, as no State or Federal legislative office changed party in the [[U.S. House election, 2004|2004 election]], although 53 congressional, 20 state senate, and 80 state assembly seats were potentially at risk.

In 2006, the term "70/30 District" came to signify the equitable split of two evenly split (i.e. 50/50) districts. The resulting districts gave each party a guaranteed seat and retained their respective power base.

===Prison-based gerrymandering===
Prison-based gerrymandering occurs when prisoners are counted as residents of a particular district, increasing the district's population with non-voters when assigning political apportionment. This phenomenon violates the principle of [[one person, one vote]] because, although many prisoners come from (and return to) urban communities, they are counted as "residents" of the rural districts that contain large prisons, thereby artificially inflating the political representation in districts with prisons at the expense of voters in all other districts without prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prison-Based Gerrymandering |url=http://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/news/2006/05/20/NYT-gerrymandering |newspaper=The New York Times |type=Editorial |date=20 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others contend that prisoners should not be counted as residents of their original districts when they do not reside there and are [[disenfranchisement|not legally eligible to vote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/NYS_A9710-D.html|title=New York Prison-Based Gerrymandering Bill|first=Prison Policy|last=Initiative|date=|website=www.prisonersofthecensus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/NYS_A11597.html|title=New York Prison-Based Gerrymandering Technical Amendment|first=Prison Policy|last=Initiative|date=|website=www.prisonersofthecensus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes to achieve competitive elections==
[[File:map22007.gif|thumb|250px|Electoral divisions in the Sydney area, drawn by the politically independent [[Australian Electoral Commission]]]]
Due to the perceived issues associated with gerrymandering and its effect on competitive elections and democratic accountability, numerous countries have enacted reforms making the practice either more difficult or less effective. Countries such as the U.K., Australia, Canada and most of those in Europe have transferred responsibility for defining constituency boundaries to neutral or cross-party bodies. In Spain, they are constitutionally fixed since 1978.&lt;ref name="ES_Const" /&gt;

In the United States, however, such reforms are controversial and frequently meet particularly strong opposition from groups that benefit from gerrymandering. In a more neutral system, they might lose considerable influence.

=== Redistricting by neutral or cross-party agency ===
The most commonly advocated electoral reform proposal targeted at gerrymandering is to change the redistricting process. Under these proposals, an independent and presumably objective commission is created specifically for redistricting, rather than having the legislature do it.

This is the system used in the United Kingdom, where the independent [[boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|boundary commissions]] determine the boundaries for [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved legislatures]], subject to ratification by the body in question (almost always granted without debate). A similar situation exists in Australia where the independent [[Australian Electoral Commission]] and its state-based counterparts determine electoral boundaries for federal, state and local jurisdictions.

To help ensure neutrality, members of a redistricting agency may be appointed from relatively apolitical sources such as retired judges or longstanding members of the civil service, possibly with requirements for adequate representation among competing political parties. Additionally, members of the board can be denied access to information that might aid in gerrymandering, such as the demographic makeup or voting patterns of the population.

As a further constraint, [[consensus]] requirements can be imposed to ensure that the resulting district map reflects a wider perception of fairness, such as a requirement for a supermajority approval of the commission for any district proposal. Consensus requirements, however, can lead to deadlock, such as occurred in [[Missouri]] following the 2000 census. There, the equally numbered partisan appointees were unable to reach consensus in a reasonable time, and consequently the courts had to determine district lines.

In the U.S. state of [[Iowa]], the nonpartisan Legislative Services Bureau (LSB, akin to the U.S. [[Congressional Research Service]]) determines boundaries of electoral districts. Aside from satisfying federally mandated contiguity and population equality criteria, the LSB mandates unity of counties and cities. Consideration of political factors such as location of incumbents, previous boundary locations, and political party proportions is specifically forbidden. Since Iowa's counties are chiefly regularly shaped [[polygons]], the LSB process has led to districts that follow county lines.&lt;ref name="7_buck_trust.html"/&gt;

In 2005, the U.S. state of [[Ohio]] had a ballot measure to create an independent commission whose first priority was competitive districts, a sort of "reverse gerrymander". A complex mathematical formula was to be used to determine the competitiveness of a district. The measure failed voter approval chiefly due to voter concerns that communities of interest would be broken up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/2005/11/08/oh/state/issue/4/ |title=Issue 4: Independent Redistricting Process – Ohio State Government |publisher=Smartvoter.org |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the [[Open Our Democracy Act of 2017]] was submitted to the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] by [[John Delaney (Maryland politician)|Rep. Delaney]] as a means to implement non-partisan redistricting.

===Transparency regulations===
When a single political party controls both legislative houses of a state during redistricting, both Democrats and Republicans have displayed a marked propensity for couching the process in secrecy; in May 2010, for example, the Republican National Committee held a redistricting training session in Ohio where the theme was "Keep it Secret, Keep it Safe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2011/12/13/study-of-gop-maps-points-to-politics.html|title= Study of GOP Maps Points to Politics|publisher= Dispatch.com|last1=Siegel|first1= Jim|date= 13 December 2011|access-date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for increased transparency in redistricting processes is clear; a 2012 investigation by The Center for Public Integrity reviewed every state's redistricting processes for both transparency and potential for public input, and ultimately assigned 24 states grades of either D or F.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kusnetz |first=Nicholas |date=1 November 2012 |title=Behind Closed Doors: GOP and Dems Alike Cloaked Redistricting in Secrecy |url=http://openchannel.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/01/14839356-behind-closed-doors-gop-and-dems-alike-cloaked-redistricting-in-secrecy |work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these types of problems, redistricting transparency legislation has been introduced to US Congress a number of times in recent years, including the Redistricting Transparency Acts of 2010, 2011, and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr4918|title=Redistricting Transparency Act of 2010 (2010; 111th Congress H.R. 4918) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr419|title=Redistricting Transparency Act of 2011 (2011; 112th Congress H.R. 419) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr337|title=Redistricting Transparency Act of 2013 (2013; 113th Congress H.R. 337) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such policy proposals aim to increase the transparency and responsiveness of the redistricting systems in the US. The merit of increasing transparency in redistricting processes is based largely on the premise that lawmakers would be less inclined to draw gerrymandered districts if they were forced to defend such districts in a public forum.

===Changing the voting system===
Because gerrymandering relies on the [[wasted vote|wasted-vote effect]], the use of a different voting system with fewer wasted votes can help reduce gerrymandering. In particular, the use of [[multimember district|multi-member districts]] alongside voting systems establishing proportional representation such as [[Single Transferable Voting|single transferable voting]] can reduce wasted votes and gerrymandering. Semi-proportional voting systems such as [[single non-transferable vote]] or [[cumulative voting]] are relatively simple and similar to ''first past the post'' and can also reduce the proportion of wasted votes and thus potential gerrymandering. Electoral reformers have advocated all three as replacement systems.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Richard L. Engstrom, The Single Transferable Vote: An Alternative Remedy for Minority Vote Dilution, 27 U.S.F.L.Rev. 781, 806 (1993) (arguing that the Single Transferable Voting systems maintain minority electoral opportunities); Steven J. Mulroy, Alternative Ways Out: A Remedial Road Map for the Use of Alternative Electoral Systems as Voting Rights Act Remedies, 77 N.C.L.Rev. 1867, 1923 (1999) (concluding that ranked-ballot voting systems avoid minority vote dilution); Steven J. Mulroy, The Way Out: A Legal Standard for Imposing Alternative Electoral Systems as Voting Rights Remedies, 33 Harv.C.R.-C.L.L.Rev. 333, 350 (1998) (arguing that preferential voting systems enhance minority representation); and Alexander Athan Yanos, Note, Reconciling the Right to Vote With the Voting Rights Act, 92 Colum.L.Rev. 1810, 1865–66 (1992) (arguing that Single Transferable Voting serves to preserve the minority party's right to representation).&lt;/ref&gt;

Electoral systems with various forms of proportional representation are now found in nearly all European countries, resulting in multi-party systems (with many parties represented in the parliaments) with higher voter attendance in the elections,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Electoral systems with election of just one winner in each district (i.e., "winner-takes-all" electoral systems) and no proportional distribution of extra mandates to smaller parties tend to create two-party systems ([[Duverger's law]]). In these, just two parties effectively compete in the national elections and thus the national political discussions are forced into a narrow two-party frame, where loyalty and forced statements inside the two parties distort the political debate.{{According to whom|date=October 2013}}

===Changing the size of districts and the elected body===
If a proportional or semi-proportional voting system is used then increasing the number of winners in any given district will reduce the number of wasted votes. This can be accomplished both by merging separate districts together and by increasing the total size of the body to be elected. Since gerrymandering relies on exploiting the wasted vote effect, increasing the number of winners per district can reduce the potential for gerrymandering in proportional systems. Unless all districts are merged, however, this method cannot eliminate gerrymandering entirely.

In contrast to proportional methods, if a nonproportional voting system with multiple winners (such as [[plurality-at-large voting|block voting]]) is used, then increasing the size of the elected body while keeping the number of districts constant will not reduce the amount of wasted votes, leaving the potential for gerrymandering the same. While merging districts together under such a system can reduce the potential for gerrymandering, doing so also amplifies the tendency of block voting to produce [[landslide victory|landslide victories]], creating a similar effect to gerrymandering by concentrating wasted votes among the opposition and denying them representation.

If a system of single-winner elections is used, then increasing the size of the elected body will implicitly increase the number of districts to be created. This change can actually make gerrymandering easier when raising the number of single-winner elections, as opposition groups can be more efficiently packed into smaller districts without accidentally including supporters, further increasing the number of wasted votes amongst the opposition.

===Using fixed districts===
Another way to avoid gerrymandering is simply to stop redistricting altogether and use existing political boundaries such as state, county, or provincial lines. While this prevents future gerrymandering, any existing advantage may become deeply ingrained. The [[United States Senate]], for instance, has more competitive elections than the House of Representatives due to the use of existing state borders rather than gerrymandered districts—Senators are elected by their entire state, while Representatives are elected in legislatively drawn districts.

The use of fixed districts creates an additional problem, however, in that fixed districts do not take into account changes in population. Individual voters can come to have very different degrees of influence on the legislative process. This [[malapportionment]] can greatly affect representation after long periods of time or large population movements. In the United Kingdom during the [[Industrial Revolution]], several constituencies that had been fixed since they gained representation in the Parliament of England became so small that they could be won with only a handful of voters (''[[rotten borough]]s''). Similarly, in the U.S. the state legislature of Alabama refused to redistrict for more than 60 years, despite major changes in population patterns. By 1960 less than a quarter of the state's population controlled the majority of seats in the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Michael McDonald, U.S. Elections Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary [http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm Dept. of Public and International Affairs George Mason University]. Retrieved 6 April 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624024455/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |date=24 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this practice of using fixed districts for state legislatures was effectively banned in the United States after the ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' Supreme Court decision in 1964, establishing a rule of [[one man, one vote]].

===Objective rules to create districts===
Another means to reduce gerrymandering is to create objective, precise criteria to which any district map must comply. Courts in the United States, for instance, have ruled that congressional districts must be contiguous in order to be constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Reynolds v. Sims|Reynolds v. Sims]] states that "a state legislative apportionment scheme may properly give representation to various political subdivisions and provide for compact districts of contiguous territory if substantial equality among districts is maintained." See also [[Reynolds v. Sims|the Wikipedia article]].&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, is not a particularly binding constraint, as very narrow strips of land with few or no voters in them may be used to connect separate regions for inclusion in one district, as is the case in [[Illinois's 4th congressional district]].

Depending on the distribution of voters for a particular party, metrics that maximize compactness can be opposed to metrics that minimize the efficiency gap.  For example, in the United States, voters registered with the Democratic Party tend to be concentrated in cities, potentially resulting in a large number of "wasted" votes if compact districts are drawn around city populations.  Neither of these metrics take into consideration other possible goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hating-gerrymandering-is-easy-fixing-it-is-harder/|title=Hating Gerrymandering Is Easy. Fixing It Is Harder.|first=David|last=Wasserman|date=25 January 2018|website=fivethirtyeight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as proportional representation based on other demographic characteristics (such as race, ethnicity, gender, or income), maximizing competitiveness of elections (the greatest number of districts where party affiliation is 50/50), avoiding splits of existing government units (like cities and counties), and ensuring representation of major interest groups (like farmers or voters in a specific transportation corridor), though any of these could be incorporated into a more complicated metric.

====Minimum district to convex polygon ratio====
One method is to define a minimum district to [[convex polygon]] ratio {{Definition needed|date=July 2016}} . To use this method, every proposed district is circumscribed by the smallest possible convex polygon (similar to the concept of a [[convex hull]]; think of stretching a rubberband around the outline of the district). Then, the area of the district is divided{{elucidate|date=December 2015}} by the area of the polygon; or, if at the edge of the state, by the portion of the area of the polygon within state boundaries.

The advantages of this method are that it allows a certain amount of human intervention to take place (thus solving the Colorado problem of [[#Shortest splitline algorithm|splitline districting]]); it allows the borders of the district to follow existing jagged subdivisions, such as neighbourhoods or voting districts (something isoperimetric rules would discourage); and it allows concave coastline districts, such as the Florida gulf coast area. It would mostly eliminate bent districts, but still permit long, straight ones. However, since human intervention is still allowed, the gerrymandering issues of packing and cracking would still occur, just to a lesser extent.

====Shortest splitline algorithm====
The [[Center for Range Voting]] has proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org/GerryExamples.html |title=Gerrymandering and a cure—shortest splitline algorithm |publisher=RangeVoting.org |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a way to draw districts by a simple [[algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org|title=RangeVoting.org – Center for Range Voting}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm uses only the shape of the state, the number N of districts wanted, and the population distribution as inputs. The algorithm (slightly simplified) is:
# Start with the boundary outline of the state.
# Let N=A+B where N is the number of districts to create, and A and B are two whole numbers, either equal (if N is even) or differing by exactly one (if N is odd). For example, if N is 10, each of A and B would be 5. If N is 7, A would be 4 and B would be 3.
# Among all possible straight lines that split the state into two parts with the population ratio A:B, choose the ''shortest''. If there are two or more such shortest lines, choose the one that is most north-south in direction; if there is still more than one possibility, choose the westernmost.
# We now have two hemi-states, each to contain a specified number (namely A and B) of districts. Handle them recursively via the same splitting procedure.
# Any human residence that is split in two or more parts by the resulting lines is considered to be a part of the most north-eastern of the resulting districts; if this doesn't decide it, then of the most northern.
This district-drawing algorithm has the advantages of simplicity, ultra-low cost, a single possible result (thus no possibility of human interference), lack of intentional bias, and it produces simple boundaries that do not meander needlessly. It has the disadvantage of ignoring geographic features such as rivers, cliffs, and highways and cultural features such as tribal boundaries. This landscape oversight causes it to produce districts different from those a human would produce. Ignoring geographic features can induce very simple boundaries.

While most districts produced by the method will be fairly compact and either roughly rectangular or triangular, some of the resulting districts can still be long and narrow strips (or triangles) of land.

Like most automatic redistricting rules, the shortest splitline algorithm will fail to create majority-minority districts, for both ethnic and political minorities, if the minority populations are not very compact. This might reduce minority representation.

Another criticism of the system is that splitline districts sometimes divide and diffuse the voters in a large metropolitan area. This condition is most likely to occur when one of the first splitlines cuts through the metropolitan area. It is often considered a drawback of the system because residents of the same agglomeration are assumed to be a community of common interest. This is most evident in the splitline allocation of [[Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rangevoting.org/SSHR/co_final.png&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2007, shortest-splitline redistricting pictures, based on the results of the 2000 census, are available for all 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org/SplitLR.html |title=Splitline districtings of all 50 states + DC + PR |publisher=RangeVoting.org |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Minimum isoperimetric quotient====
{{See also|Compactness measure of a shape|Polsby-Popper Test}}
It is possible to define a specific minimum [[Isoperimetric inequality|isoperimetric quotient]],&lt;ref name="siam.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siam.org/pdf/news/1237.pdf |title=James Case "Flagrant Gerrymandering: Help from the Isoperimetric Theorem?" |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; proportional to the ratio between the area and the square of the perimeter of any given congressional voting district. Although technologies presently exist to define districts in this manner, there are no rules in place mandating their use, and no national movement to implement such a policy. One problem with the simplest version of this rule is that it would prevent incorporation of jagged natural boundaries, such as rivers or mountains; when such boundaries are required, such as at the edge of a state, certain districts may not be able to meet the required minima. One way of avoiding this problem is to allow districts which share a border with a state border to replace that border with a polygon or semi-circle enclosing the state boundary as a kind of virtual boundary definition, but using the actual perimeter of the district whenever this occurs inside the state boundaries. Enforcing a minimum isoperimetric quotient would encourage districts with a high ratio between area and perimeter.&lt;ref name="siam.org"/&gt;

====Efficiency Gap calculation====
{{see also|Wasted vote#Efficiency gap}}
The efficiency gap is a simply-calculable measure that can show the effects of gerrymandering.&lt;ref name=The New Republic: "Here's How We Can End Gerrymandering Once and for All"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118534/gerrymandering-efficiency-gap-better-way-measure-gerrymandering |title=Here's How We Can End Gerrymandering Once and for All |author=Nicholas Stephanopoulas |date= |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It measures wasted votes for each party: the sum of votes cast in losing districts (losses due to cracking) and excess votes cast in winning districts (losses due to packing).  The difference in these wasted votes are divided by total votes cast, and the resulting percentage is the efficiency gap.

==Use of databases and computer technology==
{{See also|Geographic information system}}
The introduction of modern computers alongside the development of elaborate [[voter database]]s and special districting software has made gerrymandering a far more precise science. Using such databases, political parties can obtain detailed information about every household including political party registration, previous campaign donations, and the number of times residents voted in previous elections and combine it with other predictors of voting behavior such as age, income, race, or education level. With this data, gerrymandering politicians can predict the voting behavior of each potential district with an astonishing degree of precision, leaving little chance for creating an accidentally competitive district.

On the other hand, the introduction of modern computers would let the United States Census Bureau to calculate more equal populations in every voting district that are based only on districts being the most compact and equal populations.  This could be done easily using their Block Centers based on the Global Positioning System rather than street addresses.  With this data, gerrymandering politicians will not be in charge, thus allowing competitive districts again.

Online web apps such as [[Dave's Redistricting]] have allowed any citizen to redistrict [[U.S. state|states]] into legislative districts as they wish &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bradlee |first1=Dave |title=Dave Bradlee |url=http://gardow.com/davebradlee/default.html |website=Gardow.com |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wang |first1=Sam |title=The Great Gerrymander of 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sunday/the-great-gerrymander-of-2012.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bradlee, the software was designed to "put power in people's hands," and so that they "can see how the process works, so it's a little less mysterious than it was 10 years ago." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Korte |first1=Gregory |title=Technology allows citizens to be part of redistricting process |url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-03-21-redistricting21_ST_N.htm |website=USA Today |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International examples of gerrymandering==
Several western democracies, notably [[Israel]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]] employ an electoral system with only one (nationwide) voting district for election of national representatives. This virtually precludes gerrymandering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/cards/gerrymandering-explained/how-do-other-countries-handle-redistricting|title=How do other countries handle redistricting?|author=|date=15 April 2014|website=vox.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://knesset.gov.il/description/eng/eng_mimshal_beh.htm|title=The Electoral System in Israel|author=|accessdate=8 October 2018|website=Official Website of the Knesset}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other European countries such as [[Austria]], the [[Czech Republic]] or [[Sweden]], among many others, have electoral districts with fixed boundaries (usually one district for each administrative division). The number of representatives for each district can change after a census due to population shifts, but their boundaries do not change. This also effectively eliminates gerrymandering.

Additionally, many countries where the president is directly elected by the citizens (e.g. [[France]], [[Poland]], among others) use only one electoral district for presidential election, despite using multiple districts to elect representatives.

===Australia===
Gerrymandering has not typically been considered a problem in the [[Electoral system of Australia|Australian electoral system]] largely because drawing of electoral boundaries has typically been done by non-partisan [[Australian Electoral Commission|electoral commissions]]. There have been historical cases of [[malapportionment]], whereby the distribution of electors to electorates was not in proportion to the population [[Electoral system of Australia#Gerrymandering and malapportionment|in several states]]. For example, [[Thomas Playford IV|Sir Thomas Playford]] was [[Premiers of the Australian states|Premier]] of [[South Australia]] from 1938 to 1965 as a result of a system of malapportionment, which became known as the [[Playmander]], despite it not strictly speaking involving a gerrymander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Tilby Stock|first = Jenny|year = 1996|chapter = The 'Playmander': its origins, operations and effect on South Australia|editor1-last = O'Neil|editor1-first = Bernard|editor2-last = Raftery|editor2-first = Judith|editor3-last = Round|editor3-first = Kerrie|title = Playford's South Australia: Essays on the History of South Australia, 1933–1968|publisher = Association of Professional Historians|pages = 73–90|isbn = 0646290924}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the nominally independent South Australian Electoral Districts Boundaries Commission has been accused of favouring the [[Australian Labor Party]], as the party has been able to form government in four of the last seven elections, despite receiving a lower two-party preferred vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nocookies |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/liberals-blocked-by-unfair-boundaries-says-downer/story-e6frgczx-1226856356689 |work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Queensland]], malapportionment combined with a gerrymander under Premier Sir [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] became nicknamed the [[Bjelkemander]] in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orr|first1=Graham D.|last2=Levy|first2=Ron|title=Electoral Malapportionment: Partisanship, Rhetoric and Reform in the Shadow of the Agrarian Strong-Man|journal=[[Griffith Law Review]]|year=2009|volume=18|issue=18|pages=638–665|ssrn=1579826}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the system, electoral boundaries were drawn so that rural electorates had as few as half as many voters as metropolitan ones and regions with high levels of support for the opposition [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] were concentrated into fewer electorates, allowing Bjelke-Petersen's [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] (later National Party) led Coalition government to remain in power despite attracting substantially less than 50% of the vote. In the [[Queensland state election, 1986|1986 election]], for example, the National Party received 39.64% of the first preference vote and won 49 seats (in the 89 seat legislature) whilst the Labor Opposition received 41.35% but won only 30 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.uwa.edu.au/elecdetail.lasso?keyvalue=801|title=Parliament of Queensland, Assembly election, 1 November 1986|author=Australian Government and Politics Database|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the Liberals/Nationals still received a greater combined share of the vote than the Labor opposition because the system also worked against the Liberal representation.

===Canada===
Early in [[Canada|Canadian]] history, both the federal and provincial levels used gerrymandering to try to maximise partisan power. When [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] were admitted to Confederation in 1905, their original district boundaries were set forth in the respective [[Alberta Act|Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan Act]]s. These boundaries had been devised by federal [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] members to ensure the election of provincial Liberal governments.

Since responsibility for drawing federal and provincial electoral boundaries was handed over to independent agencies, this problem has largely been eliminated at these levels of government. [[Manitoba]] was the first province to authorise a non-partisan group to define constituency boundaries in the 1950s. In 1964, the federal government delegated the drawing of boundaries for national seats to the "arm's length" [[Elections Canada]].

As a result, gerrymandering is not generally a major issue in Canada except at the civic level. Although city wards are recommended by independent agencies, city councils occasionally overrule them. This is much more likely where the city is not homogenous and different neighbourhoods have sharply different opinions about city policy direction.

In 2006, a controversy arose in [[Prince Edward Island]] over the provincial government's decision to throw out an electoral map drawn by an independent commission. Instead they created two new maps. The government adopted the second of these, designed by the [[caucus]] of the governing party. Opposition parties and the media attacked Premier [[Pat Binns]] for what they saw as gerrymandering of districts. Among other things, the government adopted a map that ensured that every current [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] from the premier's party had a district to run in for re-election, whereas in the original map, several had been redistricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No Christmas election: Binns |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/prince-edward-island/story/2006/11/16/binns-fall.html? |work=[[cbc.ca]] |date=16 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702191517/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/prince-edward-island/story/2006/11/16/binns-fall.html? |archive-date=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, in the [[Prince Edward Island general election, 2007|2007 provincial election]] only seven of 20 incumbent Members of the Legislative Assembly were re-elected (seven did not run for re-election), and the government was defeated.

===Chile===

The military government which ruled [[Chile]] from 1973 to 1990 was ousted in a [[Chilean national plebiscite, 1988|national plebiscite]] in October 1988. Opponents of General [[Augusto Pinochet]] voted NO to remove him from power and to trigger democratic elections, while supporters (mostly from the right-wing) voted YES to keep him in office for another eight years.

Five months prior to the plebiscite, the regime published a law regulating future elections and referendums, but the configuration of electoral districts and the manner in which Congress seats would be awarded were only added to the law seven months after the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=30082&amp;tipoVersion=0 |title=LEY-18700 06-MAY-1988 MINISTERIO DEL INTERIOR |publisher=Leychile.cl |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idLey=18799 |title=LEY-18799 26-MAY-1989 MINISTERIO DEL INTERIOR |publisher=Leychile.cl |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] (lower house), [[Electoral division of Chile|60 districts]] were drawn by grouping (mostly) neighboring [[Communes of Chile|communes]] (the smallest administrative subdivision in the country) within the same [[Regions of Chile|region]] (the largest). It was established that two deputies would be elected per district, with the most voted coalition needing to outpoll its closest rival by a margin of more than 2-to-1 to take both seats. The results of the 1988 plebiscite show that neither the "NO" side nor the "YES" side outpolled the other by said margin in any of the newly established districts. They also showed that the vote/seat ratio was lower in districts which supported the "YES" side and higher in those where the "NO" was strongest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flacsochile.org/biblioteca/pub/memoria/1989/000261.pdf Documento de trabajo. Programa FLACSO-Chile. Número 428, septiembre 1989]. FLACSO Chile Biblioteca.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-090X2005000200004&amp;script=sci_arttext|title=Representación y tamaño de los distritos electorales en Chile, 1988-2002|author=Rojas, Priscilla and Patricio Navia|language=Spanish|date=2005|publisher=Revista de ciencia política (Santiago)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, at the 1989 parliamentary election, the center-left opposition was able to capture both seats (the so-called ''doblaje'') in twelve out of 60 districts, winning control of 60% of the Chamber.

[[Senate of Chile|Senate]] constituencies were created by grouping all lower-chamber districts in a region, or by dividing a region into two constituencies of contiguous lower-chamber districts. The 1980 Constitution allocated a number of seats to appointed senators, making it harder for one side to change the Constitution by itself. The opposition won 22 senate seats in the 1989 election, taking both seats in three out of 19 constituencies, controlling 58% of the elected Senate, but only 47% of the full Senate. The unelected senators were eliminated in the 2005 constitutional reforms, but the electoral map has remained largely untouched (two new regions were created in 2007, one of which altered the composition of two senatorial constituencies; the first election to be affected by this minor change took place in 2013).

===France===
France is one of the few countries to let legislatures redraw the map with no check.&lt;ref&gt;Balinski &amp; Baïou (2002), ''Découpage électoral'', Pour la science&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the legislature sets up an executive commission. Districts called ''arrondissements'' were used in the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] and under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] they are called ''circonscriptions''. During the Third Republic, some reforms of arrondissements, which were also used for administrative purposes, were largely suspected to have been arranged to favour the kingmaker in the Assembly, the [[Parti radical]].

The dissolution of [[Seine (department)|Seine]] and [[Seine-et-Oise]] départements was seen as a case of Gerrymandering to counter communist's influence around Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://21maps.com/quand-la-politique-decoupe-la-geographie|title=Quand la politique découpe la géographie • 21Maps|author=|date=15 March 2018|website=21maps.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern regime, there were three designs: in 1958 (regime change), 1987 (by [[Charles Pasqua]]) and 2010 (by [[Alain Marleix]]), three times by conservative governments. Pasqua's drawing was known to have been particularly good at gerrymandering, resulting in 80% of the seats with 58% of the vote in [[French legislative election, 1993|1993]], and forcing Socialists [[French legislative election, 1997|in the 1997 snap election]] to enact multiple pacts with smaller parties in order to win again, this time as a coalition. In 2010, the Sarkozy government created 12 districts for expats.

The [[Conseil Constitutionnel|Constitutional council]] was called twice by the opposition to decide about gerrymandering, but it never considered partisan disproportions. However, it forced the Marleix committee to respect an 80–120% population ratio, ending a tradition dating back to the Revolution in which ''départements'', however small in population, would send at least two MPs.

Gerrymandering in France is also done against regionalist parties. ''Départements'' are always used even if they split urban areas or larger identity territories, and smaller identity divisions are avoided.

===Germany===
When the electoral districts in Germany were redrawn in 2000, the ruling center-left Social Democratic Party ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) was accused of gerrymandering to marginalise the left-wing [[Left Party (Germany)|PDS]] party. The SPD combined traditional PDS strongholds in eastern Berlin with new districts made up of more populous areas of western Berlin, where the PDS had very limited following.

After having won four seats in Berlin in the 1998 national election, the PDS was able to retain only two seats altogether in the 2002 elections. Under German electoral law, a political party has to win either more than five percent of the votes, or at least three directly elected seats, to qualify for top-up seats under the [[Additional Member System]]. The PDS vote fell below five percent thus they failed to qualify for top-up seats and were confined to just two members of the [[Bundestag]], the German federal parliament (elected representatives are always allowed to hold their seats as individuals). Had they won a third constituency, the PDS would have gained at least 25 additional seats, which would have been enough to hold the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in the Bundestag.

In the election of 2005, [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (successor of the PDS) gained 8.7% of the votes and thus qualified for top-up seats.

&lt;!--Ugly paragraph and very confusing—needs more explanation--&gt;The number of Bundestag seats of parties which traditionally get over 5% of the votes cannot be affected very much by gerrymandering, because seats are awarded to these parties on a proportional basis. However, when a party wins so many districts in any one of the 16 federal states that those seats alone count for more than its proportional share of the vote in that same state does the districting have some influence on larger parties—those extra seats, called "[[Overhang seat|Überhangmandate]]", remain. In the Bundestag election of 2009, Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU gained 24 such extra seats, while no other party gained any; this skewed the result so much that the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] issued two rulings declaring the existing election laws invalid and requiring the Bundestag to pass a new law limiting such extra seats to no more than 15. In 2013, Germany's Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of Überhangmandate, which from then on have to be added in proportion to the second vote of each party thereby making it impossible that one party can have more seats than earned by the proportionate votes in the election.

===Greece===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
Gerrymandering has been rather common in [[Greece|Greek]] history since organised parties with national ballots only appeared after the 1926 Constitution.{{clarify|reason=Why was it common if there were no parties? Also, why was there then only one case BEFORE it?|date=October 2013}} The only case before that was the creation of the Piraeus electoral district in 1906, in order to give the Theotokis party a safe district.

The most infamous case of gerrymandering{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} was in the [[Greek legislative election, 1956|1956 election]]. While in previous elections the districts were based on the [[prefecture]] level (νομός),{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} for 1956 the country was split in districts of varying sizes, some being the size of prefectures, some the size of sub-prefectures (επαρχία) and others somewhere in between. In small districts the winning party would take all seats, in intermediate size it would take most and there was proportional representation in the largest districts. The districts were created in such a way that small districts were those that traditionally voted for the right while large districts were those that voted against the right.

This system has become known as the three-phase (τριφασικό) system or the [[baklava]] system (because, as baklava is split into full pieces and corner pieces, the country was also split into disproportionate pieces). The opposition, being composed of the center and the left, formed a coalition with the sole intent of changing the electoral law and then calling new elections, despite the fact that only seven years earlier the center and the left had fought each other in the [[Greek Civil War]]. Even though the centrist and leftist opposition won the popular vote (1,620,007 votes against 1,594,992), the right wing [[National Radical Union|ERE]] won the majority of seats (165 to 135) and was to lead the country for the next two years.

===Hong Kong===
In [[Hong Kong]], functional constituencies are demarcated by the government and defined in statutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org|title=''Legislative Council Ordinance''|work=hklii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; making them prone to gerrymandering. The functional constituency for the information technology sector was particular criticised for gerrymandering and voteplanting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a%3Do%26d%3D5000859099 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525081357/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=5000859099 |archivedate=25 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
In 2011, [[Fidesz]] politician [[János Lázár]] has proposed a redesign to Hungarian voting districts; considering the territorial results of previous elections, this redesign would favor right-wing politics according to the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2011/11/28/igy_lesz_jobboldali_magyarorszag/ |title=Index – Belföld – Így lesz jobboldali Magyarország |publisher=Index.hu |date= |accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.policysolutions.hu/userfiles/elemzesek/PID_Hungarian%20Politics%20In-Depth_2011_Week48.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426070629/http://www.policysolutions.hu/userfiles/elemzesek/PID_Hungarian%20Politics%20In-Depth_2011_Week48.pdf |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the law has been passed by the Fidesz-majority Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2011/12/23/elfogadtak_az_uj_valasztojogi_torvenyt/ |title=Index – Belföld – Elfogadták az új választójogi törvényt |publisher=Index.hu |date= |accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Formerly it took twice as many votes to gain a seat in some election districts as in some others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hornyák József: |url=http://www.vg.hu/kozelet/vg_online/kozelet_-_belfold/090112_capital_255559 |title=Fellebbez a Political Capital a választókerületi aránytalanságok miatt &amp;#124; Közélet &amp;#124; Világgazdaság Online |publisher=Vg.hu |date= |accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
Until the 1980s [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] boundaries in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] were drawn not by an independent commission but by government ministers. Successive arrangements by governments of all political characters have been attacked as gerrymandering. Ireland uses the [[single transferable vote]] and as well as the actual boundaries drawn the main tool of gerrymandering has been the number of seats per constituency used, with three-seat constituencies normally benefiting the strongest parties in an area, whereas four-seat constituencies normally help smaller parties.

In 1947 the rapid rise of new party [[Clann na Poblachta]] threatened the position of the governing party [[Fianna Fáil]]. The government of [[Éamon de Valera]] introduced the [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 1947]], which increased the size of the Dáil from 138 to 147 and increased the number of three-seat constituencies from fifteen to twenty-two. The result was described by the journalist and historian [[Tim Pat Coogan]] as "a blatant attempt at gerrymander which no [[Northern Ireland|Six County]] Unionist could have bettered."&lt;ref name="coogan637"&gt;Tim Pat Coogan, ''De Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' (Hutchinson, London, 1993) hardback. page 637 {{ISBN|0-09-175030-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following February the [[Irish general election, 1948|1948 general election]] was held and Clann na Poblachta secured ten seats instead of the nineteen they would have received proportional to their vote.&lt;ref name="coogan637" /&gt;

In the mid-1970s, the Minister for Local Government, [[James Tully (Irish politician)|James Tully]], attempted to arrange the constituencies to ensure that the governing [[Fine Gael]]–[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] [[Government of the 20th Dáil|National Coalition]] would win a parliamentary majority. The [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 1974]] was planned as a major reversal of previous gerrymandering by Fianna Fáil (then in opposition). Tully ensured that there were as many as possible three-seat constituencies where the governing parties were strong, in the expectation that the governing parties would each win a seat in many constituencies, relegating Fianna Fáil to one out of three.

In areas where the governing parties were weak, four-seat constituencies were used so that the governing parties had a strong chance of still winning two. The election results created substantial change, as there was a larger than expected collapse in the vote. Fianna Fáil won a landslide victory in the [[Irish general election, 1977]], two out of three seats in many cases, relegating the National Coalition parties to fight for the last seat. Consequently, the term "[[Tullymandering]]" was used to describe the phenomenon of a failed attempt at gerrymandering.

===Kuwait===
From the years 1981 until 2005, Kuwait was divided into 25 electoral districts in order to over-represent the government's supporters (the 'tribes').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asafas.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kias/pdf/kb4_1and2/08hiramatsu.pdf|title=The Changing Nature of the Parliamentary System in Kuwait|page=63 &amp; 70|quote=Due to the gerrymandering on the part of the government, the "tribes" from the 1980s onwards, came to occupy a significant number of seats in the National Assembly.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005, a new law for electoral reforms was approved which prevented electoral gerrymandering by cutting the number of electoral districts from 25 to 5. 
The government of Kuwait found that 5 electoral districts resulted in a powerful parliament with the majority representing the opposition. A new law was crafted by the government of Kuwait and signed by the Amir to gerrymander the districts to 10 allowing the government's supporters to regain the majority.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Malaysia===
{{see also|List of Malaysian electoral districts}}
The practice of gerrymandering has been around in the country since its independence in 1957. The ruling coalition at that time, ''[[Barisan Nasional]]'' (BN; English: "National Front"), has been accused of controlling the election commission by revising the boundaries of constituencies. For example, during the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|13th General Election in 2013]], Barisan Nasional won 60% of the seats in the Malaysian Parliament despite only receiving 47% of the popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=9 August 2014|title=What's Malay for gerrymandering?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21611139-years-delineation-electoral-boundaries-will-determine-future-malaysian-politics-whats|newspaper=The Economist|location=Kuala Lumpur|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malapportionment has also been used at least since 1974, when it was observed that in one state alone (Perak), the parliamentary constituency with the most voters had more than ten times as many voters as the one with the fewest voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ongkianming.com/2013/07/19/press-statement-malaysia-among-the-most-malapportioned-countries-in-the-world/ |title=Malaysia among the most malapportioned countries in the world |last=Yang Berhomat Dr. Ong |first=Kiang Ming MP|date=2013-07-19 |accessdate=2016-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These practices finally failed BN in the [[Malaysian general election, 2018|14th General Election]] on May 9, 2018, when the opposing ''[[Pakatan Harapan]]'' (PH; English: "Alliance of Hope") won despite perceived efforts of gerrymandering and malapportionment from the incumbent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.nl/malaysia-election-results-details-who-won-2018-5/|title=In a historic election, Malaysia's allegedly corrupt prime minister lost to his 92-year-old former mentor who ran on behalf of a man he put in jail|date=2018-05-10|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta===
The Labour Party that won in 1981, even though the Nationalist Party got the most votes, did so because of its gerrymandering. A 1987 constitutional amendment prevented that situation from reoccurring.

===Nepal===
After the restoration of democracy in 1990, Nepali politics has well exercised the practice of gerrymandering with the view to take advantage in the election. It was often practised by [[Nepali Congress]], which remained in power in most of the time. Learning from this, the reshaping of constituency was done for constituent assembly and the opposition now wins elections.

===Philippines===
[[Legislative districts of the Philippines|Congressional districts in the Philippines]] were originally based on an ordinance from the 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution]], which was created by the Constitutional Commission, which was ultimately based on legislative districts as they were drawn in 1907. The same constitution gave [[Congress of the Philippines]] the power to legislate new districts, either through a national redistricting bill or piecemeal redistricting per province or city. Congress has never passed a national redistricting bill since the approval of the 1987 constitution, while it has incrementally created 34 new districts, out of the 200 originally created in 1987.

This allows Congress to create new districts once a place reaches 250,000 inhabitants, the minimum required for its creation. With this, local dynasties, through congressmen, can exert influence in the district-making process by creating bills carving new districts from old ones. In time, as the population of the Philippines increases, these districts, or groups of it, will be the basis of carving new provinces out of existing ones.

An example was in [[Camarines Sur]], where two districts were divided into three districts which allegedly favors the Andaya and the Arroyo families; it caused Rolando Andaya and [[Dato Arroyo]], who would have otherwise run against each other, run in separate districts, with one district allegedly not even surpassing the 250,000-population minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/558593/noynoy-hits-creation-camarines-sur-district-dato |title= Noynoy hits creation of Camarines Sur district for Dato |date=18 March 2010 |first=Aurea |last=Calica |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] later ruled that the 250,000 population minimum does not apply to an additional district in a province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/564542/supreme-court-ruling-camsur-clears-senate |title=  'Supreme Court ruling on Camsur clears Senate' |date=9 April 2010 |first=Christina |last=Mendez |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting splits would later be the cause of another gerrymander, where the province would be split into a new province called [[Nueva Camarines]]; the bill was defeated in the Senate in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/regions/06/08/13/senate-fails-pass-nueva-camarines-measure |title=Senate fails to pass Nueva Camarines measure |date=8 June 2013 |first=Christina |last=Mendez |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |publisher=ABS-CBNnews.com |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Singapore]] --&gt;
In recent decades, critics have accused the ruling [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) of unfair electoral practices to maintain significant majorities in the [[Parliament of Singapore]]. Among the complaints are that the government uses gerrymandering.&lt;ref&gt;[[Channel NewsAsia]], "More detailed explanation needed to fend off gerrymandering claims: Analysts", August 3, 2015. http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-detailed-explanation/2007228.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Elections Department]] was established as part of the executive branch under the [[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)|Prime Minister of Singapore]], rather than as an independent body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmo.gov.sg/AboutPMOffice/OurDepartments/ Prime Minister's Office], Our Departments {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607102642/http://www.pmo.gov.sg/AboutPMOffice/OurDepartments/ |date=7 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have accused it of giving the ruling party the power to decide polling districts and polling sites through electoral engineering, based on poll results in previous elections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ve4vY9ZosRMC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Electoral+engineering+in+Singapore&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Electoral Engineering: Voting Rules and Political Behavior], Pippa Norris&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of opposition parties claim that the [[Group Representation Constituency]] system is "synonymous to gerrymandering", pointing out examples of [[Cheng San Group Representation Constituency|Cheng San GRC]] and [[Eunos Group Representation Constituency|Eunos GRC]] which were dissolved by the Elections Department with voters redistributed to other constituencies after opposition parties gained ground in elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lim |first1=Lydia |last2=Hussain |first2=Zakir |date=2 August 2008 |title=Insight: GRCs: 20 years on |url=https://wpsn.wordpress.com/2008/08/02/st-02-08-2008/ |newspaper=Straits Times |location=Singapore |access-date=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spain ===
Until the establishment of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] in [[1931]], [[Spain]] used both single-member and multi-member constituencies in general elections. Multi-member constituencies were only used in some big cities. Some gerrymandering examples included the districts of [[Vilademuls]] or [[Torroella de Montgrí]] in [[Catalonia]]. These districts were created in order to prevent the [[Federal Democratic Republican Party]] to win a seat in [[Figueres]] or [[La Bisbal]] and [[Turno|to secure a seat to the dynastic parties]]. Since [[Second Spanish Republic|1931]], the constituency boundaries match the [[Provinces of Spain|province]] boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Balcells |first1=Albert |last2=B.

{{main|Elections in Spain}}

After the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist dictatorship]], during the [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition to democracy]], these fixed provincial constituencies were reestablished in Section 68.2 of the current [[Constitution of Spain|1978 Spanish Constitution]],&lt;ref name="ES_Const"&gt;{{cite book |title=Constitution of Spain in English |date=1978 |publisher=Government of Spain |location=Madrid |page=35 |url=http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Hist_Normas/Norm/const_espa_texto_ingles_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; so gerrymandering is impossible in general elections. There are not ''[[Single-member district|winner-takes-all]]'' elections in Spain except for the tiny territories of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] (which only have one representative each); everywhere else the number of representatives assigned to a constituency is [[proportional representation|proportional]] to its population and calculated according to a national law, so tampering with under- or over-representation is difficult too.

[[Spain (European Parliament constituency)|European]], [[Autonomous communities of Spain|regional]] and municipal elections are held under single, [[at-large]] multi-member constituencies with [[proportional representation]] and gerrymandering is not possible either.

=== Sri Lanka ===
Sri Lanka's new [[Local government in Sri Lanka|Local Government]] elections process has been the talking point of gerrymandering since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=138097|title=The Island|last=|first=|date=|website=www.island.lk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though that talk was more about the ward-level, it is also seen in some local council areas too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lgpc.gov.lk/downloads/2017Feb_WardMaps/VAVUNIYA/05_Vavuniya_VavuniyaSouth(Sinhala)PS.pdf|title=Ward Map of Vavuniya South (Sinhala) Pradeshiya Sabha - Vavuniya District|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lgpc.gov.lk/downloads/2017Feb_WardMaps/VAVUNIYA/04_Vavuniya_VavuniyaSouth(Tamil)PS.jpg|title=Ward Map of Vavuniya South (Tamil) Pradeshiya Sabha - Vavuniya District|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sudan===
In the most recent election of 2010, there were numerous examples of gerrymandering throughout the entire country of [[Sudan]]. A report from the Rift Valley Institute uncovered violations of Sudan's electoral law, where constituencies were created that were well below and above the required limit. According to Sudan's National Elections Act of 2008, no constituency can have a population that is 15% greater or less than the average constituency size. The Rift Valley Report uncovered a number of constituencies that are in violation of this rule. Examples include constituencies in Jonglei, Warrap, South Darfur, and several other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riftvalley.net/resources/file/Electoral%20Designs%20-%20Report%20on%20elections%20in%20Sudan.pdf |title=Rift Valley Report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426171620/http://www.riftvalley.net/resources/file/Electoral%20Designs%20-%20Report%20on%20elections%20in%20Sudan.pdf |archivedate=26 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
Turkey has used gerrymandering in İstanbul in 2009 municipal elections. Just before the election İstanbul is divided in new counties. Large low income boroughs are bundled with rich boroughs to win municipal elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/akp-redraws-turkey-despite-opposition-ire-34521|title=AKP redraws Turkey despite opposition ire|last=|first=|date=2012|work=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=16 January 2018|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====Northern Ireland====
Gerrymandering (Irish: ''Claonroinnt'') is widely considered to have been introduced after the establishment of [[Irish Home Rule|Home Rule]] in [[Northern Ireland]] in 1921, favouring [[Irish unionism|Unionists]] who tended to be Protestant, to the detriment of [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalists]] who were mostly [[Roman Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholic]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Some critics and supporters spoke at the time of  "[[A Protestant Parliament for a Protestant People]]". This passed also into local government. [[Stephen Gwynn]] had noted as early as 1911 that since the introduction of the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In [[County Armagh|Armagh]] there are 68,000 Protestants, 56,000 Catholics. The County Council has twenty-two Protestants and eight Catholics. In [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], Catholics are a majority of the population, 82,000 against 68,000; but the electoral districts have been so arranged that Unionists return sixteen as against thirteen Nationalists (one a Protestant). This Council gives to the Unionists two to one majority on its Committees, and out of fifty-two officials employs only five Catholics. In [[County Antrim|Antrim]], which has the largest Protestant majority (196,000 to 40,000), twenty-six Unionists and three Catholics are returned. Sixty officers out of sixty-five are good Unionists and Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn S.L. ''The Case for Home Rule'' (1911) pp. 104–105. (http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/E900030.html book text here; accessed August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s, the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] created new electoral boundaries for the [[Londonderry County Borough Council]] to ensure election of a [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionist]] council in a city where [[Irish nationalism|Nationalists]] had a large majority and had won [[Londonderry County Borough Council election, 1920|previous elections]].&lt;ref name="whyte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm |title=CAIN: Issues – Discrimination: John Whyte, 'How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921–1968?' |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially local parties drew the boundaries, but in the 1930s the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|province-wide government]] redrew them to reinforce the gerrymander.&lt;ref name="whyte" /&gt; However, in the 1967 election, Unionists won 35.5% of the votes and received 60% of the seats, while Nationalists got 27.4% of the votes but received 40% of the seats. This meant that both the Unionist and Nationalist parties were over-represented, while the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] and [[Independent politician|Independents]] (amounting to more than 35% of the votes cast) were severely under-represented.

From the outset, Northern Ireland had installed the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) system in order to secure fair elections in terms of proportional representation in its [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]]. After two elections under that system, [[House of Commons (Method of Voting and Redistribution of Seats) Act (Northern Ireland) 1929|in 1929]] Stormont changed the electoral system to be the same as the rest of the [[United Kingdom]]: a single-member [[first past the post]] system. The only exception was for the election of four Stormont MPs to represent the [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's University of Belfast]]. Some scholars believe that the boundaries were gerrymandered to under-represent Nationalists.&lt;ref name="coogan637"/&gt; Other geographers and historians, for instance Professor [[John H. Whyte]], disagree.&lt;ref name="whyte" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/hnihoc.htm |title=Northern Ireland House of Commons, 1921–1972 |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have argued that the electoral boundaries for the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] were not gerrymandered to a greater level than that produced by any single-winner election system, and that the actual number of Nationalist MPs barely changed under the revised system (it went from 12 to 11 and later went back up to 12). Most observers have acknowledged that the change to a single-winner system was a key factor, however, in stifling the growth of smaller political parties, such as the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] and [[Independent Unionist]]s.

After Westminster reintroduced direct rule in 1973, it restored the single transferable vote (STV) for elections to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] in the following year, using the same definitions of constituencies as for the Westminster Parliament. Currently in Northern Ireland, all elections use STV except those for positions in the [[Westminster Parliament]], which follow the pattern in the rest of the United Kingdom by using "first past the post."

====Boundary Review====
The number of electors in a [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|United Kingdom constituency]] can vary considerably, with the smallest constituency currently (2017 electoral register) having fewer than a fifth of the electors of the largest (Scotland's Na h-Eileanan an Iar (21,769 constituents) and Orkney and Shetland (34,552), compared to England's North West Cambridgeshire (93,223) and Isle of Wight (110,697)). This variation has resulted from:
* [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] being favoured in the Westminster Parliament with deliberately smaller electoral quotas (average electors per constituency) than those in [[England]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. This inequality was initiated by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1958, which eliminated the previous common electoral quota for the whole United Kingdom and replaced it with four separate national quotas for the respective Boundaries commissions to work to: England 69,534; Northern Ireland 67,145, Wales 58,383 and in Scotland only 54,741 electors.
* Current rules historically favouring geographically "natural"{{clarify|date=April 2014}} districts, this continues to give proportionally greater representation to Wales and Scotland.
* Population migrations, due to [[white flight]] and [[deindustrialization]] tending to decrease the number of electors in inner-city districts.

Under the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]], the [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|Coalition government]] planned to review and redraw the parliamentary constituency boundaries for the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]]. The review and redistricting was to be carried out by the [[boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|four UK boundary commissions]] to produce a reduction from 650 to 600 seats, and more uniform sizes, such that a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] was to have no fewer than 70,583 and no more than 80,473 electors. The process was intended to address historic [[malapportionment]], and be complete by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19166125 | title=Q&amp;A: Boundary changes | publisher=BBC | date=29 January 2013 | accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/election2010/results/default.stm | title=Election 2010 Results | publisher=BBC | date=6 May 2010 | accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary reports suggesting the areas set to lose the fewest seats historically tended to vote [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], while other less populous and deindustrialized regions, such as [[Wales]], which would lose a larger proportion of its seats, tending to have more [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] voters, partially correcting the existing malapportionment. An opposition (Labour) motion to suspend the review until after the next general election was tabled in the House of Lords and a vote called in the [[United Kingdom House of Commons]], in January 2013. The motion was passed with the help of the Liberal Democrats, going back on an election pledge. {{as of|2016|October|}}, a new review is in progress and a draft of the new boundaries has been published.

[[File:North Carolina 12th Congressional District (National Atlas).gif|thumb|''[[Shaw v. Reno]]'' was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case involving the [[redistricting]] and racial gerrymandering of [[North Carolina's 12th congressional district]] ''(pictured)''.]]

The United States, among the first with an elected representative government, eventually named the practice. Incidents precede the 1789 election of the [[1st United States Congress|First U.S. Congress]]. In 1788, [[Patrick Henry]] and his [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalist]] allies were in control of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]]. They drew the boundaries of [[Virginia's 5th congressional district]] in an unsuccessful attempt to keep [[James Madison]] out of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;Labunski, Richard. ''James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of gerrymandering the borders of new states continued past the Civil War and into the late 19th century. The Republican Party used its control of Congress to secure the admission of more states in territories friendly to their party—the admission of [[Dakota Territory]] as two states instead of one being a notable example. By the rules for representation in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], each new state carried at least three electoral votes regardless of its population.&lt;ref&gt;Compare a map of the United States in 1860 [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/us_terr_1860.jpg] with a map from 1870 [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/us_terr_1870.jpg]. &lt;!-- These images need to be put in wikimedia commons, rather than external links--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

All redistricting in the United States has been contentious because it has been controlled by political parties vying for power. As a consequence of the decennial [[census]] required by the [[United States Constitution]], districts for members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] typically need to be redrawn whenever the number of members in a state changes. In many states, state legislatures redraw boundaries for state legislative districts at the same time.

State legislatures have used gerrymandering along racial lines both to decrease and increase minority representation in state governments and congressional delegations. In Ohio, a conversation between Republican officials was recorded that demonstrated that redistricting was being done to aid their political candidates. Furthermore, the discussions assessed the race of voters as a factor in redistricting, on the premise that African-Americans tend to back Democratic candidates. Republicans apparently removed approximately 13,000 African-American voters from the district of [[Jim Raussen]], a Republican candidate for the House of Representatives, in an attempt to tip the scales in what was once a competitive district for Democratic candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wcpo.com/wcpo/localshows/iteam/cdd905.html |title=Republican Party Politics (Part II) |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[WCPO]] |date=29 April 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515112805/http://www.wcpo.com/wcpo/localshows/iteam/cdd905.html |archivedate=15 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Civil Rights Movement and passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], federal enforcement and protections of suffrage for all citizens were enacted. Gerrymandering for the purpose of reducing the political influence of a racial or ethnic minority group was prohibited. After the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed, some states created "majority-minority" districts to enhance minority voting strength. This practice, also called "affirmative gerrymandering", was supposed to redress historic discrimination and ensure that ethnic minorities would gain some seats and representation in government. In some states, bipartisan gerrymandering is the norm. State legislators from both parties sometimes agree to draw congressional district boundaries in a way that ensures the re-election of most or all incumbent representatives from both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Virginia, an incumbent protection plan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-virginia-an-incumbent-protection-plan/2013/09/27/0e08acfc-27c0-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852_story.html|accessdate=21 April 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than allowing more political influence, some states have shifted redistricting authority from politicians and given it to non-partisan [[redistricting commission]]s. The states of Washington,&lt;ref&gt;[[Washington State Redistricting Commission]] {{cite web|url=http://www.redistricting.wa.gov |title=Washington State Redistricting Commission |publisher=Redistricting.wa.gov |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona,&lt;ref&gt;[[Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission]] {{cite web|url=http://www.azredistricting.org |title=Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission |publisher=Azredistricting.org |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and California&lt;ref&gt;[[California Proposition 11 (2008)|Proposition 11]], passed in 2008, and [[California Proposition 20 (2010)|Proposition 20]], passed in 2010&lt;/ref&gt; have created [[standing committee]]s for redistricting following the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It has been argued however that in California's case, gerrymandering still continued despite this change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/how-democrats-fooled-californias-redistricting-commission|title=How Democrats Fooled California's Redistricting Commission — ProPublica|author=|date=21 December 2011|website=ProPublica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhode Island&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071018002452/http://riredistricting.org/ Rhode Island Reapportionment Commission] Archived 18 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and New Jersey&lt;ref&gt;[[New Jersey Redistricting Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; have developed ''[[ad hoc]]'' committees, but developed the past two decennial reapportionments tied to new census data. Florida's amendments 5 and 6, meanwhile, established rules for the creation of districts but did not mandate an independent commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.palmbeachpost.com/yourvote/ballot_question/florida/2010/amendment-5-and-6-2010/ |title=Election 2010: Palm Beach County &amp; Florida Voting, Candidates, Endorsements &amp;#124; The Palm Beach Post |publisher=Projects.palmbeachpost.com |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208155829/http://projects.palmbeachpost.com/yourvote/ballot_question/florida/2010/amendment-5-and-6-2010/ |archivedate=8 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

International election observers from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, who were invited to observe and report on the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 national elections]], expressed criticism of the U.S. congressional redistricting process and made a recommendation that the procedures be reviewed to ensure genuine competitiveness of Congressional election contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/usa/14028 |title=XI |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, an analyst reported that the two major parties differ in the way they redraw districts. The Democrats construct coalition districts of liberals and minorities together with conservatives which results in Democratic-leaning districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/#Dem |title=The Atlas of Redistricting: Gerrymander districts to favor Democrats |last1=Bycoffe |first1=Aaron |last2=Koeze |first2=Ella |last3=Wasserman |first3=David |last4=Wolfe |first4= Julia |date=25 January 2018 |website=FiveThirtyEight |access-date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Republicans tend to place liberals all together in a district, conservatives in others, creating clear partisan districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/#GOP |title=The Atlas of Redistricting: Gerrymander districts to favor Republicans |last1=Bycoffe |first1=Aaron |last2=Koeze |first2=Ella |last3=Wasserman |first3=David |last4=Wolfe |first4= Julia |date=25 January 2018 |website=FiveThirtyEight |access-date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Ledyard | last=King | title=Democrats face long house odds | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/25/democrats-face-long-wait-reclaim-house-majority/76325436/| newspaper=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida| pages= 1B | date=November 28, 2015 | id= | accessdate=November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---hard copy and soft copy differ in source but are duplicate articles---&gt;

===Venezuela===
Prior to the [[Venezuelan parliamentary election, 2010|26 September 2010 legislative elections]], gerrymandering took place via an [[addendum]] to the electoral law by the [[National Assembly of Venezuela]]. In the subsequent election, [[Hugo Chávez]]'s political party, the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] drew 48% of the votes overall, while the opposition parties (the [[Democratic Unity Roundtable]] and the [[Fatherland for All]] parties) drew 52% of the votes. However, due to the re-allocation of electoral legislative districts prior to the election, Chávez's United Socialist Party of Venezuela was awarded over 60% of the spots in the National Assembly (98 deputies), while 67 deputies were elected for the two opposition parties combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first= | last= | title=The WP: Parliament election was an unmistakable rebuff to Chávez | url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2010/10/01/en_pol_esp_the-wp-parliament-e_01A4549411.shtml | newspaper=El Universal| location=Caracas| pages= | date=October 1, 2010 | id= | accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journalist and author ==

Born in [[Bregenz]], [[Vorarlberg]], Martin worked for the [[Germany|German]] weekly news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]''. As a freelance writer, he has written and co-authored several popular books, among them the best-selling ''[[The Global Trap|The Global Trap: Globalization and the Assault on Prosperity and Democracy]]'' (''Die Globalisierungsfalle'', 1996), ''Bitter Pills'' (''Bittere Pillen'') about the pros and cons of [[pharmacology|pharmaceuticals]] and ''The European Trap'' (''Die Europafalle'', only available in German but a partial translation is available on Martin's website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpmartin.net/english/european-trap The European Trap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409051510/http://www.hpmartin.net/english/european-trap |date=2013-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), an inside analysis of European integration, faults of the European bureaucracy and lobbyism in the EU.

The publishing house [[Penguin Random House]] released a new book by Hans-Peter Martin carrying the title ''"Game Over: Wellbeing for the few, Democracy for no one, Nationalism for all - and then?"'' in September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://service.randomhouse.de/book/Game-Over/Hans-Peter-Martin/e538698.rhd?pub=1&amp;frm=true|title=Hans-Peter Martin: Game Over. penguin (Hardcover)|isbn=9783328600237|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;''"Game over"'' was shortlisted, together with nine other books, for the best German Economic Book of the year 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/wirtschaftsbuchpreis-2018-die-besten-wirtschaftsbuecher-des-jahres/22897046.html|title=Wirtschaftsbuchpreis 2018: Die besten Wirtschaftsbücher des Jahres|website=www.handelsblatt.com|language=de|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== European Parliament 1999–2004 ==
In the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (Austria)|1999 European Parliament elections]] Martin was selected as leader of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]]'s group. However, differences with the party's leadership led to his complete break with the SPÖ.

Since then Martin has been reelected twice through his independent candidate list, [[Hans-Peter Martin's List]].

Early in 2004, he accused [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] of all parties of falsely claiming reimbursement of [[travel and subsistence]] expenses. He produced evidence of MEP's signing the register in the morning to receive their daily allowance, and then immediately leaving the building. Broadcast on German TV, the accusations caused an uproar.&lt;ref&gt;German TV program RTL Exklusiv: {{YouTube|wzEQWigzz30|MEP Hans-Peter Martin exposes an expenses scandal in the European Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then European Parliament spokesman [[Hans Gert Pöttering]] dismissed Martin's accusations as unnecessarily aggressive and the President of the Parliament [[Pat Cox]] said that he would have preferred to deal with the case internally.

In response, Martin was accused of claiming too much in meal expenses. He was later cleared of this charge.

Eventually the disclosures and the public outrage Martin's revelations induced resulted in a change of the expense system.

== European Parliament 2004–09 ==

In the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Austria)|2004 European Parliament elections]] Hans-Peter Martin decided to compete on his own party list "Hans-Peter Martin's List &amp;ndash; For genuine control and [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] in Brussels" (''Liste Dr. Hans-Peter Martin &amp;ndash; Für echte Kontrolle in Brüssel''). For an independent he received a surprising 14% of the vote &amp;ndash; more than the [[Austrian Green Party|Greens]] or the right-wing [[Austrian Freedom Party]] &amp;ndash; and gained two of Austria's seats in the [[European Parliament]]. He has been widely credited with having reduced the vote share of the far-right parties.

The second mandate went to Austrian [[Karin Resetarits]], a former journalist with the [[ORF (broadcaster)|Austrian public broadcaster ORF]] and a private radio station. However, Martin and Resetarits soon found themselves in heavy disagreement and ceased to work together. She later joined the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe|Liberal group]] in the European Parliament on June 7, 2005 and was not reelected.

Martin's list also competed in the [[Austrian legislative election, 2006|Austrian legislative elections of 2006]], but received only 2.8% of the vote and thus was blocked from entry into the Austrian parliament by the requirement to at least have 4% of the vote. Martin explained the unexpectedly low result with accusations of "expedient but contrary to the rule" use of the secretarial allowance, which were widely publicised in the Austrian media. The later court ruling stated that Martin used the funds correctly and did not benefit from the money, but as he did not follow some formal requirements he was ordered to repay the funds. Martin argued that this was a political decision.

== European Parliament 2009–14 ==

In 2009, Martin flirted with the idea of heading a planned Austrian list of the pan-European [[euroscepticism|eurosceptical]] alliance [[Libertas.eu]], but later rebuffed Libertas' advances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austriantimes.at/index.php?id=11605 "Martin stiffs Irish ´Libertas´"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706090629/http://www.austriantimes.at/index.php?id=11605 |date=2011-07-06 }}, [[Austrian Times]], 5 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

While Libertas finally didn't manage to set up a list at all, Martin successfully competed again with his independent [[Hans-Peter Martin's List]]. He even surprised many by increasing his vote share to 18%, giving his list three seats in the European Parliament.

=== Anti-Lobbyism campaign ===

During his mandate Martin vocally campaigned for transparency and against lobbying. Since 2011 he collects and publishes all lobby invitations his office receives&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lobbyticker.eu Hans-Peter Martin's Lobby-Ticker]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 published an analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Presse Release on H.P.

{{voting}}

The term '''issue voting''' describes when [[Voting|voters]] cast their vote in [[election]]s based on [[political issue]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 11&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of an election, issues include "any questions of [[public policy]] which have been or are a matter of controversy and are sources of disagreement between [[political party|political parties]].”&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory of issue voting, voters compare  the [[Candidate#Candidates in elections|candidates']] respective [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] against their own in order to decide for whom to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
A voter does not need to have an in-depth understanding of every issue and knowledge of how a [[candidate]] stands on every issue, but rather a sense of which candidate they agree with the most.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 132&lt;/ref&gt; Voters use many different tactics to rationalize their view on a particular issue. Some people look at what has happened in the past and predict how they think a particular issue will affect them in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Issue voting is often contrasted with party voting. A 2010 [[University of California, Davis]] study found that voters switch between issue voting and party voting depending on how much information is available to them about a given candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Highton, 455-458&lt;/ref&gt; [[Low information voter|Low-information elections]], such as those for [[Elections in the United States#Congressional elections|congressional candidates]], would thus be determined by [[Party politics|party voting]], whereas [[Elections in the United States#Presidential elections|presidential elections]], which tend to give voters much more information about each candidate, have the potential to be issue-driven.&lt;ref&gt;Enelow, 217-219&lt;/ref&gt;

Voters typically choose a political party to affiliate with in one of two ways.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt; The voter will create an opinion of an issue without consulting what a political party thinks about it, then choose the political party that best fits the opinion they already have, or the voter will study the opinions of the different parties and decide which party he or she agrees with the most.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 79, 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

A voter's understanding of parties' principles is strengthened and developed over time as a person gains experience with more political events.&lt;ref&gt;Denver,21-23&lt;/ref&gt; In order for an issue to create the foundation for [[Political party|party]] choice, a voter must first be concerned about a particular issue and have some knowledge about that issue.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 245&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a person to be an issue voter, they must be able to recognize that there is more than one opinion about a particular issue, have formed a solid opinion about it and be able to relate that to a specific [[Political parties in the United States|political party]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 246&lt;/ref&gt; According to Campbell, only 40 to 60 percent of the informed population even perceives party differences, and can thus partake in party voting.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 104&lt;/ref&gt; This would suggest that it is common for individuals to develop opinions of issues without the aid of a political party.

==History of issue voting==
Prior to [[Paul Lazarsfeld|''The People's Choice'']] study in 1944, it was assumed by political scientists that voting was based solely on issues.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 1, 2, 22&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study found little evidence of issue voting in the [[United States presidential election, 1940|United States presidential election of 1940]]. Rather, the researchers found that issues reinforced [[political party]] loyalties. Research stemming from the study concluded that voters' motivations could be broken down into three categories: [[party identification]], [[candidate]] orientation, and issue orientation. ''[[The American Voter]]'' in 1960 determined that party identification was the primary force, which in turn strongly influenced the other two categories. These three factors make up the Michigan School's approach to modeling voting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, "Issue Voting"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest research on issue voting done in 1960 found that voters often did not have enough information to link specific issues to individual candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 109-102&lt;/ref&gt; Converse, in 1964, also concluded that voters did not have a sophisticated enough understanding of issues to be able to link them to candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Converse, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Key was one of the first people to conclude that voters are able to connect issues to certain candidates and cast their vote based on that information.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the growing knowledge of the field, reliable evidence didn't begin to appear until the 1970s. ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' published a symposium that hypothesized that there was a rise in issue voting in the 1960s. Nie and Anderson published an analysis of correlations with issue orientations in 1974 that attempted to revise the Michigan School's theory of the public's political belief systems' inherent limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Nie (1974) 541-591&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Nie et all in ''The Changing American Voter'' attempted to explain the rise in issue voting through the fall in party voting.&lt;ref&gt;Nie 47-73&lt;/ref&gt; This decline of party voting, they claimed, came about because the proportion of the electorate with no party affiliation had fallen, and because the proportion of voters who cast votes for candidates from other parties had risen.

===Rise in issue voting===
In recent years, the United States has seen a rise in issue voting.  This can be attributed to the increased [[Political polarization|polarization]] in the last century between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 172&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these parties have become more extreme in their issue viewpoints. This has alienated [[moderate]]s from their parties.&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Since a large portion of American voters are moderates, an increase has been seen in the number people who choose to affiliate as [[Independent (voter)|Independent]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt; 
Identifying as an independent allows voters to avoid the constraints of a polarized political party. An independent voter can hand-pick a candidate based upon their positions on various issues rather than on their political party.&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholic Church|Catholics]] face the "issue voting vs. party voting" dilemma. Many Catholics support the [[opposition to legal abortion|pro-life]] stance which is backed by Republicans, but strongly oppose the [[capital punishment|death penalty]], which the Republican Party also supports. Extreme party polarization might cause Catholic voters to feel uncomfortable about both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates.&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of [[trade union|labor unions]] strongly identify with the Democratic Party's advocacy for workers' rights, but unions also tend to not support [[gay rights]], a stance which more closely aligns with Republican views.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications regarding issue voting==
Many factors can complicate issue voting. First, issues are not always [[dichotomy|dichotomous]]; there are often many stances one could take.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessel, 460&lt;/ref&gt; Voters often must settle for the candidate whose stances are closest to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessel, 461&lt;/ref&gt;  This can prove difficult when two or more candidates have similar opinions, or when candidates have positions that are equally far from a voter's. An example of an issue which might be difficult to issue vote on is [[Education in the United States|education]] spending. A voter may have a drastically different opinion from the available candidates on how much money should be spent on schools; this could lead the individual to vote based on party affiliation instead.&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt;

A second complexity is that, oftentimes, problems do not line up on linear bases. That is, some issues may make it hard to even determine the candidate with the closest position.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 US presidential election]] the growing threat of [[Communism]] in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] was a salient issue for voters.&lt;ref&gt;Schweizer, 213&lt;/ref&gt;  There were many proposed solutions to this problem; [[Ronald Reagan]] endorsed military intimidation through increased spending and innovation (the [[Reagan Doctrine]]), [[Jimmy Carter]] proposed diplomatic efforts to keep peace, and the independent [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] advocated a return to the [[containment]] strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Schweizer, 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bisnow, 24&lt;/ref&gt; None of these answers are [[mutually exclusive]], and they cannot be linearly plotted.  The voter would instead have to choose the candidate whose opinion represented the closest mix of possible solutions to their own.

A third problem that can complicate issue voting is if there are multiple issues that are equally salient to the voter.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt; A candidate may have a similar position to a given voter on one issue, but may take a considerably different stance on another.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this occurred in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 US presidential election]]. During this election, two issues dominating attention were the economy and the wars in [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Many viewed these issues as equally salient, and had a hard time picking one issue to vote on. These three complexities in issue voting have provided problems in using this tactic to choosing candidates.

A fourth problem is that voters may be unsophisticated and lack the knowledge necessary to vote based on issues. Political scientist [[Larry Bartels]] has argued that voters are generally uninformed and that their actual vote choices do not reflect the vote choices that a fully informed voter would make. He concludes that since voters lack full information, they cannot truly be issue voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-oe-bartels3-2008nov03-story.html|title=How smart is the American voter?|date=2008-11-03|work=|publisher=LA Times|via=|last1=Bartels|first1=Larry M.|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models of issue voting==
While scholars employ many models to study voting habits, there are three primary models used in statistical studies of issue voting: the linear position model, the spatial model and the salience model. Each model takes a different approach to issue voting into account.

[[File:Linear Model of Issue Voting, April 2012.jpg|thumb|Linear Model of Issue Voting|right]]
*The Linear Position Model attempts to predict how strongly an individual will issue vote in an election. The model suggests that the more a voter and candidate agree on a particular issue, the better chance the candidate has of receiving the individual's vote.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier and Campbell, 26-43&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, a graph is used to display the relationship between the number of people voting for the party and the consistency of the issue position.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier and Campbell, 26-43&lt;/ref&gt; The equation “Y = a + bX” is used, where the variable “a” represents the minimal numbert of people voting for the party, “b” is a variable used to ensure that there is a positive gradient, "X" represents the consistency of the party's issue position, and Y represents the number of people who vote for the party.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis et. al, 426-429&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Spatial Model attempts to show the perceptions and decisions of voters when issue voting strategies are used in elections.&lt;ref&gt;Cho, 275&lt;/ref&gt; This model assumes that if someone’s issue preferences are placed on a hypothetical spatial field along with all possible candidates’ policy positions, the individual will vote for the candidate whose political stances are closest to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCullough,199-22&lt;/ref&gt; Other models that follow the idea of “closeness” are called proximity models.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, 93, 96&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Salience Model asserts that the two major parties in the [[United States]] are associated with certain goals or views on an issue, and that the voter’s decision in selecting a candidate depends on the actual salience of the issue to the voter.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 93&lt;/ref&gt; This model is important when considering issue voting because it utilizes election agenda data to predict election outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niemi,1212&lt;/ref&gt; A simple view of this model can be summarized with the equation:

::Vote=a(Saliency of the party's issues)+b(Saliency of the party's issues)

::where "a"=Party 1, and "b"=Party 2

:The more important the issue becomes, the more a voter favors a particular candidate or party on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis et. al, 426&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Italian irredentism in Switzerland''' was a political movement that promoted the unification to [[Italy]] of the Italian-speaking areas of [[Switzerland]] during the [[Risorgimento]].

==History==

In the early 19th century the ideals of unification in a single Nation of all the territories populated by Italian speaking people created the [[Italian irredentism]].

In southern Switzerland those ideals were minimally followed until the creation of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861 and up to [[World War I]].

Following the rise to power of [[Italian Fascism]], however, the initial moderate irredentism started to change to one full of aggression: the same [[Benito Mussolini]] created in the early 1930s the ''Partito Fascista Ticinese'' (Ticino Fascist Party).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpct.ch/pubblicazioni/generale/1986_fraromaeberna.shtml Fra Roma e Berna, di Mauro Cerutti (in Italian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830110602/http://www.fpct.ch/pubblicazioni/generale/1986_fraromaeberna.shtml |date=2011-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main ideal of this party was to bring the Italian frontier up to the [[Gotthard Pass|Gottardo Pass]] (''Catena mediana delle Alpi'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italiasvizzera150.it/img-schede/8-img1.jpg Map of "Catena mediana delle Alpi" as possible northern Italian border in Switzerland]&lt;/ref&gt;)  in the Alps through political unrest and possible referendums (supported, in case of need, by the Italian Army).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiasvizzera150.it/studenti.cfm?target=8|title=Italia-Svizzera: la storia dal 1861 al 2011|first=Contechnet.it massimo|last=rossi|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 was done a small tentative by the Ticino fascists: the March on Bellinzona", similar to the [[March on Rome]]. But it was successfully contrasted by socialist organizations, like "Liberi e Svizzeri" of Guglielmo Canevascini, promoted even by the Swiss government.&lt;ref&gt;M. Cerutti, Fra Roma e Berna. La Svizzera italiana nel ventennio fascista, p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

Successively, in the 1935 elections the fascists obtained just 2% of the votes and since then their movement faded away to less than 100 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wArTkIKE7WAC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=marcia%20su%20bellinzona%201934&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M7NuGyUtLJ&amp;sig=B8Mka8gIAdIpIFTalz1R9NVqWDk&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=UUmFTNraH5qKnAe4v5yTAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=marcia%20su%20bellinzona%201934&amp;f=false|title=Il cattolicesimo ticinese e i fascismi: la Chiesa e il partito conservatore ticinese nel periodo tra le due guerre mondiali|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Saint-Paul|accessdate=12 January 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[World War II]] the Italian irredentism in Switzerland was reduced to have followers mainly between the descendants of Italians emigrated to Ticino at the end of the 19th century, but was ruled and promoted by a small group of ticino intellectuals with their active newspapers and propaganda.

The most important of these intellectuals was Teresina Bontempi, who created the magazine ''L'Adula''.  She denounced in her writings, together with Rosetta Colombi, the [[germanization]] of Canton Ticino promoted by the Swiss government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ps-ticino.ch/sonvico/mondo/pubblicazioni/Crespi,Ticino%20irredento04.htm  Il sogno irredentista del Ticino (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the German speaking population in Canton Ticino went from  2.6%  in 1837 to 5.34% in 1920 and nearly 10% in 1940.

As a consequence of this political activity she was involved in continuous problems with the Swiss government, that finally jailed her in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Ilse Shneiderfranken.Le industrie del Canton Ticino. Belinzona, 1937&lt;/ref&gt; She was forced to move to Italy as a political refugee after some months.

The most renowned fascist born in Canton Ticino was Aurelio Garobbio, who tried to imitate [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] with his organization called ''Giovani Ticinesi''.&lt;ref&gt;Garobbio, Aurelio. ''Gabriele D'Annunzio e i «Giovani Ticinesi»: le vicende de «L'Adula»'' p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; After 1935 Garobbio was the main responsible of the Italian irredentism in Switzerland and was with Mussolini until his death in spring 1945, when tried to organize a last fascist area of defense in [[Valtellina]] next to Ticino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2m_xg6W8oGUC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=aurelio%20garobbio&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eL5Ipaj9P7&amp;sig=Pn59UpC7B2OtcpxsUeI5toJj08I&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=RG2FTKqQHNOfnQeG4ZTxDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=aurelio%20garobbio&amp;f=false|title=Com'era rossa la mia valle: una storia di antiresistenza in Valtellina|first=Giuseppe|last=Rocco|date=1 January 1992|publisher=GRECO &amp; GRECO Editori|accessdate=12 January 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anti-Semitism}}
{{Discrimination sidebar}}
A '''Jewish quota''' was a [[racial quota]] limiting the number of [[Jew]]s in various establishments to a certain percentage. In particular, in the 19th and 20th centuries, some countries had Jewish quotas in [[higher education]].

Jewish [[educational quotas]] could be statewide law or adopted only in certain institutions, often unofficially. The limitation took the form of total prohibition of Jewish students, or of limiting the number of Jewish students so that their share in the students' population would not be larger than their share in the general population.{{why|date=May 2018}} In some establishments, the Jewish quota placed a limit on growth rather than set a fixed level of participation to be achieved.

Jews who wanted an education used various ways to overcome this discrimination: bribing the authorities, changing their religion, or traveling to countries without such limitations. In Hungary, for example, 5,000 Jewish youngsters (including [[Edward Teller]]) left the country after the introduction of ''[[numerus clausus]]''.

==Countries legislating limitations on the admission of Jewish students==
* [[Canada]]: Certain universities, notably [[McGill University]], [[Université de Montréal]] and the [[University of Toronto]], had longstanding quotas on the number of Jews admitted to the respective universities. [[McGill University]]'s strict quota was the longest, being officially adopted in 1920 up until the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews: A People's Journey'', (Toronto: University of Toronto Press), 2008, p. 132-133, 319-321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews'', p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Germany]]: On 25 April 1933, the [[Nazi]] government introduced a 1.5 percent quota for new admissions of German Non-[[Aryan race|Aryans]]—i.e. essentially of German Jews—as core issue of a law claiming to generally limit the number of (Aryan and non-Aryan) students admitted to high-schools (''höhere Schulen'') and universities. In addition, high-schools and universities deemed to have more students than required for the professions for which they were training their students were required to reduce their student enrollment; doing so, they had to reach a maximum of 5 per cent of German non-Aryan students. The law was supposedly enacted to avoid overcrowding schools and universities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?apm=0&amp;aid=dra&amp;datum=19330004&amp;zoom=2&amp;seite=00000225&amp;ues=0&amp;x=9&amp;y=13 Gesetz gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen (RGBl 1933 I, S. 225)] (original German text of the ''Law against the Overcrowding of German Schools and Universities'', introduced in 1933)
[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?apm=0&amp;aid=dra&amp;datum=19330004&amp;seite=00000226&amp;zoom=2 Erste Verordnung zur Durchführung des Gesetzes gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen (RGBl 1933 I, S. 226)] (original German text of the ''First Regulation for the Implementation of the Law against the Overcrowding of German Schools and Universities'', introduced in 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; which referred to German concerns at the time that large numbers of students would decrease the quality of higher education. At the beginning of 1933, about 0.76 percent of the German population was Jewish, but more than 3.6 percent of German university students were Jewish, this number having steadily declined from over 9 percent in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/40185665 Claudia Huerkamp (1993). Jüdische Akademikerinnen in Deutschland 1900–1938 (= Jewish academics in Germany 1900–1938). ''Geschichte und Gesellschaft, 19. Jg. (Heft 3),'' Rassenpolitik und Geschlechterpolitik im Nationalsozialismus, pp. 311–331.] Publisher: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht (GmbH &amp; Co. KG)&lt;/ref&gt; After 30 July 1939, Jews were no longer permitted to attend German public schools at all, and the prior quota law was eliminated by a non-public regulation in January 1940.&lt;ref name="Olenhusen"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/30196241 A. G. v. Olenhusen: Die "nichtarischen" Studenten an den deutschen Hochschulen (= The non-Aryan students at German universities). ''Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte, 14(1966),'' pp. 175–206.] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;193&lt;/sup&gt;

: Apart from their strong and predominant anti-Semitic agenda, the law and its subsequent regulations were temporarily indeed used to limit general university access, i.e. including "non-Aryans" (Jews), as the name of the law implied. Starting 1934, a regulation limited the overall numbers of students admitted to German universities, and a special quota was introduced reducing women's admissions to a maximum of 10 percent. Although the limits were not entirely enforced—women's quota stayed a bit above 10 percent mainly because a smaller percentage of men than women accepted their university admissions—they made it for women approximately twice as hard to enter a university career than for men with the same qualification.&lt;ref name="Bildungsbürgerinnen"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QVToe3288bEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%C3%BCberfremdung&amp;f=false Claudia Huerkamp (1996).

(Reihe: ''Bürgertum, Band 10'')] {{ISBN|3-525-35675-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;S.&amp;nbsp;80ff.&lt;/sup&gt; After two semesters, the admission limits were revoked, however, leaving in place the non-Aryan regulations.&lt;ref name="Olenhusen"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;178&lt;/sup&gt;
:''For additional information in German, see the [[:de:Gesetz gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen|article at the German Wikipedia]]''
* [[Hungary]]: a ''Numerus Clausus'' Act was introduced in 1920, under the government of [[Pál Teleki]]. It was said that the ethnic rate of students must meet the ethnic rate of population. Limitations were relaxed in 1928. Racial criteria in admitting new students were removed and replaced by social criteria. Five categories were set up: civil servants, war veterans and army officers, small landowners and artisans, industrialists, and the merchant classes.&lt;ref&gt;See: [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_14969.html Numerus Clausus]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Imperial Russia]] and [[Soviet Union]]: ''Numerus Clausus'' was enacted in 1887, stating that the share of Jewish students should be no more than 10 percent in cities where [[Jew]]s were [[Pale of Settlement|allowed to live]], 5 percent in other cities, and only 3 percent in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. These limitations were removed in the spring of 1917 after the tsar's abdication during the early phase of the Russian revolution of 1917-1918 (the so-called [[February Revolution]] of 1917); later, in the late 1940s during the initial phase of the [[Cold War]] and the tide of the anti-"[[rootless cosmopolitan]]" campaign a [[de facto]] gross discrimination of Jewish applicants was reintroduced in many institutions of higher education in the [[Soviet Union]] until [[Perestroika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=[[Mikhail Shifman]] |title=You Failed Your Math Test, Comrade Einstein: Adventures and Misadventures of Young Mathematicians Or Test Your Skills in Almost Recreational Mathematics |publisher=World Scientific |date=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ho6fMF8ehogC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Edward Frenkel]] |title=The Fifth problem: math &amp; anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union |date=October 2012 |journal=The New Criterion |url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-Fifth-problem--math---anti-Semitism-in-the-Soviet-Union-7446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-more-migrants-please-especially-the-clever-ones-2368622.html |location=London |work=[[The Independent]] |date=October 11, 2011 |title=More migrants please, especially the clever ones|author=[[Dominic Lawson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Andre Geim]] |title=Biographical |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=2010 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/geim-bio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Poland]]: see [[Numerus clausus#Poland|Numerus clausus in Poland]] and [[Ghetto benches]].
* [[Romania]] ''Numerus Clausus'' was not introduced by law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hist-chron.com/judentum-aktenlage/numerus-clausus/EncJud_num-claus-d/EncJud_numerus-clausus-band12-kolonne-1267-1268.gif |title=Encyclopaedia Judaica: Numerus clausus, vol. 12, col. 1267-1268}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was adopted by students in the universities Cluj, Bucharest, Iasi and Cernauti.
* [[United States]]: Certain private universities, most notably [[Harvard]], introduced policies which effectively placed a quota on the number of Jews admitted to the university. According to historian [[David Oshinsky]], on writing about [[Jonas Salk]], "Most of the surrounding medical schools ([[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], and [[Yale University|Yale]]) had rigid quotas in place. In 1935 Yale accepted 76 applicants from a pool of 501. About 200 of those applicants were Jewish and only five got in." He notes that Dean Milton Winternitz's instructions were remarkably precise: "Never admit more than five Jews, take only two Italian Catholics, and take no blacks at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerard N. Burrow|title=A History of Yale's School of Medicine: Passing Torches to Others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzYX_MduAG8C&amp;pg=PA107|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|page=107ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Oshinsky added, "[[Jonas Salk]] and hundreds like him" enrolled in [[New York University]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Oshinsky, David M.

* [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]: In 1940, the Yugoslav government enacted the Decree on the Enrollment of Persons of Jewish Descent at the University, Secondary School, Teacher Training College and Other Vocational Schools which limited the proportion of Jewish students to the proportion of Jews in the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.ceu.hu/jewishstudies/pdf/02_goldstein.pdf |title=The Jews in Yugoslavia 1918-1941: Antisemitism and the Struggle for Equality |last=Goldstein |first=Ivo |authorlink=Ivo Goldstein |pages=10–11 |format=PDF |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University in New Jersey and received his  Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Massachusetts and completed his post-doctoral training at New York Hospital - Cornell Medical School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John D Gartner Bio|url=http://www.johngartner.com/about.php|website=johngartner.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fitness for Office of President Trump ==
Gartner collected in the first months of 2017 more than 25.000 signatures of mental health professionals on a petition, directed to the national opposition leader, Democratic Senator [[Chuck Schumer]].&lt;ref&gt; https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2017/02/19/psychologist-calls-on-colleagues-to-sign-petition-for-trumps-removal/#52fd90e264f3 &lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of April 2017 he was able to forward the petition with more than 41.000 signatures  of mental healthcare professionals to [[Washington D.C.]].

Core of the petition: ''My professional judgement is that Donald Trump manifests a serious mental illness that renders him  psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties of President of the United States.''
''And I respectfully request him be removed from office, according to article 3 of the 25th Amendment, and so on''.

According to Gartner, President Trump's mental handicaps are a mix of 1.[[narcissism]], 2. [[paranoia]]; 3.[[sociopathy]]; and 4. a dash of [[wikt:sadism|sadism]].

** [[Agorism]], a revolutionary form of free-market anarchism that focuses on employing counter-economic activity to undermine the state
** [[Anarcho-capitalism]], a political philosophy that advocates the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty, private property and open markets (many anarchists dispute this as a form of anarchism and argue it is a misuse of the term)
** [[Left-wing market anarchism]], a political philosophy that strongly affirms the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support "anti-capitalist" positions
* [[Libertarianism]], an individualist political philosophy that upholds liberty as its primary focus and principal objective
* [[Voluntaryism]], a political philosophy which holds that all forms of human association should be voluntary

'''Malinchism''' ({{lang-es|malinchismo}}) or '''malinchist''' ({{lang-es|malinchista}}) is a form of attraction that the foreigner has in the popular imagination, causing individuals to lose the spirit of nationality by moving to the other side, a particular case of [[cultural cringe]].&lt;ref&gt;LEMOS, M. T. T. B. (Org.), DANTAS, Alexis Toribio (Org.), ''América: Visões e Versões - Identidades em confronto'', ed. 7 Letras, 1st edn., Rio, 2010, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the name of [[Hernán Cortés]]'s [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] advisor [[La Malinche]], referring to a deep-rooted Mexican inferiority complex or [[self-hatred]] for the preference for all things foreign to the point of self-destruction.{{sfn|Butler|2004|p=83}} La Malinche is used as a symbol for being supposed to have assisted the Spaniards in destroying Native Americans' way of life, values, norms and culture and exploit the Native American peoples.

"Malinchism" is a pejorative label, expressing disdain for those who are attracted by foreign values, thinking them superior, of better quality and worthy of imitation. In [[Mexico]] and in other countries the term "malinchism" or "malinchist" applies to all those who feel an attraction to foreign cultures and disregard for their own national culture. It also applies to politics, as in [[El Salvador]], in which the leftist political parties call their opponents "malinchist right-wing". The myth of [[Malinche]] and the force of this feeling of disgust crossed the Mexican border, and malinchism came to be applied as a technical term, political, for giving preference to foreign cultures.&lt;ref&gt;LEMOS, M. T. T. B. (Org.), DANTAS, Alexis Toribio (Org.), ''América: Visões e Versões - Identidades em confronto'', ed. 7 Letras, 1st edn., Rio, 2010, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that upper-class consumers in Mexico display malinchism in their preference for American imports, rather than local Mexican brands. As result, American products are sold mostly on the middle class market, and their advertising agencies generally avoid working class and rural areas. They concentrate their efforts on Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara, which purchase 70 percent of the American imports.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Ueltschy, and John K. Ryans, Jr., "Employing standardized promotion strategies in Mexico: the impact of language and cultural differences," ''International Executive'' (July 1997) 39#4 pp 479+&lt;/ref&gt;

Malinchism is also associated with a societal depiction of women as the source of betrayal and nefarious behavior.&lt;ref name="Schneider (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneider|first1=Julia Maria|title=Recreating the Image of Women in Mexico:  A Genealogy of Resistance in Mexican Narrative Set During the Revolution|date=2010|volume=Graduate Faculty - Thesis|page=6|url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04142010-170734/unrestricted/schneiderthesis.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717070125/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04142010-170734/unrestricted/schneiderthesis.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-07-17|accessdate=16 February 2015|publisher=Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the images of Mexican popular culture, this theme plays out with [[La Malinche|Malinche]] often portrayed as both the deceiver and the deceived. In theatrical productions, she is sometimes portrayed as a victim of conquest, and sometimes the manufacturer of her own destiny; almost always, Malinche is portrayed as [[Guilt (emotion)|guilty]], in a form of [[victim blaming]]. If she was indeed forced to help the conquistadors against her will, it was because she didn't struggle enough; if she was a willing participant, she not only brought her own troubles, but she caused all of her people and her children to suffer.&lt;ref name="Day (2004)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Day|first1=Stuart A.|title=Staging Politics in Mexico: The Road to Neoliberalism|date=2004|publisher=Bucknell University Press|location=Lewisburg [Pa.]|isbn=0-8387-5587-9|pages=125–131|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=wjcglvaWZc8C&amp;lpg|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is represented in art as a figure showing women's [[Instinct#In biology|inborn]] deception and guilt — one who used her sexuality and in so doing betrayed her own unwitting children.&lt;ref name=Lindauer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindauer|first1=Margaret A.|title=Devouring Frida: The Art History and Popular Celebrity of Frida Kahlo|date=1999|publisher=Wesleyan Univ.

In ''La Malinche,'' a ballet composed in 1949, by [[José Limón]], Malinche is at first an unwilling victim, then assumes the proud deportment of an aristocrat, and in the end, weighted down by the finery she wears, she gives birth to the [[Mestizo|mixed-race]] child who rejects her.&lt;ref name="Seed (2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seed|first1=edited by Patricia|title=José Limón and La Malinche: The Dancer and the Dance|date=2008|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-71735-0|pages=24–29|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=pTsnFcV1V38C&amp;lpg|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, Malinche has been compared to [[Eve#Mother of humanity|Eve]], the temptress who through deception, leads men astray.&lt;ref name="Cypress (1991)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cypess|first1=Sandra Messinger|title=La Malinche in Mexican literature from history to myth|date=1991|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=0-292-75131-1|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=vR7UAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mani pulite''''' ({{IPA-it|ˈmaːni puˈliːte|lang}}, [[Italian language|Italian]] for "clean hands") was a nationwide judicial investigation into [[political corruption in Italy]] held in the 1990s. ''Mani pulite'' led to the demise of the so-called "[[History of Italy as a Republic#The First Republic .281947-1992.29|First Republic]]", resulting in the disappearance of many political parties. Some politicians and industry leaders committed [[suicide]] after their crimes were exposed. [[Antonio Di Pietro]] was the main judicial figure in charge of the operation.

In some accounts, as many as 5,000 public figures fell under suspicion. At one point, more than half of the members of the [[Italian Parliament]] were under [[indictment]]. More than 400 city and town councils were dissolved because of corruption charges. The estimated value of [[bribe]]s paid annually in the 1980s by Italian and foreign companies bidding for large government contracts reached [[United States dollar|US$]]4 billion dollars (6.5 trillion [[Italian lira|lire]]).&lt;ref name="Koff2002"/&gt;

The corrupt system uncovered by the investigation was referred to as '''''Tangentopoli''''' ({{IPA-it|tandʒenˈtɔːpoli}}).&lt;ref name="Moliterno"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Moliterno| first = Gino| title = Encyclopedia of contemporary Italian culture| publisher = Routledge| year = 2000| isbn = 0-415-14584-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from ''tangente'', which means "[[Kickback (bribery)|kickback]]" and in this context refers to kickbacks given for [[public works]] contracts,&lt;ref name="Koff2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen P. Koff|title=Italy: From the 1st to the 2nd Republic|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-00536-1|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[polis|poli]]'' meaning city;&lt;ref&gt;''-poli'' is also used as a suffix for a scandal (e.g. ''[[2006 Italian football scandal|Calciopoli]]'', ''[[2011–12 Italian football scandal|Scommessopoli]]''), much like "[[List of scandals with "-gate" suffix|-gate]]" in the English language (i.e. [[Lewinsky scandal|Zippergate]], [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russiagate]]).&lt;/ref&gt; it is thus sometimes translated as '''"Bribesville"''' or '''"Kickback City"'''.

==Arrest of Mario Chiesa==
''Tangentopoli'' began on 17 February 1992 when [[Antonio Di Pietro|Judge Antonio Di Pietro]] had [[Mario Chiesa (politician)|Mario Chiesa]], a member of the centre-left [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI), arrested for accepting a [[bribe]] from a [[Milan]] cleaning firm. The PSI distanced themselves from Chiesa, with PSI leader [[Bettino Craxi]] calling him ''mariuolo'', or "villain", a "wild splinter" of the otherwise clean party. Upset over this treatment by his former colleagues, Chiesa began to give information about corruption implicating them. This marked the beginning of the ''mani pulite'' investigation; news of [[political]] corruption began spreading in the Italian press.

==Extension of anti-corruption investigations==
In the [[Italian general election, 1992|1992 elections]], the centre-right [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (DC) held on to power when its [[coalition government]] kept a small majority, while leftist opposition parties gained support. However, the [[Italian Communist Party]] split after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], depriving the [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] of leadership. Many votes went to the far-right [[Lega Nord]], which was not inclined to form alliances with other parties at the time. The resulting parliament was therefore weak and difficult to bring to an agreement.

During April 1992, many industrial figures and politicians from both the government and the opposition were arrested on charges of corruption. While the investigations started in Milan, they quickly spread to other towns as more politicians confessed. One grotesque situation occurred when a Socialist politician immediately confessed to all of his crimes to two [[Carabinieri]] who had come to his house, only to later discover that they had come to deliver a mere [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] for a traffic violation. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Fundamental to this increased exposure was the general attitude of the main politicians to drop support for subordinates who got caught; this made many of them feel betrayed, and they often implicated many other figures, who in turn would implicate even more. On 2 September 1992, the Socialist politician Sergio Moroni, charged with corruption, committed [[suicide]]. He left a letter pleading guilty, declaring that crimes were not for his personal gain but for the party's benefit, and accused the financing system of all the political parties.

==Effect on national politics==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Craxi coins.jpg|thumb|[[Bettino Craxi]], viewed by many as the symbol of [[Tangentopoli]], leader of the [[Italian Socialist Party]], is greeted by a salvo of coins as a sign of loathing by protesters contesting him.]] --&gt;
In the local December elections, DC lost half of their votes. The day after that, Craxi was officially accused of corruption. After many other politicians were accused and jailed, Craxi eventually resigned from the PSI.

On 5 March 1993, the Italian government of [[Giuliano Amato]] and his justice minister [[Giovanni Conso]] tried to find a solution with a decree, which allowed criminal charges for several bribery-related crimes to be replaced by administrative charges instead; according to Italian popular opinion at the time, that would have resulted in a ''de facto'' [[amnesty]] for most corruption charges. Amid public outrage and nationwide rallies, the [[President of Italy|Italian president]] [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]] refused to sign the decree, deeming it unconstitutional. The following week, a US$250 million affair involving [[Eni]], the government-controlled national energy company, was revealed. The stream of accusations, confessions and jailing continued.

On 25 March, the Italian parliament changed the municipal electoral law in favor of a majoritarian system. Later, on 18 April, the public overwhelmingly backed the abrogation of the existing [[proportional representation]] parliamentary electoral law in a referendum (a [[Mixed member proportional representation|mixed system]] was introduced that August), causing Amato to resign three days later. Still shocked by the recent events, the parliament was unable to produce a new government. [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]], former governor of the [[Bank of Italy]], was appointed head of the government; he appointed a [[technical government]] without political influences. In the meantime, the investigation of Craxi was blocked by the parliament. Several members of the government, having been in office just three days, resigned in protest; among them were [[Minister of the Environment (Italy)|Minister of the Environment]] [[Francesco Rutelli]] and [[Italian Minister of Finance|Minister of Finance]] [[Vincenzo Visco]]. In new local elections on 6 June 1993, DC lost half of its votes once again; the PSI virtually disappeared. Instead [[Lega Nord]], a far-right protest movement, became the strongest political force in [[Northern Italy]]. The left-wing opposition was approaching majority, but still lacked unity and leadership.

Eventually, all four parties in the 1992 government disappeared, at different times in different ways: DC, the PSI, the [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party (historical)|Italian Socialist Democratic Party]], and the [[Italian Liberal Party (1943)|Italian Liberal Party]]. The [[Democratic Party of the Left]], the [[Italian Republican Party]] and the [[Movimento Sociale Italiano]] were the only surviving national parties; the Republican Party is the only one that has maintained its name since.

==The Cusani trial==
On 20 July 1993, the former Eni president, Gabriele Cagliari, committed suicide in jail. His wife later gave back US$3 million of illegal funds. Meanwhile, Cusani faced trial and was accused of crimes connected to Enimont, a joint venture between Eni and another energy company, [[Montedison]]. The trial was broadcast on national television, and was a sort of showcase of the old politics being brought to their responsibilities. While Cusani himself was not a major figure, the connection of his crimes to the Enimont affair called in all the nation's major politicians as witnesses.

A high note was reached in the Cusani trial when former head of government [[Arnaldo Forlani]], answering a question, simply said, "I don't remember"; he happened to be very nervous and did not notice that sweat was accumulating on his lips, and that image was by many considered symbolic of the people's disgust for the corrupt system. Craxi, instead, admitted that his party received $93 million of illegal funds, defending his actions by saying that "everyone was doing this." Even the Lega Nord was implicated in the trial; secretary [[Umberto Bossi]] and former treasurer Alessandro Patelli were convicted for receiving 200 million lire of illegal funding (approx. $100,000 at the time).

A bribe to the Italian Communist Party was alleged, but it was not established who had committed the offence. A number of Milanese members of the Democratic Party of the Left were charged with corruption during their time as members of the PCI, but they were [[acquittal|acquitted]]. As prosecutor [[Antonio Di Pietro]] stated, "Penal responsibility is personal. I cannot bring here a person with the first name [[Communist]] and last name Party". (''La responsabilità penale è personale, non posso portare in giudizio una persona che si chiami Partito di nome e Comunista di cognome.'')

The Enimont trial itself was carried out after the Cusani trial, with much less public interest.

==Investigations on other fronts==
In the meantime, the investigation expanded outside the political range: on 2 September 1993, the Milan judge Diego Curtò was arrested. On 21 April 1994, 80 financial regulators and 300 industry personalities were charged with corruption. A few days later, the secretary of [[Fiat]] admitted corruption with a letter to a newspaper. Media tycoon [[Silvio Berlusconi]] entered politics later that year and won the [[Italian general election, 1994|1994 general election]], in what many thought was a move to shield his many business concerns from possible scrutiny. This suspicion was reinforced on 11 February, when Berlusconi's brother, [[Paolo Berlusconi|Paolo]], admitted to corruption crimes. 

On 13 July 1994, the Berlusconi government made a new law to avoid jail time for most corruption crimes, the passage of which was timed to coincide with Italy's defeat of [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in the [[Football World Cup 1994|1994 Football World Cup]]'s semifinals in the hopes that the public would be distracted. However, as [[Roberto Baggio]] shot high the last penalty against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], and newscasts showed images of corrupt politicians leaving jail, public opinion became enraged; the images of [[Francesco De Lorenzo]], former [[Italian Minister of Health|Minister of Health]], were especially striking, since the general public perceived stealing money from hospitals an especially heinous act.

Just a few days before, the arrested regulators had been talking about corruption in [[Fininvest]], the holding company controlled by the Berlusconi family. Most of the judge pool declared that they would respect the state's laws, but they could not work in a situation where duty and conscience were to conflict: they requested therefore to be reassigned to other duties. Since the government could not afford to be seen as an adversary of the popular judge pool, the decree was hastily revoked and marked a "misunderstanding"; [[Italian Minister of the Interior|Interior Minister]] [[Roberto Maroni]], of Lega Nord, claimed that he had not even had the chance to read it. While the [[Italian Minister of Justice|Minister of Justice]] was [[Alfredo Biondi]], allegations that the decree was written by [[Cesare Previti]], a lawyer from Fininvest, are at least credible.

On 29 July Berlusconi's brother was again arrested and immediately released.

==Escalating conflict between Berlusconi and Di Pietro==
At this point a public conflict erupted between Berlusconi and Di Pietro. While Berlusconi's companies were being investigated, "inspectors" were sent from the government to the Milanese judges' office to look for formal irregularities. None were ever found, but this tactic, coupled with Berlusconi's firm grip on the media, helped spread what is described in other environments as [[fear, uncertainty and doubt]]. The battle ended without winners: Di Pietro resigned on 6 December, two weeks before the Berlusconi government resigned ahead a critical [[confidence vote]] in parliament that was expected to go against them.

During 1995, many investigations were started against Di Pietro, who would years later be cleared of all charges. Meanwhile, Berlusconi incurred other charges of corruption. It was later found that the man prosecuting Di Pietro, Fabio Salamone from [[Brescia]], was the brother of a man that Di Pietro himself had prosecuted and sent to jail for various corruption charges. However, it wasn't until later that authorities realized the [[conflict of interest]] and reassigned Salamone, even though his investigations had taken a completely different direction: Paolo Berlusconi and Previti were accused of a conspiracy against Di Pietro, but the prosecutor who later replaced Salamone asked for their acquittal and so did the court.

After being cleared, Di Pietro went into politics, despite previously not wishing to exploit the popularity gained doing what he perceived to be just his duty. His movement is named [[Italia dei Valori]] ("Italy of values"). In 1998, Cesare Previti, then sitting in parliament after the Berlusconi government, avoided jail thanks to parliamentary intervention, even though Berlusconi and his allies were in opposition. Craxi was sentenced to several years cumulative jail time in definitive convictions and fled to [[Tunisia]], where he remained until his death on 19 January 2000.

==Statutory term strategy==
After 1994, trials became likely to be cancelled due to the [[statute of limitations|expiration of statutory terms]]. The government ignored the pleas of the judiciary system for more funding to buy equipment, and passed laws that made Italy's notoriously slow legal system even slower and subject to earlier prescription. The intricate nature of these laws allowed lawyers to use many delaying tactics: an instructive example was a prosecution of Berlusconi, where he was accused of misappropriation of Fininvest's funds in order to prepare [[black fund]]s that could have been used for bribes or other illegitimate purposes; on the last possible day, a lawyer from Fininvest appeared in court and complained that his company had not been formally notified of the trial. While this trial was well publicized in the media, the formality forced the trial to be restarted from scratch, and Berlusconi was finally acquitted by expiration of statutory terms. Being acquitted in this first trial, he could later benefit from a general reduction of terms for other trials, which in turn expired earlier with a [[domino effect]].

After Berlusconi's victory in the [[Italian general election, 2001|2001 election]], public opinion had turned so far against judges, where it is not only openly acceptable to criticize them for having carried out ''Mani pulite'', but also increasingly difficult to broadcast opinions favorable to Milan's pool. Some blame Berlusconi's media influence as having played a role in this change, or the inability of the opposition to gain the consent of conservative electors. Even [[Umberto Bossi]], whose Lega Nord has been an opposition party, became highly critical of judges.

==Lottizzazione==

The term ''lottizzazione'', meaning the way a terrain is divided up in minor parts or ''lotti'', came to indicate the procedure of awarding top positions in important state conglomerates such as [[Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale|IRI]], [[Enel|ENEL]] or [[Eni|ENI]] to political figures, or at least managers with a clear political orientation. This usually trickled down to lower levels, creating power centres depending on political parties that controlled a significant part of the production system. The available seats were usually awarded so that government parties (and opposition parties like the [[Italian Communist Party]]) would get a share of power corresponding to their perceived influence in the government.

==In modern culture==
In 2005, artist Gianni Motti created a piece of [[soap]], named ''Mani Pulite'', based on the scandal. This piece was claimed to have been created out of the fat from a [[liposuction]] of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. It was sold at the 36th edition of [[Art Basel]] for 15,000 euros.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.repubblica.it/2005/f/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/motti/sapovendu/sapovendu.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 television series titled ''[[1992 (TV series)|1992]]'' is based on the events of ''mani pulite''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Deborah|title='1992': Berlin Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/1992-berlin-review-771715|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3149">In [[Troy, New York]], on March 6, 1894 during an election riot between pollwatchers and [[Edward Murphy, Jr.|operatives of the local Democratic political ward boss]] who were engaged in repeat voting, a young poll watcher, Robert Ross, was shot and killed. His brother, William, was also shot but survived.

Bartholomew Shea and John McGough were at the polling booth of the third district of the Thirteenth Ward. William and Robert Ross were present as poll watchers. ''"The row started when one of the Shea gang sought to vote upon another citizen's name and in a twinkling clubs and revolvers were flourished. Many shots were fired and when the fight closed it was found that Robert Ross had been fatally shot, that his brother, William, [sic] received a bullet in the neck and that Shea and McGough, who fled from the scene, had each been slightly wounded."''&lt;ref name="correctionhistory"&gt;[http://www.correctionhistory.org/northcountry/html/crimes/batshea3.htm Correctionhistory.org account of the events leading to Shea's trial and conviction, with details not included in ''New York Times'' accounts]&lt;/ref&gt; Shea and McGough were caught and arrested, at which time McGough initially claimed he had fired the shot that killed Ross, but later apparently withdrew this claim, only to repeat the claim years later, after Shea's execution in 1896.&lt;ref name="correctionhistory"/&gt;

A ''[[New York Times]]'' report on the incident laid blame directly on former Troy Mayor [[Edward Murphy, Jr.]], who had been elected to the [[United States Senate]] the previous year (he would serve one term), which included the following excerpt: ''"The gun that shot Robert Ross has been loaded on election day in Troy ever since "Boss" Murphy's gang began their systematic frauds, a dozen years ago."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1894/03/08/106899552.pdf ''CITIZENS OF TROY AROUSED; DETERMINED TO AVENGE THE MURDER OF ROBERT ROSS.

McGough and Shea were arrested and an original suspect in the shootings, John Boland, was released from custody. The trial of Shea and McGough began on May 28, 1894. Shea and McGough were convicted on July 4, 1894. McGough was sentenced by a jury to 20 years imprisonment, and Shea was sentenced to death. Several lengthy appeals and efforts to have Shea's sentence commuted failed and he was executed in 1896.

'''''Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali''''' is a 1980 book written by [[anthropologist]] [[Clifford Geertz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geertz argues that the pre-colonial Balinese state was not a "[[Hydraulic empire|hydraulic bureaucracy]]" nor an [[oriental despotism]], but rather, an organized spectacle. The noble rulers of the island were less interested in administering the lives of the Balinese than in dramatizing their rank and hence political superiority through large public rituals and ceremonies. These cultural processes did not support the state, he argues, but ''were'' the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=13–17, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is perhaps most clear in what was, after all, the master image of political life: kingship. The whole of the negara - court life, the traditions that organized it, the extractions that supported it, the privileges that accompanied it - was essentially directed toward defining what power was; and what power was what kings were. Particular kings came and went, 'poor passing facts' anonymized in titles, immobilized in ritual, and annihilated in bonfires. But what they represented, the model-and-copy conception of order, remained unaltered, at least over the period we know much about. The driving aim of higher politics was to construct a state by constructing a king. The more consummate the king, the more exemplary the centre. The more exemplary the centre, the more actual the realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Geertz used the Balinese case to develop an abstract model of the [[Theatre state]] applicable to all the South East Asian Indic polities. To succinctly summarize his theory, "Power served pomp, not pomp power." Other anthropologists have contested the ahistorical, static nature of the model. They point out that he has depoliticized a political institution by emphasizing culture while ignoring its material base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=393–413|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Clifford Geertz was an American anthropologist who is remembered for his influence on the practice of [[symbolic anthropology]], and who was considered "for three decades...the single most influential cultural anthropologist in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford, Shweder, R. A., &amp; Good, B. (2005). Clifford Geertz by his colleagues. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geertz used this model to provide "an alternate conception of what politics is about"; to advance an approach to history as a succession of broad cultural schemata; and to contribute to the cultural dimension of the discussion on Southeast Asian polities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=398|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book is a consideration of many elements of Balinese life, such as cremation ceremonies, that many would not consider a part of a state apparatus. In order to understand why cremation ceremonies should be so key to the "Theatre state" Geertz provides a detailed description of Balinese social organization [[Ethnography|in its own cultural terms]]. Particular aspects of Balinese life have been over-emphasized, according to some, to accommodate his model. Those aspects focus, in particular, on the role of irrigation.

===The Ruling Class===
For most of the nineteenth century, there were seven principal kingdoms, of which Klungkung was considered the oldest and most sacred. The others were Tabanan, Badung, Gianyar, Karengasem, Bangli, and Mengwi. They were primarily located on the plain on the south side of the island. Each of the kingdoms  controlled a riverine valley and hence the water supply required for rice irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kingdoms of Bali were said to have been founded by Javanese refugees from the Hinduized kingdom of [[Majapahit]] which had just fallen to Muslim invaders. They, in turn, invaded in 1352 at Gelgel and established an Indic state based upon the caste system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The caste system====
The caste system only loosely resembled the caste system in India. The three noble castes were referred to as "''triwangsa''," (three peoples), the "insiders" (''wong jero'') as opposed to the commoners (''wong jaba'', outsiders).&lt;ref name="Geertz-p26-27"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=26–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MacRae argues that this emphasis on the Indic heritage of Bali is overdrawn, and points out that Geertz himself admits that caste is a misnomer in Bali, and "that the Indic surface  of Balinese political institutions has acted to inhibit a comparative reference eastwards... towards the Pacific."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|page=398|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The dadia====
The basic unit of the triwangsa castes was the "noble house" or dadia. The commoners, for the most part, lacked these corporate kin groups.&lt;ref name="Geertz-p26-27" /&gt; The dadia was a kinship group whose leadership passed through the line of the eldest male, from father to son. Younger sons remained identified with the group, lived nearby, but had less status. The children of the core line also had more status than the children of the junior lines. Geertz refers to this as the principle of "sinking status." Each of these junior lines could potentially sever itself and form an independent dadia. This process of schism formed the internal politics within the royal houses, as distinct from political conflict between houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=27–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status differentials both within and between houses made patron-client relations the basic idiom of politics. These client relationships were especially important between castes, linking the priestly caste (''padanda'') with noble houses in a teacher-disciple tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides these patron-client ties within dadia, alliances also formed between dadia in different kingdoms. These alliances were frequently codified in treaties, although the issues they covered seemed "designed more to codify the pretexts upon which alliances could be broken than to establish the bases upon which they could be built."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Village and the State===
[[File:Bali temple diagram.png|thumbnail|right|Diagram of a Balinese temple]]
[[File:PuraDalemSidan.jpg|thumbnail|Pura Dalem Sidan (temple)]]

The Balinese ruling classes seemed fragmented, internally torn by intrigues within dadia, and weakly allied between kingdoms. This poor political integration was aggravated by the political independence of the villages under royal dadia rule. The Balinese state was composed of institutions that cross-cut villages. Villages were not independent, self-contained "village republics" but were cross-cut by membership in three separate locally based political institutions that organized local life: the hamlet (''banjar''), the irrigation society (''subak''), and the temple congregation (''pemaksan''). Villages were also crosscut by tax obligations to different lords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The village (''banjar'')====
The Balinese village has been falsely described in the colonial literature as a "village republic", bounded, self-contained and wholly autonomous. According to Geertz, an important part of this book was to disrupt colonial images of the closed corporate village. Geertz emphasizes that the village controlled only certain aspects of the everyday life of Balinese villagers, and that the tax and temple systems cross-cut village membership. That is, the members of a single village might pay taxes through several ''perbekel'' and be part of different temple congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village did have a constitution, which spelled out its members responsibilities for road making, upkeep of public facilities, night watch, and settlement of civil disputes. The village had its own leadership (''klian banjar''). This range of duties led Geertz to conclude "In brief, perhaps the bulk (though as we shall see, far from the whole) of Balinese government, in the strict sense of authoritative regulation of social life, was carried out by the hamlet, leaving the state free to dramatize power rather than to administer it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The temple congregation (''pemaksan'')====
Although focused on religious rites, the pemaksan was a corporate public body that was also an agency of government because of the link between religion and custom, i.e. forms of worship and social behaviour in Bali. Such religious rites were considered "adat" (custom), "the entire framework of social action in which both men and gods are enclosed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of small variations in adat defined the boundaries between pemaksan. The pemaksan thus stands as the moral community, next to the civil community embodied in the hamlet and the economic community in the irrigation society. The pemaksan will draw on one to ten villages for its members.

The pemaksan will maintain the "Three Great Temples" (''Kahyangan Tiga''): 1) the Origin Temple (''Pura Puseh'') which commemorates the human settlement of the area. 2) The Death Temple (''Pura Dalem'') used to pacify the not yet cremated and hence dangerous dead. And 3) the Great Council Temple (''Pura Balai Agung'') for ensuring the overall fertility of the pemaksan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irrigation system (''Subak'')====
[[File:1 Tegalalang rice terrace ubud bali.jpg|left|thumb|[[Subak (irrigation)|Subak]] irrigation system]]

According to Geertz, one of the most important of state institutions in Bali is the irrigation society (''subak'') given the theoretical emphasis placed upon irrigation in the materialist models of the "[[Asiatic mode of production]]." These models viewed the control of irrigation by lords as the major means of also controlling the population that depended on those irrigation works for their sustenance. Geertz views the subak as an autonomous organization separate from the state, much like the banjar. The system of dams, dikes and canals were the property of the subak, and hence controlled by the farmers themselves. Geertz thus dismisses any notion of "primitive communism" - and its spectre, "state capitalism."&lt;ref name="Geertz-p69"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subak controls the water flowing from a single up-river dam. The water flows through its rice terraces to other subaks farther downstream. Once water flowed into a subak it was divided through a series of weirs so that each farmer would get the amount of water they needed at the right time. The regulation of water is thus a serious issue, and encounters regular bottlenecks where control of the supply for a whole subak can be seized. Controlling the complex flow of water within a subak was accomplished through a highly regimented series of rituals. Water temples placed at points of water division would coordinate the flow of water through carefully timed rituals. Geertz emphasizes that there is no central control of the timing of these rituals, and hence that the state is not an "oriental despotism" controlling the population through the control of water.&lt;ref name="Geertz-p69" /&gt;

[[File:Bali panorama.jpg|thumb|300px|Balinese rice terraces is part of Subak irrigation system.]]

It is Geertz's characterization of the irrigation system as headless that has attracted critique. Stephen Lansing's examination of Balinese irrigation shows that the need for effective water management links thousands of farmers in clear hierarchies, beginning with the most sacred temples dedicated to the Goddess of the volcanic Crater Lake ([[Mount Agung]]) that all Balinese hold sacred, and descending into the plains and low-lying rice fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lansing|first=Stephen|title=Priests and Programmers: technologies of power in the engineered landscape of Bali|year=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on nineteenth century Balinese records, Brigitta Hauser-Schaublin has shown that regional lords and kings played a large role in managing irrigation, and that this role was lost only in the Dutch colonial period. She argues that Geertz's failure to see the larger state role in water management reflects this change in colonial practice, thereby weakening the "theatre state" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hauser-Schaublin|first=Brigitta|title=Temple and King: Resource Management, Rituals and Redistribution in Early Bali |journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|year=2005|volume=11|issue=4|pages=747–71|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9655.2005.00260.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Perbekel system ====
The free, land-owning ''kawulas'' made up 90% of the population. Kawulas were attached to a perbekel, a "political foreman" to whom they owed specific obligations and taxes. The perbekels were attached to punggawas, the lords of dadia. Unlike the village, none of these political roles was based upon territorial residence. In other words, membership in the village was cross-cut by obligations to different perbekels and their lords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bali was thus not a feudal realm where lords controlled land and people within a fiefdom. Lords and kawulas owned their own land, and lords did not generally seek their kawulas as tenants on their land. Kawulas had only two obligations to their perbekels: ritual service and military support: "He was a stagehand, spear carrier, and [[claqueur]] in an endless political opera."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trade====
Although Bali lies along major Indonesian trade roots in the north, its mountainous geography orients it to the south; its only navigable port was at Kuta, on a southern peninsula. The bulk of trade remained in foreign hands, including the Chinese, [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Bugis|Buginese]] and Europeans. Foreigners were largely restricted to these insulated ports of trade. Trade within Bali occurred in rotating markets characterized by traditional fixed exchange rates. Goods and services were also circulated through large scale [[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistributive]] ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization of international trade was leased out by the king to a ''subandar'' (harbour master), who served as an intermediary between the traders and the dadia of the royal house, to whom he paid the rent. This rent was paid to each Lord of the royal house whenever they held a ceremony. The more ceremonies held, the greater share a Lord would receive of the spoils of trade. The point of trade then, was to hold larger spectacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spectacle and political power===
[[File:Ubud Cremation 3.jpg|thumbnail|left|Balinese Cremation tower]]

Geertz argues that state ceremonials in the Negara were "metaphysical theatre"; that is, theatre designed to express a vision of the ultimate nature of reality that at the same time tried to shape current conditions to match that reality. Ritual events all re-created social relations of jero ("inner", to whom one surrendered power in the ritual event thereby making them powerful) and jaba ("outer", a provider of services to those who are jero) between lords and their kawula. Every ritual performance reproduced jero-jaba relations as both symbolic ideal and pragmatic reality, thereby reinforcing social order. Thus, although the state was cross-cut by the conflicting jurisdictions of temples, hamlets, and irrigation societies, they all come together  for mass state rituals in which the ideal social order of the state is made real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of the cremation ceremony====
The cremation ceremony was the largest and most ostentatious of the state rituals, attended by all the political dependants of a lord. At the centre of the ritual was the cremation tower (badé) on which the body of the deceased lord rested in state until the whole was consumed in fire. The cremation tower itself symbolized the cosmic order the ritual sought to make real. At its base were the world of demons (winged serpents), above which stood a platform called the House, representing the world of man. Above that were the tiers of roofs symbolizing the world of the gods, to which the deceased was ascending; a commoner would ascend to the first heaven (1 tier), whereas a king to the eleventh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While having an eleven storey tower was iconic of regal status, accomplishing a cremation ritual was an accomplishment - a struggle - that justified that status. The first part of the ceremony, for example, involved transporting the tower in a procession to the cremation ground, a mob scene involving thousands; some of these carried the bier forward, while others tried to stop it. The struggle could potentially prevent those who lacked the status and resources from making what others felt were false claims; the scene "was a bit like a playful riot - a deliberated, even studied, violence, designed to set off a no less deliberated and even more studied stillness, which the variously imperturbable priests, agnates, widows and tributary dead contrived to gather about the central tower."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=118–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and critique of the book==
[[File:Southeast Asian Historical Mandalas.svg|thumb|right|Notable mandala states in [[History of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian history]] (circa 5th to 15th century). From north to south; [[Pagan Kingdom|Bagan]], [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]], [[Champa]], [[Khmer empire|Angkor]], [[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit]].]]
Although Geertz considered this the pinnacle of his thinking on politics and history, reactions to the book have been mixed, "combining admiration for its scope and ambition with scepticism about its claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=394|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One source of the scepticism is that the book is clearly not a history of a specific polity, but a generalized ideal-type model intended to guide representations of the Southeast Asian Indic states found in [[Bali]], [[Java]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Burma]] in the fifth to fifteenth centuries. As such, it is one of several models, such as that of O.W. Wolters "[[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]]" model, or [[Stanley Tambiah]]'s model of the "Galactic polity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Tony|title=Fluid Iron: State formation in Southeast Asia|year=2002|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geertz made it clear that his emphasis was a general model of the "theatre state" and not a specific Balinese kingdom by referring to the Balinese state with the Indic term Negara, whereas the Balinese refer to their pre-colonial state as a ''kerajaan''. As such, it over-estimates the Indic influence on Bali, and under-estimates its similarities with Polynesian kingdoms in [[Tahiti]], [[Samoa]] and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=398–403|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of the book have focused on:

1) As a culturalist approach to history, it is remarkably static and ahistorical. [[Fredrik Barth]] argued that it "depoliticized" a political institution as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barth|first=Fredrik|title=Balinese worlds|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2) By subordinating power to culture, the book ignores the material base of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howe|first=Leo|title=Rice, ideology and the legitimation of hierarchy in Bali|journal=Man|year=1991|volume=26|issue=4|pages=445–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Geertz's book was published, several other historical studies of particular kingdoms have appeared which emphasize the more conventional political economic forms of power underlying the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|page=395|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3) Geertz makes the ritual aspect of Balinese culture "more exotic, more extraordinary and more other than the evidence warrants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howe|first=Leo|title=Rice, ideology and the legitimation of hierarchy in Bali|journal=Man|year=1991|volume=26|issue=4|page=451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4) Tambiah notes that Geertz presents the Balinese kings as, at once, the focus of ritual theatre that creates the exemplary centre as a still point, "immobilized into passivity and reflective trances" yet at the same time "Rent by virtually continuous intrigue, dispute, violence and an enormous amount of micro-upheaval."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tambiah|first=Stanley|title=Culture, Thought, and Social Action: An Anthropological Perspective|year=1985|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge MA|pages=320–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his best effort, Geertz does not transcend the break between expressive and instrumental action, or between power as pomp and power as control of people and resources.  He thus leaves himself open to Marxist critiques that view the state as a mystification, an "illusory representation of the unity of the village communities (as Marx put it in his sketch of 'oriental despotism'), and that the ceremonies of state are nothing but the spiritualizing of material interests and the covering up of material conflicts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tambiah|first=Stanley|title=Culture, Thought, and Social Action: An Anthropological Perspective|year=1985|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge MA|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gaspard De La Fontaine.jpg|thumb|[[Gaspard-Théodore-Ignace de la Fontaine]], leader of the Orangists]]
'''Orangism''' was a movement in the 19th century [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] favouring the [[personal union]] of the [[Netherlands]] and Luxembourg under the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. Made up of many notable figures, mainly nobles and Roman Catholic clergy, they were moderate liberals or conservative-liberals and slightly anti-clerical. At first they favoured maintaining the Grand Duchy's autonomous status and, especially during the [[Belgian Revolution]], opposed it being merged into [[Belgium]]. In the end the western part of the Grand Duchy (the present province of [[Luxembourg (province)|Luxembourg]]) passed to Belgium, whilst the eastern part and the Orange grand duchy continued as an independent state. In 1890 the heads of the House of Orange were grand dukes of Luxembourg, but on the death of king and grand duke [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] in 1890 he was succeeded by his relation [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolphe]] as grand duke since Luxembourg's constitution did not allow a woman ([[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Princess Wilhelmina]]) to hold the throne. The movement's newsletter was the ''Journal de la Ville et du Pays Luxembourg''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

{{this|Political Communications Principles|the academic journal|Political Communication (journal)}}

'''Political communication(s)''' is a subfield of [[communication]] and [[political science]] that is concerned with how [[information flow|information spread]]s and [[social influence|influences]] [[politics]] and [[policy maker]]s, the [[news media]] and [[citizen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Acrobat/Political%20Communications%20encyclopedia2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since the advent of the [[World Wide Web]], the amount of data to analyze has exploded, and researchers are shifting to computational methods to study the dynamics of political communication. In recent years, [[machine learning]], [[natural language processing]], and [[Social network analysis|network analysis]] have become key tools in the subfield. It deals with the production, dissemination, procession and effects of information, both through [[mass media]] and [[Interpersonal communication|interpersonally]], within a political context. This includes the study of the media, the analysis of [[political speech|speeches by politicians]] and those that are trying to influence the [[political process]], and formal and informal conversations among members of the public, among other aspects. The media acts as bridge between government and public. Political communication can be defined as the connection concerning politics and citizens and the interaction modes that connect these groups to each other. Whether the relationship is formed by the modes of persuasion, Pathos, Ethos or Logos. 

== Defining the concept ==

The study and practice of political communication focuses on the ways and means of expression of a political nature. Robert E. Denton and Gary C. Woodward, two important contributors to the field, in  ''Political Communication in America'' characterize it as the ways and intentions of message senders to influence the political environment. This includes public discussion (e.g. political speeches, news media coverage, and ordinary citizens' talk) that considers who has authority to sanction, the allocation of public resources, who has authority to make decision, as well as social meaning like what makes someone American. In their words "the crucial factor that makes communication 'political' is not the source of a message, but its content and purpose." &lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite book|author=Denton R.E., Woodward G.C.|title=Political Communication in America|publisher=New York: Praeger|year=1998|pages=11|isbn=978-0275957834}}&lt;/ref&gt; David L. Swanson and Dan Nimmo, also key members of this sub-discipline, define political communication as "the strategic use of communication to influence public knowledge, beliefs, and action on political matters." &lt;ref name="b"&gt;Swanson, D. &amp; Nimmo D. "New Directions in Political Communication: A Resource Book." Thousand Oaks: Sage, 1990, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasize the strategic nature of political communication, highlighting the role of [[persuasion]] in [[political discourse]]. Brian McNair provides a similar definition when he writes that political communication is "purposeful communication about politics." For McNair this means that this not only covers [[Words|verbal]] or [[written]] statements, but also [[visual]] representations such as dress, make-up, hairstyle or logo design. With other words, it also includes all those aspects that develop a "political identity" or "image".&lt;ref name="c"&gt;McNair B. ''An Introduction to Political Communication'', London: Routledge, 2003, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;  Reflecting on the relationship between political communication and contemporary agenda-building, Vian Bakir defines Strategic Political Communication (SPC) as comprising 'political communication that is [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] in intent, that utilises [[social science|social scientific]] techniques and heuristic devices to understand human [[motivation]], [[human behavior]] and the media environment, to inform effectively what should be communicated – encompassing its detail and overall direction – and what should be withheld, with the aim of taking into account and influencing [[public opinion]], and creating [[strategic alliance]]s and an enabling environment for government policies – both at home and abroad'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bakir, V.|title=Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles|publisher=Farnham: Ashgate|year=2013|pages=3|isbn=9781472402554}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are many academic departments and schools around the world that specialize in political communication. These programs are housed in programs of communication, [[political journalism|journalism]] and [[political science]], among others. The study of political communication is clearly [[interdisciplinary]].

== Contemporary examples of strategic political communication ==
The ''[[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]]’s torture-for-intelligence policy'', initiated soon after [[9/11]], was kept secret for several years, as remains the level of complicity of many other nation-states' governments. While this secret policy was gradually revealed from 2004 onwards, initiated by the [[Abu Ghraib]] torture photos, the Bush administration engaged in SPC to publicly reframe and protect its secret policy. SPC included ''[[silencing]]'' and ''persuasive'' discursive activity.&lt;ref&gt;Bakir, V. Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles. Farnham: Ashgate (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discourse|Discursive]] activity aimed at generating ''silences'' comprised [[plea bargain]]s that silenced detainees, censoring Guantánamo detainees’ descriptions of their own torture in pre–trial hearings, deals with journalists to censor or withhold information that affected national security, weeding out personal sousveillance of torture online, suppression of visual [[sousveillance]] of torture while [[courts–martial]] and criminal investigations proceeded; destruction of videotapes of CIA interrogations; and withholding key information from intelligence oversight committees. These position those in the know as part of an elite force policing the public sphere to keep the wider public and their representatives ignorant of unpalatable but necessary official practices, relegating the likely emotional and/or moral public dissent towards such practices as unaffordable niceties. 
* ''[[Persuasive]]'' [[discourse|discursive]] activity included the propagation and repetition of a few key messages consistently over time, with the aim of misdirecting [[public attention]] from the silence–generating activities. Key Bush Administration messages were that detainees were evil, dangerous [[war on terror|terrorists]]; that the practice of extraordinary rendition was normal and pragmatic; that interrogation techniques, although harsh, were legal (apart from isolated acts of abuse), necessary and successful in preventing future acts of terror; and that Guantánamo was a model prison. Key British Administration messages were of initial ministerial ignorance (until 2004) of American intelligence agencies’ new interrogation strategies, after which intelligence agencies’ guidelines were tightened; and of no direct involvement of British intelligence agencies in extraordinary rendition. Key messages common to both British and American Administrations were that the Abu Ghraib sousveillance and similar visual evidence involving British soldiers were examples of isolated abuse rather than a torture policy from which lessons had been learned regarding Army training and interrogation guidance (new Army guidelines on interrogation were produced under the Bush and Blair Administrations). These key messages were propagated through a range of discursive activity (including [[press conference]]s and media interviews, authorised [[News leak|leak]]s, real–time reporting, official investigations and [[public inquiries]]) and were periodically bolstered by selective public release of once–secret documents. The consistency of key messages over time, together with the offering up of specific evidence, gives the appearance of official disclosure and truth–telling, positioning the public as a force to which political administrations willingly hold themselves accountable. However, the strategic generation of key messages and selectivity of supporting information presented across all these discursive modes means that full [[accountability]] is avoided, while the public is potentially fooled into thinking that [[justice]] has been served, all–the–while being constant targets of manipulation.

==Fields and areas of study==

The field of political communication is focused on 4 main areas:

* [[Election campaigns]] - Political communications involved in campaigning for elections.
* [[Government operations]] - This role is usually fulfilled by a [[Ministry of Communications]], [[Information Technology]] or similar political entity. Such an entity is in charge of maintaining communication legislation and would be responsible for setting [[telecommunications]] policy and regulations as well as issuing broadcasting licenses, comments [[press releases]], etc...
*[[Content (media)|Media content]] - The interaction between politics, media content and the public.
*[[Communication|Communication processes]] - How people communication about about politics.

According to [[James Chesebro]], there are five critical approaches to contemporary Political communications:
# [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] - i.e. power relationships
# [[Symbol|Iconic]] - symbols are important
# [[Ritual]]istic - Redundant and superficial nature of political acts - manipulation of symbols.
# [[Leadership|Confirmation]] - political aspects looked at as people we endorse
# [[Narrative|Dramatistic]] - politics is symbolically constructed. (Kenneth Burke)

==Role of social media==
[[Social media]] has dramatically changed the way in which modern [[political campaign]]s are run. With more [[digital native]] citizens coming into the [[voting]] population, social media is the platform on which the politicians need to establish themselves and engage with the voters. In a [[digital age]], social media will be more important than traditional media to the politicians.

Taking Australia as an example below: 86% of Australians access the Internet, and with a 17,048,864 voting age population,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idea.int/vt/countryview.cfm?CountryCode=AU&lt;/ref&gt; around 14,662,023 voting population has access to Internet, and 65% of them use social media, which means 9,530,314 Australian voters use social media. (The 2013 Yellow™ Social Media Report found that among internet users 65% of Australians use social media, up from 62% last year.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalmktg.net|title=Political Campaign and Social Media|publisher=Political Marketing|accessdate=2014-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116131040/http://www.politicalmktg.net/|archivedate=2014-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With almost half of Australian voting population active on social media, political parties are adapting quickly to influence and connect with their voters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesocialsavior.com/benefits-of-social-media-for-business/&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media experience relies heavily on the user themselves due to the platforms' algorithms which tailor consumer experience for each user. This results in each person seeing more like-minded news due to the increase in digital social behavior. Additionally, social media has changed politics because it has given politicians a direct medium to give their constituents information and the people to speak directly to the politicians. This informal nature can lead to informational mistakes because it is not being subjected to the same "[[Fact checking|fact-checking]] processes as institutional journalism." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=d2NCDgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=political+communication+in+media+society&amp;ots=ofCknFEU1v&amp;sig=UHjO4A3LY9_GEVss0uKJvsJgeJM#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20communication%20in%20media%20society&amp;f=false|title=Mass Media and American Politics|last=Graber|first=Doris A.|last2=Dunaway|first2=Johanna|date=2017-07-20|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=9781506340227|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media creates greater opportunity for political persuasion due to the high number of citizens that regularly engage and build followings on social media. The more that a person engages on social media, the more influential they believe themselves to be, resulting in more people considering themselves to be politically persuasive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weeks|first=Brian E.|last2=Ardèvol-Abreu|first2=Alberto|last3=Gil de Zúñiga|first3=Homero|date=2015-12-31|title=Online Influence?

'''Political philosophy''', also known as '''political theory''', is the study of topics such as [[politics]], [[liberty]], [[justice]], [[property]], [[rights]], [[law]], and the enforcement of laws by [[authority]]: what they are, why (or even if) they are needed, what, if anything, makes a [[The purpose of government|government legitimate]], what rights and freedoms it should protect and why, what form it should take and why, what the law is, and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any, and when it may be legitimately overthrown, if ever.

In a [[vernacular]] sense, the term "political philosophy" often refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about politics, synonymous to the term "[[political ideology]]".

Political philosophy is a branch of [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Leo (1959). An introduction to Political Philosophy. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[political science]], a strong focus has historically been placed on the role of political philosophy (also known as [[normative theory]]), [[moral philosophy]] and the [[humanities]], although in recent years there has been increased focus to political theory based on [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] methodological approaches as well as [[economic theory]], the [[natural sciences]] and [[behaviouralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Savigny |first1=Heather |last2=Marsden |first2=Lee |title=Doing Political Science and International Relations: Theories in Action |date=2011 |publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education |isbn=9780230344136 |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CaUcBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient traditions ===

==== Ancient India ====
[[Indian political philosophy]]  in ancient times demarcated a clear distinction between (1) nation and state (2) religion and state. The constitutions of Hindu states evolved over time and were based on political and legal treatises and prevalent social institutions. The institutions of state were broadly divided into governance, administration, defense, law and order. ''Mantranga,'' the principal governing body of these states, consisted of the King, Prime Minister, Commander in chief of army, Chief Priest of the King. The Prime Minister headed the committee of ministers along with head of executive (Maha Amatya).

[[Chanakya]] was a 4th-century BC Indian political philosopher. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'' provides an account of the science of politics for a wise ruler, policies for foreign affairs and wars, the system of a spy state and surveillance and economic stability of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Roger Boesche|last=Boesche|first=Roger|title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K85NA7Rg67wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A0739106074&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2002|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0-7391-0401-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chanakya quotes several authorities including Bruhaspati, Ushanas, Prachetasa Manu, Parasara, and Ambi, and described himself as a descendant of a lineage of political philosophers, with his father Chanaka being his immediate predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rangarajan|first1=L N|title=The Arthashastra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3jbzZkoR36QC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PT22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2000|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=9788184750119|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influential extant Indian treatise on political philosophy is the Sukra Neeti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=D.

Sewell and J. Debrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ancient China ====
Chinese political philosophy dates back to the [[Spring and Autumn period]], specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC. Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn period and the [[Warring States period]]. The major philosophies during the period, [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[Mohism]], [[School of Agrarianism|Agrarianism]] and [[Taoism]], each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], and [[Mozi]], focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly [[authoritarian]] government based on [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] punishments and laws. [[Mohism]] advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on [[frugality]] and [[ascetism]]. The Agrarians advocated a peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deutsch|first=Eliot|author2=Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999|page=183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taoism advocated a proto-[[anarchism]]. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the [[Qin Dynasty]], but was replaced by State Confucianism in the [[Han Dynasty]]. Prior to China's adoption of [[communism]], State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hsü|first=Leonard Shihlien|title=The political philosophy of Confucianism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FWFtQIyun-8C|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-36154-5|pages=xvii–xx|quote=The importance of a scientific study of Confucian political philosophy could hardly be overstated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ancient Greece ====

==== Saint Augustine ====

The early [[Christian philosophy]] of [[Augustine of Hippo]] was heavily influenced by Plato. A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderation of the [[Stoicism]] and theory of [[justice]] of the Roman world, as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying [[mercy]] as a [[moral example]]. Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the [[City of God (book)|City of God]] (Civitas Dei) or the City of Man ([[Civitas]] Terrena). Augustine's ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis, held by many Christian Romans, that the Christian view could be realized on [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schall|first=James V.|title=At the Limits of Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yZK79kiFFtsC&amp;pg=PA40|year=1998|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-0922-7|page=40|quote=In political philosophy, St. Augustine was a follower of Plato ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== St. Thomas Aquinas ====
{{main|Treatise on Law}}

[[Thomas Aquinas]] meticulously dealt with the varieties of [[philosophy of law|law]]. According to Aquinas, there are four kinds of law:

# Eternal law ("the divine government of everything")
# Divine positive law (having been "posited" by God; external to human nature)
# [[Natural law]] (the right way of living discoverable by natural reason; what cannot-not be known; internal to human nature)
# Human law (what we commonly call "[[law]]"—including [[customary law]]; the law of the ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]'')

Aquinas never discusses the nature or categorization of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]. There is scholarly debate surrounding the place of canon law within the Thomistic jurisprudential framework.

Aquinas was an incredibly influential thinker in the [[Natural law|Natural Law tradition]].

The rise of [[Islam]], based on both the [[Qur'an]] and [[Muhammad]] strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region. [[Early Islamic philosophy]] emphasized an inexorable link between [[science]] and [[religion]], and the process of [[ijtihad]] to find [[truth]]—in effect ''all'' philosophy was "[[Political aspects of Islam|political]]" as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the "rationalist" [[Mutazilite]] philosophers, who held a more [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenic]] view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first [[speculative philosophy|speculative]] theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the [[Caliphate]]. By the late ancient period, however, the "traditionalist" [[Asharite]] view of Islam had in general triumphed. According to the Asharites, reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aslan|first=Reza|authorlink=Reza Aslan|title=No god but God|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AkyupJn81RMC&amp;pg=PA153|year=2005|publisher=Random House Inc.|isbn=978-1-58836-445-6|page=153|quote=By the ninth and tenth centuries... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic philosophy|Islamic political philosophy]], was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of [[Islam]]—i.e., the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]], the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocratic. However, in the Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: [[al-Kindi]] (Alkindus), [[al-Farabi]] (Abunaser), [[Avicenna|İbn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace) and [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes). The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), [[sultan]], [[ummah]], cemaa (obligation)-and even the "core" terms of the Qur'an—i.e., [[ibadah]] (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and [[ilah]] (deity)—is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other [[Fiqh|jurists]] and [[Ulema|ulama]] posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the [[Kharijites|Khawarij]] in the very early years of [[Muslim history|Islamic history]] on [[Caliphate|Khilafa]] and [[Ummah]], or that of [[Shia Islam]] on the concept of [[Imamah]] are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the [[Sunni Islam|Ehl-i Sunna]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character. Political thought was not purely rooted in theism, however. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotleanism]] flourished as the Islamic Golden Age saw rise to a continuation of the [[Peripatetic school|peripaetic]] philosophers who implemented the ideas of [[Aristotle]] in the context of the Islamic world. Abunaser, Avicenna and Ibn Rushd where part of this philosophical school who claimed that human reason surpassed mere coincidence and revelation. They believed, for example, that natural phenomena occurs because of certain rules (made by god), not because god interfered directly (unlike Al-Ghazali and his followers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Farabi|title=Al-Fārābī {{!}} Muslim philosopher|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/avicenna/#H5|title=Avicenna (Ibn Sina) {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-22|title=Averroes|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Averroes&amp;oldid=837663527|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Ghazali|title=Al-Ghazālī {{!}} Muslim jurist, theologian, and mystic|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable political philosophers of the time include [[Nizam al-Mulk]], a Persian scholar and [[vizier]] of the Seljuq Empire who composed the ''[[Siyasatnama]]'', or the "Book of Government" in English. In it, he details the role of the state in terms of political affairs (i.e. how to deal with political opponents without ruining the government's image), as well as its duty to protect the poor and reward the worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-30|title=Siyasatnama|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Siyasatnama&amp;oldid=788295179|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his other work, he explains how the state should deal with other issues such as supplying jobs to immigrants like the [[Turkmens]] who were coming from the north (present day southern Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nizam-al-Mulk-Seljuq-vizier|title=Niẓām al-Mulk {{!}} Seljuq vizier|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ibn Khaldun ====

The 14th-century [[Arab]] scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] is considered one of the greatest political theorists. The British philosopher-anthropologist [[Ernest Gellner]] considered Ibn Khaldun's definition of [[government]], "...an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself," the best in the history of political theory. For Ibn Khaldun, government should be restrained to a minimum for as a necessary evil, it is the constraint of men by other men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gellner|first=Ernest|authorlink=Ernest Gellner|title=Plough, Sword, and Book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WwduQjFiB7kC&amp;pg=PA239|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-28702-7|page=239|quote=Ibn Khaldun's definition of government probably remains the best: ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Europe ===
[[Medieval]] political philosophy in [[Europe]] was heavily influenced by [[Christian]] thinking. It had much in common with the Mutazilite [[Islamic]] thinking in that the [[Roman Catholic]]s though subordinating [[philosophy]] to [[theology]] did not subject reason to revelation but in the case of contradictions, subordinated reason to faith as the Asharite of Islam. The Scholastics by combining the philosophy of Aristotle with the Christianity of St. Augustine emphasized the potential harmony inherent in reason and revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koetsier|first=L. S.|title=Natural Law and Calvinist Political Theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7uLE3DynB0YC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2004|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4122-1440-7|page=19|quote=...the Medieval Scholastics revived the concept of natural law. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] who helped reintroduce [[Aristotle]]'s works, which had only been transmitted to [[Catholic]] [[Europe]] through [[Muslim]] [[Spain]], along with the commentaries of [[Averroes]]. Aquinas's use of them set the agenda, for [[scholasticism|scholastic]] political philosophy dominated European thought for centuries even unto the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA346|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|page=346|quote=There was, however, at least one department of thought ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval political philosophers, such as Aquinas in ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', developed the idea that a king who is a tyrant is no king at all and could be overthrown.

[[Magna Carta]], viewed by many as a cornerstone of Anglo-American political liberty, explicitly proposes the right to revolt against the ruler for justice sake. Other documents similar to Magna Carta are found in other European countries such as Spain and Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valente|first=Claire|title=The theory and practice of revolt in medieval England|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B8yRrtm0LicC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-0901-8|page=14|quote=The two starting points of most medieval discussions ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Renaissance ===
During the [[Renaissance]] secular political philosophy began to emerge after about a century of theological political thought in Europe. While the Middle Ages did see secular politics in practice under the rule of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the academic field was wholly [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] and therefore Christian in nature.

==== Niccolò Machiavelli ====

One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'', written between 1511–12 and published in 1532, after Machiavelli's death. That work, as well as ''[[Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio|The Discourses]]'', a rigorous analysis of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]], did much to influence modern political thought in the West. A minority (including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Ian|title=Lecture on Machiavelli's The Prince|publisher=[[Malaspina University College]]|date=February 2002|url=http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/introser/machiavelli.htm|accessdate=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the [[Republic of Florence]] rather than the [[oligarchy]] of the di [[Medici]] family. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] and somewhat [[consequentialist]] view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e., the secure and powerful state. [[Thomas Hobbes]], well known for his theory of the [[social contract]], goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the [[English Renaissance]]. Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA310|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|pages=310–12|quote=...we witness the growth of political absolutism ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Enlightenment ===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|right|upright=1.45|thumb|Eugène Delacroix's ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830, Louvre), a painting created at a time when old and modern political philosophies came into violent conflict.]]During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, new theories about what the human was and is and about the definition of reality and the way it was perceived, along with the discovery of other societies in the Americas, and the changing needs of political societies (especially in the wake of the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]]), and the [[Haitian Revolution]] led to new questions and insights by such thinkers as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

These theorists were driven by two basic questions: one, by what right or need do people form states; and two, what the best form for a state could be. These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of "state" and "government." It was decided that "state" would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified. The term "government" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in [[political science]], although some political scientists, philosophers, [[history|historians]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of [[natural order (philosophy)|natural order]] was not introduced, the [[social sciences]] could not evolve independently of [[theistic]] thinking. Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barens|first1=Ingo|last2=Caspari|first2=Volker|last3=Schefold|first3=Bertram|editor1-last=Barens|editor1-first=Ingo|others=Volker Caspari ed., Bertram Schefold ed.|title=Political events and economic ideas|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x6C5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA206|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-152-6|pages=206–07|quote=Economic theory as political philosophy: the example of the French Enlightenment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the [[guild]] was subordinated to the theory of [[free trade]], and [[Roman Catholic]] dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by [[Protestant]] churches subordinate to each [[nation-state]], which also (in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region. However, the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion, particularly Christianity. The most outspoken critic of the church in France was [[François Marie Arouet de Voltaire]], a representative figure of the enlightenment. After Voltaire, religion would never be the same again in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=James M.|title=Religion and the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FcEy8SF63TgC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1997|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25760-6|pages=1–2|quote=... there emerged groups of freethinkers intent on grounding knowledge on the exercise of critical reason, as opposed to ... established religion ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ottoman Empire]], these ideological reforms did not take place and these views did not integrate into common thought until much later. As well, there was no spread of this doctrine within the [[New World]] and the advanced civilizations of the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Inca]], [[Mohican]], [[Delaware]], [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and especially the [[Iroquois]]. The [[Iroquois]] philosophy in particular gave much to Christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the [[United States]]: for example, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a great admirer of some of the methods of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johansen|first=Bruce Elliott|title=Native American political systems and the evolution of democracy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H593mgxQNu4C&amp;pg=PA69|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30010-3|page=69|quote=... the three-tier system of federalism ... is an inheritance of Iroquois inspiration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== John Locke ====

[[John Locke]] in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation. Locke stood to refute Sir [[Robert Filmer]]'s paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the [[divine right of kings]] became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from [[original sin]], Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as [[tabula rasa]]. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man.

=== Industrialization and the Modern Era ===
The [[Karl Marx|Marxist]] critique of capitalism—developed with [[Friedrich Engels]]—was, alongside liberalism and fascism, one of the defining ideological movements of the twentieth century. The [[industrial revolution]] produced a parallel revolution in political thought. [[Urbanization]] and [[capitalism]] greatly reshaped society. During this same period, the [[History of Socialism|socialist movement]] began to form. In the mid-19th century, [[Marxism]] was developed, and [[socialism]] in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class. Without breaking entirely from the past, Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], and [[Fidel Castro]]. Though [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s philosophy of history is similar to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s, and [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant's view of history—Marx declared that he was turning Hegel's dialectic, which was "standing on its head", "the right side up again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm|title=Capital Volume One, Afterword to the Second German Edition|last=Marx|first=Karl|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Marx who believed in [[historical materialism]], Hegel believed in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kain|first=Philip J.|title=Marx and modern political theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kvG8DVBeT9QC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1993|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-7866-2|pages=1–4|quote=Some of his texts, especially the ''Communist Manifesto'' made him seem like a sort of communist Descartes ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, [[socialism]] and [[trade union]]s were established members of the political landscape. In addition, the various branches of [[anarchism]], with thinkers such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] or [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[syndicalism]] also gained some prominence. In the Anglo-American world, [[anti-imperialism]] and [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|reason=Pluralism possibly earlier|date=April 2017}}

[[World War I]] was a watershed event in human history, changing views of governments and politics. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] (and similar, albeit less successful, revolutions in many other European countries) brought [[communism]]—and in particular the political theory of [[Leninism]], but also on a smaller level [[Luxemburgism]] (gradually)—on the world stage. At the same time, [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties won elections and formed governments for the first time, often as a result of the introduction of [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspalter|first=Christian|title=Importance of Christian and Social Democratic movements in welfare politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vouKut-RAYoC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2001|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-56072-975-4|page=70|quote=The pressing need for universal suffrage ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary ==
From the end of [[World War II]] until 1971, when [[John Rawls]] published ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world, as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content, and political science turned toward statistical methods and [[behavioralism]]. In continental Europe, on the other hand, the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy, with [[Marxism]] dominating the field. This was the time of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Louis Althusser]], and the victories of [[Mao Zedong]] in [[China]] and [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]], as well as the events of [[May 1968]] led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the [[New Left]]. A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including [[Karl Popper]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[Judith Shklar]]—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world, but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment.

[[Communism]] remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s. [[Colonialism]] and [[racism]] were important issues that arose. In general, there was a marked trend towards a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to political issues, rather than a philosophical one. Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how (or whether) to apply [[utilitarianism]] to problems of political policy, or how (or whether) to apply economic models (such as [[rational choice theory]]) to political issues. The rise of [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements]] and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as [[African Americans]] and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist, [[postcolonial]], and [[multicultural]] thought becoming significant. This led to a challenge to the [[social contract]] by philosophers [[Charles W. Mills]] in his book ''[[The Racial Contract]]'' and [[Carole Pateman]] in her book ''[[The Sexual Contract]]'' that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively.

In Anglo-American academic political philosophy, the publication of [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' in 1971 is considered a milestone. Rawls used a [[thought experiment]], the [[original position]], in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance. Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice. [[Robert Nozick]]'s 1974 book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', which won a [[National Book Award]], responded to Rawls from a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis Schaefer, [http://www.nysun.com/sports/reconsiderations-robert-nozick-and-coast-utopia Robert Nozick and the Coast of Utopia], [[The New York Sun]], April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought, in Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s. Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis, but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis. Out of the [[Frankfurt School]], thinkers like [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]] combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives. Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on [[structuralism]] and on a "return to [[Hegel]]". Within the (post-) structuralist line (though mostly not taking that label) are thinkers such as [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Claude Lefort]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]]. The [[Situationist International|Situationists]] were more influenced by Hegel; [[Guy Debord]], in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of [[commodity fetishism]] to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation.

Another debate developed around the (distinct) criticisms of liberal political theory made by [[Michael Walzer]], [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. The [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[communitarian]] debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems, rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspective.These and other communitarians (such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Daniel A. Bell]]) argue that, contra liberalism, communities are prior to individuals and therefore should be the center of political focus. Communitarians tend to support greater local control as well as economic and social policies which encourage the growth of [[social capital]].

A pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are [[republicanism]] (or neo- or civic-republicanism) and the [[capability approach]]. The resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s positive and negative forms of liberty, namely "liberty as non-domination." Unlike the American liberal movement which understands liberty as "non-interference," "non-domination" entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of any other person. To a liberal, a slave who is not interfered with may be free, yet to a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable. Prominent republicans include historian [[Quentin Skinner]], jurist [[Cass Sunstein]], and political philosopher [[Philip Pettit]]. The capability approach, pioneered by economists [[Mahbub ul Haq]] and [[Amartya Sen]] and further developed by legal scholar [[Martha Nussbaum]], understands freedom under allied lines: the real-world ability to act. Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced. In other words, it is not enough to be legally able to do something, but to have the real option of doing it.

Current emphasis on "commoditization of the everyday" has been decried by many contemporary theorists, some of them arguing the full brunt of it would be felt in ten years' time. "Pricing" such ethical categories like personal relations or sex, though always present, pushed by media agenda, is thus seen as crossing boundaries and having adverse societal and philosophical consequences.

A prominent subject in recent political philosophy is the theory of [[deliberative democracy]]. The seminal work was done by Jurgen Habermas in [[Germany]], but the most extensive literature has been in English, led by theorists such as [[Jane Mansbridge]], Joshua Cohen, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson, ''Democracy and Disagreement'' (Princeton University Press, 1996). Also see Gutmann and Thompson, ''Why Deliberative Democracy?'' (Princeton University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influential political philosophers ==
A larger [[list of political philosophers]] is intended to be closer to exhaustive. Listed below are some of the most [[Archetype|canonical]] or important thinkers, and especially philosophers whose central focus was in political philosophy and/or who are good representatives of a particular school of thought.
* [[Thomas Aquinas]]: In synthesizing Christian theology and Peripatetic (Aristotelian) teaching in his ''[[Treatise on Law]]'', Aquinas contends that God's gift of higher reason—manifest in human law by way of the divine virtues—gives way to the assembly of righteous government.
* [[Aristotle]]: Wrote his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' as an extension of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Notable for the theories that humans are social animals, and that the [[polis]] (Ancient Greek city state) existed to bring about the good life appropriate to such animals. His political theory is based upon an ethics of [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionism]] (as is [[Marx]]'s, on some readings).
* [[Mikhail Bakunin]]: After [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], Bakunin became the most important political philosopher of [[anarchism]]. His specific version of anarchism is called [[collectivist anarchism]].
* [[Jeremy Bentham]]: The first thinker to analyze social justice in terms of maximization of aggregate individual benefits. Founded the philosophical/ethical school of thought known as [[utilitarianism]].
* [[Isaiah Berlin]]: Developed the distinction between positive and negative liberty.
* [[Edmund Burke]]: Irish member of the British parliament, Burke is credited with the creation of conservative thought. Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' is the most popular of his writings where he denounced the French revolution. Burke was one of the biggest supporters of the American Revolution.
* [[Confucius]]: The first thinker to relate ethics to the political order.
* [[William E. Connolly]]: Helped introduce postmodern philosophy into political theory, and promoted new theories of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralism]] and [[agonistic democracy]].
* [[John Dewey]]: Co-founder of [[pragmatism]] and analyzed the essential role of education in the maintenance of democratic government.
* [[Han Feizi]]: The major figure of the Chinese Fajia ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]]) school, advocated government that adhered to laws and a strict method of administration.
* [[Michel Foucault]]: Critiqued the modern conception of power on the basis of the [[prison–industrial complex|prison complex]] and other prohibitive institutions, such as those that designate sexuality, madness and knowledge as the roots of their infrastructure, a critique that demonstrated that subjection is the power formation of subjects in any linguistic forum and that revolution cannot just be thought as the reversal of power between classes.
* [[Antonio Gramsci]]: Instigated the concept of ''[[hegemony]]''. Argued that the [[Sovereign state|state]] and the ruling class uses [[culture]] and [[ideology]] to gain the consent of the classes it rules over.
* [[Thomas Hill Green]]: Modern liberal thinker and early supporter of [[positive freedom]].
* [[Jürgen Habermas]]: Contemporary democratic theorist and sociologist. He has pioneered such concepts as the [[public sphere]], [[communicative action]], and [[deliberative democracy]]. His early work was heavily influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]].
* [[Friedrich Hayek]]: He argued that central planning was inefficient because members of central bodies could not know enough to match the preferences of consumers and workers with existing conditions. Hayek further argued that [[command economy|central economic planning]]—a mainstay of socialism—would lead to a "total" state with dangerous power. He advocated [[free-market]] capitalism in which the main role of the state is to maintain the [[rule of law]] and let spontaneous order develop.
* [[G. W. F. Hegel]]: Emphasized the "cunning" of history, arguing that it followed a rational trajectory, even while embodying seemingly irrational forces; influenced Marx, [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Michael Oakeshott|Oakeshott]].
* [[Thomas Hobbes]]: Generally considered to have first articulated how the concept of a [[social contract]] that justifies the actions of rulers (even where contrary to the individual desires of governed citizens), can be reconciled with a conception of sovereignty.
* [[David Hume]]: Hume criticized the social contract theory of John Locke and others as resting on a myth of some actual agreement. Hume was a realist in recognizing the role of force to forge the existence of states and that [[consent of the governed]] was merely hypothetical. He also introduced the concept of [[utility]], later picked up on and developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]].
* [[Thomas Jefferson]]: Politician and political theorist during the [[American Enlightenment]]. Expanded on the philosophy of Thomas Paine by instrumenting [[republicanism]] in the United States. Most famous for the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].
* [[Immanuel Kant]]: Argued that participation in civil society is undertaken not for self-preservation, as per [[Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]], but as a moral duty. First modern thinker who fully analyzed structure and meaning of obligation. Argued that an international organization was needed to preserve world peace.
* [[Peter Kropotkin]]: One of the classic anarchist thinkers and the most influential theorist of [[anarcho-communism]].
* [[John Locke]]: Like Hobbes, described a social contract theory based on citizens' fundamental rights in the [[state of nature]]. He departed from Hobbes in that, based on the assumption of a society in which moral values are independent of governmental authority and widely shared, he argued for a government with power limited to the protection of personal property. His arguments may have been deeply influential to the formation of the [[United States Constitution]].
* [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]: First systematic analyses of: (1) how consent of a populace is negotiated between and among rulers rather than simply a naturalistic (or theological) given of the structure of society; (2) precursor to the concept of ideology in articulating the epistemological structure of commands and law.
* [[James Madison]]: American politician and protege of Jefferson considered to be "Father of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]" and "Father of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]" of the United States. As a political theorist, he believed in [[separation of powers]] and proposed a comprehensive set of [[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks and balances]] that are necessary to protect the rights of an individual from the [[tyranny of the majority]].
* [[Herbert Marcuse]]: Called the father of the [[new left]]. One of the principal thinkers within the [[Frankfurt School]], and generally important in efforts to fuse the thought of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Marx]]. Introduced the concept of "[[repressive desublimation]]", in which social control can operate not only by direct control, but also by manipulation of desire. His work [[Eros and Civilization]] and notion of a non-repressive society was influential on the 1960s and its counter-cultural social movements.
* [[Karl Marx]]: In large part, added the historical dimension to an understanding of society, culture and economics. Created the concept of ''ideology'' in the sense of (true or false) beliefs that shape and control social actions. Analyzed the fundamental nature of class as a mechanism of governance and social interaction. Profoundly influenced world politics with his theory of communism.
* [[Mencius]]: One of the most important thinkers in the Confucian school, he is the first theorist to make a coherent argument for an obligation of rulers to the ruled.
* [[John Stuart Mill]]: A [[utilitarian]], and the person who named the system; he goes further than Bentham by laying the foundation for liberal democratic thought in general and modern, as opposed to classical, liberalism in particular. Articulated the place of individual liberty in an otherwise utilitarian framework.
* [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]]: Analyzed protection of the people by a "balance of powers" in the divisions of a state.
* [[John Rawls]]: Revitalized the study of normative political philosophy in Anglo-American universities with his 1971 book [[A Theory of Justice]], which uses a version of [[social contract theory]] to answer fundamental questions about [[justice]] and to criticise [[utilitarianism]].
* [[Mozi]]: Eponymous founder of the Mohist school, advocated a form of [[Mohist consequentialism|consequentialism]].
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]: Philosopher who became a powerful influence on a broad spectrum of 20th-century political currents in [[Marxism]], [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], [[socialism]], [[libertarianism]], and [[conservatism]]. His interpreters have debated the content of his political philosophy.
* [[Robert Nozick]]: Criticized Rawls, and argued for [[libertarianism]], by appeal to a hypothetical history of the [[State (polity)|state]] and of [[property]].
* [[Thomas Paine]]: [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writer who defended [[liberal democracy]], the [[American Revolution]], and [[French Revolution]] in ''[[Common Sense]]'' and The ''[[Rights of Man]]''.
* [[Plato]]: Wrote a lengthy dialog ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' in which he laid out his political philosophy: citizens should be divided into three categories. One category of people are the rulers: they should be philosophers, according to Plato, this idea is based on his [[Theory of Forms]].
* [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]: Commonly considered the father of modern [[anarchism]], specifically [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].
* [[Ayn Rand]]: Founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and prime mover of the Objectivist and Libertarian movements in mid-twentieth-century America. Advocated a complete, laissez-faire capitalism. Rand held that the proper role of government was exclusively the protection of individual rights without economic interference. The government was to be separated from economics the same way and for the same reasons it was separated from religion. Any governmental action not directed at the defense of individual rights would constitute the initiation of force (or threat of force), and therefore a violation not only of rights but also of the legitimate function of government.
* [[Murray Rothbard]]: The central theorist of [[anarcho-capitalism]] and an [[Austrian School]] economist.
* [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]: Analyzed the social contract as an expression of the [[general will]], and controversially argued in favor of absolute [[democracy]] where the people at large would act as [[Sovereignty|sovereign]].
* [[Carl Schmitt]]: German political theorist, tied to the Nazis, who developed the concepts of the Friend/Enemy Distinction and the State of exception. Though his most influential books were written in the 1920s, he continued to write prolifically until his death (in academic quasi-exile) in 1985. He heavily influenced 20th-century political philosophy both within the Frankfurt School and among others, not all of whom are philosophers, such as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Hannah Arendt]], and [[Giorgio Agamben]].
* [[Adam Smith]]: Often said to have founded modern [[economics]]; explained emergence of economic benefits from the self-interested behavior ("the invisible hand") of artisans and traders. While praising its efficiency, Smith also expressed concern about the effects of industrial labor (e.g., repetitive activity) on workers. His work on moral sentiments sought to explain social bonds which enhance economic activity.
* [[Socrates]]: Widely considered the founder of Western political philosophy, via his spoken influence on Athenian contemporaries; since Socrates never wrote anything, much of what we know about him and his teachings comes through his most famous student, Plato.
* [[Baruch Spinoza]]: Set forth the first analysis of ''[[rational egoism]]'', in which the rational interest of self is conformance with pure reason. To Spinoza's thinking, in a society in which each individual is guided by reason, political authority would be superfluous.
* [[Max Stirner]]: Important thinker within [[anarchism]] and the main representative of the anarchist current known as [[individualist anarchism]].
* [[Leo Strauss]]: Famously rejected modernity, mostly on the grounds of what he perceived to be modern political philosophy's excessive self-sufficiency of reason and flawed philosophical grounds for moral and political normativity. He argued instead we should return to pre-modern thinkers for answers to contemporary issues. His philosophy was influential on the formation of [[Neo-Conservativism]], and a number of his students later were members of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].
* [[Henry David Thoreau]]: Influential American thinker on such diverse later political positions and topics such as [[pacifism]], [[anarchism]], [[environmentalism]] and [[civil disobedience]] who influenced later important political activists such as [[Martin Luther King]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].
* [[Voltaire|François-Marie Arouet (Voltaire)]]: French Enlightenment writer, poet, and philosopher famous for his advocacy of civil liberties, including freedom of religion and free trade.
* [[Bernard Williams]]: A British moral philosopher whose posthumously published work on political philosophy ''In the Beginning was the Deed'' has been seen—along with the works of [[Raymond Geuss]]—as a key foundational work on political realism.
* [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]: A French political scientist and diplomat, known for his works ''[[Democracy in America]]'' and ''[[The Old Regime and the Revolution]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10608">'''Posthegemony''' or '''post-hegemony''' is a period or a situation in which [[hegemony]] is no longer said to function as the organizing principle of a national or post-national [[social order]], or of the relationships between and amongst [[nation state]]s within the global order.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|p=327|ps=: "Posthegemony&amp;nbsp;... is no longer a name for the hegemony of transnational capital, but the name of those 'places in which hegemony ceases to make sense' (Jean Franco)."}} The concept has different meanings within the fields of [[political theory]], [[cultural studies]], and [[international relations]].

==In cultural studies==
In the field of [[cultural studies]], posthegemony has been developed as a concept by a number of critics whose work engages with and critiques the use of [[cultural hegemony]] theory within the writings of [[Ernesto Laclau]] and within [[subaltern studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, see {{harvp|Yúdice|1995}}, {{harvp|Moreiras|2001}}, {{harvp|Williams|2002}}, and {{harvp|Beasley-Murray|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; George Yúdice, in 1995, was one of the first commentators to summarize the background to the emergence of this concept:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Flexible accumulation, consumer culture, and the "new world information order" are produced or distributed (made to flow) globally, to occupy the space of the nation, but are no longer "motivated" by any essential connections to a state, as embodied, for example, in a "national-popular" formation. Their motivations are both infra- and [[Supranational union|supranational]]. '''We might say that, from the purview of the national proscenium, a posthegemonic situation holds.''' That is, the "compromise solution" that culture provided for Gramsci is not now one that pertains to the national level but to the local and transnational. Instead, the "culture-ideology of consumerism" serves to naturalize global capitalism everywhere [emphasis added].{{sfnp|Yúdice|1995|p=4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of posthegemony is related to the rise of the "[[multitude]]" as a social force which, unlike the "people", cannot be captured by [[hegemony]], together with the roles of [[affect (philosophy)|affect]] and [[habitus (sociology)|habitus]] in mechanisms of social control and agency.&lt;ref&gt;These ideas are discussed extensively in {{harvp|Hardt|Negri|2000}}, {{harvp|Hardt|Negri|2004}}, and {{harvp|Beasley-Murray|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Posthegemony and its related terms are influenced by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Michael Hardt]] and [[Antonio Negri]]’s accounts of the supra- and infra-national forces that are said to have rendered obsolete the national-popular forms of coercion and consent through which, for [[Antonio Gramsci]], hegemony structured and constituted society.

The features of posthegemony as a concept correspond closely to those of [[postmodernity]]. Thus, posthegemony theory argues that ideology is no longer a political driving force in mechanisms of social control and that the modernist theory of hegemony, which depends on ideology, therefore no longer accurately reflects the [[social order]].{{sfnp|Beasley-Murray|2003|p=119}} Some commentators also argue that history is not, as [[Karl Marx]] described it, a [[class struggle]], but rather a "struggle to produce class".{{sfnp|Beasley-Murray|2003|p=120}}

The concept of posthegemony also resonates with the work of post-[[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] theorists such as [[Giorgio Agamben]]. Nicholas Thoburn, drawing on Agamben's discussion on the "state of exception", writes that "it is, perhaps, with the recasting of the relationship between law and politico-military and economic crises and interventions that is instituted in the state of exception that the time of hegemony is most revealed to have passed."{{sfnp|Thoburn|2007|p=89}}

== In international relations ==
In [[international relations]], ''posthegemony'' refers to the decline of the US [[Unilateralism|unilateral]] hegemony. This has likely been the result of the difficulties that have arisen out of the unilateral style [[foreign policy]]. These difficulties predominantly include disdain from; those directly affected by the, sometimes forceful, hegemonic actions of the US, those who spectated the actions, and even Americans themselves who view the actions of their government as immoral. For example, after the [[Vietnam War]], in 1978, 72 per cent of Americans thought the war was not a mistake but fundamentally wrong and immoral.{{sfnp|Hagopian|2009|p=13}} This exemplifies the hegemonic decline: how could the US maintain the legitimacy of their interventions if their own citizens find them wrong and immoral?{{tone inline|date=June 2018}}

The dominant power(s) of the world is/are fluid, the initial period of US unilateralism can be loosely pinpointed to their interventions during the world wars.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Following this period of rising US dominance on the world stage,
{{quote|there have been no shortage of people who, from the rise of the [Soviet Union's] space programme in the 1950s, through to the third world revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s in Vietnam, Iran and elsewhere, and to the emergence of Japan, Europe and now China as major economic powers, have predicted that US dominance, predominance, hegemony or, in more recent, [[post–Cold War era|post–Cold War]] terms, "unipolarity", are ebbing away.{{sfnp|Halliday|2008|p=12}}}}
The predictions of these individuals represent the fluidity of power over time, through the idea that, during the period where the US was unequivocally dominant, people could still see the inevitable future, of a change in power and authority, on the world stage.

==Criticism==

Among the criticisms of the theory of posthegemony is Richard Johnson's, that it involves "a marked reduction of social complexity."{{sfnp|Johnson|2007|p=102}} Johnson concedes that "one considerable achievement of 'the post-hegemony project' is to draw many observable [[post-9/11]] features into a single imaginative picture, while also synthesizing different currents in contemporary social theory." But he argues that "it is strange, however, that the result is viewed as the end of hegemony rather than as a new hegemonic moment."{{sfnp|Johnson|2007|p=102}} He, therefore, calls for a rejuvenation of the concept of hegemony, rather than its abandonment.

[[File:VomStein (Gemälde Rincklake).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Freiherr vom und zum Stein]]]]
[[File:Fürst Hardenberg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl August von Hardenberg]].]]

The '''Prussian Reform Movement''' was a series of constitutional, administrative, social and economic reforms early in the nineteenth-century [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. They are sometimes known as the '''Stein-Hardenberg Reforms''', for [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Karl Freiherr vom Stein]] and [[Karl August Fürst von Hardenberg]], their main initiators. Before the Second World War, German historians, such as [[Heinrich von Treitschke]], saw the reforms as the first steps towards the [[unification of Germany]] and the foundation of the [[German Empire]].{{sfn|Dwyer|2014|p=255}}

The reforms were a reaction to the defeat of the Prussians by [[Napoleon I]] at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena-Auerstedt]] in 1806, leading to the [[Treaties of Tilsit|second Treaty of Tilsit]], in which Prussia lost about half its territory and was forced to make massive tribute payments to France. To make those payments, it needed to rationalize its administration. Prussia's defeat and subjection also demonstrated the weaknesses of its [[absolute monarchy]] model of statehood and excluded it from the great powers of Europe.

To become a great power again, it initiated reforms from 1807 onwards, based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas and in line with reforms in other European nations. They led to the reorganization of Prussia's government and administration and changes in its agricultural trade regulations, including the abolition of [[serfdom]] and allowing peasants to become landowners. In industry, the reforms aimed to encourage [[Competition (economics)|competition]] by suppressing the [[monopoly]] of [[guild]]s. The administration was decentralised and the nobility's power reduced. There were also parallel military reforms led by [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]], [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]] and [[Hermann von Boyen]] and educational reforms headed by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Gneisenau made it clear that all these reforms were part of a single programme when he stated that Prussia had to put its foundations in "the three-faced primacy of arms, knowledge and the constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Cited after {{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is harder to ascertain when the reforms ended – in the fields of the constitution and internal politics in particular, the year 1819 marked a turning point, with [[Concert of Europe|Restoration]] tendencies gaining the upper hand over constitutional ones. Though the reforms undoubtedly modernised Prussia, their successes were mixed, with results that were against the reformers' original wishes. The agricultural reforms freed some peasants, but the liberalisation of landholding condemned many of them to poverty. The nobility saw its privileges reduced but its overall position reinforced.

==Reasons, aims and principles==

===Prussia in 1807===

====Prussia's position in Europe====
[[File:Preussen-1806.jpg|thumb|Map showing Prussian territory after Tilsit (in orange)]]
In 1803, [[German Mediatisation]] profoundly changed the political and administrative map of Germany. Favourable to mid-ranking states and to Prussia, the reorganisation reinforced French influence. In 1805, the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] formed in the hope of stopping French domination of Europe from advancing further, but the coalition's armies were defeated at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] in December 1805. Triumphant, [[Napoleon I]] continued working towards dismantling the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. On 12 July 1806, he detached 16 German states from it to form the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] under French influence. On 6 August the same year, [[Francis I of Austria]] was forced to renounce his title of emperor, and the Empire had to be dissolved.

French influence reached as far as the Prussian frontier by the time [[Frederick III of Prussia|Frederick William III of Prussia]] realised the situation. Encouraged by the [[United Kingdom]], Prussia broke off its neutrality (in force since 1795) and repudiated the 1795 [[Peace of Basel]], joined the [[Fourth Coalition]] and entered the war against France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia mobilised its troops on 9 August 1806 but two months later was defeated at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena-Auerstedt]]. Prussia was on the verge of collapse, and three days after the defeat Frederick William III issued posters appealing to the inhabitants of his capital Berlin to remain calm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nordbruch|1996|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later, Napoleon entered Berlin.

The war ended on 7 July 1807 with the first Treaty of Tilsit between Napoleon and [[Alexander I of Russia]]. Two days later, Napoleon signed a second Treaty of Tilsit with Prussia, removing half its territory&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Knopper|Mondot|2008|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forcing Prussia's king to recognise [[Jérôme Bonaparte]] as sovereign of the newly created [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], to which Napoleon annexed the Prussian territories west of the [[river Elbe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia had had 9 million inhabitants in 1805,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pölitz|1830|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which it lost 4.55 million in the treaty.&lt;ref name="p501"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=501}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also forced to pay 120 million francs to France in war indemnities&lt;ref name="p501" /&gt; and fund a French occupying force of 150,000 troops.

====Financial situation====
The biting defeat of 1806 was not only the result of poor decisions and Napoleon's military genius, but also a reflection on Prussia's poor internal structures. In the 18th century the Prussian state had been the model of [[enlightened despotism]] for the rest of Germany. To the west and south, there was no single state or alliance that could challenge it. Yet in the era of [[Frederick II of Prussia]] it was a country oriented towards reform, beginning with the abolition of torture in 1740.

[[File:Der König überall2.JPG|thumb|[[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] inspecting his lands and talking to potato growers.]]
The economic reforms of the second half of the 18th century were based on a [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] logic. They had to allow Prussia a certain degree of [[self-sufficiency]] and give it sufficient surpluses for export. Joseph Rovan emphasises that {{cquote|the state's interest required that its subjects were kept in good health, well nourished, and that agriculture and manufacture made the country independent of foreign countries, all the while allowing it to raise money by exporting surpluses&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Economic development also had to fund and support the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Reihlen|1988|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia's infrastructure was developed in the form of canals, roads and factories. Roads connected its outlying regions to its centre, the [[Oder]], [[Warta]] and [[Noteć]] marshes were reclaimed and farmed&lt;ref name="p411"&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; and apple-growing was developed.

However, industry remained very limited, with heavy state-control. Trades were organised into monopolistic guilds and fiscal and customs laws were complex and inefficient. After the defeat of 1806, funding the occupation force and the war indemnities put Prussia's economy under pressure. As in the 18th century, the early 19th century reforms aimed to create budgetary margins, notably in their efforts towards economic development.

====Administrative and legal situation====
Frederick II of Prussia favoured both economic and political reform. His government worked on the first codification of Prussia's laws – the 19,000 paragraph ''Allgemeines Landrecht für die preußischen Staaten'' (literally the ''General legal code for the Prussia states''). Article 22 indicated that all his subjects were equal before the law: {{Cquote|The state's laws unite all its members, without difference of status, rank or sex}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Frederick died in 1786 leaving the code incomplete and was succeeded by [[Frederick William II of Prussia]], who extended the same administrative structure and the same civil servants.

The absolutist system started to re-solidify under the obscurantist influence of [[Johann Christoph von Wöllner]], financial privy councillor to Frederick William II. The reforms stalled, especially in the field of modernising society. The editing of the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'' was completed in 1792, but the [[French Revolution]] led to opposition to it, especially from the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then withdrawn from circulation for revision and did not come back into force until 1794. Its aims included linking the state and middle class society to the law and to civil rights, but at the same time it retained and confirmed the whole structure of the [[Ancien Régime]].&lt;ref name="p411" /&gt; [[Serfdom]], for example, was abolished in Prussia's royal domains but not in the estates of the great landowners east of the [[river Elbe]].&lt;ref name="Nipperdey_33"&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nobility also held onto its position in the army and administration.

In 1797 Frederick William III succeeded his father Frederick William II, but at the time of his accession he found society dominated by the old guard, apart from the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'' promulgated in 1794. His own idea of the state was absolutist and he considered that the state had to be in the hands of the sovereign.&lt;ref name="harvp|Griewank|2003|p=14"&gt;{{harvp|Griewank|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1806, several observers and high-level civil servants such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein]] and [[Karl August von Hardenberg]] underlined the fact that the Prussia state needed restructuring. As Minister of Finances and the Economy, Stein put some reforms in place, such as standardising the price of salt (then a state monopoly) and partially abolishing the export-import taxes between the kingdom's territories. In April 1806, he published ''Darstellung der fehlerhaften Organisation des Kabinetts und der Notwendigkeit der Bildung einer Ministerialkonferenz'' (literally ''Exposé on the imperfect organisation of the cabinet and on the necessity of forming a ministerial conference''). In it, he wrote: {{Cquote|There should be a new and improved organisation of state affairs, to the measure of the state's needs born of circumstances. The main aim is to gain more strength and unity across the administration}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Türk|Lemke|Bruch|2006|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Start of the reforms===

====Trigger – the defeat of 1806====
[[File:Grassi, Josef Mathias - Luise von Mecklenburg-Strelitz.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Queen Louise of Prussia]]]]
Prussia's war against Napoleon revealed the gaps in its state organisation. Pro-war and a strong critic of his sovereign's policies, Stein was dismissed in January 1807 after the defeat by France. However, Frederick William III saw that the Prussian state and Prussian society could only survive if they began to reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|p=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the treaty of Tislsit, he recalled Stein as a minister on 10 July 1807 with the backing of Hardenberg and Napoleon, the latter of whom saw in Stein a supporter of France.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Pertz, pp. 449–450.{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] also supported Stein's re-appointment&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=451}}&lt;/ref&gt; – indeed, she was more in favour of reform than her husband and was its main initiator. Aided by Stein, Hardenberg and others, she had convinced her husband to mobilise in 1806 and in 1807 she had even met with Napoleon to demand that he review the hard conditions imposed in the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Förster|2004|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardenberg wrote the same year: {{cquote|I believe that queen Louise could tell the king what the queen of Navarre, [[Catherine de Foix]], said to her husband [[Jean d'Albret]] – "If we were born, your dear Catherine and my dear Jean, we would not have lost our kingdom"; for she would have listened to men of energy and asked advice, she would have taken them on and acted decisively. What [the king] lacks in personal strength is replaced in this way. An enterprising courage would have replaced a tolerant courage.&lt;ref name="harvp|Griewank|2003|p=14"&gt;{{harvp|Griewank|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stein set certain conditions for his taking the job, among which was that the cabinets system should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Pertz, pp. 115–116.{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its place, ministers had to win their right to power by speaking to the king directly. After this condition had been satisfied, Stein took up his role and was thus directly responsible for the civil administration as well as exercising a controlling role over the other areas. Frederick William III still showed little inclination to engage in reforms and hesitated for a long while.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Förster|2004|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reformers thus had to expend much effort convincing the king. In this situation, it was within the bureaucracy and the army that the reformers had to fight the hardest against the nobility and the conservative and restorationist forces. The idealist philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] thus had a great influence on the reformers – Stein and Hardenberg each produced a treatise describing their ideas in 1807.

====''Nassauer Denkschrift''====
[[File:Standbild Heumarkt Köln - Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Heinrich vom Stein]], instigator of the early reforms]]
After his recall, Stein retired to his lands in [[Nassau, Germany|Nassau]]. In 1807, he published the ''Nassauer Denkschrift'', whose main argument was the reform of the administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the reforms in the states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], Stein's approach was traditionalist and above all anti-Enlightenment, focussing instead on critiquing absolutism. Stein followed English models such as the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and was sceptical of a centralised and militarised bureaucracy, favouring a decentralised and collegiate administration. With his collaborators, he followed (in his own words) a "policy of defensive modernisation, not with Napoleon but against him".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stein, the administration should be split up by field and no longer by geographical area.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the administration had to be divided into two branches – the public revenue branch and the top-level state-policy branch (''oberste Staatsbehörde''). One of the main aims of this concept was to rationalise the state financial system to raise the money to meet its war indemnities under the treaty of Tilsit. Rationalising the state finances would allow the state to raise revenue but limit losses due to poor administrative organisation.

Stein was an anti-absolutist and an anti-statist, suspicious of bureaucracy and central government. For him, civil servants were only men paid to carry out their task with "indifference" and "fear of innovation".&lt;ref name="p141"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, he set out to decentralise and form a collegiate state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein thus gave more autonomy to the provinces, [[Districts of Germany|Kreise]] and towns. Thanks to the different posts he had previously held, Stein, realised that he had to harmonise the government of the provinces.&lt;ref name="p141" /&gt; He had recourse to the old corporative constitution, as he had experienced in [[Westphalia]]. The landowner, according to Stein, was the keystone to local self-government – "If the landowner is excluded from all participation in the provincial administration, then the link which links him to the fatherland remains unused".&lt;ref name="p141"/&gt;

However, it was not only functional considerations which played a role for Stein. He felt he first had to educate the people in politics and provincial self-government was one of the most useful things in this area. On landowners' participation in the provincial administration, he wrote&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|the economy as regards administrative costs is however the least important advantage gained by the landowners' participation in the provincial administration. What is much more important is to stimulate the spirit of the community and of the civic sense, the use of sleeping and poorly led forces and spreading knowledge, the harmony between the spirit of the nation, its views and its needs and those of the national administrations, the re-awakening of the feelings for the fatherland, independence and national honour.}} In his reform projects, Stein tried to reform a political system without losing sight of the Prussian unity shaken by the defeat of 1806.

====''Rigaer Denkschrift''====
[[File:Standbild Heumarkt Köln - Barthold Georg Niebuhr.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Niebuhr]] on the Cologne monument (1878)]]
Stein and Hardenberg not only made a mark on later policy but also represented two different approaches to politics, with Hardenberg more steeped in Enlightenment ideas. He took the principles of the French Revolution and the suggestions created by Napoleon's practical policy on board more deeply than Stein.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardenberg was a [[statism|statist]] who aspired to reinforce the state through a dense and centralised administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kitchen|2006|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, these differences only represented a certain change of tendency among the reformers. The initiatives put in place were very much things of their own time, despite the latter umbrella concept of the 'Stein-Hardenberg reforms'.

The ''Rigaer Denkschrift'' was published the same year as Stein's work and presented on 12 September 1807. It bore the title 'On the reorganisation of the Prussian state'. Previously living in [[Riga]], Hardenberg had been summoned in July by the king of Prussia under pressure from Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardenberg developed ideas on the overall organisation of the Prussian state that were different from those of his fellow reformers. The main editors of the ''Rigaer Denkschrift'' were [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]], an expert financier, [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], a future minister of Finances&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Walther|1993|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön]]. These three men concluded that the Revolution had given France a new impetus: "All the sleeping forces were re-awakened, the misery and weakness, the old prejudices and the shortcomings were destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;''Rigaer Denkschrift'' in {{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in their view, Prussia had to follow France's example: {{Cquote|The folly of thinking that one can access the revolution in the safest way, remaining attached to the [[ancien regime]] and strictly following the principles for which it argues has only stimulated the revolution and made it continually grow larger. These principles' power is so great – they are so generally recognised and accepted, that the state that does not accept them must expect to be ruined or to be forced to accept them ; even the rapacity of Napoleon and his most-favoured aides are submitted to this power, and will remain so against their will. One cannot deny that, despite the iron despotism with which he governs, he nevertheless follows these principles widely in their essential features ; at least he is forced to make a show of obeying them.&lt;ref name="Rigaer_88"&gt;''Rigaer Denkschrift'' in {{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The authors thus favoured a revolution "im guten Sinn" or "in the right sense",&lt;ref name="Rigaer_88"/&gt; which historians later described as "revolution from above". Sovereigns and their ministers thus put in place reforms to gain all the advantages of a revolution without any of the disadvantages, such as losing their power or suffering from setbacks or outbreaks of violence.

As in Stein's Denkschrift, the ''Rigaer Denkschrift'' favours reviving national spirit to work with the nation and the administration. Hardenberg also sought to define society's three classes – the nobility, the middle class and the peasants. For him, the peasants took part in "the most numerous and most important but nevertheless the most neglected and belittled class in the state" and added that "the peasant class has to become the main object of our attention".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardenberg also sought to underline the principal of merit which he felt had to rule in society, by affirming "no task in the state, without exception, is for this or that class but is open to merit and to skill and to the ability of all classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview of the reforms===
Within fourteen months of his appointment, Stein put in place or prepared the most important reforms. The major financial crisis caused by the requirements of Tilsit forced Stein into a radical austerity policy, harnessing the state's machinery to raise the required indemnities. The success of the reforms begun by Stein was the result of a discussion already going on within the upper bureaucracy and Stein's role in putting them in place was variable – he was almost never, for example, involved in questions of detail. Many of the reforms were drafted by others among his collaborators, such as [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön]] in the case of the October decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Klein|1965|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stein was responsible for presenting the reforms to the king and to other forces opposed to them, such as the nobility.

[[File:2006-08-07 Rathaus Schoeneberg Gedenkrelief vom Stein.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque celebrating Stein and the ''Städteordnung'' in Berlin (1913)]]
During Stein's short period of office, decisive laws were promulgated, even if the organizational law on state administration was not published until 1808 (i.e. after Stein's fall). It was during Stein's time in office that the edict of October 1807 and the cities' organizational reforms (''Städteordnung'') of 1808 were put into effect. After a short term of office by [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], Hardenberg regained control of policy. From 1810, he bore the title of ''[[Staatskanzler]]'',&lt;ref name="harvp|Büsch|1992|p=287"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; retaining it until 1822. Thanks to him, land reform was completed via the Edicts of Regulation (''Regulierungsedikten'') of 1811 and 1816 as well as the ''Ablöseordnung'' (literally the ''redemption decree'') of 1821. He also pushed through the reforms of trades such as the edict on professional tax of 2 November 1810 and the law on policing trades (''Gewerbepolizeigesetz'') of 1811. In 1818 he reformed the customs laws, abolishing internal taxes. As for social reform, the edict of emancipation was promulgated in 1812 for Jewish citizens. Despite the different initial situations and aims pursued, similar reforms were carried out in the states of the Confederation of the Rhine, except for the military and educational reforms. The Restoration tendencies put a stop to the reformist policy in Prussia around 1819 or 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main reform fields===
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|upright|In the field of political economy, the reformers were strongly influenced by [[Adam Smith]].]]
The reforms which were to be put in place were essentially a synthesis between historic and progressive concepts. Their aim was to replace the absolutist state structures which had become outdated. The state would have to offer its citizens the possibility of becoming involved in public affairs on the basis of personal freedom and equality before the law. The government's main policy aim was to make it possible to liberate Prussian territory from French occupation and return the kingdom to great-power status through modernising domestic policy.&lt;ref name="p453"&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prussian subject had to become an active citizen of the state thanks to the introduction of self-government to the provinces, districts (''kreise'') and towns. National sentiment had to be awakened as Stein foresaw in his Nassau work,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; but a citizen's duties were in some ways more important than his or her rights. Moreover, Stein's concept of self-government rested on a class-based society. A compromise between corporative aspects and a modern representative system was put in place. The old divisions into the [[three estates]] of nobility, clergy and [[bourgeoisie]] were replaced by divisions into nobility, bourgeoisie and peasants. The right to vote also had to be expanded, particularly to free peasants, which would be one of the bases for the freeing of the peasants in 1807.

The new organisation of power in the countryside and reform of industry were factors in the liberalisation of the Prussian economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, the Prussian reforms went much further than those in the states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] and were much more successful. The 1806 financial crisis, intensified by the indemnities, the occupation costs and other war costs, gave the necessary impetus for these changes – in all, Prussia had to pay France 120 million francs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leo|1845|p=491}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freeing of the peasants, the industrial reforms and the other measures removed economic barriers and imposed free competition. The Prussian reforms relied on the economic liberalism of [[Adam Smith]] (as propounded by [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön]] and [[Christian Jakob Kraus]]) more heavily than the south German reformers. The Prussian reformers did not actively seek to encourage Prussian industry, which was then under-developed, but to remedy the crisis in the agricultural economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=109–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State and administration==
The reformers' top priority was to reorganise the administration and the state. Before 1806, there was not really a single Prussian state, but a multiplicity of states and provinces, mostly only held together by the single person of the king himself. There was no unified administration – instead there were the two parallel structures of decentralised administrations (each responsible for all portfolios within a single given territory) and a centralised administration (responsible for a single portfolio across the whole of Prussia). This double structure made any coordinated action difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also had no overview of Prussia's economic situation and its government ministers had little clout faced with the king's cabinet, where they had less power than the king's private political councillors.

===Bureaucracy and leadership===
The start of the Stein era saw the unification of the Prussian state, with the old system of cabinets being abolished. A ministry of state (''Staatsministerium'') was introduced on 16 December 1808 in place of a top-level administration poorly defined as the ''Generaldirektorium''. This reform was completed in 1810. Now the administration was ruled according to the principle of portfolios. The ''Staatsministerium'' included five major ministries – minister of the interior, minister for foreign affairs, minister for finances, minister for justice and minister of war, all responsible to the king alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; These modifications could not take full effect, however, until a more effective statist model of leadership was created. This was done by replacing Prussian absolutism with a double domination of king and bureaucracy, in which the ministers had an important role, reducing the king's influence and meaning he could now only reign through his ministers' actions. In Stein's era, the ''Staatsministerium'' was organised in a collegiate way without a prime minister – that post was set up under Hardenberg, who received the title of ''Staatskanzler'' or State Chancellor in June 1810&lt;ref name="harvp|Büsch|1992|p=287"/&gt; along with control over the ministers' relations with the king.

The role of the head of state was also considerably modified. From 1808, Prussia was divided into districts. The different governments of these districts were set up according to the principle of portfolios, as with the national ministers of state. Each region was given an ''[[Oberpräsident]]'' for the first time, directly subordinate to the national ministers and with the role of stimulating public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their rôle, which even went as far as putting up sanitary cordons in the event of an epidemic, was similar to that of French [[prefect (France)|prefect]]s – that is, to represent regional interests to the central government. The post was abolished in 1810 but revived in 1815 to play an important part in political life. It was in this context that justice and administration were separated once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Botzenhart|1985|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the establishment of administrative acts, the people concerned thus had a right of appeal. Nevertheless, there was no judicial control on the administration. Aiming to reduce any influence on the administration, this was reinforced by different administrative acts. The organisation that the reformers put in place served as a model for other German states and to major businesses.

===National representation===
[[File:Friedrich-August-Ludwig-von-der-Marwitz-1777-1837.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich August von der Marwitz]] was one of the representatives of the aristocratic opposition.]]
In parallel to the ''Staatsministerium'', Stein planned the creation of a ''Staatsrat'' or [[Privy Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he had had no opportunity to set up a correctly functioning one by 1808 and it was Hardenberg who set it up in 1810. The text of the relevant law stated: {{Cquote|We ordain a Council of State and by edict give our orders and our decisions on one side in this upper chamber and on the other side in our cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The members of the Council of State had to be current ministers or former ministers, high-level civil servants, princes of the royal house or figures nominated by the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|pp=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commission was also formed to function as a kind of parliament, with major legislative rights. As a bastion of the bureaucracy, the Council of State had to prevent any return to absolutism or any moves to reinforce the interests of the [[Ancien Régime]]. The Council of State also had to [[subrogation|subroge]] all laws and administrative and constitutional procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way as the towns' self-government, Hardenberg foresaw the establishment of a national representative body made up of [[Imperial State|corporative]] and representative elements. The first assembly of notable figures was held in 1811 and the second in 1812. These were made up of a corporative base of 18 aristocratic landowners, 12 urban property owners and nine representatives from among the peasants. This corporative composition was based partly on the traditional conception of society and partly on practical and fiscal considerations&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=461}}&lt;/ref&gt; – in order to be able to pay its war indemnities to France, the Prussian state had to have massive recourse to credit contracts issued by the aristocrats and to gain credit in foreign countries the different states had to offer themselves as guarantors.

After the summoning of the provisional assemblies, it quickly became clear that their deputies' first priority was not the state's interests but more defending their own classes' interests. The nobility saw the reforms as trying to reduce their privileges and so blocked them in the assemblies, led by figures such as [[Friedrich August von der Marwitz]] and Friedrich Ludwig Karl Fink von Finkenstein. Their resistance went so far that the cabinet even resorted to imprisoning them at [[Spandau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bussiek|2002|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Reinhart Koselleck]] has argued that the establishment of a corporative national representative body prevented all later reforms. At the end of the reforming period, the districts and the provincial representative bodies (such as the ''Provinziallandtage'') remained based on corporative principles. Prussia was prevented from forming a true representative national body, with considerable consequences on the internal development of Prussia and the [[German Confederation]]. Thus, while the states of the Confederation of the Rhine located in southern Germany became constitutional states, Prussia remained without a parliament until 1848.&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=113"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform of the towns===
[[File:Stadtverordnete1808.jpg|thumb|upright|Religious service for the first Prussian municipal councillors in 1808 in Berlin]]
Prior to the reforms the Prussian towns east of the [[river Elbe]] were under the state's direct control, with any surviving instances of self-government retaining their names and forms but none of their power. Stein's reform of the towns used this former tradition of self-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; All rights specific to a certain city were abolished and all the cities put under the same structures and rule – this even came to be the case for their courts and police. Self-government was at the centre of the town reforms of 1808, with the towns now no longer subject to the state and their citizens given a duty to participate in the towns' political life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the strongest indication of Stein's rejection of a centralised bureaucracy – self-government had to awaken its citizens' interest in public affairs in order to benefit the whole Prussian state.

The ''Städteordnung'' (Municipal Ordinance) of 1808 defined a citizen (or at least a citizen in the sense of the inhabitant of a town or city) as "a citizen or member of an urban community which possesses the right of citizenship in a town".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipal councillors were representatives of the town and not of an order or [[Three Estates|estate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; These councillors could be elected by all landowning citizens with a taxable revenue of at least 15 [[Thaler|taler]]. A councillor's main task was to participate in the election of a municipal council or ''Magistrat'', headed by a mayor. The election of the mayor and the members of the council had to be ratified by the central government. Different officials were put in place to carry out administrative portfolios. The council managed the municipal budget and the town also managed its own police.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some democratic elements, the town administrations retained large corporative elements – the groups were differentiated according to their estates and only citizens had full rights. Only landowners and industrial property-owners had a right to citizenship, though it was in principle also open to other people, such as ''Eximierten'' (bourgeois people, mostly those in state service) or ''Schutzverwandten'' (members of the lower classes without full citizenship rights). The costs linked to a citizen's [[octroi]] dissuaded many people. It was only the new reform of 1831 which replaced the 1808 assemblies of ''Bürger'' (citizens) with assemblies of inhabitants. Until the [[Vormärz]], self-government in the towns was in the hands of artisans and established businessmen. In the cities and large towns, the citizens with full rights and their families represented around a third of the total population. Resistance by the nobility prevented these reforms from also being set up in the countryside.&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=113"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|pp=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reforms were a step towards modern civic self-government.

===Customs and tax reforms===
Tax reform was a central problem for the reformers, notably due to the war indemnities imposed by Napoleon, and these difficulties marked Hardenberg's early reforms. He managed to avoid state bankruptcy&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Müller-Osten|2007|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inflation by increasing taxes or selling off lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; These severe financial problems led to a wholesale fiscal reform. Taxes were standardised right across Prussia, principally by replacing the wide variety of minor taxes with main taxes. The reformers also tried to introduce equal taxation for all citizens, thus bringing them into conflict with aristocratic privileges. On 27 October 1810, the king proclaimed in his ''Finanzedikt'':{{cquote|We find we need to ask all our faithful subjects to pay increased taxes, mainly in the taxes on consumer goods and deluxe objects, though these will be simplified and charged on fewer articles, associated with the raising of complementary taxes and [[excise]]s all as heavier taxes. These taxes will be borne in a proportional manner by all the classes of the nation and will be reduced as soon as the unfortunate need disappears.{{#tag:ref|"Wir sehen Uns genöthigt, von Unsern getreuen Unterthanen die Entrichtung erhöhter Abgaben, hauptsächlich von der Konsumtion und von Gegenständen des Luxus zu fordern, die aber vereinfacht, auf weniger Artikel zurückgebracht, mit Abstellung der Nachschüsse und der Thoraccisen, so wie mehrerer einzelner lästigen Abgaben, verknüpft und von allen Klassen der Nation verhältnißmäßig gleich getragen, und gemindert werden sollen, sobald das damit zu bestreitende Bedürfniß aufhören wird."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}}}
Excises were raised the following year on appeals.&lt;ref name="p118"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1819, excise (originally only raised by the towns) was suppressed and replaced with a tax on the consumption of beer, wine, gin and tobacco.&lt;ref name="p28"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the industrial sphere, several taxes were replaced with a progressively spread-out professional tax. Other innovations were an income tax and a tax on wealth based on a tax evaluation carried out by the taxpayer. 1820 saw protests against a tax on classes, the tax being defined by the taxpayer's position in society.&lt;ref name="p28" /&gt; This tax on classes was an intermediate form between [[Tax per head|poll tax]] and income tax. The towns had the possibility of retaining the tax on cattle and cereal crops. The results for fiscal policy remain controversial. The nobility was not affected by the taxes as the reformers had originally planned, so much so that they did not managed to put in place a 'foncier' tax also including the nobility. The poorest suffered most as a result of these measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zollvereinpreussen.jpeg|thumb|One of the forerunners of the ''Zollverein'' was [[Wilhelm Anton von Klewitz]], Prussian Minister of Finances.]]
It was only after the end of the Napoleonic Wars and after the territorial reorganisation of Europe at the [[Congress of Vienna]] that Prussia's customs duties were reformed. At the Congress Prussia regained its western territories, leading to economic competition between the industrialised part of these territories such as the [[Rhine Province]], the [[Province of Westphalia]] and the territories in Saxony on the one hand and the essentially agricultural territories to the east of the Elbe on the other. Customs policy was also very disparate.&lt;ref name="p118" /&gt; Thus, in 1817, there were 57 customs tariffs on 3,000 goods passing from the historic western territories to the Prussian heartland, with the taxes in the heartland not yet having spread to the formerly French-dominated western provinces.

This was one of the factors that made customs reform vital. That reform occurred on 26 May 1818, with the establishment of a compromise between the interest of the major landowners practicing free-exchange and those of the still-weak industrial economy asking for [[protectionism|protectionist]] custom duties. They therefore only took on what would now be called a tax for protecting internal markets from foreign competition and customs duties for haulage were lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mercantile policy instituted by Frederick II thus came to an end. Export bans were lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Reihlen|1988|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The customs laws and duties put in place by the reformers proved so simple and effective over time that they served as a model for taxation in other German states for around fifty years and that their basic principles remained in place under the [[German Empire]]. The Prussian customs policy was one of the important factors in the creation of the [[Zollverein|Deutscher Zollverein]] in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fischer|1972|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|pp=442–445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and politics==

===Agricultural reforms===
Agriculture was reformed across Europe at this time, though in different ways and in different phases. The usefulness of existing agricultural methods came into doubt and so the [[Ancien Régime]]'s and [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s agricultural structures were abolished. Peasants were freed and became landowners; and services and [[corvée]]s were abolished. Private landownership also led to the breakdown of [[common land]]s – that is, to the usage of woods and meadows 'in common'. These communal lands were mostly given to lords in return for lands acquired by the peasants. Some meadow{{what|date=May 2018}} reforms had already taken place in some parts of Prussia before 1806, such as the freeing of the peasants on royal lands in the 18th century, though this freeing only fully came into force in 1807.

The landowning nobility successfully managed to oppose similar changes. The government had to confront aristocratic resistance even to the pre-1806 reforms, which became considerable. The ''Gesindeordnung'' of 1810 was certainly notable progress for servants compared to that proposed in the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'', but still remained conservative and favourable to the nobility. The nobility's opposition to this also led to several privileges being saved from abolition. The rights of the police and the courts were controlled more strongly by the state, but not totally abolished like religious and scholarly patrongage, hunting rights and fiscal privileges. Unlike the reforms in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], the nobles were not asked to justify their rank. The reformers made compromises, but the nobility were unable to block the major changes brought by the reforms' central points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|pp=40–43, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|p=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Edict of October 1807====
[[File:Oktoberedikt.jpg|thumb|upright|Frontispiece of the October 1807 edict.]]
The freeing of the peasants marked the start of the Prussian reforms. The kingdom's modernisation began by modernising its base, that is, its peasants and its agriculture. At the start of the 19th century, 80% of the German population lived in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Botzenhart|1985|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edict of 9 October 1807, one of the central reforms, liberated the peasants and was signed only five days after Stein's appointment on von Schön's suggestion. The October edict began the process of abolishing [[serfdom]] and its hereditary character. The first peasants to be freed were those working on the domains in the ''Reichsritter'' and on 11 November 1810 at the latest, all the Prussian serfs were declared free:&lt;ref name="p51"&gt;{{harvp|Botzenhart|1985|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Cquote|On [[St Martin's Day]] 1810 all servitude ended throughout our states. After St Martin's Day 1810, there would be nothing but free people as was already the case over our domains in our provinces[...].{{#tag:ref|"Mit dem Martini-Tage Eintausend Achthundert und Zehn (1810.) hört alle Guts-Unterthänigkeit in Unsern sämmtlichen Staaten auf. Nach dem Martini-Tage 1810. giebt es nur freie Leute, so wie solches auf den Domainen in allen Unsern Provinzen schon der Fall ist [...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}}} However, though serfdom was abolished, [[corvée]]s were not – the October edict said nothing on the latter subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The October edict authorised all Prussian citizens to acquire property and choose their profession, including the nobles, who until then could not take on jobs reserved for the bourgeoisie: {{Cquote|Any nobleman is authorised, without prejudice to its estate, to take up a bourgeois job ; and any bourgeois or peasant is authorised to join the bourgeoisie in the case of the peasant or the peasantry in the case of the bourgeois.{{#tag:ref|"Jeder Edelmann ist, ohne allen Nachtheil seines Standes, befugt, bürgerliche Gewerbe zu treiben; und jeder Bürger oder Bauer ist berechtigt, aus dem Bauer- in den Bürger und aus dem Bürger- in den Bauerstand zu treten"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}}} The principle of "[[dérogeance]]" disappeared.

The peasants were allowed to travel freely and set up home in the towns and no longer had to buy their freedom or pay for its with domestic service. The peasants no longer had to ask their lord's permission to marry – this freedom in marriage led to a rising birth rate and population in the countryside. The freeing of the peasants, however, was also to their disadvantage – lordly domains were liberalised and major landowners were allowed to buy peasants' farms (the latter practice having been illegal previously). The lords no longer had an obligation to provide housing for any of their former serfs who became invalids or too old to work. This all led to the formation of an economic class made up of bourgeois and noble entrepreneurs who opposed the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Edict of regulation (1811)====
After the reformers freed the peasants, they were faced with other problems, such as the abolition of corvées and the establishment of properties. According to the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'', these problems could only be solved by compensating the financiers. The need to legally put in place a "revolution from above" slowed down the reforms.

The edict of regulation of 1811 solved the problem by making all peasants the owners of the farms they farmed. In place of buying back these lands (which was financially impossible), the peasants were obliged to compensate their former lords by handing over between a third and a half of the farmed lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid splitting up the lands and leaving areas that were too small to viably farm, in 1816 the buy-back of these lands was limited to major landowners. The smaller ones remained excluded from [[allodial title]].&lt;ref name="p117f"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other duties linked to serfdom, such as that to provide domestic service and the payment of authorisation taxes on getting married, were abolished without compensation. As for corvées and services in kind, the peasants had to buy back from their lords for 25% of their value.

[[File:Baranowen-1850.jpg|thumb|Estate of Baranowen]]
The practical compensations in Prussia were without doubt{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} advantageous compared to the reforms put in place in the states of the Confederation of the Rhine. In effect, they allowed the process of reform to be accelerated. Nevertheless, the 12,000 lordly estates in Prussia saw their area increase to reach around 1.5 million Morgen&lt;ref name="p118f"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; (around 38,000 hectares), mostly made up of common lands, of which only 14% returned to the peasants, with the rest going to the lords. Many of the minor peasants thus lost their means of subsistence and most could only sell their indebted lands to their lords and become agricultural workers.&lt;ref name="p94"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[set-aside|jachère]] lands were made farmable, but their cultivation remained questionable due to their poor soil quality. The measures put in place by the reformers did have some financial success, however, with Prussia's cultivated land rising from 7.3 to 12.46 million hectares in 1848&lt;ref name="p94" /&gt; and production raised by 40%.&lt;ref name="p117f" /&gt;

In the territories east of the Elbe, the agricultural reforms had major social consequences. Due to the growth of lordly estates,&lt;ref name="p118f" /&gt; the number of lordly families rose greatly, right up until the second half of the 19th century. The number of exploited lands remained the same. A very important lower social class was also created. According to region and the rights in force, the number of agricultural day workers and servants rose 2.5 times. The number of minor landowners, known as ''Kätner'' after their homes (known as ''Kotten''), tripled or even quadrupled. Many of them were dependent on another job. Ernst Rudolf Huber, professor of public law, judged that the agricultural reforms were {{Cquote|one of the tragic ironies of German constitutional history. Through it was shown the internal contradiction of the bourgeois liberalism which created the liberty of the individual and his property and at the same time – due to its own law of the liberty of property – unleashed the accumulation of power in the hands of some people.&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reform of industry and its results===
[[File:Schneider wappen.jpg|thumb|upright|Arms of the tailors' guild – like the other guilds, it lost its influence due to the ''Gewerbefreiheit''.]]
The reformers aspired to free individual forces in the industrial sphere just as in the agricultural one, in their devotion to the theories of Adam Smith. To free these forces, they had to get rid of guilds and an economic policy based on mercantilism. To encourage free competition also meant the suppression of all limitations on competition.

It was in this context that the freedom of industry (''Gewerbefreiheit'') was introduced in 1810–1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; To set up an industry, one had to acquire a licence, but even so there were exceptions, such as doctors, pharmacists and hotelliers. The guilds lost their monopoly role and their economic privileges. They were not abolished, but membership of them was now voluntary, not compulsory as it had been in the past. State control over the economy also disappeared, to give way to a free choice of profession and free competition. The reform of industry unlocked the economy and gave it a new impetus. There was no longer any legal difference in the industrial sphere between the town and the countryside. Only mining remained as an exception until the 1860s.

Originally planned to encourage rural industry, the freedom of industry became the central condition for Prussian economic renewal on an industrial base. As had happened with the nobility, the citizens of the towns arose unsuccessfully opposed the reforms. Their immediate results were contradictory—early on, non-guild competition was weak, but after a period of adaptation the number of non-guild artisans rose significantly. However, in the countryside, the burdens of the artisans and other industries rose considerably. This rise in the number of artisans was not accompanied by a similar growth in the rest of the population.&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of master-craftsmen rose too, but master-craftsmen remained poor due to the strong competition. During the [[Vormärz]], tailors, cobblers, carpenters and weavers were the main over-subscribed trades. The rise in the lower classes in the countryside accentuated the 'social question and would be one of the causes of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 Revolution]].&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|pp=429–432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish emancipation===
{{further|Jewish emancipation|Disabilities (Jewish)}}
By the Edict of Emancipation of 11 March 1812, Jews [[Jewish emancipation|gained the same rights and duties]] as other citizens:
{{Cquote|We, Frederick William, King of Prussia by the Grace of God, etc. etc., having decided to establish a new constitution conforming to the public good of Jewish believers living in [[Royal we|our]] Kingdom, proclaim all the former laws and prescriptions not confirmed in this present Edict to be abrogated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} To gain civil rights, all Jews had to declare themselves to the police within six months of the promulgation of the edict and choose a definitive name.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Edict was the result of a long reflection since 1781, begun by [[Christian Wilhelm von Dohm]], pursued by [[David Friedländer]] in a thesis to Frederick William II in 1787 (Friedländer approved the Edict of 1812&lt;ref&gt;Jean Mondot, "L'émancipation des Juifs en Allemagne entre 1789 et 1815", in {{harvp|Knopper|Mondot|2008|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Humboldt's influence allowed for the so-called "[[Jewish question]]" to be re-examined.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Mondot, "L'émancipation des Juifs en Allemagne entre 1789 et 1815", in {{harvp|Knopper|Mondot|2008|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 8 of the Edict allowed Jews to own land and take up municipal and university posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews were free to practise their religion and their traditions were protected. Nevertheless, unlike the reforms in the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], the Edict of Emancipation in Prussia [[Disabilities (Jewish)|did have some limitations]] – Jews could not become army officers or have any government or legal role, but were still required to do military service.

Even if some traditionalists opposed the Edict of Emancipation&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=460}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it proved a major step towards Jewish emancipation in the [[German states]] during the 19th century. The judicial situation in Prussia was significantly better than that in most of southern and eastern Germany, making it an attractive destination for Jewish immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|p=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===

====New organisation====
[[File:Reiterstandbild Wilhelm III Sockelfig Koeln2007 Humboldt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] wished to reform Prussia's school and university system.]]
For the reformers, the reform of the [[Prussian education system]] (''Bildung'') was a key reform. All the other reforms relied on creating a new type of citizen who had to be capable of proving themselves responsible and the reformers were convinced that the nation had to be educated and made to grow up. Unlike the state reforms, which still contained corporative elements, the ''Bildungsreform'' was conceived outside all class structures. [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] was the main figure behind the educational reform. From 1808, he was in charge of the department of religion and education within the ministry of the interior. Like Stein, Humboldt was only in his post for a short time, but was able to put in place the main elements of his reforms.

Humboldt developed his ideas in July 1809 in his treatise ''Über die mit dem Königsberger Schulwesen vorzunehmende Reformen'' (''On reforms to execute with the teaching in Königsberg''). In place of a wide variety of religious, private, municipal and corporative educational institutions, he suggested setting up a school system divided into ''Volksschule'' (people's schools), ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]s'' and universities. Humboldt defined the characteristics of each stage in education. Elementary teaching "truly only need be occupied with language, numbers and measures, and remain linked to the mother tongue being given that nature is indifferent in its design".{{#tag:ref|"Er hat es also eigentlich nur mit Sprach-, Zahl- und Mass-Verhältnissen zu thun, und bleibt, da ihm die Art des Bezeichneten gleichgültig ist, bei der Muttersprache stehen."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} For the second stage, that of being taught in school, Humboldt wrote "The aim of being taught in school is to exercise [a pupil's] ability and to acquire knowledge without which scientific understanding and ability are impossible.{{#tag:ref|"Der Zweck des Schulunterrichts ist die Uebung der Fähigkeit, und die Erwerbung der Kenntnisse, ohne welche wissenschaftliche Einsicht und Kunstfertigkeit unmöglich ist."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Finally, he stated that university had to train a student in research and allow him to understanding "the unity of science".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1812, a university entry had to obtain the ''[[Abitur]]''. The state controlled all the schools, but even so it strictly imposed compulsory education and controlled exams. To enter the civil service, performance criteria were set up. Education and performance replaced social origin.

====New humanism====
[[File:Wilhelm von Humboldt Denkmal - Humboldt Universität zu Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of Humboldt in front of the [[Humboldt University]] in Berlin (1882)]]
Wilhelm von Humboldt backed a new [[humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the utilitarian teaching of the Enlightenment, which wished to transmit useful knowledge for practical life, Humboldt desired a general formation of man. From then students had to study antiquity and ancient languages to develop themselves intellectually.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only would they acquire this humanistic knowledge, they would also acquire other knowledge necessary for other jobs. The state would not seek to form citizens at all costs to serve it, but it did not entirely let go of that aim:
{{Cquote|Each [student] who does not give evidence of becoming a good artisan, businessman, soldier, politician is still a man and a good citizen, honest, clear according to his rank without taking account of his own job. Give him the necessary training and he will acquire the particular capacity for his job very easily and always hold onto liberty, as is the case so often in life, going from one to the other.{{#tag:ref|"Jeder ist offenbar nur dann ein guter Handwerker, Kaufmann, Soldat und Geschäftsmann, wenn er an sich und ohne Hinsicht auf seinen besonderen Beruf ein guter, anständiger, seinem Stande nach aufgeklärter Mensch und Bürger ist. Gibt ihm der Schulunterricht, was hierzu erforderlich ist, so erwirbt er die besondere Fähigkeit seines Berufs nachher sehr leicht und behält immer die Freiheit, wie im Leben so oft geschieht, von einem zum anderen überzugehen"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Giesecke|1991|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}}} Unlike Humboldt, for whom the individual was at the centre of the educational process, the republican [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] rather leaned towards national education to educate the whole people and thus to affirm the nation in the face of Napoleonic domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In paying professors better and improving their training, the quality of teaching in the ''Volksschule''s was improved. The newly founded ''gymnasia'' offered a humanist education to ready pupils for university studies. In parallel ''Realschule''s were set up&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=661}}&lt;/ref&gt; to train men in manual trades. Some schools for officer cadets were allowed to remain. Despite stricter state influence and control, the religious authorities retained their role in inspecting schools.

====Universities====
[[File:Berlin Universitaet um 1850.jpg|thumb|Berlin University around 1850.]]
In Humboldt's thinking, university represented the crowning glory of intellectual education and the expression of the ideal of freedom between teaching and research held an important place in it. German universities of the time were mostly mediocre.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Humboldt, "the state must treat its universities neither as gymnasia nor as specialist schools and must not serve its Academy as a technical or scientific deputation. Together, they must [...] demand nothing of them which does not give it profit immediately and simply".{{#tag:ref|"Der Staat muss seine Universittendäten weder als Gymnasien noch als Specialschulen behandeln, und sich seiner Akademie nicht als technischen oder wissenschaftlichen Deputation bedienen. Er muss im Ganzen [...] von ihnen nichts fordern, was sich unmittelbar und geradezu auf ihn bezieht."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

Students, in his view, had to learn to think autonomously and work in a scientific way by taking part in research. The foundation of [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin University]] served as a model. It was opened in 1810 and the great men of the era taught there – [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], the physician [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]], the historian [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] and the jurist [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the educational reforms' results were different from what Humboldt had expected. Putting in place his ideal of [[philology|philological]] education excluded the lower classes of society and allied the educational system to the restorationist tendencies. The major cost of education rendered the reforms in this area ineffective. The reformers had hoped that people would rise through the social scale thanks to education, but this did not happen so well as they had hoped.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
[[File:Berlin Scharnhorst memorial.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] in Berlin (1822)]]
[[File:Reorganisation.jpg|thumb|Commission for military reorganisation at [[Königsberg]] in 1807. The two men in the foreground are [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau|Gneisenau]] and [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]], with the seated person in civilian dress is [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein|Stein]].]]
Unlike the reforms in the states of the Confederation of the Rhine, the Prussian policy was aimed against French supremacy right from the start. Also, the Prussian military reforms were much more profound than those in the south German states. They were instigated by a group of officers which had formed after the defeats of 1806 and notably included [[Gerhard Johann David von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]], [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau|Gneisenau]], [[Hermann von Boyen|Boyen]], [[Karl von Grolman|Grolman]] and [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]].&lt;ref name="p28"/&gt;

Chief of staff since 1806, Scharnhorst became head of the military reorganisation commission set up by Frederick William III in July 1807. For him, every citizen was a born defender of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Abenheim|1987|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main aim was to drive out the French occupiers. In close contact with Stein, Scharnhorst managed to convince the king that the military needed reform. Like the civil administration, the military organisation was simplified, via the creation of a Prussian ministry of war and of an army staff on 25 December 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Millotat|2000|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scharnhorst was at the head of the new ministry and he aimed his reforms at removing the obstacles between army and society and at making the army ground itself in the citizens' patriotism.

====Military service====
[[File:Sommerschenburg Gneisenau.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial to Gneisenau in Sommersdorf-Sommerschenburg (1835)]]
The experiences of 1806 showed that the old organisation of the Prussian army was no longer a match for the might of the French army. Compared to the French defensive tactics, Prussian tactics were too immobile. Its officers treated their soldiers as objects and punished them severely&lt;ref name="p453" /&gt; – one of the most severe punishments, the ''Spießrutenlaufen'', consisted of making a soldier pass between two ranks of men and be beaten by them. The French instead had compulsory military service and the Prussian army's adoption of it was the centre of Prussia's military reforms.

[[File:Gneisenaustatue.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Statue of Gneisenau in Berlin (1855)]]
Frederick William III hesitated about the military reforms, the officer corps and nobility resisted them and even the bourgeoisie remained sceptical. The start of the [[German campaign of 1813]] was the key factor. On 9 February 1813 a decree replaced the previous conscription system with an obligation to serve by canton ''Kantonpflichtigkeit''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this new system had to last for the whole war. Thus it looked to restore the pride and position of the common soldier in adapting army discipline to civil law. The punishments and in particular the 'schlague' (consisting of a soldier being beaten) were abolished. The social differences had to disappear. The Treaty of Tilsit had reduced the Prussian army to 42,000 men, but Scharnhorst put in place the "Krümper system",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lange|1857|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted of training a number of soldiers by making them turn without ever exceeding the numbers authorised by the Treaty. Between 30,000 and 150,000 supplementary men were also trained – the training system changed several times and so it is difficult to work out precise numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Neugebauer|Busch|2006|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory military service was ordered by Frederick William III on 27 May 1814 then fixed by a military law on 3 September the same year:{{Cquote|Every man of 20 years is obliged to defend the fatherland. To execute this general obligation, particularly in time of peace, in such manner that the progress of science and industry will not be disturbed, the following exclusion must be applied in taking into account the terms of service and the duration of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Other====
The officer corps was also reformed and several officers dismissed.&lt;ref name="rovan459"&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nobility's privilege was abolished and a career as an officer was opened up to the bourgeois. The aristocrats disliked this and protested, as with [[Hans David Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg]]. In practice a system of co-opting of officers was put in place which gave generally favoured nobles, even if there remained some (albeit minor) bourgeois influence. Starting with the regiment of chasseurs on campaign, chasseur and protection units were set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gumtau|1837|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Hans David Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Yorck von Wartenburg]] who from June 1808 occupied on their training.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Neugebauer|Busch|2006|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the officer corps, it was now the terms of service not the number of years served which determined promotion. The Prussian Academy of War also provided better officer training than before – dissolved after the defeat at Jena, it had been refounded in 1810 by Scharnhorst.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Millotat|2000|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1813–1814&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Braeuner|1863|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the line infantry troops, we also see the [[Landwehr]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; which served as reserve troops to defend Prussia itself. It was independent in organisation and had its own units and its own officers. In the ''Kreise'' (districts), commissions organised troops in which the bourgeois could become officers. The reformers' idea of unifying the people and the army seems to have succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|pp=50–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteer chasseur detachments (''freiwillige Jägerdetachements'') were also formed as reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Neugebauer|Busch|2006|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main leaders==
[[File:Reiterstandbild Wilhelm III Sockelfig Koeln2007vonSchon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Theodor von Schön]]]]
The reforms are sometimes named after their leaders Stein and Hardenberg, but they were also the fruit of a collaboration between experts, each with his own speciality. One of these experts was [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön]] – born in 1773, he had studied law at Königsberg university to follow a career in political sciences. In 1793 he entered Prussian service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roloff|1997|p=787}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years later, he became financial councillor to the ''Generaldirektorium''. When the Prussian government fled to [[Königsberg]] after its defeat at Jena, he followed Stein there. It was there that he brought to bear his expertise on [[serfdom]] and it was his treatise that would help Stein write the October edict. Unlike Stein, Schön backed a greater liberalisation of landowning – for him, economic profitability had to take first priority, even if this was to the peasants' disadvantage.&lt;ref name="klein"&gt;{{harvp|Klein|1965|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1816, Schön became ''Oberpräsident'', a post he held for around 40 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; and devoted himself to the economic and social life of the provinces which he governed.&lt;ref name="klein" /&gt;

[[File:Berlin-tiergarten beuth-humboldt 20050406 p1020313.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statues of [[Christian Peter Wilhelm Beuth|Beuth]] and Humboldt on Burggrafenstraße in [[Tiergarten (park)|Tiergarten]], Berlin (1878)]]
Schön also took part in editing the ''Rigaer Denkschrift''. In 1806 he travelled with a group of civil servants that had gathered around the just-dismissed Hardenberg – the group also included [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], [[Friedrich August von Stägemann]] and [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hensler|Twesten|1838|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr had studied law, philosophy and history at the university of Kiel between 1794 and 1796. In 1804 he was made head of the Danish national bank. His reputation as a financial expert quickly spread to Prussia. On 19 June 1806, Niebuhr and his family left for Riga with other civil servants to work with Hardenberg when he was dismissed. On 11 December 1809, he was made financial councillor and section chief for state debt. In 1810, he edited a note to the king in which he expressed strong doubts on whether a financial plan put in place by Hardenberg could be realised. Its tone he employed was so strong that the king disavowed him&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hensler|Twesten|1838|p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so Niebuhr retired from politics.

The three other civil servants present at Riga – [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], [[Wilhelm Anton von Klewitz]] and [[Friedrich August von Stägemann]] – also played important rôles in the reforms. Altenstein became high financial councillor in the ''Generaldirektorium''. When Stein was dismissed in 1807, Altenstein and the minister of finances [[Friedrich Ferdinand Alexander zu Dohna-Schlobitten]] put in place the state reform conceived by Stein.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810, Klewitz and Theodor von Schön edited the ''Verordnung über die veränderte Staatsverfassung aller obersten Staatsbehörden'' (''Decree on the new constitution of all the high portfolios of state''). Other collaborators took part in the reforms, such as Johann Gottfried Frey (chief of police in [[Königsberg]] and the real author of the ''Städteordnung''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schüler-Springorum|1996|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Friedrich Leopold Reichsfreiherr von Schrötter (who collaborated with Stein on the ''Städteordnung''), [[Christian Peter Wilhelm Beuth]] (in Prussian service since 1801, who had collaborated with Hardenberg on the fiscal and industrial laws) and Christian Friedrich Scharnweber (who had some influence on Hardenberg&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vogel|1980|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Resurgence of Prussia==
[[File:An Mein Volk.jpg|thumb|upright|[[An Mein Volk]] – the Prussian king's appeal to his people on 17 March 1813]]
{{See also|German campaign (Napoleonic Wars)}}
From 1806 onwards isolated uprisings occurred in Germany and the German-speaking countries. On 26 August 1806 the bookseller [[Johann Philipp Palm]] was shot for publishing an anti-Napoleon pamphlet,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Radrizzani|2002|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a strong public outcry. In 1809, [[Andreas Hofer]] launched an insurrection in the Tyrol, but met the same fate as Palm. Anti-Napoleonic feeling developed little by little, with Germans feeling their spirits weighed down by the French occupation and Prussia still paying huge indemnities to the French. When Napoleon's 1812 [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] met with disaster, it lit a glimmer of hope in Germany and above all in Prussia. On 30 December 1812, [[Hans David Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Yorck von Wartenburg]] signed the [[convention of Tauroggen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which Prussia in effect turned against Napoleon and repudiated the Treaty of Tilsit.

On 13 March 1813 Frederick William III made his '[[An Mein Volk]]' speech, making an appeal:
{{Cquote|To my people! ... Brandenburgers, Prussians, Silesians, Pomeranians, Lithuanians! You know what you have endured for nearly seven years, you know what will be your sad fate if we do not end with honour the fight we have begun. Remember past times, the Great Elector, the great Frederick [II]. Keep in your minds the good things our ancestors won under his command: freedom of conscience, honour, independence, trade, industry and science. Keep in your minds the great example of our powerful Russian allies, keep in your mind the Spanish, the Portuguese, even the lesser people who have declared war on powerful enemies to win the same good things and have gained victory [...] Great sacrifices are demanded of all classes, for our beginning is great and the numbers and resources of our enemies are great [...] But whatever the sacrifices demanded of the individual, they pale beside the holy goods for which we make them, for the things for which we fight and must win if we do not wish to stop being Prussians and Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following 27 March Prussia declared war on France and the following 16–19 October saw the beginning of the end for Napoleonic power with the [[battle of Leipzig]]. On 1 October 1815 the Congress of Vienna opened and at it Harbenberg represented the victorious Kingdom of Prussia.

==Historiography==

===Early analyses===
[[File:Heinrich von Treitschke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Heinrich von Treitschke]] long influenced the positive perception of the Prussian reforms from the 19th to the 20th century.]]
In late 19th century historiography, the Prussian reforms and the "revolution from above" were considered by [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] and others to be the first step in the foundation of the German Empire on the basis of a 'small-Germany' solution. For [[Friedrich Meinecke]], the reforms put in place the conditions necessary for the future evolution of Prussia and Germany. For a long time, under the influence of [[Leopold von Ranke]], the era of reforms was presented first and foremost as a story of the deeds and destinies of "great men", as shown by the large number of biographies written about the reformers – [[Hans Delbrück]] wrote about Gneisenau and Meinecke about Boyen, for example.

Indeed, it was the military reforms which first gained the researchers' interest. It was only with the biography of [[Max Lehmann]] that Stein's life and actions were analysed. Unlike Stein, the biographers paid little attention to Hardenberg. Despite the significant differences between Stein and Hardenberg, historiography saw a fundamental continuity between their approaches that made them one single unified policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=235–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors, such as [[Otto Hintze]], underlined the role of reform programmes such as the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'' of 1794. One such continuity confirmed the theory that the reformers were already a distinct group before the reforms occurred. [[Thomas Nipperdey]] resumed the debate by writing that there had been reform plans before the disaster of 1806, but that those behind them had lacked the energy to put them into force and also lacked internal cohesion.&lt;ref name="Nipperdey_33"/&gt; As for the agricultural reforms, the works of Georg Friedrich Knapp aroused a controversy at the end of the 19th century – he criticised the reform policy, stating that it favoured the aristocrats' interests and not the peasants' interests. He held Adam Smith's liberal interest responsible for the evolution of certain problems. Research later led to a global critique which could not be maintained. After all, the peasants' properties were developed, even if the lands they gained were most often revealed to be poor soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=239–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuances in criticism===
[[File:Gaertner2.jpg|thumb|upright|It was only in 1848 that a plan for a constitution was discussed in the Sing-Akademie.]]
Today, the industrial reforms' success is also critiqued in a more nuanced way. They are considered not to have been the immediate reason for the artisans' misery, instead taken as the reduced influence of the legislation on their development. The historian Barbara Vogel tried to address an overall concept of agricultural and industrial approaches and to describe them as a "bureaucratic strategy of modernisation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vogel|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; When industrial development was taken into account, the policy of reforms is seen to certainly be centred on the encouragement of rural industry in the historic Prussian territories, thus allowing the onset of Prussia's [[industrial revolution]].

[[Reinhart Koselleck]] tried to give a general interpretation of the reform policy in view of the 1848 revolution, in his work ''Preußen zwischen Reform und Revolution'' (''Prussia between Reform and Revolution''). He distinguished three different processes. The ''Allgemeines Landrecht'' represented – at the time of its publication – a reaction to social problems, but remained attached to corporative elements. Koselleck saw the birth of an administrative state during the reform era and during the reinforcement of the administration between 1815 and 1825 as an anticipation of the later constitution. However, in his view, the following decades saw the political and social movement suppressed by the bureaucracy. After the end of the reform period, Koselleck underlined that there was a rupture in the equilibrium between the high level civil servants and the bourgeois of the 'Bildungsbürgertum' who could not become civil servants. According to him, the bureaucracy represented the general interest against the individual interest and no national representative body was set up for fear of seeing the reforming movement stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Koselleck|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Standbild Heumarkt Köln - Gesamtansicht.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] in the [[Heumarkt]] in [[Cologne]], erected to the glory of Prussia – round its base are statues of the great Prussian reformers such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein|Stein]], [[Karl August von Hardenberg|Hardenberg]], [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön|Schön]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]]]]
[[File:Standbild Heumarkt Köln 1869 W. Gause.jpg|thumb|upright|Cologne monument (1878)]]
The historian Hans Rosenberg and later the representatives of the Bielefeld School supported the theory that the end of the process which would have led to a constitution in Prussia was one of the reasons for the end to its democratisation and for the ''[[Sonderweg]]''. Hans-Jürgen Puhle, professor at Frankfurt University, even held the Prussian regime to be "in the long term programmed for its own destruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Puhle|1980|p=15}}, cited in {{harvp|Langewiesche|1994|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers more orientated towards [[historicism]] such as Thomas Nipperdey underlined the divergence between the reformers' intentions and the unexpected later results of the reforms.

Several decades ago, the Prussian reforms from 1807 to 1819 lost their central position in historical study of 19th-century Germany. One contributing factor to this decline is that the reforms in the states of the Confederation of the Rhine were considered as similar by several historians. Another is that the Prussian regions – dynamic in industry and society – belonged to the French sphere of influence directly or indirectly until the end of the [[First French Empire|Napoleonic era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=241–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials to the reformers==

===Statues===
Several statues of the reformers were set up, especially of Stein. In 1870 a statue of Stein by [[Hermann Schievelbein]] was put up on the [[Dönhoffplatz]] in Berlin. Around its base can be read "To minister Baron vom Stein. The recognition of the fatherland.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stamm-Kuhlmann|2001|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Hardenberg by Martin Götze was also put up beside it in 1907. Stein's statue now stands in front of the [[Landtag of Prussia]] in Berlin.

===Cologne memorial===
One of the most important monuments to the reformers is that in the Heumarkt in [[Cologne]], made up of an equestrian statue of Frederick William III by Gustav Blaeser on a base surrounded by statues of important figures of the era, including several Prussian reformers: Stein, Hardenberg, Gneisenau, Scharnhorst, Humboldt, Schön, Niebuhr and Beuth. The monument's design process had been launched in 1857&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Reihlen|1988|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was inaugurated on 26 September 1878, with a medal marking the occasion bearing [[William I of Germany]] and his wife on the obverse and the monument and the phrase "To king Frederick William III, the Rhine states recognise him" on the reverse. The monument recalled the Berlin [[equestrian statue of Frederick the Great]], designed by [[Christian Daniel Rauch]], master of Blaeser.

===Other===
Stein featured on commemorative stamps in 1957 and 2007 and Humboldt in 1952, whilst several streets are now named after the reformers, especially in Berlin, which has a Humboldtstraße, a Hardenbergstraße, a Freiherr-vom-Stein-Straße, a Niebuhrstraße, a Gneisenaustraße and a Scharnhorststraße.

A '''referendum''' (plural: '''referendums''' or less commonly '''referenda''') is a direct [[vote]] in which an entire [[Constituency|electorate]] is invited to vote on a particular proposal. This may result in the adoption of a new law. In some countries, it is synonymous with a '''plebiscite''' or a vote on a '''ballot question'''.

Some definitions of 'plebiscite' suggest that it is a type of vote to change the constitution or government of a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/plebiscite |title=Definition of Plebiscite |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some other countries define it differently. For example,  Australia defines 'referendum' as a vote to change the constitution, and 'plebiscite' as a vote that does not affect the constitution.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2015/08/plebiscite-or-referendum-whats-the-difference.html | title=Plebiscite or Referendum - What's the Difference | publisher=ABC | date=12 August 2015 | accessdate=23 August 2015 | author=Green, Antony}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, the vote to adopt its constitution was called a "plebiscite", but a subsequent vote to amend the constitution is called a 'referendum', and so is a poll of the electorate on a non-constitutional bill.

==Etymology and plural form==
'Referendum' is the [[gerundive]] form of the [[Latin language|Latin]] verb ''refero'', literally "to carry back" (from the verb ''fero'', "to bear, bring, carry"&lt;ref&gt;Marchant &amp; Charles, Cassell's Latin Dictionary, 1928, p.221&lt;/ref&gt; plus the inseparable [[preposition]] ''re-'', here meaning "back".&lt;ref&gt;Marchant &amp; Charles, Cassell's Latin Dictionary, 1928, p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt;) As a gerundive is an [[adjective]],&lt;ref&gt;A gerundive is a verbal adjective (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.)&lt;/ref&gt; not a [[noun]],&lt;ref&gt;A [[gerund]] however is a verbal noun (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.) but has no nominative case, for which an infinitive (''referre'') serves the purpose&lt;/ref&gt; it cannot be used alone in Latin and must be contained within a  context attached to a noun such as ''Propositum qui referendum est populo'', "A proposal which must be carried back to the people". The addition of the verb ''sum'' (3rd person singular, ''est'') to a gerundive, denotes the idea of necessity or compulsion, that which "must" be done, rather than that which is "fit for" doing. Its use as a noun in English is thus not a strictly grammatical usage of a foreign word, but is rather a freshly coined English noun, which therefore follows English grammatical usage, not Latin grammatical usage. This determines the form of the plural in English, which according to English grammar should be "referendums". The use of "referenda" as a plural form in English (treating it as a Latin word and attempting to apply to it the rules of Latin grammar) is thus insupportable according to the rules of both Latin and English grammar alike. The use of "referenda" as a plural form is  posited hypothetically as either a gerund or a gerundive by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which rules out such usage in both cases as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Referendum&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Referendums'' is logically preferable as a plural form meaning 'ballots on one issue' (as a Latin gerund,&lt;ref&gt;a [[gerund]] is a verbal noun (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.) but has no nominative case, for which an infinitive (''referre'') serves the purpose. It has only accusative, genitive, dative and ablative cases (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, pp. 91-2.)&lt;/ref&gt; referendum has no plural). The Latin plural gerundive 'referenda', meaning 'things to be referred', necessarily connotes a plurality of issues".&lt;ref&gt;i.e. ''Proposita quae referenda sunt popolo'', "Proposals which must be carried back to the people"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is closely related to the [[political agenda]], "those matters which must be driven forward", from ''ago'', to drive (cattle); and the [[memorandum]], "that matter which must be remembered", from ''memoro'', to call to mind.

==Earliest use ==
The name and use of the 'referendum' is thought to have originated in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] canton of [[Graubünden]] as early as the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Benjamin R.. ''The Death of Communal Liberty: A History of Freedom in a Swiss Mountain Canton''. Princeton University Press, 1974, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, J.M.. ''State and Federal Government in Switzerland'', Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;122&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'plebiscite' has a generally similar meaning in modern usage, and comes from the Latin ''plebiscita'', which originally meant a decree of the ''[[Plebeian Council|Concilium Plebis]]'' (Plebeian Council), the popular assembly of the [[Roman Republic]]. Today, a referendum can also often be referred to as a plebiscite, but in some countries the two terms are used differently to refer to votes with differing types of legal consequences. For example,  Australia defines 'referendum' as a vote to change the constitution, and 'plebiscite' as a vote that does not affect the constitution.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; In contrast, Ireland has only ever held one plebiscite, which was the vote to adopt its constitution, and every other vote has been called a referendum. Plebiscite has also been used to denote a non-binding vote count such as the one held by Nazi Germany to 'approve' in retrospect the so-called Anschluss with Austria, the question being not 'Do you permit?' but rather 'Do you approve?' of that which has most definitely already occurred.

==Typology==
The term referendum covers a variety of different meanings. A referendum can be binding or advisory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=2–3 |title=The Dynamics of Referendum Campaigns: An International Perspective|chapter=Context, Elites, Media and Public Opinion in Reerendums: When Campaigns Really Matter|last= de Vreese |first=Claes H. |isbn=9780230591189 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=wHuGDAAAQBAJ |date= 2007 |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, different names are used for these two types of referendum.

Referendums can be further classified by who initiates them: mandatory referendums prescribed by law, voluntary referendums initiated by the legislature or government, and referendums initiated by citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Serdült|first1=Uwe|last2=Welp|first2=Yanina|title=Direct Democracy Upside Down|journal=Taiwan Journal of Democracy| date=2012 |volume=8 |issue=1 |url=http://www.tfd.org.tw/export/sites/tfd/files/publication/journal/dj0801/004.pdf|doi=10.5167/uzh-98412|pages=69–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[deliberative referendum]] is a referendum specifically designed to improve the deliberative qualities of the campaign preceding the referendum vote, and/or of the act of voting itself.

==Rationale==
From a political-philosophical perspective, referendums are an expression of [[direct democracy]]. However, in the modern world, most referendums need to be understood within the context of representative democracy. Therefore, they tend to be used quite selectively, covering issues such as changes in voting systems, where currently elected officials may not have the legitimacy or inclination to implement such changes.

==Referendums by country==
{{Further|Referendums by country}}
Since the end of the 18th century, hundreds of national referendums have been organised in the world;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Bruno S. Frey et Claudia Frey Marti, ''Le bonheur. L'approche économique'', [[Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes]], 2013 ({{ISBN|978-2-88915-010-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; almost 600 national votes were held in [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]] since its inauguration as a [[Modern history of Switzerland|modern state in 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/explore-600-national-votes_how-direct-democracy-has-grown-over-the-decades/41481992 |title=How direct democracy has grown over the decades |author=Duc-Quang Nguyen |publisher=swissinfo.ch - a branch of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG SSR |date=17 June 2015  |location=Berne, Switzerland |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italy]] ranked second with 72 [[Referendums in Italy|national referendums]]: 67 popular referendums, 3 constitutional referendums, [[Italian institutional referendum, 1946|one institutional referendum]] and [[Italian advisory referendum, 1989|one advisory referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://elezionistorico.interno.it/index.php?tpel=F&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiple-choice referendums==
A referendum usually offers the electorate a choice of accepting or rejecting a proposal, but this is not necessarily the case. In [[Switzerland]], for example, multiple choice referendums are common. Among several other instances, two multiple choice referendums held in [[Sweden]], in 1957 and in 1980, offered voters three options; in 1977, a referendum held in [[Australia]] to determine a new [[Advance Australia Fair|national anthem]] was held in which voters had four choices; in 1992, New Zealand held a five-option referendum on their electoral system; and in 1982, Guam had one on six options, with an additional blank option for anyone(s) wishing to (campaign and) vote for their own seventh option.

A multiple choice referendum poses the question of how the result is to be determined. If no single option receives the support of an absolute [[majority]] (more than half) of voters resort can be made to the two-round system or the alternative vote (AV, which is also called IRV, PV, or STV). In 2018 the [[Citizens' Assembly (Ireland)|Citizens' Assembly]] considered [[referendums in Ireland]], with 76% supporting allowing more than two options, and 52% favouring STV in such cases.&lt;ref name="citizensassembly_referenda"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citizensassembly.ie/en/Manner-in-which-referenda-are-held/Manner-in-which-referenda-are-held.html|title=Manner in which referenda are held|publisher=Citizens' Assembly|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people regard a non-majoritarian methodology like the [[Modified Borda count, MBC]] as more inclusive and more accurate.

Swiss referendums offer a separate vote on each of the multiple options as well as an additional decision about which of the multiple options should be preferred. In the Swedish case, in both referendums the 'winning' option was chosen by the [[First Past the Post electoral system|Single Member Plurality]] ("first past the post") system. In other words, the winning option was deemed to be that supported by a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]], rather than an absolute majority, of voters. In the 1977, Australian referendum, the winner was chosen by the system of preferential [[instant-runoff voting, IRV or PV]]. Polls in Newfoundland (1949) and Guam (1982), for example, were counted under a form of the [[two-round system]], and an unusual form of TRS was used in the 1992 New Zealand poll.

Although [[California]] does not have deliberate multiple-choice referendums in the Swiss or Swedish sense (in which only one of several counter-propositions can be victorious, and the losing proposals are wholly null and void), it does have so many yes-or-no referendums at each Election Day that the State's Constitution provides a method for resolving conflicts when two or more inconsistent propositions are passed on the same day. This is a de facto form of [[approval voting]]—i.e. the proposition with the most "yes" votes prevails over the others to the extent of any conflict.

Another voting system that could be used in multiple-choice referendum is the [[Condorcet method|Condorcet rule]].

==Criticisms==

===Criticism of populist aspect===
[[File:Odessa Russian Sring 20140330 07.JPG|thumb|Pro-Russian protesters in [[Odessa]], [[Ukraine]], demanding a referendum, March 30, 2014]]

Critics{{who|date=February 2016}} of the referendum argue that voters in a referendum are more likely to be driven by transient whims than by careful deliberation, or that they are not sufficiently informed to make decisions on complicated or technical issues. Also, voters might be swayed by [[propaganda]], strong personalities, intimidation, and expensive advertising campaigns. [[James Madison]] argued that direct democracy is the "[[tyranny of the majority]]".

Some opposition to the referendum has arisen from its use by dictators such as [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] who, it is argued,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Qvortrup|first1=Matt |title=Direct Democracy: A Comparative Study of the Theory and Practice of Government by the People|isbn=978-0-7190-8206-1|date=2013|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the plebiscite to disguise oppressive policies as [[populism]]. Dictators may also make use of referendums as well as [[show elections]] to further legitimize their authority such as Benito Mussolini in [[Italian general election, 1934|1934]], Adolf Hitler in [[German election and referendum, 1936|1936]], [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in [[Philippine constitutional plebiscite, 1973|1973]], [[Park Chung-hee]] in [[South Korean constitutional referendum, 1972|1972]], and [[Francisco Franco]] in [[Spanish law of succession referendum, 1947|1947]]. Hitler's use of plebiscites is argued{{by whom|date=March 2016}} as the reason why, since [[World War II]], there has been no provision in [[Germany]] for the holding of referendums at the federal level.

In recent years, referendums have been used strategically by several European governments trying to pursue political and electoral goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jcer.net/index.php/jcer/article/view/836/781|first1= Cecilia Emma |last1=Sottilotta|date= 2017|title=The Strategic Use of Government-Sponsored Referendums in Contemporary Europe: Issues and Implications|journal= Journal of Contemporary European Research|volume=13|issue=4|pages=1361–1376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patten's criticism===
British politician [[Chris Patten]] summarized many of the arguments used by those who oppose the referendum in an interview in 2003, when discussing the possibility of a referendum in the [[United Kingdom]] on the [[Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe|European Union Constitution]]:

{{quote|I think referendums are awful. The late and great [[Julian Critchley]] used to say that, not very surprisingly, they were the favourite form of plebiscitary democracy of Mussolini and Hitler. They undermine Westminster. What they ensure, as we saw in the last election, is that if you have a referendum on an issue, politicians during an election campaign say: "Oh, we're not going to talk about that, we don't need to talk about that, that's all for the referendum." So during the last election campaign, the euro was hardly debated. I think referendums are fundamentally anti-democratic in our system, and I wouldn't have anything to do with them. On the whole, governments only concede them when governments are weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast_with_frost/2954232.stm |title=Breakfast with Frost &amp;#124; Interview with Chris Patten, EU Commissioner for External Affairs on Sunday 01 June 2003 |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-06-01 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Closed questions and the separability problem===
Some critics of the referendum attack the use of closed questions. A difficulty which can plague a referendum of two issues or more is called the [[separability problem]]. If one issue is in fact, or in perception, related to another on the ballot, the imposed simultaneous voting of first preference on each issue can result in an outcome that is displeasing to most.

===Undue limitations on regular government power===
Several commentators have noted that the use of [[initiative|citizens' initiatives]] to amend constitutions has so tied the government to a mishmash of popular demands as to render the government unworkable. ''[[The Economist]]'' has made this point about the US State of [[California]], which has passed so many referendums restricting the ability of the state government to tax the people and pass the budget that the state has become effectively ungovernable. Calls for an entirely new Californian constitution have been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

A similar problem however arises when elected governments accumulate excessive debts. That can severely reduce the effective margin for later governments.

Both these problems can be moderated by a combination of other measures as 
* strict rules for correct accounting on budget plans and effective public expenditure;
* mandatory assessment by an independent public institution of all budgetary implications of all legislative proposals, before they can be approved;
* mandatory prior assessment of the constitutional coherence of any proposal;
* interdiction of extra-budget expenditure (tax payers anyway have to fund them, sooner or later).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20989">{{Politics of Switzerland}}
The '''right of foreigners to vote in Switzerland''' is an ongoing political issue in the country.  [[Switzerland]] is a [[Federalism|federal nation]]. As such, the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] have extensive powers to enact their own legislation (similar to the arrangement in the [[List of states and territories of the United States|states of the United States]]). For this reason, the rules regarding the [[Right of foreigners to vote|rights of foreign residents to vote]] differ considerably throughout Switzerland.

At federal level, exercising one's political rights in the strictest sense (the right to stand for election and to vote in [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)|popular initiatives]] and [[referendum]]s) is limited to Swiss citizens aged 18 or over, as prescribed by Articles 136, 143 and 150 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]]. A bill proposing granting foreign residents the right to vote in federal elections was submitted to the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]] on 4 October 2000 but was rejected on 4 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parlament.ch/f/suche/pages/geschaefte.aspx?gesch_id=20003512|title=Geschäft Ansehen|website=www.parlament.ch|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Article 36(1) of the Federal Constitution, the cantons have the power to grant political rights in cantonal and municipal elections which go beyond the minimum federal threshold (such as lowering the [[voting age]] and extending the right to vote to foreign nationals). The cantons also have the option to delegate these powers to the [[Municipalities of Switzerland|communes]]. Therefore, in theory, foreigners can be elected to the [[Council of States (Switzerland)|Council of States]], as Article 150(3) of the Constitution states: "The Cantons determine the rules for the election of their representatives to the Council of States."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19995395/201506140000/101.pdf|title=English version of the Swiss Federal Constitution|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afpr.ch/pdf/afpr3635a.pdf|title=Problèmes d'intégration des ressortissants étrangers en Suisse|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Office fédéral des migrations sur mandat du chef du Département fédéral de justice et police|access-date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the cantons of [[Canton of Jura|Jura]] and [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]] grant foreigners the right to vote in cantonal elections, but neither allow foreigners to stand for election at cantonal level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avenir-suisse.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015-09_as_eligibilite-des-etrangers_hp.pdf|title=Pour la participation des étrangers au niveau local.

== Aargau ==
In 1996, a referendum was held to decide whether to grant to foreigners the right to vote and stand for election in the [[Aargau|Canton of Aargau]]. The proposal was rejected by voters.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.federalism.ch/files/Newsletter/742_12/JU-NE-etrangers-f.pdf|title=Jura et Neuchâtel : L’extension du droit d’éligibilité des étrangers se poursuit|last=Gassmann|first=Jean-Luc|date=June 2007|website=|publisher=University of Fribourg|access-date=4 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210103657/http://www.federalism.ch/files/Newsletter/742_12/JU-NE-etrangers-f.pdf|archivedate=10 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appenzell Ausserrhoden ==
Article 105(2) of the [[Appenzell Ausserrhoden]] Cantonal Constitution of 30 April 1995 gives the communes of this canton the freedom to grant (or not) political rights to foreigners, provided that such foreigners have been resident in Switzerland for at least ten years and have lived in the canton for at least five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/131_224_1/a105.html|title=SR 131.224.1 Verfassung des Kantons Appenzell A.

== Basel-Stadt ==
The [[Basel-Stadt|Canton of Basel-Stadt]] has a large foreign population – 50,000 people, who make up 30% of the total population.  In 2005, the canton inserted a clause into its constitution (which entered into force on 13 November 2006) giving each of its three communes ([[Basel]], [[Bettingen]] and [[Riehen]]) the power to extend the right to vote and stand for election at municipal level to “residents other than those who hold Swiss nationality who are at least 18 years of age”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/131_222_1/a40.html|title=RS 131.222.1 Constitution du canton de Bâle-Ville, du 23 mars 2005|last=P|first=Bundeskanzlei -|website=www.admin.ch|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, only the two autonomous communes (Bettingen and Riehen) have this power, as Basel is administered directly by the canton.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ge.ch/constituante/doc/presse/CoT2_Rapport_complet_DPE_251109.pdf|title=Les droits politiques des étrangers Rapport préliminaire no 1|last=|first=|date=25 November 2009|website=|publisher=Assemblée constituante de la République et Canton de Genève|access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bern ==
In April 2005, the Grand Council (parliament) of the [[Canton of Bern]] refused by 98 votes to 86 a bill from the cantonal government to grant the communes the freedom to grant (or not) foreigners the right to vote at municipal level. Had this bill been approved, it would have allowed foreigners the right to vote provided that they had lived in Switzerland for at least ten years, in the canton for at least five years and in the same commune for at least three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minorites.org/article.php?IDA=8525|title=Le Grand Conseil bernois refuse le droit de vote aux étrangers|last=|first=|date=18 April 2005|website=Swissinfo|publisher=|access-date=4 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050501015758/http://www.minorites.org/article.php?IDA=8525|archivedate=1 May 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar bill, brought by the Bern [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party]] and the Independent Socialist Party, was rejected on 25 January 2007 by 77 votes to 73, although it was again supported by the cantonal government. Opponents to the bill primarily came from the bourgeois bloc, the [[Swiss People's Party|Swiss People’s Party]] and the [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland|Free (or “Radical”) Democratic Party]], although the latter had been in favour of the 2005 bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/fre/recherche/detail/A_Berne_les_etrangers_resteront_muets.html|title=A Berne, les étrangers resteront muets|last=|first=|date=23 January 2007|website=Swissinfo|publisher=|access-date=4 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224113254/http://www.swissinfo.org/fre/recherche/detail/A_Berne_les_etrangers_resteront_muets.html |archivedate=24 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, a popular initiative supported by the socialists, the [[Green Party of Switzerland|Green Party]] and the [[Swiss Federation of Trade Unions]] gained enough signatures (12,500) to amend the Bern Cantonal Constitution to allow each commune to decide whether to grant voting rights to foreign residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfj.ch/rjb/Actualite/Regionale/11808Initiative-pour-le-droit-de-vote-des-etrangers-dans-le-canton-de-Berne-.html|title=Initiative pour le droit de votes des étrangers dans le canton de Berne|last=|first=|date=11 August 2008|website=Radio Jura bernois|publisher=|access-date=4 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224055259/http://www.rfj.ch/rjb/Actualite/Regionale/11808Initiative-pour-le-droit-de-vote-des-etrangers-dans-le-canton-de-Berne-.html |archivedate=24 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent referendum was rejected by voters on 26 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lematin.ch/actu/suisse/berne-bale-ville-refusent-droit-vote-etrangers-327789|title=Le Matin, l'actualité en direct: sports, people, politique, économie, multimédia|website=www.lematin.ch|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fribourg ==
The new constitution of the [[Canton of Fribourg]], adopted on 16 May 2004, states in Article 48: “The following have the right to vote and stand for election at municipal level, providing that they are of voting age: […] foreigners and foreigners resident in their respective commune who have been resident in the canton for at least five years and who have a residence permit.”

The Law of 16 March 2005 granting political rights to foreigners and to Swiss citizens living abroad amended the Law on the exercising of political rights, bringing the latter into conformity with the new constitution. This law also states: “any person who enjoys political rights at municipal level may stand for election.”

== Geneva ==
On 24 April 2005, 52.3% of voters in the [[Canton of Geneva]] approved an initiative granting voting rights at municipal level to foreigners who have lived in the canton for at least eight years. Another initiative granting foreigners the right to stand for election gained only 47.2% support. Geneva became the sixth canton in Switzerland to grant political rights to foreign residents.

This vote came after four unsuccessful earlier attempts. On 17 June 1979, 56.3% of voters rejected an initiative to grant foreigners the right to vote and stand for election at industrial-tribunal elections. On 6 June 1993, 71.3% of voters refused an initiative granting foreigners the right to vote and stand for election at municipal level. On 28 November 1993, the same percentage of voters refused a second initiative granting foreigners only the right to vote. On 4 March 2001, 52% of voters refused an initiative to create a constitutional law granting foreigners the right to vote and stand for election at municipal level.

Article 42 of the Cantonal Constitution was amended to allow foreign residents the right to vote at municipal elections provided that they have been legally resident in Switzerland for at least eight years. However, foreign residents do not have the right to stand for election.

The constitutional provision relating to foreigners’ voting rights is directly enforceable and applicable. However, a bill amending the Law on the exercising of political rights was approved on 14 September 2005 to bring legislation in line with the constitution.

== Glarus ==
At a [[Landsgemeinde]] on 2 May 2010, the voters of the [[Canton of Glarus]] rejected a proposal to grant foreigners the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tdg.ch/actu/suisse/glaris-refuse-droit-vote-etrangers-2010-05-02|title=Glarus refuse le droit de vote aux étrangers|last=|first=|date=2 May 2010|website=Agence télégraphique suisse|publisher=|access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Graubünden ==
Article 9 of the Constitution of the [[Graubünden|Canton of Graubünden]] of 14 September 2003 enshrines Swiss citizens’ right to vote at cantonal level, but does not exclude this right being extended to foreigners, as it is up to the legislator to determine the details. No actual law was adopted to grant voting rights to foreigners.

Article 9 also states that the communes have the discretion to decide (or not) to grant foreigners both the right to vote and the right to stand for election. Ten of the canton’s 208 communes have made use of this power: [[Bever, Switzerland|Bever]], [[Bonaduz]], [[Calfreisen|Calfreise]], [[Cazis]], [[Conters im Prättigau]], [[Fideris]], [[Lüen]], [[Masein]], [[Portein]] (which merged into the commune of Cazis on 1 January 2010) and [[Schnaus]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.auslaenderstimmrecht.ch/jyvis-jyvote/deja-une-realite.php|title=Cantons et communes en Suisse accordant le droit actif de vote aux étrangers|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=4 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412210827/http://www.auslaenderstimmrecht.ch/jyvis-jyvote/deja-une-realite.php|archivedate=12 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jura ==
When the [[Canton of Jura]] was formed in 1978, it immediately granted foreigners the right to vote.

The Cantonal Constitution grants voting rights to citizens “holding Swiss nationality” and states in Article 73: “the law defines and regulates the right to vote and other political rights of foreigners.”

Article 3 of the Law of 26 October 1978 on political rights states that foreigners may vote in municipal elections provided that they have been resident in the canton for at least ten years and in their respective commune for at least 30 days. It states that foreigners enjoying the right to vote can also stand for election at municipal level.

This law also grants foreigners the right to vote at cantonal elections, under the sole condition that they have been resident in the canton for at least ten years.

On 21 February 2007, the cantonal parliament passed a law (by 51 votes to 4) granting foreigners the right to stand for election as mayor. All such candidates must have lived regularly in Switzerland for at least ten years, including at least one year in the Canton of Jura.

On 17 June 2007, the voters of Jura voted against a law allowing foreigners to stand for election, therefore revoking the earlier law.

On 28 September 2014, the cantonal government approved (by 54% of votes) a proposal re-granting foreigners the right to stand for election to all municipal offices except that of mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rts.ch/info/regions/jura/6179408-les-etrangers-pourront-etre-elus-au-plan-communal-dans-le-jura.html|title=Les étrangers pourront être élus au plan communal dans le Jura|website=rts.ch|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lucerne ==
Article 15(2) of the draft of the new constitution of the [[Canton of Lucerne]] allowed communes the discretion to grant (or not) foreigners the right to vote in municipal elections. However, this clause did not appear in the version of the constitution that was approved by popular vote on 17 June 2007.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Neuchâtel ==
The [[Canton of Neuchâtel]] has allowed foreigners to vote in municipal elections since 1849. It briefly abolished this right but then reinstated it in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christ|first=Thierry|date=June 2002|title=" Il est juste que ceux qui paient puisse voir ce qu'on fait de leur argent ": Le droit de vote des étrangers dans les débats politiques neuchâtelois de la seconde moitié du XIXe siècle|journal=Revue Historique Neuchâteloise|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law of 17 October 1984 on political rights allows foreigners to vote in municipal elections provided that they are “in a regular situation” and have been resident in the canton for at least a year. Foreigners are also allowed to stand for election.

An amendment to the Cantonal Constitution in 2000 granted foreigners the right to vote in cantonal elections provided that they have been resident in the canton for at least five years.

In 1850, Neuchâtel granted foreign residents the right to vote, but not to stand for election, in municipal elections. During the [[19th century]], not even Swiss citizens were automatically guaranteed the right to stand for election if they originated from a different canton.

In June 2007, voters rejected a cantonal initiative that proposed granting foreigners the right to stand for election.

2016 saw the rules changed for both municipal and cantonal elections. At municipal level, foreigners and stateless persons who have been resident in a commune of the canton, have a residence permit (“Permis C”) and have been resident in the canton for at least one year are now allowed to stand for election. They may now also stand for election at cantonal level under the same requirements except they must have been resident in the canton for at least five years.

== Schaffhausen ==
In 2001, the voters of the [[Canton of Schaffhausen]] rejected a popular initiative proposing granting foreigners the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stimm- und Wahlrecht für Ausländerinnen und Ausländer|last=Heusser|first=Pierre|publisher=Schulthess Juristische Medien|year=2001|isbn=9783725542567|location=Zurich|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2014, voters again rejected (by 85% of the vote) a proposal allowing foreigners to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/fre/le-projet-de-fusion-entre-les-deux-b%25C3%25A2le-a-une-nouvelle-fois-%25C3%25A9chou%25C3%25A9/40804708|title=Le projet de fusion entre les deux Bâle a une nouvelle fois échoué - SWI swissinfo.ch|website=SWI swissinfo.ch|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solothurn ==
In 1997, the voters of the [[Canton of Solothurn]] rejected (by 88.5% of the vote) a proposal allowing foreigners to vote.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Thurgau ==
Article 19 of the Constitution of the [[Thurgau|Canton of Thurgau]] and Article 2(1) of the Law on political rights allows the communes to grant (or not) foreigners the right to vote at municipal level. As of 2009, only two communes – [[Langrickenbach]] and [[Lengwil]] – had taken up this option.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Uri ==
The voters of the [[Canton of Uri]] rejected a popular initiative (by 84% of votes) proposing allowing foreigners complete political rights at both municipal and cantonal level.

== Vaud ==
Article 142 of the new Constitution of the [[Vaud|Canton of Vaud]], of 14 April 2003, specifies: “the following make up the electorate: […] foreigners who have been resident in commune anywhere in Switzerland and held a residence permit for at least ten years and have also been resident in the canton for at least three years.” In order to transpose the constitutional provision, the Law on the exercising of political rights was amended in 2003 to grant foreigners the right to vote. As the right to vote and the right to stand for election are indivisible rights in the law of Vaud, foreigners are also allowed to stand for election at municipal level. Only Swiss citizens have the right to vote and stand for election at cantonal level.

== Zug ==
An amendment providing for the possibility for the communes of the [[Canton of Zug]] to grant foreigners the right to vote at municipal elections was presented in September 2006 during debates surrounding the amendment of the Law on political rights. However, this provision was not retained in the final version of the amended law.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Zurich ==
In 1993, the voters of the [[Canton of Zürich|Canton of Zurich]] voted against a popular initiative (by 74.5% of votes) proposing granting foreigners political rights in the canton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geneve.ch/grandconseil/memorial/data/540310/44/540310_44_partie3.asp|title=Session 540310 - Séance 44 - PL - 7913-A|website=www.geneve.ch|access-date=2016-03-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308034302/http://www.geneve.ch/grandconseil/memorial/data/540310/44/540310_44_partie3.asp |archivedate=2016-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual initiative launched by a citizen (“Einzelinitiative”) which proposed introducing voting rights for foreigners in municipal elections was rejected in February 2007.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''right to the city''' is an idea and a slogan that was first proposed by [[Henri Lefebvre]] in his 1968 book ''Le Droit à la ville'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Purcell | first = Mark | title = Excavating Lefebvre: The right to the city and its urban politics of the inhabitant | journal = [[GeoJournal]], special issue: Social Transformation, Citizenship, and the Right to the City | volume = 58 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 99–108 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1023/B:GEJO.0000010829.62237.8f | jstor = 41147756 | date = October 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:GEJO.0000010829.62237.8f3 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://faculty.washington.edu/mpurcell/geojournal.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Unger | first = Knut | title =  "Right to the City" as a response to the crisis: "Convergence" or divergence of urban social movements? | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120310001029/http://www.reclaiming-spaces.org/crisis/archives/266 | archive-date = 10 March 2012 | url = http://www.reclaiming-spaces.org/crisis/archives/266 | publisher = Reclaiming Spaces | date = 14 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that has been reclaimed more recently by social movements, thinkers and several progressive local authorities alike as a call to action to reclaim the city as a co-created space—a place for life detached from the growing effects that [[commodification]] and [[capitalism]] has had over social interaction and the rise of [[Spatial inequality|spatial inequalities]] in worldwide cities throughout the last two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newleftreview.org/II/53/david-harvey-the-right-to-the-city|title=David Harvey: The Right to the City. New Left Review 53, September-October 2008.|website=newleftreview.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first inception of the concept, Lefevbre paid specific emphasis on the effects that capitalism had over “the city”, whereas urban life was downgraded into a commodity, social interaction became increasingly uprooted and urban space and governance were turned into exclusive goods.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://capitanswing.com/libros/el-derecho-a-la-ciudad/|title=El derecho a la ciudad  {{!}}  Capitán Swing|last=Swing|first=Capitán|website=capitanswing.com|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to this trend, Lefevbre called to “''rescue the citizen as main element and protagonist of the city that he himself had built''” and to transform urban space into “''a meeting point for building collective life''”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to the inequalities produced by the rapid increase of world urban population in most regions of the world, the concept of the right to the city has been recalled on several occasions since the publication of Lefevbre’s book as a call to action by social movements and grassroots organizations. In their appeal for “their right to the city”, local mobilizations around the world usually refer to their struggle for social justice and a dignified access to urban life face to growing urban inequalities (especially in large metropolitan concepts). The right to the city has had a particular influence in [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]], where social movements have particularly appealed to the concept in their actions and promoted local instruments for advancing its concrete understanding in terms of policy-making at the local and even national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/observatory/reports/competitive-metropolises-and-prospects-spatial-justice|title=Competitive Metropolises and the Prospects for Spatial Justice {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rioonwatch.org/?p=11668|title=What Is The Right to the City? {{!}} RioOnWatch|website=www.rioonwatch.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good proof on how the notion of right to the city has gained international recognition in the last years could be seen in the [[United Nations]] [[Habitat III]] process, and how the [[New Urban Agenda]] (2016) recognized the concept as the vision of “cities for all”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/20/habitat-3-right-city-concrete-policies-ada-colau|title=After Habitat III: a stronger urban future must be based on the right to the city|last=Colau|first=Ada|date=2016-10-20|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing popularity of the concept has nonetheless raised some criticism and concerns on how the original vision of Henri Lefevbre could be reduced to a “citizenship vision”, focused on the mere implementation of social and economic rights in the city leaving aside its transformatory nature and the concept of social conflict behind the original concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/03/16/seres_urbanos/1521194122_492095.html|title=Elogio y rescate de Henri Lefebvre|last=Delgado|first=Manuel|date=2018-03-19|work=El País|access-date=2018-06-14|language=es|issn=1134-6582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Gorgens | first1 = Tristan | last2 = van Donk | first2 = Mirjam | title = From basic needs towards socio-spatial transformation: coming to grips with the 'Right to the City' for the urban poor in South Africa | url = http://isandla.org.za/publications/152/ | website = isandla.org.za | publisher = The Isandla Institute | date = 2011 }} [http://isandla.org.za/download/assets/gorgens_and_van_donk_isandla_institute_acc-cubes_conference_paper.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcelo Lopes de Souza]] has for instance argued that as the right to the city has become "''fashionable these days''", "''the price of this has often been the trivialisation and corruption of Lefebvre's concept''"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lopes de Souza | first = Marcelo | title = Which right to which city?

==Overview==
Lefebvre summarizes the idea as a "demand...[for] a transformed and renewed access to urban life".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Lefebvre | first = Henri | author-link = Henri Lefebvre | contribution = The right to the city | editor-last1 = Kofman | editor-first1 = Eleonore | editor-last2 = Lebas | editor-first2 = Elizabeth | title = Writings on cities | page = 158 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]] | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780631191889 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Attoh | first = Kafui | title = What ''kind'' of right is the right to the city? | journal = [[Progress in Human Geography]] | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 669–685 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0309132510394706 | date = October 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0309132510394706 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] described it as follows:
{{quote|The right to the city is far more than the individual liberty to access urban resources: it is a right to change ourselves by changing the city. It is, moreover, a common rather than an individual right since this transformation inevitably depends upon the exercise of a collective power to reshape the processes of urbanization. The freedom to make and remake our cities and ourselves is, I want to argue, one of the most precious yet most neglected of our human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Harvey | first = David | authorlink = David Harvey (geographer) | title = The right to the city | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 53 | pages = 23–40 | publisher = New Left Review | date = September–October 2008 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/53/david-harvey-the-right-to-the-city | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A number of popular movements, such as the shack dwellers' movement [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Abahlali_3 | title = S’bu Zikode &amp; Richard Pithouse debating Pallo Jordan on the Record of the ANC – Oslo, 22 November 2012 | url = http://abahlali.org/node/9405/ | website = abahlali.org | publisher = [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] | date = 17 January 2013 }} (Campaigns and Statements on ''The Right to the City''.)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Right to the City Alliance]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Leavitt | first1 = Jackie | last2 = Roshan Samara | first2 = Tony | last3 = Brady | first3 = Marnie | title = The Right to the City Alliance: time to democratize urban governance (blog) | url = http://www.plannersnetwork.org/publications/2009_fall/leavitt_samara_brady.html | publisher = Progressive Planning, Planners Network | date = Fall 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100429105813/http://www.plannersnetwork.org/publications/2009_fall/leavitt_samara_brady.html | archivedate = 2010-04-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recht auf Stadt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title =  Congress theses on ''The Right to the City'' | url = http://wiki.rechtaufstadt.net/index.php/Congress_2011/Theses_to_the_Congress | website = wiki.rechtaufstadt.net | publisher = Recht Auf Stadt | date = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a network of squatters, tenants and artists in [[Hamburg]], and various movements in Asia and Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Mayer | first = Margit | contribution = The "right to the city" in urban social movements | editor-last1 = Brenner | editor-first1 = Neil | editor-last2 = Marcuse | editor-first2 = Peter | editor-last3 = Mayer | editor-first3 = Margit | title = Cities for people not for profit: critical urban theory &amp; the right to the city | pages = 63–85 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780415601771 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; have incorporated the idea of the right to the city into their struggles.

In Brazil the 2001 [[City Statute]] wrote the Right to the City into federal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Implementing the Right to the City in Brazil | url = http://sustainablecitiescollective.com/polis-blog/30417/implementing-right-city-brazil | website = sustainablecitiescollective.com | publisher = Sustainable Cities Collective | date = 14 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, scholars have proposed a 'Digital Right to the City',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Joe Shaw and Mark Graham | title = Our Digital Rights to the City | url = http://meatspacepress.org/ | website = meatspacepress.org | publisher = Meatspace Press | date = 15 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foth|first1=Marcus|last2=Brynskov|first2=Martin|last3=Ojala|first3=Timo|title=Citizen's Right to the Digital City: Urban Interfaces, Activism, and Placemaking|date=2015|publisher=Springer|location=Singapore|isbn=9789812879172|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/78107/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which involves thinking about the city as not just bricks and mortar, but also digital code and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shaw | first1 = Joe | last2 = Graham | first2 = Mark | title = An Informational Right to the City?

'''''Schutzjude''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃʊtsˌjuːdə|lang}}, "protected Jew") was a status for [[History of the Jews in Germany| German Jew]]s granted by the imperial, princely or royal courts. 

Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], except some eastern territories gained by the Empire in the 11th and 12th centuries (e.g. [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]), Jews usually had the status of [[Servi camerae regis]]. This status included imperial protection and the levying of special taxes on the Jews for the Empire's treasury (Latin: camera regis). But the emperors, always short of money, alienated — by sale or pledge — their privilege to levy extra taxes on Jews, not all at once, but territory by territory to different creditors and purchasers. Thus Jews lost their — not always reliable — imperial protection. 

Many territories that gained supremacy over the Jews living within their boundaries subsequently expelled them. After the general expulsions of the Jews from a given territory often only single Jews&amp;nbsp;— if any at all&amp;nbsp;— would be granted the personal privilege to reside within the territory. This personal privilege, documented by a ''Schutzbrief'' (writ of protection), a ''Geleitsbrief'' (writ of escort), or (in Brandenburg) a ''Patent'', was sometimes inheritable by only one son (in rare instances, by all sons), and was sometimes uninheritable. Jews holding such a privilege were thus called ''Schutzjuden'', ''vergeleitete Juden'', or ''Patentjuden'', as opposed to Jews who had no right of residence, who were known as ''unvergeleitete Juden''. The latter were not allowed to marry, and might spend their life unmarried as a member of the household of a privileged relative or employer. 

For example, in October 1763 King [[Frederick II "the Great", King in Prussia|Frederick II]] of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] granted [[Moses Mendelssohn]], until then under protection by being employed by a ''Patentjude'', a personal, uninheritable privilege, which assured his right to undisturbed residence in [[Berlin]]. His wife and children, who had no independent permission to reside, lost their status of family member of a ''Patentjude'' when Mendelssohn died in 1786. They were later granted multi-son inheritable ''Patents''. In 1810 [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Stein's]] [[Prussian reforms]] introduced a freely inheritable Prussian citizenship for all subjects of the king, doing away with the different prior legal status of the Estates, such as the Nobility, the [[bourgeoisie|burgher]]s of the chartered cities, the unfree peasants, the officialdom at the court, the Patent Jews, and the [[Huguenot]]s.

{{History of the Soviet Union}}
The '''Sino-Soviet split''' (1956–1966) was the breaking of political relations between the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR), caused by [[doctrine|doctrinal]] divergences arising from the powers' different interpretations of [[Marxism–Leninism]], as influenced by the national interests of each country during the [[Cold War]] (1945–91).&lt;ref name="World History 2000. p. 769"&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'', B.P. Lenman, T. Anderson editors, Chambers: Edinburgh:2000. p. 769.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1950s and early 1960s, debates of [[Orthodox Marxism|ideological orthodoxy]] between the communist parties of the USSR and of the PRC became disputes about Soviet policies of [[de-Stalinization]] and [[peaceful coexistence]] with the capitalist West. Despite such background politics, to the Chinese public [[Mao Zedong]] proposed a belligerent attitude towards capitalist countries, an initial rejection of the Soviets' peaceful-coexistence policy, which he perceived as [[Marxist revisionism]] by the Russians.&lt;ref name="World History 2000. p. 769"/&gt;

Since 1956—after [[Nikita Khrushchev]] denounced Stalin and Stalinism in the speech ''[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]''—the PRC and the USSR had progressively disagreed and diverged about orthodox interpretation of Marxist ideology. By 1961, intractable differences of philosophy provoked the [[Communist Party of China]] to formally denounce [[Soviet communism]] as the product of "Revisionist Traitors".&lt;ref name="World History 2000. p. 769"/&gt; The Sino-Soviet split was about who would lead the revolution of [[world communism]]—to whom, China or Russia, would the [[Vanguardism|vanguard parties]] of the world turn for aid and assistance?&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Scalapino, "Sino-Soviet Competition in Africa", ''Foreign Affairs'' (1964) 42#4, pp. 640–654 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20029719 in JSTOR] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009092822/https://www.jstor.org/stable/20029719 |date=9 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that vein, the USSR and the PRC competed for ideological leadership through their respective networks of communist parties in the countries of their spheres of influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scalapino |first1=Robert A. |year=1964 |title=Sino-Soviet Competition in Africa |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=42 |issue=4|pages=640–654 |jstor=20029719|doi=10.2307/20029719 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geopolitically, the Sino-Soviet split was a pivotal event of the bi-polar Cold War, as important as the [[Berlin Wall]] (1961), the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (1962), and the [[Vietnam War]] (1965–1975), because it facilitated the Sino–American rapprochement of the [[1972 Nixon visit to China]]. Internationally, the geopolitical rivalry between Communists—Chinese Stalinism and Russian peaceful coexistence—eliminated the myth that monolithic Communism was an actor in the 1947–1950 period of the [[1947–50 in the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]] and in world politics—such ''[[Realpolitik]]'' established the tri-polar geopolitics of the latter part of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;The historian Lorenz M. Lüthi said: The Sino-Soviet split was one of the key events of the Cold War, equal in importance to the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]], the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the [[Vietnam War|Second Vietnam War]], and [[China–United States relations#Rapprochement|Sino-American Rapprochement]]. The split helped to determine the framework of the second half of the Cold War in general, and influenced the course of the Second Vietnam War, in particular. Like a nasty divorce, it left bad memories and produced myths of innocence on both sides.{{cite book|author=Lorenz M.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2009}}

===Origins===
[[File:Chinese stamp in 1950.jpg|thumb|400px|Chinese stamp commemorating the ''Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance'' (1950)]]
[[File:Sino-Soviet split 1980.svg|thumb|400px|Communist states in 1980: pro-Soviet (red), pro–Chinese (yellow), the non-aligned North Korea and Yugoslavia (black). Somalia was pro-Soviet until 1977, and Democratic Kampuchea (Cambodia) was pro–Chinese until 1979.]]

In taking Communism to China, the leader of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), [[Mao Zedong]], fought against [[Imperial Japan]], and especially the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927–1949), against the Nationalist [[Kuomintang]], led by Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Stalin played both sides and Mao ignored most of his advice.  During the Second World War (1939–1945), Stalin advised Mao to enter an anti-Japanese-coalition with Chiang Kai-shek. After the war, Stalin advised Mao against seizing power and to collaborate with the Nationalists, because of Stalin's Treaty of Friendship and Alliance (1945) with the Kuomintang; in communist solidarity, Mao abided Stalin. In the event, Gen. Chiang Kai-shek opposed the USSR's annexation of [[Tannu Uriankhai]]; three months after the Japanese surrender, Stalin broke the treaty requiring Soviet withdrawal from [[Manchuria]], gave Mao control of the region, and ordered Gen. [[Rodion Malinovsky]] to give the Japanese army's [[War looting|spoils of war]] to the Chinese Communists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://book.sina.com.cn/excerpt/sz/rw/2011-11-24/0951293044_2.shtml 杨奎松《读史求实》：苏联给了林彪东北野战军多少现代武器] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926184147/http://book.sina.com.cn/excerpt/sz/rw/2011-11-24/0951293044_2.shtml |date=26 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1945–1949 period, Chiang Kai-shek received large amounts of financial and military assistance from the United States, which tried to broker peace between him and Mao. In 1948–1949, the Nationalist armies collapsed and the leaders fled to Formosa (Taiwan).&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Dreyer, ''China at War 1901–1949'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

As head-of-state of the People's Republic of China, Mao visited Moscow (December 1949–February 1950) and returned to China with the [[Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship]] (1950), which included a $300 million loan, the [[Return of the Chinese Eastern Railway|transfer of former Russian colonial properties,]]&amp;nbsp;and a 30-year military alliance. Under Soviet guidance, the PRC applied the soviet model of  centralised [[planned economy]]; the planning and development made [[heavy industry]] the priority and consumer-goods production the second priority. Despite Soviet guidance, Mao developed the basic ideas of China's [[Great Leap Forward]] (1958–1961), from an agrarian society to an industrial society.

Ideologically, to justify realising the modernisation of China, Mao argued that [[orthodox Marxism]], rooted in industrialized Europe, could not readily be adapted and applied to the agricultural societies of eastern Asia, and adapted Marxism to Chinese socio-economic conditions. In 1947, Mao sent the journalist [[Anna Louise Strong]] with documents to the West, and to "show them to Party leaders in the United States and Europe", but that it was not "necessary to take them to Moscow". Mao's trust in Strong derived from her article "The Thought of Mao Tse-Tung" and the book ''Dawn Comes Up Like Thunder Out of China: An Intimate Account of the Liberated Areas in China'' (1948), reporting that Mao's intellectual feat was "to change Marxism from a European [form] to an Asiatic form&amp;nbsp;... in ways of which neither Marx nor Lenin could dream"; the book was banned in the USSR, as anti-soviet literature.

===After Stalin===
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar|History}}
In 1954, new Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] sought to improve the USSR's relations with China by reaching new trade agreements. He acknowledged Stalin's economic unfairness to China, arranged for the USSR to fund fifteen industrial projects in China, and also arranged mutual exchanges of technicians.&lt;ref name="Luthi40"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Luthi |first1=Lorenz |title=The Sino-Soviet Split: Cold War in the Communist World |date=2008 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0691135908 |pages=39-40 |chapter=Historical Background, 1921–1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the trade agreements, the two countries exchanged economic specialists (ca. 10,000 by 1960) and political advisors (ca. 1,500), and China sent laborers to fill the shortage of workers in Siberia. Despite this economic cooperation, Mao and Khrushchev disliked each other.&lt;ref name="Luthi40"/&gt;
In the field of international relations, the PRC and the USSR strengthened their relationship through diplomacy, by encouraging Vietnamese rapprochement, by way of a peace treaty between Communist [[North Vietnam]] and non-Communist [[South Vietnam]], in 1954. In the event, by 1955, 60 per cent of China's exports went to Russia, and Mao had begun implementation of a [[Five-year plans of China|Chinese version of the Soviet "Five Year Plan"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shabad |first1=Theodore |title=Communist China's 5 Year Plan |journal=Far Eastern Survey |date=December 1955 |volume=24 |issue=12 |page=189 |jstor=3023788 |doi=10.2307/3023788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Sino-Soviet relations began to deteriorate when Khrushchev initiated the de–Stalinization of the USSR. In a secret speech to the 20th Congress of the CPSU, ''On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences'',  Khrushchev criticized Stalin the man and Stalin's policies — especially the "[[Great Purge]]" of the Communist Party, in which Stalin killed hundreds of thousands of people.

Khrushchev's de–Stalinization of the Soviet Union caused a serious domestic problem for Mao, who had emulated Stalin and Stalinism in the development of [[Chinese Communism]].&lt;ref&gt;Luthi, pp 49–50, "Collapse of Socialist Unity"&lt;/ref&gt;

For Mao, the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] was a serious political concern, because such a revolt questioned the political legitimacy of Communist Party government. In response, the Chinese Communist Party formally denounced Khrushchev's de–Stalinization policies as [[Marxist revisionism|ideological revisionism of Marx]], and reaffirmed the ideological orthodoxy of Mao's Stalinist government — while preserving diplomatic and economic relations with the USSR; the abstractions of ideology had cracked socialist unity.&lt;ref&gt;Luthi, pp 62–63, "Collapse of Socialist Unity"&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao perceived that the Soviet Union's foreign policy of [[peaceful coexistence]] with the West would isolate the PRC in every sense of geopolitics.&lt;ref&gt;Luthi, page 48, "Collapse of Socialist Unity"&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian revolution made Mao aware that such revolts might occur in the PRC. He sought to counter possible political discontent with the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]] (1956) of political liberalization, which proved too successful when it featured criticism of Mao as Party Chairman and head of state.&lt;ref&gt;Luthi, pp 71–73, "Collapse of Socialist Unity"&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Khrushchev's political liberalization of the USSR compelled Mao to retain the Stalinist model of government for the PRC. The ideological break was assured when Khrushchev's Stalinist enemies failed to depose him, which left China and the USSR practicing different forms of Marxism, leading to ideological quarrels and enmity.&lt;ref&gt;Luthi, pp 76–77, "Collapse of Socialist Unity"&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Khrushchev's efforts to maintain positive Sino-Soviet relations (especially with technical assistance to China's nuclear weapons program), political tensions remained strong, because the USSR's policy of peaceful coexistence threatened the PRC's geopolitical credibility, especially after failed rapprochement with the U.S. That diplomatic failure and the presence of U.S. nuclear weapons in the [[Taiwan and weapons of mass destruction|Republic of China]] (Taiwan) led Mao to a policy of confrontation with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Luthi, page 80, "Mao's Challenges"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, the ideological differences, especially the Soviet policy of peaceful coexistence with the West, worsened Sino-Soviet relations. Notably, Mao's [[Great Leap Forward]], a Stalinist program of instant industrialization, led to a [[cult of personality]] around Mao as the true leader of the socialist world.&lt;ref&gt;Luthi, pp 81–83, "Mao's Challenges"&lt;/ref&gt; Mao widened the ideological divergence between the PRC and the USSR with criticism of Khrushchev's economic policies, which included foreign aid for China. To the USSR, the ideological radicalism of the PRC destabilized peaceful coexistence with the West, in response, the USSR reduced aid to China.&lt;ref name="Luthi103"&gt;Luthi, pp 103–104, "Mao's Challenges"&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1958, Khrushchev went to Beijing to negotiate for bases in China for Soviet submarines. Instead, Mao accused Khrushchev of trying to control the PRC's coast, and there was no deal.&lt;ref&gt;Luthi, pp 93–84, "Mao's Challenges"&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of August, Mao tried to force the issue of PRC control of Taiwan, held by the remnant of the [[Republic of China]] (RoC). China attacked RoC-held [[Kinmen]] and the [[Matsu islands]], beginning the [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]] (23 August–22 September 1958). Mao had not warned Khrushchev of the attack, which forced the USSR to re-think peaceful coexistence with the West, especially after the U.S. publicly committed to the military defense of the RoC.

The PRC's failure to warn the USSR of the attack worsened Khrushchev's relations with Mao, especially because the U.S. threatened nuclear war if the PRC invaded Taiwan. Such Chinese actions then compelled the USSR's involvement in Sino-American quarrels over a lost civil war.&lt;ref name="Luthi103"/&gt; In that geopolitical context, Khrushchev became skeptical of Mao's mental health, fearing that his confrontational behavior might provoke a nuclear war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=M. |last1=Sheng |title=Mao and China's Relations with the Superpowers in the 1950s: A New Look at the Taiwan Strait Crises and the Sino-Soviet Split |journal=Modern China |date=2008 |volume=4 |issue=34 |page=499 |doi=10.1177/0097700408315991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khrushchev cancelled aid agreements, including delivery of Soviet nuclear weapons to the PRC. That lack of clear and candid communications from the Chinese and ideological disagreement about the [[Great Leap Forward]] had seriously damaged Sino-Soviet relations.

==Onset==
The events of the 1958–59 period convinced Mao that the USSR was not trustworthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/one-fingers-worth-historical-events-new-russian-and-chinese-evidence-the-sino-soviet|title="One Finger's Worth of Historical Events": New Russian and Chinese Evidence on the Sino-Soviet Alliance and Split, 1948-1959|author=David Wolff|date=7 July 2011|website=Wilson Center|accessdate=24 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307170823/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/one-fingers-worth-historical-events-new-russian-and-chinese-evidence-the-sino-soviet|archive-date=7 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Premier Khrushchev met with U.S. President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] (1953–1961) to decrease tensions with the West. To that end, the USSR had reneged an agreement to provide technical aid for the development of a Chicom nuclear weapon; the USSR sided with India in the [[Sino-Indian War]] (1962), by way of moderate diplomatic relations with India; each collaboration of the USSR with the West offended Mao. Thereafter, he perceived Khrushchev as too-tolerant of the West, despite the USSR sometimes confronting the Western powers. The Chinese Communist Party believed that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union concentrated too much on "Soviet–U.S. cooperation for the domination of the world", with actions that contradicted the ideology of [[Marxism–Leninism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese Communist Party: The Leaders of the CPSU are the Greatest Splitters of Our Times, February 4, 1964|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1964CCP-onCPSU.html|website=Modern History Sourcebook|publisher=Fordham University|accessdate=1 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231225103/http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1964CCP-onCPSU.html|archive-date=31 December 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao had expected an aggressive response from Khrushchev about the [[1960 U-2 incident|U-2 spy plane incident]] (1960) over Russia. At the [[1960 Paris Summit]] meeting, Khrushchev demanded an official apology from U.S. President Eisenhower, who refused. Mao and the CCP took Eisenhower's response as a political affront to socialist countries, and the PRC responded with political rallies demanding that Khrushchev act against the American aggressors. To the Chinese Communists, Khrushchev not responding to the U.S. with military force tarnished his image as a Communist leader. At the [[1960 International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties]], in [[Bucharest]], Mao and Khrushchev argued and each socialist attacked the other's interpretation of [[Orthodox Marxism|Marxist doctrine]] as the incorrect road to world socialism. Mao argued that Khrushchev's greater emphasis upon material easiness would make the people ideologically soft and un-revolutionary; Khrushchev replied, "If we could promise the people nothing, except revolution, they would scratch their heads and say 'Isn't it better to have good goulash?' "&lt;ref&gt;Mark, Chi-kwan (2012). "Ideological radicalization and the Sino-Soviet split, 1956-64". ''China and the World since 1945 - An international history.'' Routledge, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha.jpg|thumb|300px|Chinese Stalinism: Mao Zedong and [[Enver Hoxha]], leader of Albania]]

In the 1950s, the Sino-Soviet split manifested itself indirectly through actions related to other Communist states. China denounced the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (1945–1992) and [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], who had pursued a [[Non-Aligned Movement|non aligned]] foreign policy; neither pro–Russian nor pro–Chinese. The USSR criticized [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]] and [[Enver Hoxha]], who had refused to abandon [[Stalinism]] and had aligned with the PRC, starting the [[Soviet–Albanian split]]. Moreover, in accordance with geopolitical circumstance, the USSR provided moral support to the Tibetan rebels of the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]] against the PRC.

By 1960, the Sino-Soviet split was manifested as open criticism, when Khrushchev and [[Peng Zhen]] openly argued at the congress of the [[Romanian Communist Party]]. Khrushchev insulted Chairman Mao as "a nationalist, an adventurist, and a [[deviationist]]"; Peng Zhen called Khrushchev a [[Marxist revisionism|Marxist revisionist]] whose régime of the USSR showed him to be a "patriarchal, arbitrary and tyrannical" ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Axelrod, ''The Real History of the Cold War: A New Look at the Past'', p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Premier Khrushchev denounced the People's Republic of China in an eighty-page letter to the Romanian Communist Party congress.

In June 1960, the USSR openly denounced PR Albania at the height of the [[de-Stalinization]] of the USSR. In China, Bao Sansan described the Party's message to the cadres in China, "When Khrushchev stopped Russian aid to Albania, Hoxha said to his people: 'Even if we have to eat the roots of grass to live, we won't take anything from Russia.' China is not guilty of [[chauvinism]] and immediately sent food to our brother country."&lt;ref&gt;[Bao] Sansan and [[Bette Bao Lord]] (1964/1966), ''Eighth Moon: The True Story of a Young Girl's Life in Communist China'', reprint, New York: Scholastic, Ch. 9, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Khrushchev further responded to Mao's criticism by withdrawing some 1,400 technicians from the PRC, which led to cancellation of some 200 scientific joint projects intended to foster cooperation between Russia and China. To Mao, the withdrawal of Soviet technicians from China justified his accusation that Khrushchev had caused not only the PRC's great economic failures, but also had caused the famines occurred during the [[Great Leap Forward]].

As socialist countries, the PRC and the USSR still had reason to prefer political unity. In the PRC, Chairman Mao needed to continue economic relations, to alleviate famine in China, and resolve border disputes with India. In the USSR, Premier Khrushchev had lost political ground, because of his policy of ''[[détente]]'' with the U.S. His accusations of U.S. espionage against the Eisenhower government had generated political tensions that broke USSR–US diplomacy at the Paris Summit meeting, which worsened relations between the American and Russian superpowers; and yet, the PRC remained allied to the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Mark, Chi-kwan (2012). "Ideological radicalization and the Sino-Soviet split", p.  49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1960, at the [[1960 International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties|Congress of 81 Communist parties in Moscow]], the Chinese argued about the interpretation of Marxist doctrine with the Soviets, and with most of the other socialist delegations, yet compromised in effort to avoid an ideological split among socialist nations. In October 1961, at the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] the USSR and the PRC renewed their conflicting ideological disputes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873466,00.html One-Third of the Earth] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204212557/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873466,00.html |date=4 February 2011 }}, ''Time'', 27 October 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1961, the USSR broke diplomatic relations with People's Socialist Republic of Albania, which had been aligned with the PRC, escalating the ideological dispute from political-party level to the national level.

When [[Indian annexation of Portuguese India|India annexed Goa]], following demand by the [[Goan people]], who were flabbergasted by Portugal's resistance to leaving its occupied territory in 1961, Moscow lauded the action while an unimpressed Beijing declared that "India's apparent contribution to anti-imperialist struggle consists of taking on the world's smallest imperialist power."

In 1962, the PRC and the USSR broke diplomatic relations. Chairman Mao criticized Premier Khrushchev for withdrawing from the [[Cuban missile crisis]] (1962), that "Khrushchev has moved from adventurism to capitulationism". Khrushchev replied that Mao's confrontational policies would lead to a nuclear war. At the same time, the USSR supported India against the Chinese invasion of the Indian north east in the [[Sino-Indian War]] (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/03pol/c05s04.html|title=Exploring Chinese History: Politics: International Relations: Sino- Soviet Relations|author=Richard R.

The aftermath of the Cuban missile crisis placed [[nuclear disarmament]] at foremost in 20th-century geopolitics. To limit production of nuclear weapons by other nations, the USSR, the UK, and the US signed the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]] (5 August 1963). In that time, the PRC were developing their own nuclear weapons, and Mao saw the Limited Test Ban Treaty as an attempt to slow China's becoming a nuclear superpower. He was angered by Khrushchev's failure to aggressively deal with the U.S. Premier Khrushchev's failure to confront the West led Chairman Mao to publish nine (September 1963–July 1964) letters in which he openly and specifically criticized the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev as Premier of the USSR. After the occurrence of the Sino-Soviet split, Chairman Mao turned to the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to develop new and strong alliances to further the economic and ideological redevelopment of the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;Mark, Chi-Kwan (2012). "Ideological radicalization and the Sino-Soviet split", p. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal ideological statements===
The governments of the PRC and the USSR supported their actions with formal ideological statements. In June 1963, the PRC published ''The Chinese Communist Party's Proposal Concerning the [[general line (party)|General Line]] of the International Communist Movement'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/sino-soviet-split/cpc/proposal.htm|title=A Proposal Concerning the General Line of the International Communist Movement|author=|date=|website=marxists.org|accessdate=24 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131074829/https://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/sino-soviet-split/cpc/proposal.htm|archive-date=31 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the USSR replied with an ''Open Letter of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union''; such were the last communications to each other, as socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etext.org/Politics/MIM/classics/mao/polemics/sevenlet.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225024740/http://www.etext.org/Politics/MIM/classics/mao/polemics/sevenlet.html |archivedate=25 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1964, Chairman Mao said that a [[counter-revolution]] in the USSR had re-established [[capitalism]]; consequently, the USSR broke relations with the PRC, and the [[Warsaw Pact]] soon followed the Soviets.

After [[Leonid Brezhnev]] deposed Premier Khrushchev in October 1964, Chinese Prime Minister [[Zhou Enlai]] went to Moscow and met with Brezhnev and [[Alexei Kosygin]], who were the new leaders of the USSR. The meeting with the Soviet leaders went poorly, and the disappointed Zhou returned to China and reported to Chairman Mao that the Soviets remained firm in their stance, for which Mao denounced "[[Khrushchevism]] without Khrushchev"; Mao's dismissal continued the Sino-Soviet split.

China accused the Soviet Union of colluding with the U.S., for instance during the [[Glassboro Summit Conference]] (June 1967) between Kosygin and U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. [[Radio Peking]] said that they discussed "a great conspiracy on a worldwide basis . . . criminally selling the rights of the revolution of [the] Vietnam people, Arabs, as well as Asian, African, and Latin-American peoples to U.S. imperialists."&lt;ref name="ap19670624"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WAFOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AYwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6332%2C5746364 |title=At the Summit: Cautious Optimism |work=The Free Lance-Star |date=1967-06-24 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=17 July 2013 |location=Fredericksburg, Virginia |pages=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427111356/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WAFOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AYwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6332,5746364 |archive-date=27 April 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict==

===Cultural Revolution===
{{Main|Cultural Revolution}}
[[File:China USSR E 88.jpg|thumb|350px|The Sino–Soviet split allowed minor problems to become violent at the disputed areas of the Argun and Amur rivers; the Damansky–Zhenbao is southeast, north of the lake. (2 March – 11 September 1969).]]
Meanwhile, in China, Mao Zedong launched the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976) to prevent the development of the  Russian-style bureaucratic communism of the USSR. The schools and universities were closed as students, following Mao's proclamations, organized themselves into [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]], grassroots-led units of radicals. However, this process was chaotic and violent and had no real leadership, and so over time the Red Guard divided into factions, and their subsequent violence provoked civil war in some parts of China; Mao had the [[People's Liberation Army|Army]] suppress the Red Guard factions; and when factionalism occurred in the Army, Mao dispersed the Red Guard, and then began to rebuild the [[Chinese Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="The Columbia Encyclopedia 1993. p. 696"&gt;The Columbia Encyclopedia, Fifth Edition. Columbia University Press:1993. p. 696.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast grassroots experiment that was the Cultural Revolution stressed, strained, and broke China's political relations with the USSR, and relations with the [[Western world|West]]. Nevertheless, despite the "Maoism vs. Marxism–Leninism" differences interpreting [[Marxism]], Russia and China aided [[North Vietnam]], headed by [[Ho Chi Minh]], in fighting the [[Vietnam War]] (1945–1975), which [[Maoism]] defined as a peasant revolution against foreign [[imperialism]]. The Chinese allowed Soviet [[materiel]] across China for the North, to prosecute the war against the [[Republic of Vietnam]], a U.S. ally. In that time, besides the [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania]], only the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] advocated the [[Maoism|Maoist]] policy of peasant revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Historical Terms, Chris Cook, editor. Peter Bedrick Books:New York:1983 p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National interests conflict===
Since 1956, the Sino-Soviet [[ideology|ideological]] split, between Communist political parties, had escalated to small-scale warfare between Russia and China; thereby, in January 1967, [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] attacked the Soviet embassy in Beijing. Earlier, in 1966, the Chinese had revived the matter of the Russo-Chinese border that was demarcated in the 19th-century, and imposed upon the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1912) monarchy by means of unequal treaties that virtually annexed Chinese territory to the [[Russian Empire]].

Despite not asking the return of territory, the Chinese did ask the USSR to formally (publicly) acknowledge that said border, established with the [[Treaty of Aigun]] (1858) and the [[Convention of Peking]] (1860), was a historic Russian injustice against China; the Soviet government ignored the matter. Then, in 1968, the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]] [[purge]]s meant to restore doctrinal [[orthodoxy]] to China had provoked civil war in parts of the country, which Mao resolved with the [[People's Liberation Army]] suppressing the pertinent cohorts of the Red Guard; the excesses of the Red Guard and of the Cultural Revolution declined. Mao required internal political equilibrium in order to protect China from the strategic and military vulnerabilities that resulted from its political isolation from the community of nations.

===Border war===
{{Main|Sino-Soviet border conflict}}

[[File:Project-131-door-9754.jpg|thumb|250px|The door to the [[nuclear war]] shelter complex in the tunnels of [[Underground Project 131]], in [[Hubei]], China.]]
Meanwhile, during 1968, the [[Soviet Army]] had massed along the 4,380&amp;nbsp;km (2,738&amp;nbsp;mi.) border with China—especially at the [[Xinjiang]] frontier, in north-west China, where the Soviets might readily induce [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] separatists to insurrection. Militarily, in 1961, the USSR had 12 divisions and 200 airplanes at that border; in 1968, there were 25 divisions, 1,200 airplanes, and 120 medium-range missiles. Although China had detonated [[596 (nuclear test)|its first nuclear weapon, the 596 Test]], in October 1964, the [[People's Liberation Army]] was militarily inferior to the Red Army. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

By March 1969, the Sino-Soviet border confrontation had become the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]], with fighting at the Ussuri River and [[Zhenbao Island incident|on Damansky–Zhenbao Island]]; more small-scale warfare occurred at [[Tielieketi]] in August. US journalist [[Harrison Salisbury]] reported that Soviet sources hinted at a possible [[first strike]] against China's [[nuclear weapons testing]] site in the [[Lop Nur]] basin.&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury, Harrison. ''The Coming War Between Russia and China'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

US Presidents Kennedy and Johnson had considered attempting to destroy the Chinese program before it succeeded, but the USSR had refused to cooperate.&lt;ref name="jstor2626706"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2626706 | last1 = Burr | first1 = W. | last2 = Richelson | first2 = J.

===Geopolitical pragmatism===
[[File:Mao Zedong, Zhang Yufeng et Richard Nixon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|To counter the USSR, Chairman Mao met U.S President Richard Nixon in order to establish a Sino-American rapprochement. (China, 1972)]]
After the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] (2 Mar. – 11 Sept., 1969), Soviet Prime minister [[Alexei Kosygin]] secretly went to Beijing to confer with Premier [[Zhou Enlai]], and by October, the PRC and the USSR began determining the demarcation of their national borders. Despite not resolving the border demarcation, the meetings restored Sino-Soviet diplomatic communications, and, by 1970, Mao understood that the People's Republic of China could not simultaneously fight the USSR and the USA, whilst suppressing internal disorder. In July 1971, Nixon's [[National Security Adviser]] [[Henry Kissinger]], went to Beijing to arrange the [[Nixon visit to China]] (February 1972). Kissinger's actions offended the USSR, who then convoked a summit meeting with President Nixon; that action re-cast the Cold War as tri-polar relation among Moscow and Washington and Beijing.

Concerning the 4,380&amp;nbsp;km (2,738&amp;nbsp;mi.) Sino-Soviet border, Soviet propaganda agitated against the PRC's complaint about the unequal [[Treaty of Aigun]] (1858) and the [[Convention of Peking]] (1860), which cheated China of territory and natural resources. To that effect, in the 1972–73 period, the USSR deleted the Chinese and Manchu place-names—Iman (伊曼, Yiman), Tetyukhe (野猪河, yĕzhūhé), and Suchan—from the map of the  [[Soviet Far East]], and replaced them with the Russian place-names [[Dalnerechensk]], [[Dalnegorsk]], and [[Partizansk]], respectively.&lt;ref name=stephan&gt;Stephan, John J.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=osW5AAAAIAA Snippet view only] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate social  acceptance of such cultural revision, the Soviet press misrepresented the historical presence of Chinese people—in lands gained by Tsarist Russia—which provoked Russian violence against the local Chinese populaces; moreover, politically inconvenient exhibits were removed from museums,&lt;ref name=stephan /&gt; and vandals covered with cement the [[Jurchen script|Jurchen-script]] stele, about the [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin Dynasty]], in the Khabarovsk Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Georgy Permyakov (Георгий ПЕРМЯКОВ) ''The Ancient Tortoise and the Soviet Cement'' ([http://85.114.94.194/page.php?page=1787&amp;date_id_num=2000-04-30&amp;year=2000&amp;month=04&amp;day_id=27 «Черепаха древняя, цемент советский»]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}), ''Tikhookeanskaya Zvezda'', 30-April-2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competing front groups===
{{Further|Communist front}}
After Mao Zedong broke relations with the Soviet Union in 1956, he launched a world-wide rivalry for leadership of [[world communism]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Jeremy.  "Soviet Policy in the Developing World and the Chinese Challenge in the 1960s", ''Cold War History'' (2010) 10#2 pp. 247–272.&lt;/ref&gt; In the countries of the PRC's sphere of influence, Mao established a network of pro–Chinese, anti–Soviet political parties and communist-front organisations that directly challenged pro–Soviet organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael D. Gambone|title=Capturing the Revolution: The United States, Central America, and Nicaragua, 1961–1972|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WF8P91maf0oC&amp;pg=PA129|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood |page=129|isbn=9780275973056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alaba Ogunsanwo|title=China's Policy in Africa 1958-71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Dn0fbuz4mEC&amp;pg=PA96|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=96|isbn=9780521201261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1970, Sino–Soviet ideological rivalry extended to Africa and the Middle East, where the Soviet Union and China funded and supported opposed political parties, militias, and states, notably the [[Ogaden War]] (1977–1978) between Ethiopia and Somalia, the [[Rhodesian Bush War]] (1964–1979), the Zimbabwean [[Gukurahundi]] (1980–1987), the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002), the [[Mozambican Civil War]] (1977–1992), and factions of the [[Palestinian people]]. In Thailand, the pro–Chinese communist fronts were organized for revolution, but were based in the local Chinese populations, and failed to connect with the greater population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregg A.

==Equilibrium==

===The transition===
[[File:Lin Biao.jpg|thumb|The elimination of Marshal [[Lin Biao]] in 1971 ameliorated the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976).]]
[[File:Gerald and Betty Ford meet with Deng Xiaoping, 1975 A7598-20A.jpg|thumb|Paramount Leader of China, Deng Xiaoping (center), with U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]] (left); peaceful coexistence redux. (China, 1975).]]

In 1971, the failure of [[Project 571]], an attempted ''coup d'état'' against Chairman Mao, and the death of Marshal [[Lin Biao]], Mao's executive officer, concluded the politically radical phase of the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–76). Afterwards, China resumed political normality, until Mao's death (9 September 1976), and the emergence of the politically radical [[Gang of Four]].

The re-establishment of Chinese domestic tranquility ended armed confrontation with the USSR, but it did not improve Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations because in 1973 the Soviet Army garrisons at the Russo-Chinese border were twice as large as the 1969 garrisons. That continued military threat prompted the Chinese to denounce "Soviet [[social-imperialism]]", by accusing the USSR of being an enemy of [[world revolution]].

===Transcending Mao===
After thwarting the 1976 ''coup d'état'' by the radical [[Gang of Four (China)|Gang of Four]], who argued for ideologic orthodoxy at the expense of internal development, the Chinese Communist Party politically rehabilitated [[Deng Xiaoping]] and appointed him head of the internal modernization programs in 1977. With the reversal of Mao's policies (without politically attacking him), the politically moderate Deng's political and economic reforms began the PRC's transition from a [[planned economy]] to a semi-capitalist [[mixed economy]], which he furthered with strengthened commercial and diplomatic relations with the West.&lt;ref name="Modern Thought 1999. pp. 349"&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition, Allan Bullock, Stephen Trombley editors. Harper Collins Publishers:London:1999. pp. 349–350&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Political Terms 1983. pp. 127"&gt;''Dictionary of Political Terms'', Chris Cook, editor. Peter Bedrick Books:New York: 1983. pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, on the 30th anniversary of the foundation of the PRC, the government of Deng Xiaoping denounced the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as a national failure; and, in the 1980s, pursued ''[[Realpolitik]]'' policies, such as "seeking truth from facts" and the "Chinese road to socialism", which withdrew the PRC from the high-level abstractions of [[ideology]], [[polemic]], and the [[revisionism (Marxism)|Marxist revisionism]] of the Soviet Union; the Sino–Soviet split had lost some political importance.&lt;ref name="Modern Thought 1999. pp. 349"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Political Terms 1983. pp. 127"/&gt;

===Competing hegemonies===
After the government of Mao Zedong, the Sino-Soviet split about ideology became useless domestic politics, but was useful [[geopolitics]], wherein conflicted the Russian and Chinese [[hegemony|hegemonies]] in the pursuit of their [[national interest]]s. The initial Soviet–Chinese [[proxy war]] occurred in [[Indochina]], in 1975, where the Communist victory of the [[Viet Cong|National Liberation Front]] (Viet Cong) and of [[North Vietnam]] in the thirty-year [[Vietnam War]] had produced a post–[[Colonialism|colonial]] Indochina that featured pro-Soviet governments in Vietnam ([[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]) and Laos ([[Laos|Lao People's Democratic Republic]]), and a pro–Chinese government in Cambodia ([[Democratic Kampuchea]]).

[[File:PolPot.jpg|thumb|In 1979, the Chinese-supported government of [[Pol Pot]] in Cambodia (Kampuchea) was overthrown by the Soviet-backed Vietnamese in the Cambodian–Vietnamese War (1975–1979).]]

At first, Vietnam ignored the [[Khmer Rouge]] domestic re-organisation of Cambodia, by the [[Pol Pot]] government (1975–1979), as an internal matter, until the Khmer Rouge attacked the ethnic Vietnamese populace of Cambodia, and the border with Vietnam; the counter-attack precipitated the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War]] (1975–1979) that deposed Pol Pot in 1978. In response, the PRC denounced the Vietnamese, and retaliated by invading northern Vietnam, in the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] (1979); in turn, the USSR denounced the PRC's invasion of Vietnam.

In December 1979, the USSR invaded the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] to maintain the Afghan Communist government in power. The PRC viewed the Soviet invasion as a local feint, within Soviet's greater, geopolitical encirclement of China. In response, the PRC entered a tri-partite alliance with the U.S. and Pakistan to sponsor [[Islamist]] Afghan armed resistance to the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Occupation]] (cf. [[Operation Storm-333]]). Meanwhile, the Sino-Soviet split became manifest when [[Deng Xiaoping]], the [[paramount leader]] of China, required the removal of "three obstacles" so that Sino-Soviet relations might improve:
# The massed Soviet Army at the Sino-Soviet border and in Mongolia.
# Soviet support of the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea|Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea (Cambodia)]].
# The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

In 1981–82 period, Sino-American relations were strained by geopolitical disagreements about wars, such as the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] and the [[Falklands War]]. At the CCP's 12th Congress in September 1982, Deng Xiaoping revived the revisionist "Three Worlds" idea that characterized China as a neutral player in a world divided by conflict between the superpowers. Meanwhile, in March 1982 in [[Tashkent]], USSR Secretary [[Leonid Brezhnev]] gave a speech conciliatory towards the PRC, and Deng took advantage of Brezhnev's proffered conciliation; in autumn of 1982, Sino-Soviet relations resumed (semi-annually) at the vice-ministerial level.

When Brezhnev died in November 1982, a Chinese delegation, headed by Foreign Minister [[Huang Hua (politician)|Huang Hua]], attended the funeral, where Huang praised the late Soviet leader Brezhnev as "an outstanding champion of world peace" and expressed hope for normal relations with Moscow. However, Huang's actions at Brezhnev's funeral led to his dismissal from office after he returned to the PRC.

Three years later, in 1985, when [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became President of the USSR, he worked to restore political relations with the PRC; he reduced the Soviet Army garrisons at the Sino-Soviet border and in Mongolia, resumed trade, and dropped the matter of the 1969 border-demarcation dispute. Nonetheless, the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan remained unresolved, and Sino-Soviet [[diplomacy]] remained cool, which circumstance allowed the Reagan government to sell American weapons to China and so counter the geopolitics of the USSR in the Russo-American aspect of the tri-polar Cold War.

Diplomatic relations between China and Afghanistan were neutral during the reign of the Afghan king; yet, when pro-Soviet Afghan communists seized power in 1978, relations between China and the Afghan communists quickly worsened and then became hostile. Although the Afghan communists supported China's enemies in Vietnam, and blamed China for supporting militant Afghan anti–Communists, China responded to the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] by supporting the [[Afghan mujahideen|Afghan Mujahidin]] with aid, small arms, and ''matériel'', delivered by the Pakistani military and intelligence and the CIA, and likewise increased their military presence in Xinjiang, near Afghanistan. China acquired American military equipment to defend from Soviet attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Frederick Starriditor=S. Frederick Starr|year=2004|edition=illustrated|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXj4a3gss8wC&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Xinjiang: China's Muslim Borderland|volume=|location=|isbn=978-0765613189|page=157|pages=|quote=|accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] trained and supported the Afghan Mujahidin during the Soviet–Afghan War. China moved training camps for the Mujahideen from Pakistan into China proper, which were supported with military advisors and soldiers; afterwards, the Mujahidin were provided anti-aircraft missiles, rocket launchers, and machine guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Frederick Starriditor=S. Frederick Starr|year=2004|edition=illustrated|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXj4a3gss8wC&amp;pg=PA158#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Xinjiang: China's Muslim Borderland|volume=|location=|isbn=978-0765613189|page=158|pages=|quote=|accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1980s, Sino-Soviet political relations improved, by trade agreements and cultural exchanges, however ideological relations between the Communist parties of Russia and China remained unchanged, because the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) refused to accept the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) as their Marxist equals.

===Reform===
In May 1989, Soviet President Gorbachev visited the People's Republic of China, where the government doubted the practical efficacy of ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]''. Since the PRC did not officially recognize the USSR as a socialist state, there was no official opinion about Gorbachev's reformation of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[socialism]]. Privately, the [[Chinese Communist Party|Chinese Communists]] thought that the USSR was unprepared for such political and social reforms without first reforming the economy of the USSR.

The Chinese perspective derived from how the paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, effected economic reform with a semi-capitalist [[mixed economy]], while the political power remained with the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. Ultimately, Gorbachev's reformation of Russian society ended Soviet-Communist government and provoked the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.

'''''The She Spot: Why Women are the Market for Changing the World &amp;ndash; And How to Reach Them''''' is a 2008 [[non-fiction]] book by [[Lisa Witter]] and [[Lisa Chen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why political candidates should be sucking up to women |author=Kate Harding |url=http://www.salon.com/2008/06/02/she_spot/ |newspaper=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=June 2, 2008 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
''The She Spot'' looks at the impact of women on [[social change]], and focuses on the influence women have had on the world, as well as on volunteering. The book incorporates several case studies, polls, and the potential for women to be underrepresented in these polls and studies. It also covers the potential mis-representation in marketing towards women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The she spot; why women are the market for changing the world--and how to reach them (Book review) |author= |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-183483734.html |newspaper=Reference &amp; Research Book News |date=August 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 17, 2012|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Critical reception for ''The She Spot'' has been positive, with [[Publishers Weekly]] calling it a "thoughtful, helpful guide to nonprofit marketers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nonfiction review - The She Spot: Why Women Are the Market for Changing the World—and How to Reach Them |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-57675-472-6 |newspaper=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=April 21, 2008 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AdAge|AdAge's]] Matt Kinsey wrote that the book was "good fodder for discussion" but that he was unsure that Witter and Chen's "formula alone can commandeer a loyal female audience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Finding 'The She Spot' More Important Than You Thought |author=Matt Kinsey |url=http://adage.com/article/ad-and-marketing-book-reviews/finding-spot-important-thought/130170/ |newspaper=[[Advertising Age]] |date=August 6, 2008 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in [[ForeWord (magazine)|ForeWord]] magazine by Mary Spiro said that, "If one agrees with the premise that marketing has been male-centered or that the strategies they present are uniquely suited to impact women then this text offers plenty of practical advice for those courting female clientele" and that the end of chapter summaries offer "quick inspiration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The She Spot: Why Women are the Market for Changing the World--and How to Reach Them (Book review) |author=Mary Spiro |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-236034590.html |newspaper=[[ForeWord (magazine)|ForeWord]] |date=August 19, 2009 |accessdate=April 17, 2012|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="82746">The '''Tibetan sovereignty debate''' refers to two [[political]] debates. The first is whether the various territories within the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) that are claimed as political [[Tibet]] should [[separatism|separate]] and become a new [[sovereign state]]. Many of the points in the debate rest on a second debate, about whether Tibet was independent or subordinate to China in certain parts of its recent history.

It is generally agreed that China and Tibet were independent prior to the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368),&lt;ref&gt;Wang and Nyima (1997) p.20.  Sperling (2004) p.21&lt;/ref&gt; and that Tibet has been ruled by the People's Republic of China (PRC) since 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Sperling (2004) p.17. Shakya (1999) p.90.  Latourette (1964) p.419. Spence (1999) p.500.&lt;/ref&gt;  The nature of Tibet's relationship with China in the intervening period is a matter of debate.  The PRC claims that Tibet has been a part of China since the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Wang and Nyima (1997) p.20. Grunfeld (1996) p.256.  Sperling (2004) p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) claimed that "Tibet was placed under the sovereignty of  China" when the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) [[Sino-Nepalese War|ended the brief Nepalese rule]] (1788-1792) from parts of Tibet in c. 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Sperling (2004) pp.6,7.  Goldstein (1989) p.72.  Both cite the ROC's position paper at the 1914 Simla Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] claims that Tibet was an independent state until the PRC invaded Tibet in 1949/50.&lt;ref&gt;Sperling (2004) p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dalailama.com/messages/tibet/five-point-peace-plan|title=Five Point Peace Plan|publisher=The Dalai Lama|date=21 September 1987|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Western scholars claim that Tibet and China were ruled by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;Feigon (1996) p.58. Gernet (1972) pp.369, 384.  Goldstein (1997) pp.3, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Sino-Tibetan relations during the Ming dynasty|Tibet was independent]] during the Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644).&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1997) pp.4,5.

Feigon (1996) p.119 "border between the two countries" of China and Tibet in 1917.  Goldstein (1997) pp.30-37 Chapter titled "Interlude: De Facto Independence".  Latourette (1964) pp.333 "practically independent" from 1912, 419 "accepted the suzerainity of the Communists" in 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; although it had extremely limited international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/china/question-tibet/p15965#p2|title=The Question of Tibet|publisher=Council of Foreign Relations|quote=Western countries, including Britain and the United States, did not recognize Tibet as fully independent|date=5 December 2008|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] contends that it has had control over Tibet since the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/china/2008-03/21/content_13268563.htm History of Tibet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], which ruled mainland China from 1912 until 1949 and now controls [[Taiwan]], had a cabinet-level [[Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission]] in charge of the administration of [[Tibet]] and [[Mongolia]] regions from 1912. The commission retained its cabinet level status after 1949, but no longer executes that function.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} On 10{{nbsp}}May 1943, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] asserted that "Tibet is part of Chinese territory... No foreign nation is allowed to interfere in our domestic affairs".&lt;ref name=WW2&gt;[http://www.tibet.cn/english/zt/TibetologyMagazine/..%5CTibetologyMagazine/200312007421120803.htm ''The Issue of Tibet in China-US Relations During The Second World War'']&lt;/ref&gt; He again declared in 1946 that the Tibetans were Chinese nationals.&lt;ref name=Buruma&gt;[http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/buruma11/English ''The last of the Tibetans''] By Ian Buruma&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic of China (on Taiwan) still claims sovereignty over Tibet and Mongolia and maintains the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission.

In the late 19th century, China adopted the Western model of nation-state diplomacy. As the government of Tibet, China concluded several treaties (1876, 1886, 1890, 1893) with [[British Raj|British India]] touching on the status, boundaries and access to Tibet.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14718a.htm The ''Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume XIV. Published 1912: Tibet'']&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese government sources consider this a sign of [[sovereignty]] rather than [[suzerainty]]. However, by the 20th century British India found the treaties to be ineffective due to China's weakened control over the Tibetan local government. [[British expedition to Tibet|The British invaded Tibet]] in 1904 and forced the signing of a separate treaty, directly with the Tibetan government in Lhasa. In 1906, an [http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties11.html Anglo-Chinese Convention] was signed at Peking between Great Britain and China. It incorporated the 1904 Lhasa Convention (with modification), which was attached as Annex.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="treaty1906"&gt;[http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties11.html Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet (1906)]&lt;/ref&gt; A treaty between Britain and Russia (1907) followed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties12.html Convention Between Great Britain and Russia (1907)]&lt;/ref&gt; Article II of this treaty stated that "In conformity with the admitted principle of the suzerainty of China over Tibet, Great Britain and Russia engage not to enter into negotiations with Tibet except through the intermediary of the Chinese Government." China sent troops into Tibet in 1908. The result of the policy of both Great Britain and Russia has been the virtual annexation of Tibet by China.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; China controlled Tibet up to 1912. Thereafter, Tibet entered the period described commonly as ''de facto'' independence, though it was only recognized by independent Mongolia as enjoying ''de jure'' independence.

In the 2000s the position of the Republic of China with regard to Tibet appeared to become more nuanced as was stated in the following opening speech to the International Symposium on Human Rights in Tibet on 8{{nbsp}}September 2007 through the pro-Taiwan independence then ROC President [[Chen Shui-bian]] who stated that his offices no longer treated exiled Tibetans as Chinese mainlanders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.gov.tw/en/prog/news_release/print.php?id=1105499543 'President Chen Shui-bian's Remarks at the Opening Ceremony of the 2007 International Symposium on Human Rights in Tibet' Sep 8, 2007]  {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal arguments based on historical status===

The position of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which has ruled mainland China since 1949, as well as the official position of the Republic of China (ROC), which ruled mainland China before 1949 and currently controls Taiwan,&lt;ref&gt;For the PRC's position, see State Council's whitepaper [http://www.china.org.cn/e-white/tibet/ ''Tibet - Its Ownership and Human Rights Situation''], 1992 and Beijing Review's [http://www.tibet.cn/tibetzt/question_e/index.htm ''100 Question about Tibet''], 1989; for ROC's position, see Government Information Office's [http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/92roc/pdfs/01-02-02.pdf online publication] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724210652/http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/92roc/pdfs/01-02-02.pdf |date=2006-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is that Tibet has been an indivisible part of China ''[[de jure]]'' since the [[Yuan dynasty]] of Mongol-ruled China in the 13th century,&lt;ref&gt;Grunfeld, A. Tom, [http://www.fpif.org/briefs/vol5/v5n09tibet_body.html ''Reassessing Tibet Policy''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906034739/http://www.fpif.org/briefs/vol5/v5n09tibet_body.html |date=2006-09-06 }}, 2000 ([http://www.fpif.org/pdf/vol5/09iftibet.pdf also in PDF file] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025063501/http://www.fpif.org/pdf/vol5/09iftibet.pdf |date=2006-10-25 }})&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to other states such as the [[Kingdom of Dali]] and the [[Tangut Empire]] that were also incorporated into China at the time.

The PRC contends that, according to [[international law]] and the [[Succession of states theory]],&lt;ref&gt;For a definition of the "Succession of states theory in international law", see West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2, The Gale Group, Inc., 2008 : "Succession occurs when one state ceases to exist or loses control over part of its territory, and another state comes into existence or assumes control over the territory lost by the first state. A central concern in this instance is whether the international obligations of the former state are taken over by the succeeding state. Changes in the form of government of one state, such as the replacement of a monarchy by a democratic form of government, do not modify or terminate the obligations incurred by the previous government. When the state ceases to exist, however, the treaties it concluded generally are terminated and those of the successor state apply to the territory. These include political treaties like alliances, which depend on the existence of the state that concluded them. But certain obligations, such as agreements concerning boundaries or other matters of local significance, carry over to the successor state. More difficult to determine is the continuing legality of treaties granting concessions or contract rights. Scholarly opinion has diverged on this aspect of succession, and state practice has likewise divided. Consequently each case must be studied on its merits to determine whether the rights and duties under the contract or concession are such that the successor state is bound by the obligations of the previous state."&lt;/ref&gt; all subsequent Chinese governments have succeeded the Yuan Dynasty in exercising de jure sovereignty over Tibet, with the PRC having succeeded the ROC as the legitimate government of all China.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Kamm, [http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi/Kamm%20Rene.pdf?oberlin1340040517 The Sino-Tibetan Dialogue: Talk Shop or Path to Resolution?], Marc Blecher, advisor, Oberlin College, East Asian Studies Honors, 2012 April 26, p. 7: "The PRC contends that, according to international law and the succession of states theory, all subsequent Chinese governments have succeeded the Yuan Dynasty in exercising de jure sovereignty over Tibet."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott David Parker, Department of Political Science, Sierra College Truckee, California, [http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2012/Parker.pdf All (Geo-)Politics are Local: the Consequences of the People's Republic of China's Military Doctrine of Local War for the East Asia Region], Paper submitted for presentation at the Canadian Political Science Association annual meeting, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, June 12–15, 2012 : "In the view of its leadership, the PRC replaced the ROC as the legitimate government of all China under the succession of states theory of international law. That the majority of the world's states agree reinforces this assertion and serves to isolate the Taipei regime".&lt;/ref&gt;

===De facto independence===
The ROC government had no effective control over Tibet from 1912 to 1951;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Running From Tenda Gyamar: A Voluteer's Story of Life with the Refugee Children of Tibet|last=Freeman|first=Lesley|publisher=Mantra Books|year=2013|isbn=978-1-78099-853-4|location=Winchester, UK|pages=5|quote="With the collapse of the Chinese Empire in 1911, Tibet Declared its independence."}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in the opinion of the Chinese government, this condition does not represent Tibet's independence as many other parts of China also enjoyed ''de facto'' independence when the Chinese nation was torn by [[warlord era|warlordism]], [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]], and [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;Grunfeld, 1996, p256&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein explains what is meant by ''de facto'' independence in the following statement:

{{quote|...[Britain] instead adopted a policy based on the idea of ''autonomy'' for Tibet within the context of Chinese ''suzerainty'', that is to say, ''de facto'' independence for Tibet in the context of token subordination to China. Britain articulated this policy in the [[Simla Accord (1914)|Simla Accord]] of 1914.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State'' by Melvyn Goldstein, Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press(1989),  p822&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While at times the Tibetans were fiercely independent-minded at other times Tibet indicated its willingness to accept subordinate status as ''part of China'' provided that Tibetan internal systems were left untouched and China relinquished control over a number of important ethnic Tibetan groups in [[Kham]] and [[Amdo]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Melvyn C., ''A History of Modern Tibet: 1913-1951'', 1989, pp 239-241, 248, 271&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grunfeld, A. Tom, ''The Making of Modern Tibet'', M.E. Sharpe, 1996, p245, regarding Kham and Amdo: "The historical reality is that the Dalai Lamas have not ruled these outer areas since the mid-eighteenth century, and during the Simla Conference of 1913, the 13th Dalai Lama was even willing to sign away rights to them"&lt;/ref&gt; The PRC insists that during this period the ROC government continued to maintain sovereignty over Tibet. The [[Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China]] (1912) stipulated that Tibet was a province of the Republic of China. Provisions concerning Tibet in the Constitution of the Republic of China promulgated later all stress the inseparability of Tibet from Chinese territory, and the Central Government of China exercise of sovereignty in Tibet.&lt;ref name=HoT-3&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/china/2008-03/21/content_13268563_3.htm ''History of Tibet'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zt/zgxz/Tibeta%20in%20Brief/Did%20Tibet/t37144.htm ''The Consistent Stand Taken by the Successive Chinese Central Governments towards the Sovereignty over Tibet after the Revolution of 1911'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China'', issued March, 1912; ''Constitution of the Republic of China'', issued May, 1914; ''Provisional Constitution in the Political Tutelage Period of the Republic of China'', issued June 1931&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TB1911"&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/ch-xizang/tibet/serie_book/english/independent/independent.html "''Did Tibet Become an Independent Country after the Revolution of 1911?''"], China Internet Information Center&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, the Commission in Charge of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Tibet'' By Alex McKay (ed), London: RoutledgeCurzon (2003) p.427,571&lt;/ref&gt; of the Chinese Government contained members of great influence in the Mongolian and Tibetan areas, such as the 13th [[Dalai Lama]], the 9th [[Panchen Lama]] and other Tibetan government representatives.&lt;ref name=HoT-4&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/china/2008-03/21/content_13268563_4.htm ''History of Tibet'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, on his condolence mission for the demise of the Dalai Lama, the Chinese General Huang Musong posted notices in Chinese and Tibetan throughout Lhasa that alluded to Tibet as an integral part of China while expressing the utmost reverence for the Dalai Lama and the Buddhist religion.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Modern Tibet, 1913–1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State'' by Melvyn C.

In 1933, he called upon the Mongols to embrace national unity and to obey the Chinese Government to resist Japanese invasion. In February 1935 the Chinese government appointed Panchen Lama "Special Cultural Commissioner for the Western Regions" and assigned him 500 Chinese troops.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Modern Tibet, 1913–1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State'' by Melvyn C.

A proclamation issued by 13th Dalai Lama in 1913 states, "During the time of [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Altan Khan]] of the Mongols, the [[Ming dynasty]] of the Chinese, and the [[Qing Dynasty]] of the [[Manchus]], Tibet and China cooperated on the basis of benefactor and priest relationship. [...] the existing relationship between [[Tibet (1912–1951)|Tibet]] and [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]] had been that of [[Patron and priest relationship|patron and priest]] and had not been based on the subordination of one to the other." He condemned that the "Chinese authorities in Szechuan and Yunnan endeavored to colonize our territory Chinese" in 1910–12 and stated that "We are a small, religious, and independent nation".&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa, Tsepon W.

[[File:Passeportshakabpa.jpg|thumb|left|The passport of Tsepon Shakabpa]]In 2003, an old Tibetan [[passport]] was rediscovered in Nepal. Issued by the [[Kashag]] to Tibet's  finance minister [[Tsepon Shakabpa]] for foreign travel, the passport was a single piece of pink paper, complete with photograph. It has a message in hand-written Tibetan and typed English, similar to the message by the nominal issuing officers of today's passports, stating that ""''the bearer of this letter – Tsepon Shakabpa, Chief of the Finance Department of the Government of Tibet, is hereby sent to China, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and other countries to explore and review trade possibilities between these countries and Tibet. We shall, therefore, be grateful if all the Governments concerned on his route would kindly give due recognition as such, grant necessary passport, visa, etc. without any hindrance and render assistance in all possible ways to him.''" The text and the photograph is sealed by a square stamp belonging to the Kashag, and is dated "''26th day of the 8th month of Fire-Pig year (Tibetan)''" (14 October 1947 in the gregorian calendar).&lt;ref name="Kokswijk2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacob van Kokswijk|title=Digital Ego: Social and Legal Aspects of Virtual Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqTKFylfhakC&amp;pg=PA52|year=2007|publisher=Eburon Uitgeverij B.V.|isbn=978-90-5972-203-3|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma2004"&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.friendsoftibet.org/mediaonfot/20040402a.html | title=First Tibetan Passport Found after 15 Years |author=Pawan Sharma |newspaper=Hindustan Times | date=April 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passport has received visas and entry stamps from several countries and territories, including India, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Switzerland, Pakistan, Iraq and Hong Kong, but not China. Some visa do reflect an official status, with mentions such as "Diplomatic courtesy, Service visa, Official gratis, Diplomatic visa, For government official".

However, acceptance of a passport does not indicate recognition of independence, as for example the [[Republic of China passport]] is accepted by almost all the countries of the world, even though few of them recognize the ROC as independent.

=== Tibet Government in exile (post 1959) ===
{{See also|Central Tibetan Administration}}

In 1959, the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|14th]] [[Dalai Lama]] fled Tibet and established a [[Government of Tibet in Exile|government in exile]] at [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]] in northern [[India]]. This group claims sovereignty over various ethnically or historically Tibetan areas now governed by China. Aside from the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], an area that was administered directly by the Dalai Lama's government until 1951, the group also claims [[Amdo]] ([[Qinghai]]) and eastern [[Kham]] (western [[Sichuan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Melvyn C., ''The Snow Lion and the Dragon'', University of California Press, 1997, p71&lt;/ref&gt; About 45 percent of ethnic Tibetans under Chinese rule live in the Tibet Autonomous Region, according to the 2000 census. Prior to 1949, much of Amdo and eastern Kham were governed by local rulers and even warlords.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The view of the current Dalai Lama in 1989 was as follows:

{{quote|During the 5th Dalai Lama's time [1617–1682], I think it was quite evident that we were a separate sovereign nation with no problems. The 6th Dalai Lama [1683–1706] was spiritually pre-eminent, but politically, he was weak and uninterested. He could not follow the 5th Dalai Lama's path. This was a great failure. So, then the Chinese influence increased. During this time, the Tibetans showed quite a deal of respect to the Chinese. But even during these times, the Tibetans never regarded Tibet as a part of China. All the documents were very clear that China, Mongolia and Tibet were all separate countries. Because the Chinese emperor was powerful and influential, the small nations accepted the Chinese power or influence. You cannot use the previous invasion as evidence that Tibet belongs to China. In the Tibetan mind, regardless of who was in power, whether it was the Manchus [the Qing dynasty], the Mongols [the Yuan dynasty] or the Chinese, the east of Tibet was simply referred to as China. In the Tibetan mind, India and China were treated the same; two separate countries.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, Tenzin, 14th Dalai Lama. ''Tibet, China and the World: A Compilation of Interviews'', Dharamsala, 1989, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[International Commission of Jurists]] concluded that from 1913 to 1950 Tibet demonstrated the conditions of statehood as generally accepted under international law. In the opinion of the commission, the government of Tibet conducted its own domestic and foreign affairs free from any outside authority, and countries with whom Tibet had foreign relations are shown by official documents to have treated Tibet in practice as an independent State.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Inquiry Committee, ''Tibet and Chinese People's Republic'', Geneva: International Commission of Jurists, 1960, pp. 5,6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walt Van Praag, Michael C. van, [http://tibet.dharmakara.net/tibethistory.html ''The Status of Tibet: History, Rights and Prospects in International Law''], (Westview, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations General Assembly passed resolutions urging respect for the rights of Tibetans in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/141/76/IMG/NR014176.pdf?OpenElement |title=''United Nations General Assembly - Resolution 1353 (XIV)'' |access-date=2012-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306110438/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/141/76/IMG/NR014176.pdf?OpenElement |archive-date=2014-03-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1961&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/167/76/IMG/NR016776.pdf?OpenElement ''United Nations General Assembly - Resolution 1723 (XVI)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192638/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/167/76/IMG/NR016776.pdf?OpenElement |date=2014-01-02 }} and alternative:[http://daccess-ods.un.org/TMP/1639066.93458557.html]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/218/42/IMG/NR021842.pdf?OpenElement ''United Nations General Assembly - Resolution 2079 (XX)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013223016/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/218/42/IMG/NR021842.pdf?OpenElement |date=2013-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1961 resolution calls for that "principle of self-determination of peoples and nations" applies to the Tibetan people.

The Tibetan Government in Exile views current PRC rule in Tibet, including neighboring provinces outside Tibet Autonomous Region, as colonial and illegitimate, motivated solely by the natural resources and strategic value of Tibet, and in gross violation of both Tibet's historical status as an independent country and the right of Tibetan people to [[self-determination]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} It also points to PRC's autocratic policies, [[divide and rule|divide-and-rule]] policies, and what it contends are assimilationist policies, and regard those as an example of ongoing [[imperialism]] aimed at destroying Tibet's distinct ethnic makeup, culture, and identity, thereby cementing it as an indivisible part of China.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} That said, the Dalai Lama stated in 2008 that he wishes only for Tibetan autonomy, and not separation from China, under certain conditions, like freedom of speech and expression, genuine self-rule, and control over ethnic makeup and migration in all areas claimed as historical Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24097313/ns/us_news-faith/t/tibetans-just-want-autonomy-dalai-lama-says/|title=Tibetans just want autonomy, Dalai Lama says|publisher=MSNBC|date=13 April 2008|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars outside of China say that [[Tibet during the Ming dynasty|during]] the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), Tibet was independent without even nominal Ming suzerainty. In contrast, since the mid-18th century it is agreed that China had control over Tibet reaching its maximum in the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gernet, J., Foster, J.R. &amp; Hartman C., ''A History of Chinese Civilization'', Cambridge University Press, 1982, p481 reads in part: "''From 1751 onwards Chinese control over Tibet became permanent and remained so more or less ever after, in spite of British efforts to seize possession of this Chinese protectorate at the beginning of the twentieth century.''"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luciano Petech]], a scholar of Himalayan history, indicated that Tibet was a Qing protectorate.&lt;ref&gt;Petech L.,''China and Tibet in the Early XVIIIth Century: History of the Establishment of Chinese Protectorate in Tibet'', 1972, p260&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[patron and priest relationship]] held between the Qing court and the Tibetan lamas has been subjected to varying interpretation. The 13th Dalai Lama, for example, knelt, but did not kowtow, before the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] and the young Emperor while he delivered his petition in Beijing.  Chinese sources emphasize the submission of kneeling; Tibetan sources emphasize the lack of the kowtow.  Titles and commands given to Tibetans by the Chinese, likewise, are variously interpreted. The Qing authorities gave the 13th Dalai Lama the title of "Loyally Submissive Vice-Regent", and ordered to follow Qing's commands and communicate with the Emperor only through the Manchu Amban in [[Lhasa]]; but opinions vary as to whether these titles and commands reflected actual political power, or symbolic gestures ignored by Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Tibet: Volume III The Modern Period: 1895-1959'' edited by Alex McKay, London and New York: Routledge Curzon (2003), p.9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cc.purdue.edu/~wtv/tibet/13th.html |title=A wall painting showing the 13th Dalai Lama kneeling before the Dowager Queen |access-date=2008-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010425201257/http://cc.purdue.edu/~wtv/tibet/13th.html |archive-date=2001-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors claim that kneeling before the Emperor followed the 17th-century precedent in the case of the [[5th Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;Grunfeld, A. Tom, ''The Making of Modern Tibet'', p. 42, reads in part "''Both'' (Tibetan and Chinese)'' accounts agree that the Dalai Lama was exempt from the traditional kowtow symbolizing total subservience; he was, however, required to kneel before the emperor.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians indicate that the emperor treated the Dalai Lama as an equal&lt;ref&gt;Laird, Thomas. (2006). ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', pp. 170-174. Grove Press, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1827-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kneeling was a compromise allowed by the Qing court for foreign representatives, Western and Tibetan alike, as both parties refused to perform the kowtow.

Tibetologist Melvyn C. Goldstein writes that [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Russia]] formally acknowledged Chinese authority over Tibet in treaties of 1906 and 1907; and that the 1904 [[British expedition to Tibet|British invasion of Tibet]] stirred China into becoming  more directly involved in Tibetan affairs and working to integrate Tibet with "the rest of China."&lt;ref name="Goldstein art4"&gt;[http://cc.purdue.edu/~wtv/tibet/article/art4.html Tibet, China and the United States: Reflections on the Tibet Question by Melvyn C.

The status of Tibet after the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]] ended the Qing dynasty is also a matter of debate. After the revolution, the Chinese Republic of five races, including Tibetans, was proclaimed. Western powers recognized the Chinese Republic, however the 13th Dalai Lama proclaimed Tibet's independence.

This lack of legal recognition makes it difficult for international legal experts sympathetic to the Tibetan Government in Exile to argue that Tibet formally established its independence.&lt;ref&gt;Bradsher, Henry S.  ''Tibet Struggles to Survive'', Foreign Affairs, July 1969 Vol. 47 Issue 4, p.753 "Even today international legal experts sympathetic to the Dalai Lama's cause find it difficult to argue that Tibet ever technically established its independence of the Chinese Empire, imperial or republican..."&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in 1959 and 1960 the [[International Commission of Jurists]] concluded that Tibet had been independent between 1913 and 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Tibet and the Chinese People's Republic, International Commission of Jurists, 1960 "Tibet demonstrated from 1913 to 1950 the conditions of statehood as generally accepted under international law."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genocide allegations ===

Groups such as the Madrid-based [[Committee to Support Tibet]] claim the death toll in Tibet since the 1950 People's Liberation Army invasion of Tibet to be 1,200,000 and have filed official charges of genocide against prominent Chinese leaders and officials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-rejects-spains-genocide-claims-481351.html ''China rejects Spain's 'genocide' claims'']&lt;/ref&gt; This figure has been disputed by Patrick French, a supporter of the Tibetan cause who was able to view the data and calculations,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/22/opinion/22french.html ''He May Be a God, but He's No Politician'' By PATRICK FRENCH]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Tibet: Politics, Development, and Society in a Disputed Region'' by Barry Sautman and June Teufel Dreyer, New York: M.E.Sharpe (2006),p12&lt;/ref&gt; but rather, concludes a no less devastating death toll of half a million people as a direct result of Chinese policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karmapa.org.nz/news/29/67/TIBET-TIBET-A-PERSONAL-HISTORY-OF-A-LOST-LAND/] ''TIBET, TIBET, A PERSONAL HISTORY OF A LOST LAND'' ''Nov 17, 2008 Category: Book Reviews''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an ICJ ([[International Commission of Jurists]]) report released in 1960, there was no "sufficient proof of the destruction of Tibetans as a race, nation or ethnic group as such by methods that can be regarded as genocide in international law" found in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;ICJ Report on Tibet and China (excerpt) (1960), p.346&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other rights ===

(See [[Serfdom in Tibet controversy]], [[Social classes of Tibet]] and [[Human rights in Tibet]].)
The PRC argues that the Tibetan authority under successive Dalai Lamas was also itself a [[Human rights#Human rights violations|human rights violator]]. The old society, the Chinese government and its supporters say, was a [[serfdom]] and, according to reports of an early English explorer, had remnants of "a very mild form of [[slavery]]" prior to the 13th Dalai Lama's reforms of 1913.&lt;ref name=hr&gt;For existence of serfdom and slaves, see Grunfeld, 1996, pp12-17 and Bell, Charles, 1927, pp78-79; for other forms of human rights violation, see [[Frank Bessac|Bessac, Frank]], "''This Was the Perilous Trek to Tragedy''", ''Life'', 13 Nov 1950, pp130-136, 198, 141; Ford, Robert W., "''Wind Between The Worlds''", New York, 1957, p37; MacDonald, David, "''The Land of the Lamas''", London, 1929, pp196-197&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetologist Robert Barnett wrote about clerical resistance to the introduction of anything Anti-Buddhist that might disturb the prevailing power structure.  Clergy obstructed modernization attempts by the 13th Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name=leh&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/weai/documents/LEHMN2b.pdf Robert Barnett in [[Steve Lehman (photographer)|Steve Lehman]], ''[[The Tibetans: Struggle to Survive]]'', Umbrage Editions, New York, 1998. pdf p.12], [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1884167365]&lt;/ref&gt;

Old Tibet had a long history of persecuting non-Buddhist Christians.  In the years 1630 and 1742, Tibetan Christian communities were suppressed by the lamas of the Gelugpa Sect, whose chief lama was the Dalai Lama.  Jesuit priests were made prisoners in 1630 or attacked before they reached [[Tsaparang]].  Between 1850 and 1880, eleven fathers of the Paris Foreign Mission Society were murdered in Tibet, or killed or injured during their journeys to other missionary outposts in the Sino-Tibetan borderlands. In 1881 Father Brieux was reported to have been murdered on his way to Lhasa. Qing officials later discovered that the murder cases were in fact covertly supported and even orchestrated by local lamaseries and their patrons—the native chieftains. In 1904, Qing official Feng Quan sought to curtail the influence of the Gelugpa Sect and ordered the protection of Western missionaries and their churches. Indignation over Feng Quan and the Christian presence escalated to a climax in March 1905, when thousands of the Batang lamas revolted, killing Feng, his entourage, local Manchu and Han Chinese officials, and the local French Catholic priests. The revolt soon spread to other cities in eastern Tibet, such as Chamdo, Litang and Nyarong, and at one point almost spilled over into neighboring Sichuan Province. The missionary stations and churches in these areas were burned and destroyed by the angry Gelugpa monks and local chieftains. Dozens of local Westerners, including at least four priests, were killed or fatally wounded. The scale of the rebellion was so tremendous that only when panicked Qing authorities hurriedly sent 2,000 troops from Sichuan to pacify the mobs did the revolt gradually come to an end. The lamasery authorities and local native chieftains' hostility towards the Western missionaries in Tibet lingered through the last throes of the Manchu dynasty and into the Republican period.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificrim.usfca.edu/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html ''When Christianity and Lamaism Met: The Changing Fortunes of Early Western Missionaries in Tibet'' by Hsiao-ting Lin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626095547/http://www.pacificrim.usfca.edu/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html |date=June 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Tibet'' By Alex McKay (ed), London: RoutledgeCurzon (2003) p640-1,643 Christian missionaries banned&lt;/ref&gt;

Three UN resolutions of 1959, 1961, and 1965 condemned human rights violation in Tibet. These resolutions were passed at a time when the PRC was not [[China and the United Nations|permitted to become a member]] and of course was not allowed to present its singular version of events in the region (however, the Republic of China on Taiwan, which the PRC also tries to claim sovereignty over, was a member of the UN at the time, and it equally claimed sovereignty over Tibet and opposed Tibetan self-determination). Professor and sinologist [[A. Tom Grunfeld]] called the resolutions impractical and justified the PRC in ignoring them.&lt;ref&gt;Grunfeld, 1996, p180&lt;/ref&gt;

Grunfeld questioned Human Rights Watch reports on human rights abuses in Tibet, saying they distorted the big picture.&lt;ref name=Gru&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/2821 |title=''Reassessing Tibet Policy'' by Tom Gunfeld |access-date=2008-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224030617/http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/2821 |archive-date=2008-02-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Barnett, since Western powers and especially the United States used the Tibet issue in the 1950s and 1960s for cold war political purposes, the PRC is now able to get support from developing countries in defeating the last nine attempts at the United Nations to criticize China.  Barnett writes that the position of the Chinese in Tibet would be more accurately characterized as a colonial occupation, and that such an approach might cause developing nations to be more supportive of the Tibetan cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/weai/documents/LEHMN2b.pdf Passages extracted by Robert Barnett from Steve Lehman, ''The Tibetans: Struggle to Survive'', Umbrage Editions, New York, 1998. pdf p.9]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government ignores the issue of its alleged violations of Tibetan human rights, and prefers to argue that the invasion was about territorial integrity and unity of the State.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-04/12/content_6612118.htm Retrieved on 12 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Tibetan activists inside Tibet have until recently focused on independence, not human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/weai/documents/LEHMN2b.pdf Passages extracted by Robert Barnett from Steve Lehman, ''The Tibetans: Struggle to Survive'', Umbrage Editions, New York, 1998. pdf p.13]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders of the [[Tibetan Youth Congress]] which claims 30,000 over members &lt;ref name=chi&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-04/11/content_6608921.htm '''[[Tibetan Youth Congress]]' is pure terrorist organization'' Retrieved on 13 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; are alleged by China to advocate violence.  In 1998, Barnett wrote that India's military includes 10,000 Tibetans, causing China some unease; and that "at least seven bombs exploded in Tibet between 1995 and 1997, one of them laid by a monk, and a significant number of individual Tibetans are known to be actively seeking the taking up of arms; hundreds of Chinese soldiers and police have been beaten during demonstrations in Tibet, and at least one killed in cold blood, probably several more."&lt;ref name=leh/&gt;

Chinadaily.com reported on the discovery of weapons subsequent to the protests by peaceful Buddhists monks on March 14, 2008: "Police in Lhasa seized more than 100 guns, tens of thousands of bullets, several thousand kilograms of explosives and tens of thousands of detonators, acting on reports from lamas and ordinary people."&lt;ref name=chi/&gt;

And on 23 March 2008, there was a bombing incident in the Qambo prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-04/12/content_7966393.htm''Police crack bombing at Tibetan township government building'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-determination ===
While the earliest ROC constitutional documents already claim Tibet as part of China, Chinese political leaders also acknowledged the principle of [[self-determination]]. For example, at a party conference in 1924, [[Kuomintang]] leader [[Sun Yat-sen]] issued a statement calling for the right of self-determination of all Chinese ethnic groups: "''The Kuomintang can state with solemnity that it recognizes the right of self-determination of all national minorities in China and it will organize a free and united Chinese republic.''"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from ''National and Minority Policies, The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science: Report of China 277'', 1951, pp148-149&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]] issued a [[constitution]] for the short-lived [[Chinese Soviet Republic]] which states that Tibetans and other ethnic minorities, "may either join the Union of Chinese Soviets or secede from it."&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, C., Schwartz, B. and Fairbank, John K. (ed.), ''A Documentary History of Chinese Communism'', 1960, pp223-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="revo"&gt;[http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv2n1/aiprf.htm "Report on the International Seminar on the Nationality Question"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that China was in a state of civil war at the time and that the "Chinese Soviets" only represents a faction. Saying that Tibet may secede from the "Chinese Soviets" does not mean that it can secede from China. The quote above is merely a statement of Tibetans' freedom to choose their political orientation. The possibility of complete secession was denied by Communist leader [[Mao Zedong]] in 1938: "They must have the right to self-determination and at the same time they should continue to unite with the Chinese people to form one nation".&lt;ref name="revo"/&gt; This policy was codified in [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|PRC's first constitution]] which, in Article 3, reaffirmed China as a "''single'' [[multi-national state]]," while the "national ''autonomous areas'' are inalienable parts".&lt;ref name="revo"/&gt; The Chinese government insists that the [[United Nations]] [[Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples|documents]], which codifies the principle of self-determination, provides that the principle shall not be abused in disrupting [[territorial integrity]]: "Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations...."&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:UN General Assembly Resolution 1514|United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legitimacy ===
The PRC also points to what it claims are the [[autocracy|autocratic]], [[oppression|oppressive]] and [[theocracy|theocratic]] policies of the government of Tibet before 1959, its toleration of existence of serfdom and slaves,&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; its so-called "renunciation" of ([[Arunachal Pradesh]]) and its association with India and other foreign countries, and as such claims the Government of Tibet in Exile has no legitimacy to govern Tibet and no [[credibility]] or justification in criticizing PRC's policies.

China claims that the People's Liberation Army's march into Tibet in 1951 was "not without the support of a handful of Tibetan people", including the 10th [[Panchen Lama]]. [[Ian Buruma]] writes:

{{quote|...It is often forgotten that many Tibetans, especially educated people in the larger towns, were so keen to modernize their society in the mid-20th century that they saw the Chinese communists as allies against rule by monks and serf-owning landlords. The Dalai Lama himself, in the early 1950s, was impressed by Chinese reforms and wrote poems praising Chairman Mao.&lt;ref name=Buruma /&gt;}}

Instances have been documented when the PRC government gained support from a portion of the Tibetan population, including monastic leaders,&lt;ref name=mgoldstein&gt;Goldstein, Melvyn C., "''A history of modern Tibet''", pp683-687&lt;/ref&gt; monks,&lt;ref&gt;Ford, R. W., "''Wind between the Worlds''", p178, saying: ' ''There was no sacking of monasteries at this time. On the contrary, the Chinese took great care not to cause offense through ignorance. They soon had the monks thanking the gods for their deliverance.'' '&lt;/ref&gt; nobility&lt;ref name=grufeld115&gt;Grunfeld, A.T., "''The Making of Modern Tibet''", p115, saying: ' ''By most accounts there were some Tibetans who were pleased to see the Han in Tibet.

When Tibet complained to the United Nations through [[El Salvador]] about Chinese invasion in November 1950—after China captured [[Chamdo]] (or Qamdo) when Tibet failed to respond by the deadline to China's demand for negotiation--&lt;ref&gt;[http://rss.xinhuanet.com/newsc/english/2008-04/16/content_7987732.htm ''Tell you a true Tibet -- Peaceful Liberation of Tibet'']{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; members debated about it but refused to admit the "Tibet Question" into the agenda of the U.N. General Assembly. Key stakeholder India told the General Assembly that "the [[Peking]] Government had declared that it had not abandoned its intention to settle the difficulties by peaceful means", and that "the Indian Government ''was certain'' that the Tibet Question could still be settled by peaceful means".  The Russian delegate said that "China's sovereignty over Tibet had been recognized for a long time by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the U.S.S.R." The United Nations postponed this matter on the pretext Tibet was officially an "autonomous nationality region belonging to territorial China", and because the outlook of peaceful settlement seemed good.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State'' by Melvyn C.

Subsequently, ''The Agreement Between the Central Government and the Local Government of Tibet on Method for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet'', also known as [[Seventeen Point Agreement|Seventeen-Point Agreement]], was signed between delegates of China and Tibet on 23 May 1951. The Dalai Lama,despite the massive Chinese military presence, had ample time and opportunity to repudiate and denounce the Seventeen-Point Agreement. He was encouraged and instigated to do so with promise of public but not military support by the US, which by now had become hostile to Communist-ruled China.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State'' by Melvyn Goldstein, Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press(1989), p761-769,784-812&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, the 10th Panchen Erdeni (i.e. 10th Panchen Lama) and the Panchen Kampus Assembly made a formal statement, expressing their heartfelt support for the agreement. The statement indicated their resolution to guarantee the correct implementation of the agreement and to realize solidarity between the different ethnic groups of China and ethnic solidarity among the Tibetans; and on May 30, the 10th Panchen Erdeni telegrammed the 14th Dalai Lama, expressing his hope for unity and his vow to support the 14th Dalai Lama and the government of Tibet with the implementation of the agreement under the guidance of the Central Government and Chairman Mao.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rss.xinhuanet.com/newsc/english/2008-04/16/content_7987757.htm ''Signing of the Agreement on Methods for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet'']{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on 25 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agreement was finally accepted by Tibet's National Assembly, which then advised the Dalai Lama to accept it. Finally, on 24 October 1951, the Dalai Lama dispatched a telegram to [[Mao Zedong]]:

{{quote|The Tibet Local Government as well as the ecclesiastic and secular People unanimously support this agreement, and under the leadership of [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] and the Central People's Government, will actively support the People's Liberation Army in Tibet to consolidate defence, drive out imperialist influences from Tibet and safeguard the unification of the territory and sovereignty of the Motherland.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Tibet: Volume III The Modern Period: 1895-1959'' edited by Alex McKay, London and New York: Routledge Curzon (2003), p.603&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 28 October 1951, the Panchen Rinpoche [i.e. [[Panchen Lama]]] made a similar public statement accepting the agreement. He urged the "people of [[Shigatse]] to give active support" to carrying out the agreement.&lt;ref name="Tibet 2003 p.604"&gt;''The History of Tibet: Volume III The Modern Period: 1895-1959'' edited by Alex McKay, London and New York: Routledge Curzon (2003), p.604&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsering Shakya writes about the general acceptance of the Tibetans toward the Seventeen-Point Agreement, and its legal significance:

{{quote|The most vocal supporters of the agreement came from the monastic community...As a result many Tibetans were willing to accept the agreement....Finally there were strong factions in Tibet who felt that the agreement was acceptable...this section was led by the religious community...In the Tibetans' view their independence was not a question of international legal status, but as Dawa Norbu  writes, "Our sense of independence was based on the independence of our way of life and culture, which was more real to the unlettered masses than law or history, canons by which the non-Tibetans decide the fate of Tibet...This was the first formal agreement between Tibet and Communist China and it established the legal basis for Chinese rule in Tibet." &lt;ref name="Tibet 2003 p.604"/&gt;}}

On March 28, 1959, premier Zhou Enlai signed the order of the PRC State Council on the uprising in Tibet, falsely accusing the Tibetan government of disrupting the Agreement. (see,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savetibet.ru/2010/03/10/tibet_book.html Kuzmin, S.L. 2011. Hidden Tibet: History of Independence and Occupation. Dharamsala: LTWA, p. 239-240]&lt;/ref&gt; for review). The creation of the TAR finally buried the Agreement that was discarded back in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Shakya, Ts. 1999. The Dragon in the Land of Snows. A History of Modern Tibet Since 1947. London: Pimlico, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 1959, the Dalai Lama published a statement in Tezpur, India, that gave his reasons for escaping to India. He pointed out that the 17 Point Agreement was signed under compulsion; later the Chinese side permanently violated it. According to Michael Van Walt Van Praag, "treaties and similar agreements concluded under the use or threat of force are invalid under international law ab initio".&lt;ref&gt;Walt Van Praag, Michael C. van, The Status of Tibet: History, Rights and Prospects in International Law. Westview, 1987, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this Agreement is not considered legal by those who consider Tibet to have been an independent state before its signing; but it is considered legal by those who oppose Tibet's independence. In either case the PRC did not abide by the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. 2006. The Tibetans. London: Blackwell, pp. 280-290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Commission of Jurists, The Question of Tibet and the Rule of Law. Feb. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="96362">The [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] was a process in which the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was broken up into constituent republics, and over the course of which the [[Yugoslav wars]] started. The process generally began with the death of [[Josip Broz Tito]] on 4 May 1980 and formally ended when the last two remaining republics ([[SR Serbia]] and [[SR Montenegro]]) proclaimed the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] on 27 April 1992. At that time the Yugoslav wars were still ongoing, and FR Yugoslavia continued to exist until 2003, when it was renamed and reformed as the state union of [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. This union lasted until 5 June 2006 when [[Montenegro]] proclaimed independence. The former Yugoslav autonomous province of [[Kosovo]] subsequently proclaimed independence from Serbia in February 2008.

     {{Voting}}

'''Voter segments in political polling''' in the United States consist of '''all adults''', '''registered voters''', and '''likely voters'''.

==Definitions==
Political opinion polling in the United States usually surveys one of three population segments. 
* '''All adults''' are polls in which all Americans age 18 and older have been surveyed. These polls represent the aggregate opinion of all United States residents, regardless of voting eligibility or intent.&lt;ref name="gal1"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the difference between registered voters and likely voters?|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/110287/what-difference-between-registered-voters-likely-voters.aspx|website=Gallup|publisher=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|accessdate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aapor"/&gt; 
* '''Registered voters''' are polls in which only Americans who are [[voting registration|registered to vote]] are surveyed. These polls represent the aggregate opinion only of citizens who would be legally able to cast a vote if the election were held on the day the poll was taken and, therefore, necessarily exclude non-citizen residents and, in many jurisdictions, the mentally ill and convicted felons.&lt;ref name="gal1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aapor"/&gt; 
* '''Likely voters''' are polls in which only Americans who are (a) registered voters, and who, (b) have indicated a high intent of actually voting in the next election, are surveyed.&lt;ref name="gal1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aapor"/&gt;

==Relative values==
According to the [[American Association for Public Opinion Research]], "there is a consensus in the polling community that it is better to report 'likely' voters than '[[Registered Voter|registered]]' voters".&lt;ref name="aapor"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/Election-Polling-Resources/Likely-Voters.aspx|title=Likely Voters|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[American Association for Public Opinion Research]]|access-date=|quote=There is a consensus in the polling community that it is better to report "likely" voters than "registered" voters, especially as Election Day approaches.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting on a Pew study, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' has noted that polls of "likely voters" represent the "Holy Grail of polling" and are most likely to accurately reflect the outcome of an election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clement|first1=Scott|title=Why the 'likely voter' is the holy grail of polling|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/07/why-the-likely-voter-is-the-holy-grail-of-polling/|accessdate=February 6, 2017|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of 2010 polling by [[Five Thirty Eight]] concluded that polls of "registered voters" that year tended to favor [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates by a factor of five percentage points over the actual results of the election, while polls of "likely voters" tended to favor [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates by a factor of one percentage point over the actual results of the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Registered Voter Polls Will (Usually) Overrate Democrats|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/registered-voter-polls-will-usually-overrate-democrats/|accessdate=February 6, 2017|work=[[Five Thirty Eight]]|date=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' this is because registered voters who are least likely to actually cast a ballot tend to be low-income voters, or persons living in urban areas, which are constituencies that tend to favor Democratic candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Differences Between Registered And Likely Voter Polls Didn’t Affect Fall Trends In 2014 Senate Forecast|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/15/senate-polls_n_6327394.html|accessdate=December 15, 2014|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 study by the [[Pew Research Center]] found that registered voters tend to lean more to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] than to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], stating that "For those individuals identified as registered to vote by state governments, the voter file has a score (ranging from 0 to 100) describing their likelihood of voting for Democrats or Republicans, with higher numbers indicating a preference for Democrats. According to the full voter file, 55% of all registered voters in the U.S. are likely Democrats and 33% are likely Republicans." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/2018/10/09/the-rbs-poll-comports-well-with-data-from-the-full-voter-file-about-the-partisanship-of-registered-voters/|title=The RBS poll comports well with data from the full voter file about the partisanship of registered voters|last1=Kennedy|first1=Courtney|last2=Hatley|first2=Nick|last3=Keeter|first3=Scott|last4=Mercer|first4=Andrew|last5=Igeilnik|first5=Ruth|last6=Traylor|first6=Frederic|work=[[Pew Research Center]]|date=October 9, 2018|accessdate=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods for identifying "likely voters"==
Polls targeting "likely voters" generally begin with a list of known registered voters and then ask respondents a series of screening questions before the survey is conducted. Often this can simply be "are you going to vote on Election Day?" with respondents who answer "yes" to the question being included in the survey's final results, and those who answer "no" being excluded.&lt;ref name="gal2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newport|first1=Frank|title=How Do You Define "Likely Voters"?|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/4636/how-define-likely-voters.aspx|website=Gallup|publisher=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|accessdate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, complex formulas that account for a variety of demographic and psychographic variables are applied.&lt;ref name="gal2"/&gt;
