[[File:Kaskaskia Island 1993 flooding.jpg|thumb|[[Mississippi River]] at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]] during the [[Great Flood of 1993]].]]
A '''one-hundred-year flood''' is a [[flood]] event that has a 1% probability of occurring in any given year.

The 100-year flood is also referred to as the 1% flood, since its annual exceedance probability is 1%.&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;Holmes, R.R., Jr., and Dinicola, K. (2010) ''100-Year flood–it's all about chance '' [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/106/ U.S. Geological Survey General Information Product 106]&lt;/ref&gt;  For river systems, the 100-year flood is generally expressed as a flowrate.   Based on the expected 100-year flood flow rate, the flood [[water]] level can be mapped as an area of inundation.  The resulting [[floodplain]] map is referred to as the 100-year floodplain.  Estimates of the 100-year flood flowrate and other streamflow statistics for any stream in the United States are available.&lt;ref name="Ries"&gt;Ries, K.G., and others (2008) ''StreamStats: A water resources web application '' [http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2008/3067/ U.S. Geological Survey, Fact Sheet 2008-3067]  [http://water.usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/ Application home page] URL accessed 2015-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK The [[Environment Agency]] publishes a comprehensive map of all areas at risk of a 1 in 100 year flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?x=460730.0&amp;y=189442.0&amp;topic=floodmap&amp;ep=map&amp;scale=9&amp;location=OX10%200AJ&amp;lang=_e&amp;layerGroups=default&amp;distance=&amp;textonly=off|publisher=[[Environment Agency]]|title=Flood Map for Planning (Rivers and Sea)|access-date=25 August 2016|date=2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916225532/http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?x=460730.0&amp;y=189442.0&amp;topic=floodmap&amp;ep=map&amp;scale=9&amp;location=OX10%200AJ&amp;lang=_e&amp;layerGroups=default&amp;distance=&amp;textonly=off|archive-date=2016-09-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas near the coast of an ocean or large lake also can be flooded by combinations of [[tide]], [[storm surge]], and [[wind wave|waves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coastal Flooding|url=https://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/pages/coastal_flooding/cf_overview.jsp|website=FloodSmart|publisher=National Flood Insurance Program|accessdate=7 March 2016|ref=NFIP coastal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308052549/https://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/pages/coastal_flooding/cf_overview.jsp|archive-date=2016-03-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maps of the riverine or coastal 100-year floodplain may figure importantly in building permits, environmental regulations, and [[flood insurance]].

==Probability==
A common misunderstanding is that a 100-year flood is likely to occur only once in a 100-year period.  In fact, there is approximately a 63.4% chance of one or more 100-year floods occurring in any 100-year period. On the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany, the actual intervals between 100-year floods during 1501 to 2013 ranged from 37 to 192 years.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"&gt;Eychaner, J.H. (2015) ''Lessons from a 500-year record of flood elevations  '' [http://www.floods.org/ace-files/documentlibrary/publications/asfpmpubs-techrep7_2015.pdf Association of State Floodplain Managers, Technical Report 7] URL accessed 2015-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The probability '''P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''' that one or more floods occurring during any period will exceed a given flood threshold can be expressed, using the [[binomial distribution]], as

&lt;math&gt;P_{e}=1-\left[ 1-\left( \frac{1}{T} \right) \right]^{n}&lt;/math&gt;

where  '''T''' is the threshold [[return period]] (e.g. 100-yr, 50-yr, 25-yr, and so forth), and '''n''' is the number of years in the period. The [[probability of exceedance]] '''P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''' is also described as the natural, inherent, or hydrologic risk of failure.&lt;ref name="Mays"&gt;Mays, L.W (2005) ''Water Resources Engineering, chapter 10, Probability, risk, and uncertainty analysis for hydrologic and hydraulic design'' Hoboken: J. Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maidment"&gt;Maidment, D.R. ed.(1993) ''Handbook of Hydrology, chapter 18, Frequency analysis of extreme events''  New York: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[expected value]] of the number of 100-year floods occurring in any 100-year period is 1.

Ten-year floods have a 10% chance of occurring in any given year (P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; =0.10); 500-year have a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year (P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; =0.002); etc. The percent chance of an X-year flood occurring in a single year is 100/X. A similar analysis is commonly applied to [[coastal flood]]ing or rainfall data. The [[return period|recurrence interval]] of a storm is rarely identical to that of an associated riverine flood, because of rainfall timing and location variations among different [[drainage basin]]s.

The field of [[extreme value theory]] was created to model rare events such as 100-year floods for the purposes of civil engineering.  This theory is most commonly applied to the maximum or minimum observed stream flows of a given river. In desert areas where there are only ephemeral washes, this method is applied to the maximum observed rainfall over a given period of time (24-hours, 6-hours, or 3-hours). The extreme value analysis only considers the most extreme event observed in a given year. So, between the large spring runoff and a heavy summer rain storm, whichever resulted in more runoff would be considered the extreme event, while the smaller event would be ignored in the analysis (even though both may have been capable of causing terrible flooding in their own right).

==Statistical assumptions==

There are a number of [[Statistical assumption|assumptions]] which are made to complete the analysis which determines the 100-year flood. First, the extreme events observed in each year must be [[statistical independence|independent]] from year-to-year. In other words, the maximum river flow rate from 1984 cannot be found to be [[Statistical significance|significantly]] [[correlation and dependence|correlated]] with the observed flow rate in 1985.  1985 cannot be correlated with 1986, and so forth. The second assumption is that the observed extreme events must come from the same [[probability distribution function]]. The third assumption is that the probability distribution relates to the largest storm (rainfall or river flow rate measurement) that occurs in any one year. The fourth assumption is that the probability distribution function is stationary, meaning that the [[mean]] (average), [[standard deviation]] and [[Minima and maxima (introduction)|max/min]] values are not increasing or decreasing over time.  This concept is referred to as [[Stationary process|stationarity]].&lt;ref name="Maidment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B17C"&gt;{{cite book |last1=England |first1=John |last2=and seven others |title=Guidelines for determining flood flow frequency—Bulletin 17C |date=29 March 2018 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/tm4B5 |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first assumption is often but not always valid and should be tested on a case by case basis. The second assumption is often valid if the extreme events are observed under similar climate conditions. For example, if the extreme events on record all come from late summer thunder storms (as is the case in the southwest U.S.), or from snow pack melting (as is the case in north-central U.S.), then this assumption should be valid. If, however, there are some extreme events taken from thunder storms, others from snow pack melting, and others from hurricanes, then this assumption is most likely not valid. The third assumption is only a problem when trying to forecast a low, but maximum flow event (for example, an event smaller than a 2-year flood). Since this is not typically a goal in extreme analysis, or in civil engineering design, then the situation rarely presents itself. The final assumption about stationarity is difficult to test from data for a single site because of the large uncertainties in even the longest flood records&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt; (see next section). More broadly, substantial evidence of [[climate change]] strongly suggests that the probability distribution is also changing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5863/573.full |work=Science Magazine |title=Stationarity is Dead |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=2008-02-01 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that managing flood risks in the future will become even more difficult.&lt;ref name=IPPC&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2012) ''Managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation,'' [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPMbrochure_FINAL.pdf Summary for policymakers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719211442/http://ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPMbrochure_FINAL.pdf |date=2015-07-19 }}  Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 19 p.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest implication of this is that not all of the historical data are, or can be, considered valid as input into the extreme event analysis.

==Probability uncertainty==

When these assumptions are violated there is an ''unknown'' amount of uncertainty introduced into the reported value of what the 100-year flood means in terms of rainfall intensity, or flood depth. When all of the inputs are known the uncertainty can be measured in the form of a confidence interval. For example, one might say there is a 95% chance that the 100-year flood is greater than X, but less than Y.&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;

Direct statistical analysis&lt;ref name="B17C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACWI"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bulletin 17C |url=https://acwi.gov/hydrology/Frequency/b17c/ |publisher=Advisory Committee on Water Information |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to estimate the 100-year riverine flood is possible only at the relatively few locations where an annual series of maximum instantaneous flood discharges has been recorded. In the United States as of 2014, taxpayers have supported such records for at least 60 years at fewer than 2,600 locations, for at least 90 years at fewer than 500, and for at least 120 years at only 11.&lt;ref name="NWIS"&gt;[http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis ''National Water Information System database''] U.S. Geological Survey. URL accessed 2014-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt;  For comparison, the total area of the nation is about {{convert|3,800,000|sqmi|km2}}, so there are perhaps 3,000 stream reaches that drain watersheds of {{convert|1,000|sqmi|km2}} and 300,000 reaches that drain {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}}. In urban areas, 100-year flood estimates are needed for watersheds as small as {{convert|1|sqmi|km2}}. For reaches without sufficient data for direct analysis, 100-year flood estimates are derived from [[regression analysis|indirect statistical analysis]] of flood records at other locations in a hydrologically similar region or from other [[Hydrology#Modeling|hydrologic models]]. Similarly for coastal floods, [[tide gauge]] data exist for only about 1,450 sites worldwide, of which only about 950 added information to the global data center between January 2010 and March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obtaining Tide Gauge Data|url=http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/|website=Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level|publisher=PSMSL|accessdate=7 March 2016|ref=PSMSL_data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Passau flood scale Sept 2012.JPG|thumb|High-water scale 1501-2002 at [[Passau|Passau, Germany]], as of September 2012]]
Much longer records of flood elevations exist at a few locations around the world, such as the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany,  but they must be evaluated carefully for accuracy and completeness before any statistical interpretation.

For an individual stream reach, the uncertainties in any analysis can be large, so 100-year flood estimates have large individual uncertainties for most stream reaches.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|24}}  For the largest recorded flood at any specific location, or any potentially larger event, the recurrence interval always is poorly known.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|20,24}}  Spatial variability adds more uncertainty, because a flood peak observed at different locations on the same stream during the same event commonly represents a different recurrence interval at each location.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|20}}  If an extreme storm drops enough rain on one branch of a river to cause a 100-year flood, but no rain falls over another branch, the flood wave downstream from their junction might have a recurrence interval of only 10 years. Conversely, a storm that produces a 25-year flood simultaneously in each branch might form a 100-year flood downstream. During a time of flooding, news accounts necessarily simplify the story by reporting the greatest damage and largest recurrence interval estimated at any location. The public can easily and incorrectly conclude that the recurrence interval applies to all stream reaches in the flood area.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|7,24}}

==Observed intervals between floods==
Peak elevations of 14 floods as early as 1501 on the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany, reveal great variability in the actual intervals between floods.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|16–19}}  Flood events greater than the 50-year flood occurred at intervals of 4 to 192 years since 1501, and the 50-year flood of 2002 was followed only 11 years later by a 500-year flood. Only half of the intervals between 50- and 100-year floods were within 50 percent of the nominal average interval. Similarly, the intervals between 5-year floods during 1955 to 2007 ranged from 5 months to 16 years, and only half  were within 2.5 to 7.5 years.
[[File:Passau flood history.svg|thumb|left|Observed intervals between floods at Passau, 1501-2013]]

==Regulatory use==
In the United States, the 100-year flood provides the risk basis for [[flood insurance]] rates. Complete information on the [[National Flood Insurance Program]] (NFIP) is available [http://www.floodsmart.gov/ here.] A ''regulatory flood'' or ''base flood'' is routinely established for river reaches through a science-based rule-making process targeted to a 100-year flood at the historical average recurrence interval. In addition to historical flood data, the process accounts for previously established regulatory values, the effects of flood-control reservoirs, and changes in land use in the watershed. [[Coastal flood]] hazards have been mapped by a similar approach that includes the relevant physical processes. Most areas where serious floods can occur in the United States have been mapped consistently in this manner. On average nationwide, those 100-year flood estimates are well sufficient for the purposes of the NFIP and offer reasonable estimates of future flood risk, if the future is like the past.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|24}} Approximately 3% of the U.S. population lives in areas subject to the 1% annual chance coastal flood hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crowell|first1=Mark|last2=others|title=An estimate of the U.S. population living in 100-year coastal flood hazard areas|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|date=2010|volume=26|issue=2|pages=201–211|doi=10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-09-00076.1|url=http://www.floods.org/PDF/JCR_Est_US_Pop_100y_CFHA_2010.pdf|accessdate=6 March 2016|ref=Crowell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, removing homes and businesses from areas that flood repeatedly can protect people and reduce insurance losses, but in practice it is difficult for people to retreat from established neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="schwartz"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=Jen |title=Surrendering to rising seas |journal=Scientific American |date=1 August 2018 |volume=319 |issue=2 |pages=44-55 |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/surrendering-to-rising-seas/ |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adolf Dygasiński''' (March 7, 1839, [[Niegosławice, Pińczów County|Niegosławice]]–June 3, 1902, [[Grodzisk Mazowiecki]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] novelist, publicist and educator. In [[Polish literature]], he was one of the leading representatives of [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]]. 
==Life==
During his literary career, Dygasiński wrote forty-two short stories and novels. 
Since 1884 his works were being published in book-form and enjoyed considerable success. 
They were translated into Russian and German. 
In 1891, Dygasiński went on a trip to Brazil on a trail of Polish emigrants from [[Partitioned Poland]]. 
He produced a series of letters describing the tragic fate of Polish emigrees in South America. In the following years Dygasiński maintained a position of a tutor and coach for numerous wealthy landowning families. Late in life he settled in [[Warsaw]], where he died on June 6, 1902, and was buried at the local [[Powązkowski Cemetery]].

==Works== 
In his work Dygasiński often focused on topics of rural life and residents of small towns, highlighting the common fate of both, human and animal communities. Some of his most important work include: 

*Wilk, psy i ludzie (Wolf, dogs and humans; 1883) 
*Ogólne zasady pedagogiki dotyczące wykształcenia umysłu, uczuć, moralności i religijności (General principles of teaching in the education of mind, emotions, morality, and religion; 1883)

First, the predators approach their potential prey. Predators bite or try to swallow the hagfishes, but the hagfishes have already projected jets of slime (arrows) into the predators' mouths. Choking, the predators release the hagfishes and gag in an attempt to remove slime from their mouths and gill chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zintzen | first1=Vincent | last2=Roberts | first2=Clive D. | last3=Anderson | first3=Marti J. | last4=Stewart | first4=Andrew L. | last5=Struthers | first5=Carl D. | last6=Harvey | first6=Euan S. | title=Hagfish Slime as a Defense Mechanism against Gill-breathing Predators | journal=Scientific Reports | volume=1 | page=2011 | doi=10.1038/srep00131| year=2011 | bibcode=2011NatSR...1E.131Z | pmid=22355648 | pmc=3216612}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Anti-predator adaptations''' are mechanisms developed through [[evolution]] that assist [[prey]] organisms in their constant struggle against [[predator]]s. Throughout the animal kingdom, adaptations have evolved for every stage of this struggle, namely by avoiding detection, warding off attack, fighting back, or escaping when caught.

The first line of defence consists in avoiding detection, through mechanisms such as [[camouflage]], [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerade]], [[apostatic selection]], living underground, or [[nocturnal]]ity. 

Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, whether by advertising the presence of strong defences in [[aposematism]], by [[mimicry|mimicking]] animals which do possess such defences, by [[deimatic behaviour|startling]] the attacker, by [[signalling theory|signalling to the predator]] that pursuit is not worthwhile, by [[distraction display|distraction]], by using defensive structures such as spines, and by [[social animal|living in a group]]. Members of groups are at [[selfish herd theory|reduced risk of predation]], despite the increased conspicuousness of a group, through improved vigilance, predator confusion, and the likelihood that the predator will attack some other individual.

Some prey species are capable of fighting back against predators, whether [[autohaemorrhaging|with chemicals]], through [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|communal defence]], or by ejecting noxious materials. Many animals can escape by fleeing rapidly, outrunning or outmanoeuvring their attacker. 

Finally, some species are able to escape even when caught by [[autotomy|sacrificing certain body parts]]: crabs can shed a claw, while lizards can shed their tails, often distracting predators long enough to permit the prey to escape.

===Staying out of sight===
{{main article|Nocturnality}}
[[File:Seychelles Fruit Bat - Pteropus seychellensis.jpg|thumb|[[Fruit bat]]s forage [[nocturnality|by night]] to avoid predators.]]

Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether [[Troglobite|in caves]], [[Fossorial|underground]], or by being [[nocturnality|nocturnal]].&lt;ref name=Sherbrooke117/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cott, H.B. |date=1940 |title=Adaptive Coloration in Animals |publisher=Methuen |location=London |pages=330–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duverge, P.L. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duverge | first1=P.L. | last2=Jones | first2=G | last3=Rydell | first3=J. | last4=Ransome | first4=R. | date=2000 | title=Functional significance of emergence timing in bats | journal=Ecography | volume=23 | pages=32–40 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0587.2000.tb00258.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daly M. 1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Daly | first1=M. | last2=Behrends | first2=P.R. | last3=Wilson | first3=M. | last4=Jacobs | first4=L. | date=1992 | title=Behavioural modulation of predation risk: moonlight avoidance and crepuscular compensation in a nocturnal desert rodent, Dipodomys merriami | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=44 | pages=1–9 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80748-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called [[crypsis]] used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating [[bats]]. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from [[bat hawk]]s and [[bat falcon]]s. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.&lt;ref name="Duverge, P.L. 2000"/&gt;
Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in [[kangaroo rat]]s, which avoid moonlight. They forage in relatively open habitats and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.&lt;ref name="Daly M. 1992"/&gt;

[[File:Phrynosoma mcallii.jpg|thumb|right|[[Camouflage]] illustrated by the [[flat-tail horned lizard]], its flattened, fringed and [[disruptively patterned]] body eliminating shadow]]

===Camouflage===
{{main article|Camouflage}}

[[Camouflage]] uses any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, [[disruptive coloration]], shadow elimination by [[countershading]] or [[counter-illumination]], self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and colour.{{sfn|Cott|1940}}{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=35–60}} Animals such as the [[flat-tail horned lizard]] of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and blend in with the ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. In addition, these lizards hide any remaining shadows by pressing their bodies to the ground.&lt;ref name=Sherbrooke117&gt;{{cite book | author=Sherbrooke, W. C. |date=2003 | title=Introduction to horned lizards of North America | publisher=University of California Press |pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masquerade===
[[File:Kallima inachus qtl1.jpg|thumb|''[[Kallima inachus]]'' [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerading]] as a dead leaf]]

Animals can hide in plain sight by [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerading]] as inedible objects. For example, the [[potoo]], a South American bird, habitually perches on a tree, convincingly resembling a broken stump of a branch,{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=53–55}} while a butterfly, ''[[Kallima]]'', looks just like a dead leaf.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=318–320}}

===Apostatic selection===

Another way to remain unattacked in plain sight is to look different from other members of the same species. Predators such as [[Parus|tits]] selectively hunt for abundant types of insect, ignoring less common types that were present, forming [[search image]]s of the desired prey. This creates a mechanism for negative [[frequency-dependent selection]], [[apostatic selection]].{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=61–65}}

==Warding off attack==
[[File:Gottesanbeterin Abwehr.JPG|thumb|A Mediterranean [[mantis]], ''[[Iris oratoria]]'', attempting to startle a predator with [[deimatic behaviour]]]]

Many species make use of behavioral strategies to deter predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper |first1=William E |title=Antipredatory Behavior |url=http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/antipredatory_behavior_1/story.htm |website=IDEA |publisher=University of California, Riverside |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Startling the predator===
{{main article|Deimatic behaviour}}

Many weakly-defended animals, including [[moth]]s, [[butterflies]], [[Mantidae|mantises]], [[Phasmidae|phasmids]], and [[cephalopods]] such as octopuses, make use of patterns of threatening or [[deimatic behaviour|startling behaviour]], such as suddenly displaying conspicuous [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]], so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape. In the absence of toxins or other defences, this is essentially bluffing, in contrast to aposematism which involves honest signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1464793105006810 |author=Stevens, Martin |authorlink=Martin Stevens (biologist) |title=The role of eyespots as anti-predator mechanisms, principally demonstrated in the Lepidoptera |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=80 |issue=4 |date=2005 |pages=573–588 |pmid=16221330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/86053.html | title=Deimatic Behavior | publisher=Springer | date=2012 | accessdate=31 December 2012 | author=Edmunds, Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.conchsoc.org/node/6014 | title=Octopus vulgaris.

===Pursuit-deterrent signals===
{{further information|Signalling theory}}
[[File:Stotting gazelle.jpg|thumb|An [[impala]] [[stotting]], [[signalling honestly]] to the predator that the chase will be unprofitable]]

Pursuit-deterrent signals are behavioral signals used by prey that convince predators not to pursue them. For example, [[gazelle]]s [[stotting|stot]], jumping high with stiff legs and an arched back. This is thought to signal to predators that they have a high level of fitness and can outrun the predator. As a result, predators may choose to pursue a different prey that is less likely to outrun them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caro, T. M. |authorlink=Tim Caro |date=1986 |title=The functions of stotting in Thomson's gazelles: Some tests of the predictions |journal=Animal Behaviour |issue=3 |pages=663–684 |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(86)80052-5 |volume=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[White-tailed deer]] and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous (often black and white) tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bildstein |first1=Keith L. |title=Why White-Tailed Deer Flag Their Tails |journal=The American Naturalist |date=May 1983 |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=709–715 |doi=10.1086/284096 |jstor=2460873}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Warning calls given by birds such as the [[Eurasian jay]] are similarly [[honest signal]]s, benefiting both predator and prey: the predator is informed that it has been detected and might as well save time and energy by giving up the chase, while the prey is protected from attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bergstrom |first=C. T. |last2=Lachmann |first2=M. |year=2001 |title=Alarm calls as costly signals of antipredator vigilance: the watchful babbler game |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=535–543 |doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Getty |first=T. |year=2002 |title=The discriminating babbler meets the optimal diet hawk |journal=Anim. Behav. |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=397H. Carl 402 |doi=10.1006/anbe.2001.1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Playing dead===
{{main article|apparent death}}
[[File:Heterodon platirhinos 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eastern hog-nosed snake]] [[Apparent death|playing dead]]]]

Another pursuit-deterrent signal is [[apparent death|thanatosis or playing dead]]. Thanatosis is a form of bluff in which an animal mimics its own dead body, [[deception|feigning]] death to avoid being attacked by predators seeking live prey. Thanatosis can also be used by the predator in order to lure prey into approaching.&lt;ref name=Pasteur&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pasteur | first1=G | date=1982 | title=A classificatory review of mimicry systems | url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=13 | pages=169–199 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of this is seen in white-tailed deer fawns, which experience a drop in heart rate in response to approaching predators. This response, referred to as "alarm bradycardia", causes the fawn's heart rate to drop from 155 to 38 beats per minute within one beat of the heart. This drop in heart rate can last up to two minutes, causing the fawn to experience a depressed breathing rate and decrease in movement, called tonic immobility. Tonic immobility is a reflex response that causes the fawn to enter a low body position that simulates the position of a dead corpse. Upon discovery of the fawn, the predator loses interest in the "dead" prey. Other symptoms of alarm bradycardia, such as salivation, urination, and defecation, can also cause the predator to lose interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Alboni | first1=Paolo | last2=Alboni | first2=Marco | last3=Bertorelle | first3=Giorgio | date=2008 | title=The origin of vasovagal syncope: to protect the heart or to escape predation? | journal=Clinical Autonomic Research | volume=18 | issue=4| pages=170–8 | doi=10.1007/s10286-008-0479-7| pmid=18592129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distraction===

{{main article|phagomimicry|distraction display}}

Marine [[mollusc]]s such as [[sea hare]]s, [[cuttlefish]], [[squid]] and [[octopus]]es give themselves a last chance to escape by distracting their attackers. To do this, they eject a mixture of chemicals, which may [[phagomimicry|mimic food]] or otherwise confuse predators.&lt;ref name="Mason 2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/2005/03/sea-hares-lose-their-lunch |title=Sea Hares Lose Their Lunch |author=Inman, Mason |date=29 March 2005 |website=Sciencemag.org |accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Derby&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Derby |first1=Charles D. |title=Escape by Inking and Secreting: Marine Molluscs Avoid Predators Through a Rich Array of Chemicals and Mechanisms |journal=The Biological Bulletin |date=December 2007 |volume=213 |issue=3 |pages=274–289 |doi=10.2307/25066645|jstor=25066645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a predator, animals in these groups release [[cephalopod ink|ink]], creating a cloud, and opaline, affecting the predator's feeding senses, causing it to attack the cloud.&lt;ref name="Mason 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Derby, Kicklighter et al (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115142409/http://www2.gsu.edu/~biocdd/Publications/Reprints/2007/Derby%20et%20al%20joun%20chem%20eco%202007.pdf |archivedate=15 November 2009 |url=https://www2.gsu.edu/~biocdd/Publications/Reprints/2007/Derby%20et%20al%20joun%20chem%20eco%202007.pdf |title=Chemical Composition of Inks of Diverse Marine Molluscs Suggests Convergent Chemical Defenses |author=Derby, Charles D. |author2=Kicklighter, Cynthia E. |author3=Johnson,  P.

===Mimicry and aposematism===
{{main article|mimicry|aposematism}}
[[File:BatesMimButter.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|left|alt=Viceroy and monarch butterflies illustrate Müllerian mimicry|[[Viceroy butterfly|Viceroy]] and [[monarch butterfly|monarch]] are [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian mimics]], similar in appearance, unpalatable to predators.]]

[[Mimicry]] occurs when an organism (the mimic) simulates signal properties of another organism (the model) to confuse a third organism. This results in the mimic gaining protection, food, and mating advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Endler, J. A. |title=An overview of the relationships between mimicry and crypsis |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |date=1981 |volume=16 |pages=25–31 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1981.tb01840.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and Müllerian. Both involve [[aposematic]] [[animal coloration|coloration]]&lt;!--this means a pattern of more than one color--&gt;, or warning signals, to avoid being attacked by a predator.&lt;ref name=HolmgrenEnquist/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ritland1/&gt;

In [[Batesian mimicry]], a palatable, harmless prey species mimics the appearance of another species that is noxious to predators, thus reducing the mimic's risk of attack.&lt;ref name=HolmgrenEnquist&gt;{{cite journal | author=Holmgren, H. | author2=Enquist, M. | title=Dynamics of mimicry evolution | journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | date=1999 | volume=66  | pages=145–158 | doi=10.1006/bijl.1998.0269}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of mimicry is seen in many [[insect]]s. The idea behind Batesian mimicry is that predators that have tried to eat the unpalatable species learn to associate its colors and markings with an unpleasant taste.

[[File:Erethizon dorsatum du Québec.jpg|thumb|The porcupine ''[[Erethizon dorsatum]]'' combines sharp [[spine (zoology)|spines]] with [[warning coloration]]]]

===Defensive structures===

Many animals are protected against predators with armour in the form of hard shells (such as most [[mollusc]]s), leathery or scaly skin (as in [[reptile]]s), or tough chitinous exoskeletons (as in [[arthropod]]s).{{sfn|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|page=198}}

A [[spine (zoology)|spine]] is a sharp, needle-like structure used to inflict pain on predators. An example of this seen in nature is in the [[Sohal surgeonfish]]. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine on the front of each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Craig. Scott, Susan. (1997). ''All Stings Considered''. University of Hawaii Press. pp. 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish.&lt;ref name="Vincent1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Vincent | first1=J. F.

[[File:Stinging Rose caterpillars, Megan McCarty65.jpg|thumb|upright|Stinging [[Limacodidae]] slug moth [[caterpillar]]s]]

Many species of slug caterpillar, [[Limacodidae]], have numerous protuberances and stinging spines along their dorsal surfaces.

==Safety in numbers==
{{further information|Social animal}}

Group living can decrease the risk of predation to the individual in a variety of ways,{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=202–207}} as described below.

===Dilution effect===

A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group "dilute" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] and [[W.D. Hamilton]] proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in [[Camargue horse]]s in Southern France. The [[horse-fly]] often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently.&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duncan | first1=P. | last2=Vigne | first2=N. | date=1979 | title=The effect of group size in horses on the rate of attacks by blood-sucking flies | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=27 | pages=623–625 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(79)90201-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water striders]] are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Foster | first1=W.A. | last2=Treherne | first2=J.E. | date=1981 | title=Evidence for the dilution effect in the selfish herd from fish predation on a marine insect | journal=Nature | volume=295 | pages=466–467 | doi=10.1038/293466a0| bibcode=1981Natur.293..466F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The selfish herd theory was proposed by [[W.D. Hamilton]] to explain why animals seek central positions in a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Hamilton | authorlink=W. D. Hamilton | first1=W. | title=Geometry for the selfish herd | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume=31 | issue=2 | pages=295–311 | date=1971 | pmid=5104951 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(71)90189-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory's central idea is to reduce the individual's domain of danger. A domain of danger is the area within the group in which the individual is more likely to be attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain of danger, so animals are predicted to strive constantly to gain this position. Testing Hamilton's selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O'Rainn (2010) studied [[brown fur seal]] predation from [[great white shark]]s. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between the decoys to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had an increased risk of shark attack.&lt;ref name="De Vos ORiain 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last=De Vos | first=A. | last2=O'Riain | first2=M.

===Predator satiation===
[[File:White cicada.jpg|thumb|left|A newly emerged [[Magicicada|periodical cicada]]: millions emerge at once, at long intervals, likely to [[predator satiation|satiate predators]].]]

{{main article|Predator satiation|Periodical cicada}}

A radical strategy for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill a large majority of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the [[periodical cicadas]], which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so [[predator satiation]] is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams, K.S. |author2=C.

[[File:Chlorocebus pygerythrus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chlorocebus pygerythrus|Vervet monkeys]] have different [[alarm signal]]s that warn of attacks by [[eagle]]s, [[leopard]]s and [[snake]]s.]]

===Alarm calls===

{{main article|Alarm signal}}

Animals that live in groups often give [[alarm signal|alarm calls]] that give warning of an attack. For example, [[vervet monkey]]s give different calls depending on the nature of the attack: for an [[eagle]], a disyllabic cough; for a [[leopard]] or other cat, a loud bark; for a [[python (genus)|python]] or other snake, a "chutter". The monkeys hearing these calls respond defensively, but differently in each case: to the eagle call, they look up and run into cover; to the leopard call, they run up into the trees; to the snake call, they stand on two legs and look around for snakes, and on seeing the snake, they sometimes mob it. Similar calls are found in other species of monkey, while birds also give different calls that elicit different responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard Smith|first1=John|author1link=John Maynard Smith|last2=Harper|first2=David|title=Animal Signals|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19852-685-8|pages=113–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improved vigilance===

[[File:Circus hudsonius Recurvirostra americana.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4&lt;!--width for low image--&gt;|A raptor, a [[Circus hudsonius|northern harrier]], chases up an alert flock of [[Recurvirostra americana|American avocets]].]]

In the improved vigilance effect, groups are able to detect predators sooner than solitary individuals.{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=115–149}} For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, [[Common wood pigeon|wood pigeon]] flocks are preyed upon by [[goshawk]]s. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, the more likely it is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(73)90184-7|pmid=4734745|author=Pulliam, H. R.|title=On the advantages of flocking|volume=38|year=1973|journal=J. Theor. Biol.|pages=419–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild [[ostrich]]es in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises its head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1016/S0003-3472(80)80030-3|title=Vigilance and group size in ostriches|journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=28|issue=1|pages=278–286|author=Bertram, Brian C. |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zebras Serengeti.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;|A single [[zebra]] is hard to catch amongst a herd.]]

===Predator confusion===

Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The [[zebra]] has been suggested by the zoologist [[Martin Stevens (biologist)|Martin Stevens]] and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering [[motion dazzle]] effect in the eye of the predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-9-81|title=Motion dazzle and camouflage as distinct anti-predator defenses|pmid=22117898 | volume=9|pmc=3257203|year=2011|journal=BMC Biol.|pages=81 | last1 = Stevens | first1 = M | last2 = Searle | first2 = WT | last3 = Seymour | first3 = JE | last4 = Marshall | first4 = KL | last5 = Ruxton | first5 = GD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fighting back==

Defensive structures such as spines may be used both to ward off attack as already mentioned, and if need be to fight back against a predator.&lt;ref name="Vincent1986"/&gt; Methods of fighting back include chemical defences,{{sfn|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|pages=64–69}} mobbing,&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt; defensive regurgitation,&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"/&gt; and suicidal altruism.&lt;ref name="Davidson, D.W. 2011"/&gt;

===Chemical defences===

Some prey animals are able to eject noxious materials to deter predators actively. The [[bombardier beetle]] has specialized glands on the tip of its abdomen that allows it to direct a toxic spray towards predators.

The slime glands along the body of the [[hagfish]] secrete enormous amounts of mucus when it is provoked or stressed. The gelatinous slime has dramatic effects on the flow and viscosity of water, rapidly clogging the gills of any fish that attempt to capture hagfish; predators typically release the hagfish within seconds ''(pictured above)''. Common predators of hagfish include seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans, but few fish, suggesting that predatory fish avoid hagfish as prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lim | first1=Jeanette | last2=Fudge | first2=Douglas F. | last3=Levy | first3=Nimrod | last4=Gosline | first4=John M. | date=2006 | title=Hagfish Slime Ecomechanics: testing the gill-clogging mechanics | journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume=209 |  pages=702–10 | doi=10.1242/jeb.02067 | pmid=16449564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communal defence===
{{further information|Mobbing (animal behavior)}}
[[File:MuskOxen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7&lt;!--size for very low image--&gt;|Group of [[muskox]]en in defensive formation, horns ready, and highly alert]]

In communal defence, prey groups actively defend themselves by grouping together, and sometimes by attacking or mobbing a predator, rather than allowing themselves to be passive victims of predation. [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|Mobbing]] is the harassing of a predator by many prey animals. Mobbing is usually done to protect the young in social colonies. For example, [[red colobus]] monkeys exhibit mobbing when threatened by [[chimpanzees]], a common predator. The male red colobus monkeys group together and place themselves between predators and the group's females and juveniles. The males jump together and actively bite the chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Stanford | first1=Craig B | title=The influence of chimpanzee predation on group size and anti-predator behavior in red colobus monkeys | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=49 | issue=3| pages=577–587 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)90033-0| year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fieldfares]] are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies.

===Defensive regurgitation===
[[File:Defensive Regurgitation.png|thumb|left|A [[northern fulmar]] chick protects itself with a jet of [[stomach oil]].]]

Some birds and insects use defensive regurgitation to ward off predators. The [[northern fulmar]] vomits a bright orange, oily substance called [[stomach oil]] when threatened.&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Warham | first1 = John | date = 1977|url=http://newzealandecology.org/nzje/2787.pdf | title = The Incidence, Functions and Ecological Significance of Petrel Stomach Oils | journal = New Zealand Ecological Society | volume = 24 | pages = 84–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading to the loss of flying ability and the loss of water repellency.&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"/&gt; This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from [[hypothermia]] when diving for food.&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"/&gt;

[[European roller]] chicks vomit a bright orange, foul smelling liquid when they sense danger. This repels prospective predators and may alert their parents to danger: they respond by delaying their return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Parejo | first1=D | last2=Avilés | first2=JM | last3=Peña | first3=A | last4=Sánchez | first4=L | last5=Ruano | first5=F | display-authors=etal  | date=2013 | title=Armed Rollers: Does Nestling's Vomit Function as a Defence against Predators? | journal=PLoS ONE | volume=8 | issue=7| page=e68862 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0068862 | pmid=23874791 | pmc=3707886| bibcode=2013PLoSO...868862P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autotomy===
{{main article|Autotomy}}
[[File:Lizard tail autotomy.JPG|thumb|[[Lizard]] tail [[autotomy]] can distract predators, continuing to writhe while the lizard makes its escape.]]

Some animals are capable of [[autotomy]] (self-amputation), shedding one of their own [[appendage]]s in a last-ditch attempt to elude a predator's grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. The lost body part may be [[regeneration (biology)|regenerated]] later. Certain [[sea slug]]s discard stinging papillae; arthropods such as [[crab]]s can sacrifice a claw, which can be regrown over several successive moults; among [[vertebrate]]s, many [[gecko]]s and other [[lizard]]s shed their tails when attacked: the tail goes on writhing for a while, distracting the predator, and giving the lizard time to escape; a smaller tail slowly regrows.{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=179–181}}

==History of observations==

[[Aristotle]] recorded observations (around 350 BC) of the antipredator behaviour of [[cephalopod]]s in his ''[[History of Animals]]'', including the use of ink as a distraction, camouflage, and signalling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |authorlink=Aristotle |title=The History of Animals |date=1910 |origyear=350 BC |volume=IX |pages=621b-622a |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/history_anim.9.ix.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, [[Hugh Cott]] wrote a compendious study of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism, ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]''.{{sfn|Cott|1940}}

A '''biogenic substance''' is a product made by or of life forms. The term encompasses constituents, secretions, and metabolites of [[plants]] or [[animal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biomedical Applications of Polymeric Materials and Composites|last1=Raju Francis|first1= D. |last2=Sakthi |first2=Kumar|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In context of [[molecular biology]], biogenic substances are referred to as [[biomolecule|biomolecules]]. 

==Examples==
*[[Coal]] and [[Petroleum|oil]] are possible examples of constituents which may have undergone changes over [[geologic time]] periods.
*[[Chalk]] and [[limestone]] are examples of secretions (marine [[animal shell]]s) which are of geologic age.
*[[grass]] and [[wood]] are biogenic constituents of contemporary origin.
*[[Pearls]], [[silk]] and [[ambergris]] are examples of secretions of contemporary origin.
*Biogenic [[neurotransmitters]].

== Abiogenic (opposite) ==
An '''abiogenic''' substance or process does not result from the present or past activity of living [[organism]]s. Abiogenic products may, e.g., be [[mineral]]s, other [[inorganic compound]]s, as well as simple [[organic compound]]s (e.g. [[Methane#Extraterrestrial_methane|extraterrestrial methane]], see also [[abiogenesis]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9439">[[File:Brain chrischan.jpg|thumb|right|Biological Naturalism states that [[consciousness]] is a higher level function of the [[human brain]]'s physical capabilities.]]
'''Biological naturalism''' is a theory about, among other things, the relationship between [[consciousness]] and [[Human body|body]] (i.e. [[Human brain|brain]]), and hence an approach to the [[mind–body problem]]. It was first proposed by the philosopher [[John Searle]] in 1980 and is defined by two main theses: 1) all [[mental event|mental phenomena]] from [[Pain and nociception|pains]], tickles, and itches to the most abstruse thoughts are caused by lower-level [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] processes in the brain; and 2) mental phenomena are higher-level features of the brain.

This [[logical consequence|entails]] that the brain has the right [[causality|causal]] powers to produce [[intentionality]]. However, Searle's biological naturalism does not entail that brains and ''only'' brains can cause consciousness. Searle is careful to point out that while it appears to be the case that certain brain functions are sufficient for producing conscious states, our current state of neurobiological knowledge prevents us from concluding that they are necessary for producing consciousness. In his own words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The fact that brain processes cause consciousness does not imply that only brains can be conscious. The brain is a [[biological machine]], and we might build an artificial machine that was conscious; just as the heart is a machine, and we have built artificial hearts. Because we do not know exactly how the brain does it we are not yet in a position to know how to do it artificially." (Biological Naturalism, 2004)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Searle (2).jpg|thumb|John Searle]]
Searle denies [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]], the idea that the mind is a separate kind of substance to the body, as this contradicts our entire understanding of [[physics]], and unlike [[René Descartes|Descartes]], he does not bring [[God]] into the problem. Indeed, Searle denies any kind of dualism, the traditional alternative to monism, claiming the distinction is a mistake. He rejects the idea that because the mind is not objectively viewable, it does not fall under the rubric of physics.

Searle believes that consciousness "is a real part of the [[reality|real world]] and it cannot be [[Eliminative materialism|eliminated]] in favor of, or reduced to, something else"&lt;ref&gt; ''John R. Searle: Thinking about the Real World'' by Dirk Franken, Attila Karakus, and Jan G. Michel [http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24715-john-r-searle-thinking-about-the-real-world/]&lt;/ref&gt; whether that something else is a neurological state of the brain or a [[computer program]]. He contends, for example, that the software known as [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] ''knows'' nothing about [[chess]]. He also believes that consciousness is both a cause of events in the body and a response to events in the body.

On the other hand, Searle doesn't treat consciousness as a [[ghost in the machine]]. He treats it, rather, as a state of the brain. The causal interaction of mind and brain can be described thus in naturalistic terms: Events at the micro-level (perhaps at that of individual [[neurons]]) cause consciousness. Changes at the macro-level (the whole brain) constitute consciousness. Micro-changes cause and then are impacted by holistic changes, in much the same way that individual football players cause a team (as a whole) to win games, causing the individuals to gain confidence from the knowledge that they are part of a winning team.

He articulates this distinction by pointing out that the common philosophical term 'reducible' is ambiguous.  Searle contends that consciousness is "causally reducible" to brain processes without being "ontologically reducible".  He hopes that making this distinction will allow him to escape the traditional dilemma between [[reductive materialism]] and substance dualism; he affirms the essentially physical nature of the universe by asserting that consciousness is completely caused by and realized in the brain, but also doesn't deny what he takes to be the obvious facts that humans really are conscious, and that conscious states have an essentially first-person nature.

It can be tempting to see the theory as a kind of [[property dualism]], since, in Searle's view, a person's mental properties are categorically different from his or her micro-physical properties. The latter have "third-person [[ontology]]" whereas the former have "first-person ontology." Micro-structure is accessible objectively by any number of people, as when several brain surgeons inspect a patient's [[cerebral hemisphere]]s. But pain or desire or [[belief]] are accessible subjectively by the person who has the pain or desire or belief, and no one else has that mode of access. However, Searle holds mental properties to be a species of physical property—ones with first-person ontology. So this sets his view apart from a dualism of physical and non-physical properties. His mental properties are putatively physical.

==Criticism==
There have been several criticisms of Searle's idea of biological naturalism.

[[Jerry Fodor]] suggests that Searle gives us no account at all of exactly ''why'' he believes that  a biochemistry like, or similar to, that of the human brain is indispensable for [[intentionality]]. Fodor thinks that it seems much more plausible to suppose that it is the way in which an organism (or any other system for that matter) is connected to its environment that is indispensable in the explanation of intentionality. It is easier to see "how the fact that my thought is causally connected to a tree might bear on its being a thought about a tree. But it's hard to imagine how the fact that (to put it crudely) my thought is made out of hydrocarbons could matter, except on the unlikely hypothesis that only hydrocarbons can be causally connected to trees in the way that brains are." &lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Jerry. (1980) "Searle On What Only Brains Can Do". ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences''. vol. 3. pp.&amp;nbsp;217–219&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Haugeland]] takes on the central notion of some set of special "right causal powers" that Searle attributes to the biochemistry of the human brain. He asks us to imagine a concrete situation in which the "right" causal powers are those that our neurons have to reciprocally stimulate one another. In this case, silicon-based alien life forms can be intelligent just in case they have these "right" causal powers; i.e. they possess neurons with synaptics connections that have the power to reciprocally stimulate each other. Then we can take any speaker of the Chinese language and cover his neurons in some sort of wrapper which prevents them from being influenced by neurotransmitters and, hence, from having the right causal powers. At this point, "Searle's demon" (an English speaking nanobot, perhaps) sees what is happening and intervenes: he sees through the covering and determines which neurons would have been stimulated and which not and proceeds to stimulate the appropriate neurons and shut down the others himself. The experimental subject's behavior is unaffected. He continues to speak perfect Chinese as before the operation but now the causal powers of his neurotransmitters have been replaced by someone who does not understand the Chinese language. The point is generalizable: for any causal powers, it will always be possible to hypothetically replace them with some sort of Searlian demon which will carry out the operations mechanically. His conclusion is that Searle's is necessarily a dualistic view of the nature of causal powers, "not intrinsically connected with the actual powers of physical objects." &lt;ref&gt;Haugeland, John. (1980) "Artificial Intelligence". ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences''. vol. 3. pp.&amp;nbsp;219–224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle himself actually does not rule out the possibility for alternate arrangements of matter bringing forth consciousness other than biological brains. He also disputes that Biological naturalism is dualistic in nature in a brief essay entitled ''"Why I Am Not a Property Dualist"''.

[[File:Shimmering bees drive hornet away.ogv|thumb|A population of bees shimmers in response to a predator.]]

'''Biological organization''' is the [[hierarchy]] of [[complex systems|complex]] [[biology|biological]] [[structures]] and [[systems]] that define [[life]] using a [[Reductionism|reductionistic]] approach.&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|Berg|Martin|2002|pp=9&amp;ndash;10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional hierarchy, as detailed below, extends from [[atom]]s to [[biosphere]]s. The higher levels of this scheme are often referred to as an '''ecological organization''' concept, or as the [[Branches of science|field]],  [[#Fundamentals|hierarchical ecology]].

Each level in the hierarchy represents an increase in organizational [[wikt:complexity|complexity]], with each "object" being primarily composed of the previous level's basic unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle behind the organization is the concept of ''[[emergence]]''—the properties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and irrelevant at the lower levels.

The biological organization of life is a fundamental premise for numerous areas of [[scientific research]], particularly in the [[Medicine|medical sciences]]. Without this necessary degree of organization, it would be much more difficult—and likely impossible—to apply the study of the effects of various [[physical phenomenon|physical]] and [[chemical phenomenon|chemical]] phenomena to [[diseases]] and [[physiology]] (body function). For example, fields such as [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive]] and [[behavioral neuroscience]] could not exist if the brain was not composed of specific types of cells, and the basic concepts of [[pharmacology]] could not exist if it was not known that a change at the cellular level can affect an entire organism. These applications extend into the [[ecological]] levels as well. For example, [[DDT]]'s direct [[insecticide|insecticidal]] effect occurs at the [[subcellular]] level, but affects higher levels up to and including multiple [[ecosystem]]s. Theoretically, a change in one [[atom]] could change the entire [[biosphere]].

==Levels==
[[File:Levels of Organization.svg|thumb|The simplest unit of life is the atom, like oxygen. Two or more atoms is a molecule, like a dioxide. Many small molecules may combine in a chemical reaction to make up a macromolecule, such as a phospholipid. Multiple macromolecules form a cell, like a club cell. A group of cells functioning together as a tissue, for example, Epithelial tissue. Different tissues make up an organ, like a lung. Organs work together to form an organ system, such as the Respiratory System. All of the organ systems make a living organism, like a lion. A group of the same organism living together in an area is a population, such as a pride of lions. Two or more populations interacting with each other form a community, for example, lion and zebra populations interacting with each other.  Communities interacting not only with each other but also with the physical environment encompass an ecosystem, such as the Savanna ecosystem. All of the ecosystems make up the biosphere, the area of life on Earth.]]
The simple standard biological organization scheme, from the lowest level to the highest level, is as follows:&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"/&gt;

|-
| colspan="3" style="vertical-align:middle;text-align:left" |''For levels larger than Biosphere or Ecosphere, see [[Earth's location in the Universe]]''
|-
|}

More complex schemes incorporate many more levels. For example, a molecule can be viewed as a grouping of [[chemical element|elements]], and an atom can be further divided into [[subatomic particle]]s (these levels are outside the scope of biological organization). Each level can also be broken down into its own hierarchy, and specific types of these biological objects can have their own hierarchical scheme. For example, [[genome]]s can be further subdivided into a hierarchy of [[gene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each level in the hierarchy can be described by its lower levels. For example, the organism may be described at any of its component levels, including the atomic, molecular, cellular, histological (tissue), organ and organ system levels. Furthermore, at every level of the hierarchy, new functions necessary for the control of life appear. These new roles are not functions that the lower level components are capable of and are thus referred to as ''[[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent properties]]''.

Every organism is organised, though not necessarily to the same degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postlethwait|Hopson|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism can not be organised at the [[histological]] (tissue) level if it is not composed of tissues in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Witzany | first1 = G | year = 2014 | title = Biological Self-organization | url = | journal = International Journal of Signs and Semiotic Systems | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==
Empirically, a large proportion of the (complex) biological systems we observe in nature exhibit hierarchic structure. On theoretical grounds we could expect complex systems to be hierarchies in a world in which complexity had to evolve from simplicity. [[Systems theory|System]] hierarchies analysis performed in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the empirical foundations for a [[Branches of science|field]] that would be, from the 1980s, '''hierarchical ecology'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Margalef|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wicken|Ulanowicz|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pumain|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|Jørgensen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical foundations are summarized by thermodynamics.
When [[biological systems]] are modeled as [[physical system]]s, in its most general abstraction, they are [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|thermodynamic open systems]] that exhibit [[self-organization|self-organised]] behavior, and the [[Set theory|set/subset]] relations between [[dissipative structures]] can be characterized in a hierarchy.

A simpler and more direct way to explain the fundamentals of the "hierarchical organization of life", was introduced in [[Ecology]] by [[Howard T. Odum|Odum]] and others as the "[[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]]'s hierarchical principle";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|1969|pp=192–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon&lt;ref&gt;Simon's texts at {{doi|10.1207/S15327809JLS1203_4}}, [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705161014/http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html |date=July 5, 2015 }} or [http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ johncarlosbaez/2011/08/29 transcriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531145800/https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ |date=2015-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized that hierarchy "''emerges almost inevitably through a wide variety of evolutionary processes, for the simple reason that &lt;u&gt;hierarchical structures are stable&lt;/u&gt;''".

To motivate this deep idea, he offered his "parable" about imaginary watchmakers.

:{|
!Parable of the Watchmakers
|-
|
There once were two watchmakers, named Hora and Tempus, who made very fine watches. The phones in their workshops rang frequently; new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered while Tempus became poorer and poorer. In the end, Tempus lost his shop. What was the reason behind this?

The watches consisted of about 1000 parts each. The watches that Tempus made were designed such that, when he had to put down a partly assembled watch (for instance, to answer the phone), it immediately fell into pieces and had to be reassembled from the basic elements.

Hora had designed his watches so that he could put together subassemblies of about ten components each. Ten of these subassemblies could be put together to make a larger sub-assembly. Finally, ten of the larger subassemblies constituted the whole watch. Each subassembly could be put down without falling apart.

'''Decomposed granite''' is classification of [[Rock (geology)|rock]] that is derived from [[granite]] via its [[weathering]] to the point that the parent material readily fractures into smaller pieces of weaker rock. Further weathering yields material that easily crumbles into a mixtures of [[gravel]]-sized particles known as [[Grus (geology)|grus]], that in turn may break down to produce a mixture of clay and silica sand or silt particles. Different specific granite types have differing propensities to weather, and so differing likelihoods of producing decomposed granite. It has practical uses that include its incorporation into [[Road surface|paving]] and [[driveway]] materials, residential gardening materials in arid environments, as well as various types of [[walkway]]s and heavy-use [[Trail|paths]] in [[park]]s. Different colors of decomposed granite are available, deriving from the natural range of granite colors from different quarry sources, and admixture of other natural and synthetic materials can extend the range of decomposed granite properties.

==Definition and composition==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
Decomposed granite is [[Rock (geology)|rock]] of [[granitic]] origin that has [[weathering|weathered]] to the point that it readily fractures into smaller pieces of weak rock. Further weathering produces rock that easily crumbles into mixtures of [[gravel]]-sized particles, [[sand]], and [[silt]]-sized particles with some [[clay]]. Eventually, the gravel may break down to produce a mixture of silica sand, silt particles, and clay. Different specific granite types have differing propensities to weather, and so differing likelihoods of producing decomposed granite.

The parent [[granite]] material is a common type of [[igneous rock]] that is granular, with its grains large enough to be distinguished with the unaided eye (i.e., it is [[phaneritic]] in texture); it is composed of [[plagioclase feldspar]], [[orthoclase feldspar]], [[quartz]], [[mica]], and possibly other minerals. The chemical transformation of [[feldspar]], one of the primary constituents of [[granite]], into the clay mineral [[kaolin]] is one of the important weathering processes.&lt;ref name=MitchellSoga05&gt;Mitchell, J.K., and Soga, K. (2005) Fundamentals of soil behavior, Third edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., {{ISBN|9780471463023}}, pages 200-204.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of clay allows water to seep in and further weaken the rock allowing it to fracture or crumble into smaller particles,&lt;ref name=MitchellSoga05/&gt; where, ultimately, the grains of [[silica]] produced from the granite are relatively resistant to weathering, and may remain almost unaltered.&lt;ref name=MitchellSoga05/&gt;

==Uses==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
[[Image:Decomposed granite path.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Decomposed granite path]]
Decomposed granite, as a [[crushed stone]] form, is used as a [[Road surface|pavement]] building material. It is used on [[driveway]]s, [[garden]] [[walkway]]s, [[bocce]] courts and [[pétanque]] terrains, and [[urban park|urban]], [[regional park|regional]], and [[national park]] walkways and heavy-use [[Trail|paths]]. DG can be installed and compacted to meet handicapped accessibility specifications and criteria, such as the ADA standards in the U.S.  Different colors are available based on the various natural ranges available from different quarry sources, and polymeric stabilizers and other additives can be included to change the properties of the natural material. Decomposed granite is also sometimes used as a component of soil mixtures for cultivating [[bonsai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Randy|title=Guidelines For Creating Bonsai Soil|url=http://www.bonsailearningcenter.com/IMAGES/PDF%20Files/Soils.pdf|publisher=Bonsai Learning Center|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=Joshua|title=Potting Soils for a Bonsai|url=http://homeguides.sfgate.com/potting-soils-bonsai-70677.html|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

]]
The '''Dirac sea''' is a theoretical model of the [[vacuum]] as an infinite sea of particles with [[negative energy]]. It was first postulated by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[physicist]] [[Paul Dirac]] in 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dirac|1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explain the anomalous negative-energy [[quantum state]]s predicted by the [[Dirac equation]] for [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[electron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greiner|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[positron]], the [[antimatter]] counterpart of the [[electron]], was originally conceived of as a [[electron hole|hole]] in the Dirac sea, well before its experimental discovery in 1932.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This was not the original intent of Dirac though, as the title of his 1930 paper (''A Theory of Electrons and Protons'') indicates. But it soon afterwards became clear that the mass of holes must be that of the electron.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon solving the free Dirac equation,

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = (c\hat \boldsymbol \alpha \cdot \hat \boldsymbol p + mc^2\hat \beta)\Psi,&lt;/math&gt;

one finds&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greiner|2000|pp=107&amp;ndash;109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_{\mathbf p\lambda} = N\left(\begin{matrix}U\\ \frac{(c\hat \boldsymbol \sigma \cdot \boldsymbol p)}{mc^2 + \lambda E_p}U\end{matrix}\right)\frac{\exp[i(\mathbf p \cdot \mathbf x - \varepsilon t)/\hbar]}{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}^3},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \pm E_p, \quad E_p = +c\sqrt{\mathbf p^2 + m^2 c^2}, \quad \lambda = \sgn \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

for plane wave solutions with {{math|3}}-momentum {{math|'''p'''}}. This is a direct consequence of the relativistic [[energy-momentum relation]]

:&lt;math&gt;E^2=p^2c^2+m^2c^4&lt;/math&gt;

upon which the Dirac equation is built. The quantity {{mvar|U}} is a constant {{math|2 × 1}} column vector and {{mvar|N}} is a normalization constant. The quantity {{math|''ε''}} is called the ''time evolution factor'', and its interpretation in similar roles in, for example, the [[plane wave]] solutions of the [[Schrödinger equation]], is the energy of the wave (particle). This interpretation is not immediately available here since it may acquire negative values. A similar situation prevails for the [[Klein&amp;ndash;Gordon equation]]. In that case, the ''absolute value'' of {{math|''ε''}} can be interpreted as the energy of the wave since in the canonical formalism, waves with negative {{math|''ε''}} actually have ''positive'' energy {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greiner|2000|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this is not the case with the Dirac equation. The energy in the canonical formalism associated with negative {{math|''ε''}} is {{math|–''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greiner|2000|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In hole theory, the solutions with negative time evolution factors are reinterpreted as representing the [[positron]], discovered by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl Anderson]]. The interpretation of this result requires a Dirac sea, showing that the Dirac equation is not merely a combination of [[special relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]], but it also implies that the number of particles cannot be conserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alvarez-Gaume|Vazquez-Mozo|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The origins of the Dirac sea lie in the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|energy spectrum]] of the [[Dirac equation]], an extension of the [[Schrödinger equation]] that is consistent with [[special relativity]], that Dirac had formulated in 1928. Although the equation was extremely successful in describing electron dynamics, it possesses a rather peculiar feature: for each quantum state possessing a positive energy ''E'', there is a corresponding state with energy ''-E''. This is not a big difficulty when an isolated electron is considered, because its energy is [[conservation of energy|conserved]] and negative-energy electrons may be left out. However, difficulties arise when effects of the [[electromagnetic field]] are considered, because a positive-energy electron would be able to shed energy by continuously emitting [[photon]]s, a process that could continue without limit as the electron descends into lower and lower energy states. Real electrons clearly do not behave in this way.

Dirac's solution to this was to turn to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Electrons are [[fermion]]s, and obey the exclusion principle, which means that no two electrons can share a single energy state within an atom. Dirac hypothesized that what we think of as the "vacuum" is actually the state in which ''all'' the negative-energy states are filled, and none of the positive-energy states. Therefore, if we want to introduce a single electron we would have to put it in a positive-energy state, as all the negative-energy states are occupied. Furthermore, even if the electron loses energy by emitting photons it would be forbidden from dropping below zero energy.

Dirac also pointed out that a situation might exist in which all the negative-energy states are occupied except one. This "hole" in the sea of negative-energy electrons would respond to [[electric field]]s as though it were a positively charged particle. Initially, Dirac identified this hole as a [[proton]]. However, [[Robert Oppenheimer]] pointed out that an electron and its hole would be able to [[annihilation|annihilate]] each other, releasing energy on the order of the electron's rest energy in the form of energetic photons; if holes were protons, stable [[atom]]s would not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dirac|1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Weyl]] also noted that a hole should act as though it has the same [[mass]] as an electron, whereas the proton is about two thousand times heavier. The issue was finally resolved in 1932 when the [[positron]] was discovered by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl Anderson]], with all the physical properties predicted for the Dirac hole.

== Inelegance of Dirac sea ==

Despite its success, the idea of the Dirac sea tends not to strike people as very elegant. The existence of the sea implies an infinite positive electric charge filling all of space. In order to make any sense out of this, one must assume that the "bare vacuum" must have an infinite negative charge density which is exactly cancelled by the Dirac sea. Since the absolute energy density is unobservable—the [[cosmological constant]] aside—the infinite energy density of the vacuum does not represent a problem. Only changes in the energy density are observable.  Geoffrey Landis (author of ''Ripples In The Dirac Sea'', a hard science fiction short story) also notes{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} that Pauli exclusion does not definitively mean that a filled Dirac sea cannot accept more electrons, since, as [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel|Hilbert]] elucidated, a sea of infinite extent can accept new particles even if it is filled. This happens when we have a [[chiral anomaly]] and a gauge [[instanton]].

The development of [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) in the 1930s made it possible to reformulate the Dirac equation in a way that treats the positron as a "real" particle rather than the absence of a particle, and makes the vacuum the state in which no particles exist instead of an infinite sea of particles. This picture is much more convincing, especially since it recaptures all the valid predictions of the Dirac sea, such as electron-positron annihilation. On the other hand, the field formulation does not eliminate all the difficulties raised by the Dirac sea; in particular the problem of the [[vacuum energy|vacuum possessing infinite energy]].

== Modern interpretation ==

The Dirac sea interpretation and the modern QFT interpretation are related by what may be thought of as a very simple [[Bogoliubov transformation]], an identification between the creation and annihilation operators of two different free field theories.{{citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=phrasing suggestive of original research}} In the modern interpretation, the field operator for a Dirac  spinor is a sum of creation operators and annihilation operators, in a schematic notation:

::&lt;math&gt; \psi(x) = \sum a^\dagger(k) e^{ikx} + a(k)e^{-ikx} &lt;/math&gt;

An operator with negative frequency lowers the energy of any state by an amount proportional to the frequency, while operators with positive frequency raise the energy of any state.

In the modern interpretation, the positive frequency operators add a positive energy particle, adding to the energy, while the negative frequency operators annihilate a positive energy particle, and lower the energy. For a [[Fermionic field]], the [[Creation and annihilation operators|creation operator]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a^\dagger (k)&lt;/math&gt; gives zero when the state with momentum k is already filled, while the annihilation operator &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a(k)&lt;/math&gt; gives zero when the state with momentum k is empty.

But then it is possible to reinterpret the annihilation operator as a ''creation'' operator for a [[negative energy]] particle. It still lowers the energy of the vacuum, but in this point of view it does so by creating a negative energy object. This reinterpretation only affects the philosophy. To reproduce the rules for when annihilation in the vacuum gives zero, the notion of "empty" and "filled" must be reversed for the negative energy states. Instead of being states with no antiparticle, these are states that are already filled with a negative energy particle.

The price is that there is a nonuniformity in certain expressions, because replacing annihilation with creation adds a constant to the negative energy particle number. The [[number operator]] for a Fermi field&lt;ref name="Sattler"&gt;{{harvnb|Sattler|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is:

::&lt;math&gt; N = a^\dagger a = 1 - a a^\dagger &lt;/math&gt;

which means that if one replaces N by 1-N for [[negative energy]] states, there is a constant shift in quantities like the energy and the charge density, quantities that count the total number of particles. The infinite constant gives the Dirac sea an infinite energy and charge density. The vacuum charge density should be zero, since the vacuum is [[Lorentz invariance|Lorentz invariant]], but this is artificial to arrange in Dirac's picture. The way it is done is by passing to the modern interpretation.

Dirac's idea is more directly applicable to [[solid state physics]], where the [[valence band]] in a [[solid]] can be regarded as a "sea" of electrons. Holes in this sea indeed occur, and are extremely important for understanding the effects of [[semiconductor]]s, though they are never referred to as "positrons". Unlike in particle physics, there is an underlying positive charge&amp;nbsp;— the charge of the [[Crystal structure|ionic lattice]]&amp;nbsp;— that cancels out the electric charge of the sea.

== Revival in the theory of causal fermion systems ==
Dirac's original concept of a sea of particles was revived in the theory of [[causal fermion system]]s, a recent proposal for a unified physical theory. In this approach, the problems of the infinite [[vacuum energy]] and infinite charge density of the Dirac sea disappear because these divergences drop out of the physical equations formulated via the [[causal action principle]].&lt;ref name="srev"&gt;{{harvnb|Finster|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These equations do not require a preexisting space-time, making it possible to realize the concept that space-time and all structures therein arise as a result of the collective interaction of the sea states with each other and with the additional particles and "holes" in the sea.

Viscek  and  F. Family, Phys.  Rev. Lett. '''52''' 1669 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;) is the litmus test of showing that an evolving system exhibits [[self-similarity]]. In general a function is said to exhibit dynamic scaling if it satisfies:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,t)\sim t^\theta \varphi \left( \frac x {t^z} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here the exponent &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is fixed by the dimensional requirement &lt;math&gt;[f]=[t^\theta]&lt;/math&gt;. 
Now, the numerical value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{f}{t^\theta}&lt;/math&gt; should remain invariant despite the unit of measurement of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is changed by some factor since &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a dimensionless quantity. However, [[Tamás Vicsek]] and [[Fereydoon Family]] first proposed the idea of dynamic scaling in the context of  diffusion-limited aggregation [[Diffusion-limited aggregation|DLA]] of clusters in two dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;T. Vicsek and F. Family, Phys. Rev. Lett. '''52''' 1669 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The form of their proposal for dynamic scaling was:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,t)\sim t^{-w}x^{-\tau} \varphi \left( \frac x {t^z} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Many phenomena which physicists often investigate are not static but rather [[stochastic process|evolve probabilistically with time]]. The universe is perhaps one of the best examples which is expanding ever since the [[Big Bang]]. Similarly, growth of networks like the Internet are also ever growing systems. Another example is [[polymer degradation]]&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Ziff and E. D.  McGrady, ''The kinetics of cluster fragmentation and depolymerisation'' J.  Phys. A: Math. Gen. '''18''' 3027-3037 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; where degradation does not occur in a blink of an eye but rather over quite a long time. Spread of biological and [[computer virus]]es too does not happen over night. Many of these evolves in a self-similar fashion in the sense that data obtained from the snapshot at any fixed time is similar to the respective data taken from the snapshot of any earlier or later time. That is, the system is similar to itself at different times. The litmus test of such self-similarity is provided by the dynamic scaling.

In such system we find certain [[stochastic variable]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; which assume values that depend on time. In such cases, we are often interested to know the distribution of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at various instants of time i.e. &lt;math&gt;f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;. Now the numerical value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and the typical or mean value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; may well be very different at every different instant measurement. The question is: What happens to the corresponding dimensionless variables? If the numerical values of the dimensional quantities are different, however, corresponding dimensionless quantities remain invariant then we can argue that the snapshot of the system at different times are similar. When this happens we conclude that the system is self-similar. 

One way of verifying the dynamic scaling is to plot dimensionless variables &lt;math&gt;f/t^\theta&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{t^z}&lt;/math&gt; of the data extracted at various different time. Then if all the plots of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; vs &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; obtained at different times collapse onto a single universal curve then it is said that the systems at different time are similar and it obeys dynamic scaling. The idea of data collapse is deeply rooted to the Buckingham &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; theorem.&lt;ref&gt;G. I. Barenblatt, ''Scaling, Self-similarity, and Intermediate Asymptotics'' (Cmpridge University Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially such systems can be termed as temporal self-similarity since the same system is similar at different times.

There have many seemingly disparate systems which are found to exhibit dynamic scaling e.g., kinetics of aggregation described by [[Smoluchowski coagulation equation]],&lt;ref&gt;P. G.

Received [[radiation]] is unevenly distributed over the planet, because the Sun heats equatorial regions more than polar regions. The atmosphere and ocean work non-stop to even out solar heating imbalances through [[evaporation]] of surface water, convection, rainfall, winds, and ocean circulation. Earth is very close to being in [[radiative equilibrium]], the situation where the incoming solar energy is balanced by an equal flow of heat to space; under that condition, global temperatures will be ''relatively'' stable. Globally, over the course of the year, the Earth system—land surfaces, oceans, and atmosphere—absorbs and then radiates back to space an average of about 240 watts of solar power per square meter. Anything that increases or decreases the amount of incoming or outgoing energy will change global temperatures in response.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2009"&gt;{{cite journal

However, Earth's energy balance and heat fluxes depend on many factors, such as atmospheric composition (mainly aerosols and greenhouse gases), the [[albedo]] (reflectivity) of surface properties, cloud cover and vegetation and land use patterns.

Changes in surface temperature due to Earth's energy budget do not occur instantaneously, due to the [[inertia]] of the [[ocean]]s and the [[cryosphere]]. The net heat flux is buffered primarily by becoming part of the [[ocean heat content|ocean's heat content]], until a new equilibrium state is established between radiative forcings and the climate response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Energy budget==
[[File:Earth_heat_balance_Sankey_diagram.svg|thumb|250px|left|A [[Sankey diagram]] illustrating the Earth's energy budget described in this section &amp;mdash; line thickness is linearly proportional to relative amount of energy.&lt;ref name="energy_budget" /&gt;]]
In spite of the enormous transfers of energy into and from the Earth, it maintains a relatively constant temperature because, as a whole, there is little net gain or loss: Earth emits via atmospheric and terrestrial radiation (shifted to longer electromagnetic wavelengths) to space about the same amount of energy as it receives via insolation (all forms of electromagnetic radiation).

To quantify Earth's ''heat budget'' or ''heat balance'', let the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere be 100 units (100 units = about 1,360 watts per square meter facing the sun), as shown in the accompanying illustration. Called the [[albedo]] of Earth, around 35 units are reflected back to space: 27 from the top of clouds, 2 from snow and ice-covered areas, and 6 by other parts of the atmosphere. The 65 remaining units are absorbed: 14 within the atmosphere and 51 by the Earth’s surface. These 51 units are radiated to space in the form of terrestrial radiation: 17 directly radiated to space and 34 absorbed by the atmosphere (19 through latent heat of condensation, 9 via convection and turbulence, and 6 directly absorbed). The 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere (34 units from terrestrial radiation and 14 from insolation) are finally radiated back to space. These 65 units (17 from the ground and 48 from the atmosphere) balance the 65 units absorbed from the sun in order to maintain zero net gain of energy by the Earth.&lt;ref name="energy_budget"&gt;

===Incoming radiant energy (shortwave)===

The total amount of energy received per second at the top of [[Earth's atmosphere]] (TOA) is measured in [[watt]]s and is given by the [[solar constant]] times the cross-sectional area of the Earth. Because the surface area of a sphere is four times the cross-sectional surface area of a sphere (i.e. the area of a circle), the average TOA flux is one quarter of the solar constant and so is approximately 340&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Earth's radiation balance and its representation in CMIP5 models|publisher=Copernicus|year=2013|author1=Wild, Martin |author2=Folini, Doris |author3=Schär, Christoph |author4=Loeb, Norman |author5=Dutton, Ellsworth |author6=König-Langlo, Gert |bibcode=2013EGUGA..15.1286W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the absorption varies with location as well as with diurnal, seasonal and annual variations, the numbers quoted are long-term averages, typically averaged from multiple satellite measurements.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

Of the ~340&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar radiation received by the Earth, an average of ~77&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected back to space by clouds and the atmosphere and ~23&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected by the surface [[albedo]], leaving ~240&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar energy input to the Earth's energy budget. This gives the earth a mean net albedo of 0.29.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

===Earth's internal heat and other small effects===
The [[Earth's internal heat budget|geothermal heat flux]] from the Earth's interior is estimated to be 47 [[terawatt]]s.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Davies, J. H., &amp; Davies, D. R. (2010). Earth's surface heat flux. Solid Earth, 1(1), 5–24.&lt;/ref&gt; This comes to 0.087&amp;nbsp;watt/square metre, which represents only 0.027% of Earth's total energy budget at the surface, which is dominated by 173,000 terawatts of incoming [[solar radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN=978-0-470-94341-0|author=Archer, D.|year=2012|title=Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World energy consumption|Human production of energy]] is even lower, at an estimated 18 TW.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Photosynthesis]] has a larger effect: [[photosynthetic efficiency]] turns up to 2% of incoming sunlight into [[primary production|biomass]], for a total photosynthetic productivity of earth between ~1500–2250 TW (~1%+/-0.26% solar energy hitting the Earth's surface).&lt;ref name="PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pisciotta JM, Zou Y, Baskakov IV |title=Light-Dependent Electrogenic Activity of Cyanobacteria |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=e10821 |year=2010 |pmid=20520829 |pmc=2876029 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010821|bibcode=2010PLoSO...510821P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other minor sources of energy are usually ignored in these calculations, including accretion of [[interplanetary dust]] and [[solar wind]], light from stars other than the Sun and the thermal radiation from space. Earlier, [[Joseph Fourier]] had claimed that deep space radiation was significant in a paper often cited as the first on the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William M. Connolley's page about Fourier 1827: MEMOIRE sur les temperatures du globe terrestre et des espaces planetaires|url=http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/fourier_1827/|last=Connolley|first=William M.|authorlink=William Connolley|publisher=William M. Connolley|date=18 May 2003|accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longwave radiation===
{{main|Outgoing longwave radiation}}
Longwave radiation is usually defined as outgoing [[infrared]] energy leaving the planet. However, the atmosphere absorbs parts initially, or cloud cover can reflect radiation. Generally, heat energy is transported between the planet's surface layers (land and ocean) to the atmosphere, transported via [[evapotranspiration]] and [[latent heat]] fluxes or [[thermal conduction|conduction]]/[[convection]] processes.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;  Ultimately, energy is radiated in the form of longwave [[Infrared#Earth as an infrared emitter|infrared radiation]] back into space.

Recent satellite observations indicate additional precipitation, which is sustained by increased energy leaving the surface through evaporation (the latent heat flux), offsetting increases in longwave flux to the surface.&lt;ref name=SatObsEva /&gt;

==Earth's energy imbalance==
If the incoming energy flux is not equal to the outgoing energy flux, net heat is added to or lost by the planet (if the incoming flux is larger or smaller than the outgoing respectively).

===Indirect measurement===
An imbalance must show in something on Earth warming or cooling (depending on the direction of the imbalance), and the ocean being the larger [[thermal reservoir]] on Earth, is a prime candidate for measurements.

Earth's energy imbalance measurements provided by [[Argo (oceanography)|Argo floats]] have detected an accumulation of [[ocean heat content]] (OHC). The estimated imbalance was measured during a deep [[solar minimum]] of 2005–2010 to be 0.58 ± 0.15&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="Imbalance"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=James Hansen |author2=Makiko Sato |author3=Pushker Kharecha |author4=Karina von Schuckmann |publisher=NASA|date=January 2012|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=Earth's Energy Imbalance}}&lt;/ref&gt; This level of detail cannot be inferred directly from measurements of surface energy fluxes, which have combined uncertainties of the order of ± 17&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An update on Earth's energy balance in light of the latest global observations|url = http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v5/n10/full/ngeo1580.html|journal = Nature Geoscience|date = 2012-10-01|issn = 1752-0894|pages = 691–696|volume = 5|issue = 10|doi = 10.1038/ngeo1580|first = Graeme L.|last = Stephens|first2 = Juilin|last2 = Li|first3 = Martin|last3 = Wild|first4 = Carol Anne|last4 = Clayson|first5 = Norman|last5 = Loeb|first6 = Seiji|last6 = Kato|first7 = Tristan|last7 = L'Ecuyer|first8 = Paul W. |last8 = Stackhouse Jr.|first9 = Matthew|last9 = Lebsock|bibcode = 2012NatGe...5..691S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct measurement ===
Several [[satellite]]s indirectly measure the energy absorbed and radiated by Earth and by inference the energy imbalance. The [[NASA]] [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite|Earth Radiation Budget Experiment]] (ERBE) project involves three such satellites: the [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite]] (ERBS), launched October 1984; NOAA-9, launched December 1984; and NOAA-10, launched September 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icp.giss.nasa.gov/education/radforce/ Effect of the Sun's Energy on the Ocean and Atmosphere (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today NASA's satellite instruments, provided by CERES, part of the NASA's [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS), are designed to measure both solar-reflected and Earth-emitted radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= B.A. Wielicki |display-authors=etal |title=Mission to Planet Earth: Role of Clouds and Radiation in Climate |journal=Bull.

==Natural greenhouse effect==
[[File:Diagram showing the Earth's energy budget, which includes the greenhouse effect (NASA).png|thumb|right|alt=refer to caption and image description|250px|Diagram showing the energy budget of Earth's atmosphere, which includes the greenhouse effect]]
{{See also|Greenhouse effect}}
The major [[atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] gases ([[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]) are transparent to incoming sunlight but are also transparent to outgoing thermal ([[infrared]]) radiation. However, [[water vapor#Water vapor in Earth.27s atmosphere|water vapor]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and other trace gases are opaque to many [[wavelength]]s of thermal radiation. The Earth's surface radiates the net equivalent of 17 percent of the incoming [[solar radiation|solar energy]] in the form of thermal infrared. However, the amount that directly escapes to space is only about 12 percent of incoming solar energy. The remaining fraction, 5 to 6 percent, is absorbed by the atmosphere by [[greenhouse gas]] [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"&gt;Edited quote from public-domain source: {{citation

[[File:CO2 H2O absorption atmospheric gases unique pattern energy wavelengths of energy transparent to others.png|500px|thumb|Atmospheric gases only absorb some wavelengths of energy but are transparent to others. The absorption patterns of water vapor (blue peaks) and carbon dioxide (pink peaks) overlap in some wavelengths. Carbon dioxide is not as strong a greenhouse gas as water vapor, but it absorbs energy in wavelengths (12–15 micrometres) that water vapor does not, partially closing the "window" through which heat radiated by the surface would normally escape to space. (Illustration NASA, Robert Rohde)&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page7.php|title=NASA: Climate Forcings and Global Warming|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy, their temperature rises. Those gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in all directions. Heat radiated upward continues to encounter greenhouse gas molecules; those molecules also absorb the heat, and their temperature rises and the amount of heat they radiate increases. The atmosphere thins with [[altitude]], and at roughly 5–6&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre]]s, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the overlying atmosphere is so thin that heat can escape to space.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt;

Because greenhouse gas molecules radiate infrared energy in all directions, some of it spreads downward and ultimately returns to the Earth's surface, where it is absorbed. The Earth's surface temperature is thus higher than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating. This supplemental heating is the natural greenhouse effect.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt; It is as if the Earth is covered by a blanket that allows high frequency radiation (sunlight) to enter, but slows the rate at which the low frequency infrared radiant energy emitted by the Earth leaves.

==Climate sensitivity==
{{Main|Radiative forcing}}
A change in the incident radiated portion of the energy budget is referred to as a [[radiative forcing]].

[[Climate sensitivity]] is the [[steady state]] change in the equilibrium temperature as a result of changes in the energy budget.

===Climate forcings and global warming===
[[File:NASA Hansen Aerosol effect on expected energy imbalance Earth budget.gif|right|300px|thumb|Expected Earth energy imbalance for three choices of aerosol climate forcing. Measured imbalance, close to 0.6 W/m², implies that aerosol forcing is close to −1.6 W/m². (Credit: NASA/GISS)&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;]]
Climate forcings are changes that cause temperatures to rise or fall, disrupting the energy balance. Natural climate forcings include changes in the Sun's brightness, [[Milankovitch cycles]] (small variations in the shape of Earth's orbit and its axis of rotation that occur over thousands of years) and volcanic eruptions that inject light-reflecting particles as high as the [[stratosphere]]. Man-made forcings include particle pollution ([[aerosols]]) that absorb and reflect incoming sunlight; [[deforestation]], which changes how the surface reflects and absorbs sunlight; and the rising concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which decreases the rate at which heat is radiated to space.

A forcing can trigger [[feedback]]s that intensify ([[positive feedback]]) or weaken ([[negative feedback]]) the original forcing. For example, [[Arctic sea ice decline|loss of ice]] at the poles, which makes them less reflective, causes greater absorption of energy and so increases the rate at which the ice melts, is an example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings" /&gt;

The observed planetary energy imbalance during the [[solar cycle 24|recent solar minimum]] shows that solar forcing of climate, although natural and significant, is overwhelmed by anthropogenic climate forcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=NASA GISS: Science Brief: Earth's Energy Imbalance|website=www.giss.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[NASA]] scientists reported that to stop [[global warming]] atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content would have to be reduced to 350&amp;nbsp;ppm or less, assuming all other climate forcings were fixed. The impact of anthropogenic [[aerosols]] has not been quantified, but individual aerosol types are thought to have substantial heating and cooling effects.&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;

The '''earth pyramids of Platten''' (German: ''Erdpyramiden von Platten'' or ''Erdpyramiden bei Oberwielenbach''; {{lang-it|Piramidi di Plata}} {{IPA-it|piˈraːmidi di ˈplaːta|}}) are [[Hoodoo (geology)|earth pyramids]] located in Platten in the municipality of [[Percha]], near [[Bruneck]] in [[South Tyrol]], [[Italy]].

The erosion area is located at an altitude of 1550 to 1750 meters. What is so impressive about the pyramids of Platten is their wildness which reminds at the same time also of their fragility.

The pyramids of Platten belong to the most beautiful natural monuments of South Tyrol such as the [[earth pyramids of Ritten]] and part of the [[earth pyramids of South Tyrol]].

They were described in a scientific manner for the first time by Karl Meusburger in 1914 .&lt;ref&gt;Karl Meusburger, ''Die Erdpyramiden bei Bruneck'' (''The earth pyramides near Bruneck'', in "Zeitschrift des Ferdinandeums für Tirol und Vorarlberg" (Journal of the [[Tyrolean State Museum|Ferdinandeum]] for Tyrol and Vorarlberg, III/58, 1914, pp. 453-455.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following a cloudburst, a few centuries ago, there came a landslide which cut off the roads connecting the villages in the surroundings of Aschbach.

In 1882, again after a heavy cloudburst, a  new fault was formed. Following eluviations and erosions these earth
pyramids are constantly changing; that is due to the succession of severe cold spells in winter and hot summers which have the effect of continually forming new ones.

==Getting There and Hiking Route==
From the main road we deter at Percha/Percia and drive less than 6&amp;nbsp;km up into Oberwielenbach and beyond it a bit more to the big parking place. That road continues to the hamlet of Platten, but before reaching it, another narrow mountain road deters left, heading towards the Gönner Alm (alpine pasture). On the crossroads there's the inscription that this mountain road leads also towards the pyramids, but it is closed for public traffic (2017). So, it's best to start the walk up to the pyramids before, on the big parking place, 1430 m, or eventually later, from Platten.

From the big parking place, 1430 m, a good, marked path goes up into the woods. First it ascends a bit, then does a lot of crossing the slopes towards the right. When we reach out of the woods, hitting the before mentioned mountain road, we follow the road only to the big left turn. From there we go into the forest again and in a few minutes we reach the big ravine with the pyramids. Some 30 minutes till here.

To return, it is best to use the approach route, even if we descend along the ravine to the lower lookout point. From there a path goes further down, but it descends more than needed and makes the return a bit longer.

The '''earth pyramids of Ritten''' (German: ''Erdpyramiden am Ritten''; {{lang-it|Piramidi di terra del Renon}} {{IPA-it|piˈraːmidi di ˈtɛrra del reˈnon|}}) are a natural monument that is located on the [[Ritten]], a [[plateau]] not far from [[Bolzano]] in northern Italy. The [[earth pyramids of South Tyrol]] are a fairly widespread phenomenon which are existing in various locations.

&lt;!-- [[File:RittenLehmpyramiden.jpg|left|thumb|Another view of the Pyramids of the Ritten towards Mittelberg]] picture not upright, fj --&gt;
The original name in this area for these earth pyramids is ''Lahntürme'', i.e. landslide towers.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. Paul Stacul, ''Die erste Erwähnung der Südtiroler Erdpyramiden'' (''The first mention of the South Tyrolean earth pyramides''), in "[[Der Schlern]]", 51, 1977, pp. 675-678.&lt;/ref&gt; They are rather unusual formations of their kind which originate from morainic rocks of glacial origin. The columns of the pyramids may be more or less elongated, and the higher they are the thinner they get, ending usually with a stone cover. These earth pyramids are not static, they are constantly evolving, because their life cycle foresees a continuous [[erosion]], or even a final collapse leaving room for new formations.

In [[South Tyrol]] there are other natural monuments like this such as the [[earth pyramids of Platten]], but the ones of Ritten are considered the parents of them all.

Earth-centered religion or [[nature worship]] is a system of religion based on the veneration of [[natural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/406588/nature-worship Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; It covers any [[religion]] that [[worship]]s the [[earth]], [[nature]], or [[fertility deity]], such as the various forms of [[Mother Goddess|goddess worship]] or [[matriarchal religion]]. Some find a connection between earth-worship and the [[Gaia hypothesis]]. Earth religions are also formulated to allow one to utilize the knowledge of preserving the earth.

==Origins==
[[File:Annarbor tree.jpg|thumb]]

===Origin claims by earth religion sources===
According to [[Marija Gimbutas]], [[Old Europe (archaeology)|pre-Indo-European]] societies lived in small-scale, family-based communities that practiced [[matrilineal succession]] and goddess-centered religion&lt;ref name="From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women in the World"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2002 |last=French |first=Marilyn |title=From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women in the World | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Hyr9pwbqeqoC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Slavic+matrilinear&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iftdUb2HOoq-8AToy4G4BA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Slavic%20matrilinear&amp;f=false |publisher=McArthur}}&lt;/ref&gt; where creation comes from the woman. She is the Divine Mother who can give life and take it away. In [[Irish mythology]] she is [[Danu (Irish goddess)|Danu]], in [[Slavic mythology]] she is [[Mat Zemlya]], and in other cultures she is [[Pachamama]], [[Ninsun]], [[Terra (mythology)|Terra Mater]], [[Nüwa]], [[Matres and Matrones|Matres]] or [[Shakti]].

In the late 1800s, [[James Weir (1856-1906)|James Weir]] wrote an article describing the beginnings and aspects of early religious feeling. According to Boyer, early man was forced to locate food and shelter in order to survive, while constantly being directed by his instincts and senses. Because man's existence depended on nature, men began to form their religion and beliefs on and around nature itself. It is evident that man's first religion would have had to develop from the material world, he argues, because man relied heavily on his senses and what he could see, touch, and feel. In this sense, the [[nature worship|worship of nature]] formed, allowing man to further depend on nature for survival.&lt;ref name="Lust and Religion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weir|first=James|title=Lust and Religion|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26071/26071-h/26071-h.htm|accessdate=19 Mar 2013|format=EBook|date=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paganism (contemporary)|Neopagans]] have tried to make claims that religion started in ways that correspond to earth religion. In one of their published works, ''The Urantia Book'',  another reason for this worship of nature came from a fear of the world around primitive man.&lt;ref name="Urantia Book 2" /&gt;  His mind lacked the complex function of processing and sifting through complex ideas. As a result, man worshiped the very entity that surrounded him every day. That entity was nature. Man experienced the different natural phenomena around him, such as storms, vast deserts, and immense mountains. Among the very first parts of nature to be worshiped were rocks and hills, plants and trees, animals, the elements, heavenly bodies, and even man himself. As primitive man worked his way through nature worship, he eventually moved on to incorporate spirits into his worship.&lt;ref name="Urantia Book 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bright Morning Star|title=The Urantia Book|year=2005|publisher=Uversa Press|location=New York|isbn=0965197220|pages=805–810|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MfMsljJW3gC&amp;pg=PA806&amp;lpg=PA806&amp;dq=%22The+objects+of+worship+were+altogether+suggestive;+they+consisted+of+the+things+of+nature+which+were+close+at+hand,+or+which+loomed+large+in+the+commonplace+experience+of+the+simple-minded+primitive+Urantians%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IqLZ2C00XB&amp;sig=b8eFU33wB5hl6ekR_BZSjG3rpro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f5ZIUZiOLsWTyQHrnoCQBg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20objects%20of%20worship%20were%20altogether%20suggestive%3B%20they%20consisted%20of%20the%20things%20of%20nature%20which%20were%20close%20at%20hand%2C%20or%20which%20loomed%20large%20in%20the%20commonplace%20experience%20of%20the%20simple-minded%20primitive%20Urantians%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these claims may have some merit, they are nonetheless presented from a biased position that cannot be authenticated by traditional and reliable sources. Therefore, their claims can not be relied upon.

===Origins of religion===
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}

The origins of religion can be looked at through the lens of the function and processing of the human mind. [[Pascal Boyer]] suggests that, for the longest period of time, the brain was thought of as a simple organ of the body. However, he claims that the more information collected about the brain indicates that the brain is indeed not a "blank slate."&lt;ref name="Religion Explained"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Pascal|title=Religion Explained|year=2001|publisher=A Member of the Perseus Book club|location=New Work|isbn=0465006965|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans do not just learn any information from the environment and surroundings around them. They have acquired sophisticated cognitive equipment that prepares them to analyze information in their culture and determine which information is relevant and how to apply it. Boyer states that "having a normal human brain does not imply that you have religion. All it implies is that people can acquire it, which is very different."&lt;ref name="Religion Explained" /&gt; He suggests that religions started for the reasons of providing answers to humans, giving comfort, providing social order to society, and satisfying the need of the illusion-prone nature of the human mind.&lt;ref name="Religion Explained" /&gt; Ultimately, religion came into existence because of our need to answer questions and hold together our societal order.

An additional idea on the origins of religion comes not from man's cognitive development, but from the ape. Barbara J. King argues that human beings have an emotional connection with those around them, and that that desire for a connection came from their evolution from apes. The closest relative to the human species is the African ape.&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Barbara J.|title=Evolving God: A Provocative View of the Origins of Religion|year=2007|publisher=Doubleday Religion|location=New York|isbn=0385521553}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 Mar 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  At birth, the ape begins negotiating with its mother about what it wants and needs in order to survive. The world the ape is born into is saturated with close family and friends. Because of this, emotions and relationships play a huge role in the ape's life. Its reactions and responses to one another are rooted and grounded in a sense of [[belongingness]], which is derived from its dependence on the ape's mother and family. Belongingness is defined as "mattering to someone who matters to you ... getting positive feelings from our relationships."&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;  This sense and desire for belongingness, which started in apes, only grew as the [[hominidae|hominid]] (a human ancestor) diverged from the lineage of the ape, which occurred roughly six to seven million years ago.&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;

As severe changes in the environment, physical evolutions in the human body (especially in the development of the human brain), and changes in social actions occurred, humans went beyond trying to simply form bonds and relationships of empathy with others. As their culture and society became more complex, they began using practices and various symbols to make sense of the natural and spiritual world around them. Instead of simply trying to find belongingness and empathy from the relationships with others, humans created and evolved God and spirits in order to fulfil that need and exploration. King argued that "an earthly need for belonging led to human religious imagination and thus to the otherworldly realm of relating to God, gods, and spirits."&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;

==Encompassed religions==
The term ''earth religion'' encompasses any religion that worships the earth, nature or fertility gods or goddesses. There is an array of groups and beliefs that fall under earth religion, such as [[paganism]], which is a polytheistic, nature based religion; [[animism]], which is the worldview that all living entities (plants, animals, and humans) possess a spirit; [[Wicca]], who hold the concept of an earth mother goddess as well as practice ritual magic; and [[druidism]], which equates divinity with the natural world.

Another perspective of earth religion to consider is [[pantheism]], which takes a varied approach to the importance and purpose of the earth, and man's relationship with the planet. Several of their core statements deal with the connectivity humans share with the planet, declaring that "all matter, energy, and life are an interconnected unity of which we are an inseparable part" and "we are an integral part of Nature, which we should cherish, revere and preserve in all its magnificent beauty and diversity. We should strive to live in harmony with Nature locally and globally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WPM Statement of Principles|url=http://www.pantheism.net/manifest.htm|publisher=World Pantheism|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earth also plays a vital role to many Voltaic peoples, many of whom "consider the Earth to be Heaven’s wife",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimoń|first=Henryk|title=The Sacredness of the Earth Among the Konkomba of Northern Ghana|journal=Anthropos|year=2003|volume=98|issue=2|pages=421–443}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Konkomba]] of northern Ghana, whose economic, social and religious life is heavily influenced by the earth. It is also important to consider various Native American religions, such as [[Peyote Religion]], [[Longhouse Religion]], and Earth Lodge Religion.

==Around the world==
April 22 was established as [[International Mother Earth Day]] by the [[United Nations]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/ga10823.doc.htm |title=General Assembly Proclaims 22 April 'International Mother Earth Day' Adopting By Consensus Bolivia-Led Resolution |publisher=United Nations |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but many cultures around the world have been celebrating the Earth for thousands of years. [[Winter solstice]] and [[Summer solstice]] are celebrated with holidays like [[Yule]] and [[Dongzhi Festival|Dongzhi]] in the winter and [[Tiregān]] and [[Kupala]] in the summer.

===Africa===
[[Animism]] is practiced among the [[Bantu peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8rGpO_TzeCsC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=nature+worship+in+Africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XENeUaTVH4ym9gT0uIH4AQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=nature%20worship%20animism&amp;f=false |title=African Traditional Religion in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography p 372}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The [[Dahomey mythology]] has deities like [[Nana Buluku]], [[Gleti]], [[Mawu]],     [[Asase Yaa]], [[Naa Nyonmo]] and [[Xevioso]].

===Europe===
In [[Baltic mythology]], the sun is a female deity, [[Saulė|Saule]], a mother or a bride, and [[Mēness]] is the moon, father or husband, their children being the stars. In [[Slavic mythology]] [[Mokosh]] and [[Mat Zemlya]] together with [[Perun]] head up the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. Celebrations and rituals are centered on nature and harvest seasons. [[Dragobete]] is a traditional [[Romanians|Romanian]] spring holiday that celebrates "the day when the birds are betrothed."

===India===
In [[Hindu philosophy]], the [[yoni]] is the creative power of nature and the [[origin of life]]. In [[Shaktism]], the yoni is celebrated and worshipped during the [[Ambubachi Mela]], an annual fertility festival which celebrates the Earth's [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boloji.com/wfs/wfs082.htm|title=Celebrating The Divine Female Principle|last=Chawla|first=Janet|date=September 16, 2002|publisher=Boloji.com|accessdate=24 December 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100131031243/http://boloji.com/wfs/wfs082.htm| archivedate= 31 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
Although the idea of earth religion has been around for thousands of years, it did not fully show up in popular culture until the early 1990s. ''[[The X-Files]]'' was one of the first nationally broadcast television programs to air [[witchcraft]] and [[Wicca]] (types of earth religion) content. On average, Wiccans - those who practice Wicca - were more or less pleased with the way the show had portrayed their ideals and beliefs. However, they still found it to be a little "sensationalistic". That same year, the movie ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'' was released - also depicting the art of Wicca. Unfortunately, this cinematic feature was not as happily accepted as ''The X-Files'' had been.&lt;ref name="The Juggler"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Juggler|url=http://culture.pagannewswirecollective.com/2010/08/a-time-line-of-wiccan-pop-culture/|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, programs showcasing the aforementioned religious practices - such as ''[[Charmed]]'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' - became widely popular. Although ''Charmed'' focused mostly on witchcraft, the magic they practiced very closely resembled Wicca. Meanwhile, ''Buffy'' was one of the first shows to actually cast a Wiccan character. However, since the shows focus was primarily on [[Vampire|vampires]], the Wiccan was depicted as having supernatural powers, rather than being in-tuned with the Earth.&lt;ref name="The Juggler"/&gt;

Other movies and shows throughout the last few decades have also been placed under the genre of Earth Religion. Among them are two of director [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s most well known films - ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' and ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''. Both movies present human interaction with land, animal, and other nature spirits. Speakers for Earth Religion have said that these interactions suggest overtones of Earth Religion themes.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"&gt;{{cite web|last=krasskova|title=My Top 10 Pagan/Heathen Movies|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/pantheon/2010/11/my-top-10-paganheathen-movies/|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some popular Disney movies have also been viewed as Earth Religion films. Among them are ''[[The Lion King]]'' and ''[[Brother Bear]]''. Those who practice Earth Religion view ''The Lion King'' as an Earth Religion film mainly for the "interconnectedness" and "Circle of Life" it shows between the animals, plants, and life in general. When that link is broken, viewers see chaos and despair spread throughout the once bountiful land. Congruently, ''Brother Bear'' portrays interactions and consequences when humans disobey or go against the animal and Earth spirits.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"/&gt;

Other earth religion movies include ''[[The 13th Warrior]]'', ''[[The Deceivers (film)]]'', ''[[Sorceress (1982 film)]]'', ''[[Anchoress (film)]]'', ''[[Eye of the Devil]]'', ''[[Agora (film)]]'', and ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)]]''. These movies all contain various aspects of earth religion and nature worship in general.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"/&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
[[File:Emirgan 04589.jpg|thumb]]

===Hindrance of progress===
Many religions have negative stereotypes of earth religion and neo-paganism in general. A common critique of the worship of nature and resources of "Mother Earth" is that the rights of nature and [[ecocide]] movements are inhibitors of human progress and development.&lt;ref name="Ecocide is Earth Religion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Wesley|title=Ecocide is Earth Religion|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/human-exceptionalism/322526/ecocide-earth-religion|work=Human Exceptionalism|publisher=National Review Online|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This argument is fueled by the fact that those people socialized into 'western' world views believe the earth itself is not a living being. Wesley Smith believes this is “[[Antihumanism|anti-humanism]] with the potential to do real harm to the human family.”&lt;ref name="Ecocide is Earth Religion"/&gt; According to Smith, earth worshipers are hindering large-scale development, and they are viewed as inhibitors of advancement.

===Negative representatives===
A lot of criticism of earth religion comes from the negative actions of a few people who have been chastised for their actions. One such negative representative of earth religion is [[Aleister Crowley]]. He is believed to be "too preoccupied with awakening magical powers"&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slater|first=Herman|title=Earth Religion News|journal=geraldgardner.com|year=1976|volume=I|issue=1|pages=2–3|url=http://geraldgardner.com/archive/ern/Earth_Religion_News.php|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  instead of putting the well-being of others in his coven. Crowley allegedly looked up to [[George Pickingill|"Old George" Pickingill]], who was another worshipper of nature who was viewed negatively. Critics regarded Pickingill as a Satanist and "England’s most notorious Witch".&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt;

Crowley himself was "allegedly expelled from the Craft because he was a pervert."&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt; He became aroused by torture and pain, and enjoyed being "punished" by women.&lt;ref name="The Great Beast: Aleister Crowley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Symonds|first=John|title=The Great Beast|year=1952|publisher=Roy|isbn=0356036316|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dramatically damaged Crowley’s public image, because of his lifestyle and actions. Many people regarded all followers of earth religion as perverted Satanists.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt;

===Accused of Satanism===
Followers of earth religion have suffered major opprobrium over the years for allegedly being [[Satanism|Satanists]]. Some religious adherents can be prone to viewing religions other than their religion as being wrong sometimes because they perceive those religions as characteristic of their concept of Satan worship. To wit, [[Witchcraft]], a common practice of [[Wicca]]ns, is sometimes misinterpreted as Satan worship by members of these groups, as well as less-informed persons who may not be specifically religious but who may reside within the sphere-of-influence of pagan-critical religious adherents. From the Wiccan perspective, however, earth religion and Wicca lie outside of the phenomenological world that encompasses Satanism.&lt;ref name="What is Wicca?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Wicca?|url=http://www.thecircleofthesacredwell.org/more_info/what_is_wicca.htm|work=An Eclectic Neopagan Circle|publisher=The Circle of the Sacred Well|accessdate=12 March 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="What is Wicca"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wicca: a Neopagan, Earth-centered religion|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/witchcra.htm|work=Religioustolerance.org|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An all-evil being does not exist within the religious perspective of western earth religions. Devotees worship and celebrate earth resources and earth-centric deities. Satanism and Wicca "have entirely different beliefs about deity, different rules for ethical behavior, different expectations from their membership, different views of the universe, different seasonal days of celebration, etc."&lt;ref name="What is Wicca?"/&gt;

Neo-pagans, or earth religion followers, often claim to be unaffiliated with Satanism.&lt;ref name="Neo-Pagan Witchcraft vs Satanism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Neo-Pagan Witchcraft vs Satanism|url=http://www.paganlibrary.com/introductory/neo-pagan_satanism.php|work=Confusions and Distinctions|publisher=The Pagan Library|accessdate=20 March 2013|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-pagans, Wiccans, and earth religion believers do not acknowledge the existence of a deity that conforms to the common Semitic sect religious concept of Satan. Satanism stems from Christianity, while earth religion stems from older religious concepts.&lt;ref name="Is Satanism Pagan?"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vera|first=Diane|title=Is Satanism "Pagan"?|url=http://theisticsatanism.com/pagan/Is-Satanism-Pagan.html|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Accusations of Satanism as Religious Harassment====
Some earth religion adherents take issue with the religious harassment that is inherent in the social pressure that necessitates their having to distance themselves from the often non-uniform, Semitic sect religious concept of Satan worship. Having to define themselves as "other" from a religious concept that is not within their worldview implies a certain degree of outsider-facilitated, informal, but functional religious restriction that is based solely on the metaphysical and mythological religious beliefs of those outsiders. This is problematic because outsider initiated comparisons to Satanism with the intent of condemnation, even when easily refuted, can have the effect of social pressure on earth religion adherents to conform to outsider perception of acceptable customs, beliefs, and modes of religious behavior.

To illustrate, a problem could arise with the "other" than Satanism argument if an earth centered belief system adopted a holiday that a critic considered to be similar or identical to a holiday that Satanists celebrate. Satanists have historically been prone to adopting holidays that have origins in various pagan traditions, ostensibly because these traditional holidays are amongst the last known vestiges of traditional pre-Semitic religious practice in the west. Satanists are, perhaps irrationally, prone to interpreting non-Semitic holidays as anti-Christian and therefore as implicitly representative of their worldview. This is not surprising given the fact that this is, in fact, how many Christians interpret holidays such as [[Samhain]]. In spite of any flawed perceptions or rationale held by any other group, earth centered religion adherents do not recognize misinterpretation of their customs made by outside religious adherents or critics inclusive of Satan worshippers.

Organized Satan worship, as defined by and anchored in the Semitic worldview, is characterized by a relatively disorganized and often disparate series of movements and groups that mostly emerged in the mid-20th century. Thus, their adopted customs have varied, continue to vary, and therefore this moving target of beliefs and customs can not be justifiably nor continuously accounted for by earth centered religious adherents. Once a Satanist group adopts a holiday, social stigma may unjustifiably taint the holiday and anyone who observes it without discrimination as to whence and for what purpose it was originally celebrated. Given these facts, many earth centered religion devotees find comparisons to Satanism intrinsically oppressive in nature. This logic transfers to any and all religious customs to include prayer, magic, ceremony, and any unintentional similarity in deity characteristics (an example is the horned traditional entity Pan having similar physical characteristics to common horned depictions of Satan).

The issue is further complicated by the theory that the intra and extra-biblical mythology of Satan that is present throughout various Semitic sects may have originally evolved to figuratively demonize the heathen religions of other groups. Thus, the concept of Satan, or "the adversary", would have been representative of all non-Semitic religions and, by extension, the people who believed in them. Although, at times, the concept of the "other" as demonic has also been used to characterize competing Semitic sects. Amongst other purposes, such belief would have been extraordinarily useful during the psychological and physical process of cleansing Europe of traditional tribal beliefs in favor of Christianity. This possibility would account for the historical tendency of Christian authorities, for example, to deem most pagan customs carried out in the pagan religious context as demonic. By any modern standard, such current beliefs would violate western concepts of religious tolerance as well as be inimical to the preservation of what remains of the culture of long-persecuted religious groups.

==Ethics==
Because of the vast diversity of religions that fall under the title of ''earth religion'' there is no consensus of beliefs.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyond the Wiccan Rede" /&gt;  However, the [[Ethics|ethical]] beliefs of most religions overlap. The most well-known ethical code is the [[Wiccan Rede]]. Many of those who practice an earth religion choose to be environmentally active. Some perform activities such as recycling or composting while others feel it to be more productive to try and support the earth spiritually.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt; These six beliefs about ethics seem to be universal.

===The Wiccan Rede===
"An [if] it harm none, do what ye will."&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Commonly worded in modern English as "if it doesn't harm anyone, do what you want."&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede"&gt;{{cite web|last=Piper|first=David|title=Wiccan Ethics And The Wiccan Rede|url=http://www.paganlibrary.com/ethics/wiccan_ethics_rede.php|publisher=paganlibrary.com|accessdate=15 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This maxim was first printed in 1964, after being spoken by the priestess Doreen Valiente in the mid-20th century, and governs most ethical belief of Wiccans and some Pagans. There is no consensus of beliefs but this rede provides a starting point for most people's interpretation of what is ethical.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought"&gt;{{cite web|last=McColman|first=Carl|title=Principles of Moral Thought and Action|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Pagan/Ethics-Morality-Community/Principles-of-Moral-Thought-and-Action.html|publisher=Patheos.com|accessdate=14 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiccan Statement of Principles" /&gt;   The [[Wiccan Rede|rede]] clearly states to do no harm but what constitutes as harm and what level of self-interest is acceptable is negotiable.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="All About You" /&gt;  Many Wiccans reverse the phrase into "Do what ye will an it harm none," meaning "Do what you want if it doesn't harm anyone."&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede" /&gt; The difference may not seem significant but it is. The first implies that it is good to do no harm but does not say that it is necessarily unethical to do so, the second implies that all forms of harm are unethical. The second phrase is nearly impossible to follow. This shift occurred when trying to better adapt the phrase into modern English as well as to stress the "harmlessness" of Wiccans. The true nature of the rede simply implies that there is personal responsibility for your actions. You may do as you wish but there is a [[karma]] reaction from every action.&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede" /&gt; Even though this is the most well-known rede of practice, it does not mean that those that choose not to follow it are unethical. There are many other laws of practice that other groups follow.&lt;ref name="Beyond the Wiccan Rede"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lark|title=Beyond The Wiccan Rede - Other Pagan Ethics|url=http://realpagan.net/forum/topics/beyond-the-wiccan-rede-other|publisher=realpagan.net|accessdate=15 Mar 2013|date=22 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Threefold Law===
[[Rule of Three (Wicca)|The Threefold Law]] is the belief that for all actions there is always a cause and effect. For every action taken either the good or ill intention will be returned to the action taker threefold. This is why the Wiccan Rede is typically followed because of fear of the threefold return from that harmful action.&lt;ref name=Threefold&gt;{{cite web|last=Wren|title=The Law of Three|url=http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usfl&amp;c=basics&amp;id=2872|publisher=witchvox.com|accessdate=19 Mar 2013|date=16 Jul 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honor===
[[File:Leaf at Rocky Point of McDonald Lake.jpg|thumb]]
This term is what [[Emma Restall Orr]] calls reverence for the earth in her book ''Living with Honour: A Pagan Ethics''. She separates the term into three sections: courage, generosity and loyalty, or honesty, respect and responsibility. There is no evil force in Nature.&lt;ref name=Honor /&gt;&lt;ref name="WFT Ethics"&gt;{{cite web|title=WFT Ethics|url=http://www.wiccanfamilytemple.org/wft-ethics|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing exists beyond the natural, therefore it is up to the individual to choose to be ethical not because of divine judgment.

The '''Ekeby oak tree''' ({{lang-sv|Ekebyhovseken}}) is an oak tree in [[Ekerö]] outside [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], close to [[Ekebyhov Castle]]. It is the largest living deciduous tree in Sweden by volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3GPBT_mmdo12-ekebyhovseken?guid=da0e67b7-2af4-4a2d-89a3-06665f703190 |title=GC3GPBT MMDO12: Ekebyhovseken (Traditional Cache) in Stockholm, Sweden created by fredrikr |publisher=Geocaching.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="58539">'''Emergy''' is the amount of energy that was consumed in direct and indirect transformations to make a product or service.&lt;ref name="EnvAcct"&gt;{{cite book|first = Howard T.|title = Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making|url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=P-ssAQAAMAAJ|page=370}}|year = 1996|publisher = Wiley|isbn = 978-0-471-11442-0|p = 370|last = Odum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergy is a measure of quality differences between different forms of energy. Emergy is an expression of all the energy used in the work processes that generate a product or service in units of one type of energy. Emergy is measured in units of ''emjoule''s, a unit referring to the available energy consumed in transformations. Emergy accounts for different forms of energy and resources (e.g. sunlight, water, fossil fuels, minerals, etc.) Each form is generated by transformation processes in nature and each has a different ability to support work in natural and in human systems. The recognition of these quality differences is a key concept.

==History==

The theoretical and conceptual basis for the emergy methodology is grounded in [[thermodynamics]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, [[System theory|general system theory]]&lt;ref&gt;von Bertalanffy. L. 1968. [[System theory|General System Theory]]. George Braziller Publ. New York 295 p.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[systems ecology]].&lt;ref name=SysEco&gt;Odum, H. T. 1983.  ''Systems Ecology: An Introduction''.  John Wiley, NY. 644 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution of the theory by [[Howard T. Odum]] over the first thirty years is reviewed in ''Environmental Accounting''&lt;ref name =EnvAcct/&gt; and in the volume edited by C. A. S. Hall titled ''Maximum Power''.&lt;ref name=SelfOrg&gt;Odum, H.T., 1995. Self organization and maximum power. Chapter 28, pp. 311-364 in ''Maximum Power'', Ed. by C .A. S. Hall, University Press of Colorado, Niwot.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===

Beginning in the 1950s, Odum analyzed [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flow]] in ecosystems (''e.g.'' [[Silver Springs, Florida]];&lt;ref name=SilverSprings&gt;Odum, H. T. 1957.  Trophic structure and productivity of Silver Springs, Florida.  ''Ecol. Monogr''. 27:55-112.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enewetak Atoll|Enewetak atoll]] in the south Pacific;&lt;ref name=Eniwetok&gt;Odum, H. T. and E. P. Odum. 1955.  Trophic structure and productivity of a windward coral reef at Eniwetok Atoll, Marshall Islands.  ''Ecol. Monogr.'' 25:291-320.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galveston Bay]], Texas&lt;ref name=Texas&gt;Odum, H. T. and C. M. Hoskin. 1958.  Comparative studies of the metabolism of Texas Bays.  ''Pubi. Inst. Mar. Sci.'', Univ. Tex. 5:16-46.&lt;/ref&gt; and Puerto Rican rainforests,&lt;ref name=PR&gt;Odum, H. T. and R. F. Pigeon, eds. 1970.  ''A Tropical Rain Forest''.  Division of Technical Information, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. 1600 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others) where energies in various forms at various scales were observed. His analysis of energy flow in ecosystems, and the differences in the [[potential energy]] of sunlight, fresh water currents, wind and [[ocean current]]s led him to make the suggestion that when two or more different energy sources drive a system, they cannot be added without first converting them to a common measure that accounts for their differences in energy quality. This led him to introduce the concept of "energy of one kind" as a common denominator with the name "energy cost".&lt;ref name=FoodProd&gt;Odum, H. T. 1967.  Energetics of food production.  In: The ''World Food Problem, Report of the President's Science Advisory Committee, Panel on World Food Supply, Vol. 3''. The Whitehouse. pp. 55-94.&lt;/ref&gt; He then expanded the analysis to model food production in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=FoodProd /&gt; and in the 1970s to [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref name= Congress&gt;Odum, H. T. ''et al.'' 1976.  Net Energy Analysis of Alternatives for the United States.  In ''U.S. Energy Policy: Trends and Goals'',  Part V – Middle and Long-term Energy Policies and Alternatives. 94th Congress 2nd Session Committee Print.  Prepared for the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the U.S. House of Representatives, 66-723, U.S. Govt.  Printing Office, Wash, DC. pp. 254–304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Man&amp;Nature&gt;Odum, H. T. and E. C. Odum. 1976.  ''Energy Basis for Man and Nature''. McGraw-Hill, NY. 297 pp&lt;/ref&gt;

Odum's first formal statement of what would later be termed emergy was in 1973:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Energy is measured by calories, [[btu]]'s, kilowatthours, and other intraconvertable units, but energy has a scale of quality which is not indicated by these measures.  The ability to do work for man depends on the energy quality and quantity and this is measurable by the amount of energy of a lower quality grade required to develop the higher grade. The scale of energy goes from dilute sunlight up to plant matter, to coal, from coal to oil, to electricity and up to the high quality efforts of computer and human [[information processing]].&lt;ref name=AMBIO&gt;Odum, H. T. 1973.  ''Energy, ecology and economics''.  Royal Swedish Academy of Science.  AMBIO 2(6):220-227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1975, he introduced a table of "Energy Quality Factors", kilocalories of sunlight energy required to make a kilocalorie of a higher quality energy,&lt;ref name=NRGQuality&gt;Odum, H. T. 1976.  'Energy quality and carrying capacity of the earth.  Response at Prize Ceremony, Institute de la Vie, Paris.  ''Tropical Ecology'' 16(l):1–8.&lt;/ref&gt; the first mention of the energy hierarchy principle which states that "energy quality is measured by the energy used in the transformations" from one type of energy to the next.

These energy quality factors, were placed on a fossil-fuel basis and called "Fossil Fuel Work Equivalents" (FFWE), and the quality of energies were measured based on a fossil fuel standard with rough equivalents of 1 kilocalorie of fossil fuel equal to 2000 kilocalories of sunlight. "Energy quality ratios" were computed by evaluating the quantity of energy in a transformation process to make a new form and were then used to convert different forms of energy to a common form, in this case fossil fuel equivalents. FFWE's were replaced with coal equivalents (CE) and by 1977, the system of evaluating quality was placed on a solar basis and termed solar equivalents (SE).&lt;ref name=NRGAnalysis&gt;Odum, H. T. 1977.  Energy analysis, energy quality and environment.  In ''Energy Analysis: A New Public Policy Tool'', M. W. Gilliland, ed.  American Association for the Advancement of Science, Selected Symposium No. 9, Wash. DC. Westview Press. pp. 55–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embodied energy===

The term "[[embodied energy]]" was used for a time in the early 1980s to refer to energy quality differences in terms of their costs of generation, and a ratio called a "quality factor" for the calories (or joules) of one kind of energy required to make those of another.&lt;ref name=EnvEdu&gt;Odum, E. C., and Odum, H. T., 1980. Energy systems and environmental education. Pp. 213–231 in: ''Environmental Education- Principles, Methods and Applications'', Ed. by T. S. Bakshi and Z. Naveh. Plenum Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the term embodied energy was used by other groups who were evaluating the fossil fuel energy required to generate products and were not including all energies or using the concept to imply quality, embodied energy was dropped in favor of "embodied solar calories", and the quality factors became known as "transformation ratios".

===Introduction of the term "emergy"===

Use of the term "embodied energy" for this concept was modified in 1986 when [[David M. Scienceman|David Scienceman]], a visiting scholar at the University of Florida from Australia, suggested the term "emergy" and "emjoule" or "emcalorie" as the unit of measure to distinguish emergy units from units of available energy.&lt;ref&gt;Scienceman, D. M., 1987. "Energy and Emergy," in G. Pillet and T. Murota (eds), ''Environmental Economics: The Analysis of a Major Interface,'' R. Leimgruber, Geneva, pp. 257–276. (CFW-86-26)&lt;/ref&gt; The term transformation ratio was shortened to [[transformity]] in about the same time. It is important to note that throughout this twenty years the baseline or the basis for evaluating forms of energy and resources shifted from organic matter, to fossil fuels and finally to solar energy.

After 1986, the emergy methodology continued to develop as the community of scientists expanded and as new applied research into combined systems of humans and nature presented new conceptual and theoretical questions. The maturing of the emergy methodology resulted in more rigorous definitions of terms and nomenclature and refinement of the methods of calculating transformities. The [http://EmergySociety.org International Society for the Advancement of Emergy Research] and a biennial [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611231212/http://www.cep.ees.ufl.edu/conference.asp International Conference] at the University of Florida support this research.

==Definitions and examples==

'''''Emergy'''''— amount of energy of one form that is used in transformations directly and indirectly to make a product or service. The unit of emergy is the '''emjoule''' or emergy joule. Using emergy, sunlight, fuel, electricity, and human service can be put on a common basis by expressing each of them in the emjoules of solar energy that is required to produce them. If solar emergy is the baseline, then the results are solar emjoules (abbreviated seJ). Although other baselines have been used, such as coal emjoules or electrical emjoules, in most cases emergy data are given in solar emjoules.

'''''Unit Emergy Values (UEVs)''''' — the emergy required to generate one unit of output. Types of UEVs:
:'''''Transformity''''' — emergy input per unit of available energy output. For example, if 10,000 solar emjoules are required to generate a joule of wood, then the solar transformity of that wood is 10,000 solar emjoules per joule (abbreviated seJ/J). The solar transformity of the sunlight absorbed by the earth is 1.0 by definition.

:'''''Specific emergy''''' — emergy per unit mass output. Specific emergy is usually expressed as solar emergy per gram (seJ/g). Because energy is required to concentrate materials, the unit emergy value of any substance increases with concentration. Elements and compounds not abundant in nature therefore have higher emergy/mass ratios when found in concentrated form since more environmental work is required to concentrate them, both spatially and chemically.

:'''''Emergy per unit money''''' — the emergy supporting the generation of one unit of economic product (expressed in monetary terms)''.'' It is used to convert money into emergy units. Since money is paid for goods and services, but not to the environment, the contribution to a process represented by monetary payments is the emergy that money purchases. The amount of resources that money buys depends on the amount of emergy supporting the economy and the amount of money circulating. An average emergy/money ratio in solar emjoules/$ can be calculated by dividing the total emergy use of a state or nation by its gross economic product. It varies by country and has been shown to decrease each year, which is one index of inflation. This emergy/money ratio is useful for evaluating service inputs given in money units where an average wage rate is appropriate.

:'''''Emergy per unit labor''''' — the emergy supporting one unit of direct labor applied to a process''.'' Workers apply their efforts to a process and in so doing they indirectly invest in it the emergy that made their labor possible (food, training, transport, etc). This emergy intensity is generally expressed as emergy per time (seJ/yr; seJ/hr), but emergy per money earned (seJ/$) is also used. Indirect labor required to make and supply the inputs to a process is generally measured with the dollar cost of services, so that its emergy intensity is calculated as seJ/$.

:'''''Empower''''' — a flow of emergy (i.e., emergy per unit time)''.''

==Accounting method==

Emergy accounting converts the thermodynamic basis of all forms of energy, resources and human services into equivalents of a single form of energy, usually solar. To evaluate a system, a system diagram organizes the evaluation and account for energy inputs and outflows. A table of the flows of resources, labor and energy is constructed from the diagram and all flows are evaluated. The final step involves interpreting the results.&lt;ref name=EnvAcct /&gt;

===Purpose===

In some cases, an evaluation is done to determine the fit of a development proposal within its environment. It also allows comparison of alternatives. Another purpose is to seek the best use of resources to maximize economic vitality.

===Systems diagram===

[[File:Systems diagram of a city.png|thumb|alt=A systems diagram of a city embedded in its support region showing the environmental energy and non renewable energy sources that drive the region and city system|'''Figure 1''': Energy system diagram of a city in its support region]]
System diagrams show the inputs that are evaluated and summed to obtain the emergy of a flow. A diagram of a city and its regional support area is shown in Figure 1.&lt;ref&gt;Many example diagrams can be found at [http://emergysystems.org/symbols.php EmergySystems.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309041649/http://www.emergysystems.org/symbols.php |date=2010-03-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation table===

A table (see example below) of resource flows, labor and energy is constructed from the diagram. Raw data on inflows that cross the boundary are converted into emergy units, and then summed to obtain total emergy supporting the system. Energy flows per unit time (usually per year) are presented in the table as separate line items.

* Column #1 is the line item number, which is also the number of the footnote found below the table where raw data sources are cited and calculations are shown.
*Column # 2 is the name of the item, which is also shown on the aggregated diagram.
*Column # 3 is the raw data in joules, grams, dollars or other units.
*Column # 4 shows the units for each raw data item.
*Column # 5 is the unit emergy value, expressed in solar emergy joules per unit. Sometimes, inputs are expressed in grams, hours, or dollars, therefore an appropriate UEV is used (sej/hr; sej/g; sej/$).
*Column # 6 is the solar emergy of a given flow, calculated as the raw input times the UEV (Column 3 times Column 5).

All tables are followed by footnotes that show citations for data and calculations.

===Calculating unit values===

The table allows a unit emergy value to be calculated. The final, output row (row “O” in the example table above) is evaluated first in units of energy or mass. Then the input emergy is summed and the unit emergy value is calculated by dividing the emergy by the units of the output.

===Performance indicators===

[[File:EmergyRatios5.png|thumb|alt=a basic diagram showing an economic progress that draws resources from the environment that are both renewable and non renewable energies and feedbacks from the main economy.|'''Figure 2''': Systems diagram showing flows used in the performance indicator ratios]]
Figure 2 shows non-renewable environmental contributions (N) as an emergy storage of materials, renewable environmental inputs (R), and inputs from the economy as purchased (F) goods and services. Purchased inputs are needed for the process to take place and include human service and purchased non-renewable energy and material brought in from elsewhere (fuels, minerals, electricity, machinery, fertilizer, etc.). Several ratios, or indices are given in Figure 2 that assess the global performance of a process.
* '''Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR) —''' Emergy released (used up) per unit invested. The ratio is a measure of how much an investment enables a process to exploit local resources.
* '''Environmental Loading Ratio (ELR''') — The ratio of nonrenewable and imported emergy use to renewable emergy use. It is an indicator of the pressure a transformation process exerts on the environment and can be considered a measure of [[ecosystem]] stress due to a production (transformation activity.
* '''Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI''') — The ratio of EYR to ELR. It measures the contribution of a resource or process to the economy per unit of environmental loading.
* '''Areal Empower Intensity —''' The ratio of emergy use in the economy of a region to its area. Renewable and nonrenewable emergy density are calculated separately by dividing the total renewable emergy by area and the total nonrenewable emergy by area, respectively.

Other ratios are useful depending on the type and scale of the system under evaluation.
* '''Percent Renewable Emergy (%Ren''') — The ratio of renewable emergy to total emergy use. In the long run, only processes with high %Ren are sustainable.
* '''Emprice'''. The emprice of a commodity is the emergy one receives for the money spent in sej/$.
* '''Emergy Exchange Ratio (EER''') — The ratio of emergy exchanged in a trade or purchase (what is received to what is given). The ratio is always expressed relative to a trading partner and is a measure of the relative trade advantage of one partner over the other.
* '''Emergy per capita —''' The ratio of emergy use of a region or nation to the population. Emergy per capita can be used as a measure of potential, average standard of living of the population.
* '''Emergy-based energy return on investment''' was introduced as a way to bridge and improve the concept of [[Energy returned on energy invested]] to also include environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Y.|last2=Feng|first2=L.|last3=Wang|first3=J.|last4=Höök|first4=M|title=Emergy-based energy return on investment method for evaluating energy exploitation|journal=Energy|date=2017|volume=128|issue=6|pages=540–549|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

The recognition of the relevance of energy to the growth and dynamics of [[complex systems]] has resulted in increased emphasis on  environmental evaluation methods that can account for and interpret the effects of matter and energy flows at all scales in systems of humanity and nature. The following table lists some general areas in which the emergy methodology has been employed.

Net-Energy Analysis and the Energy Requirements of Energy Systems. Praeger Publishers, New York, 289 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Emergy theory has been criticized for allegedly offering an energy theory of value to replace other [[Labor theory of value|theories of value]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} The stated goal of emergy evaluations is to provide an "ecocentric" valuation of systems, processes. Thus it does not purport to replace economic values but to provide additional information, from a different point of view.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The idea that a [[calorie]] of sunlight is not equivalent to a calorie of fossil fuel or electricity strikes many as absurd, based on the [[Newton's laws of motion|1st Law]] definition of energy units as measures of heat (i.e. Joule's [[mechanical equivalent of heat]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sciubba, E., 2010. On the Second-Law inconsistency of Emergy Analysis. Energy 35, 3696-3706.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have rejected the concept as impractical since from their perspective it is impossible to objectively quantify the amount of sunlight that is required to produce a quantity of oil. In combining systems of humanity and nature and evaluating environmental input to economies, mainstream economists criticize the emergy methodology for disregarding market values.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

An '''energy being''' or '''astral being''' is a theoretical [[life form]] that is composed of [[energy]] rather than [[matter]]. They appear in [[myth]]s/[[legend]]s, [[paranormal]]/[[UFO]] accounts, and in various works of [[speculative fiction]].

Energy beings are typically rendered as a translucent glowing fluid or as a collection of flames or electrical sparks or bolts; somewhat in common with the representations of [[ghost]]s.

Energy beings have a variety of capacities. The Taelons (from ''[[Earth: Final Conflict]]'') are barely more powerful than mortals, while others such as ''[[Star Trek]]''{{'}}s [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]], ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''{{'}}s Ascended Ancients/Ori, ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]''{{'}}s [[List of Ben 10 characters#Verdona Tennyson|Anodites]], or the Meekrob from ''[[Invader Zim]]'' possess god-like powers.

[[File:Red Knot from The Crossley ID Guide Eastern Birds.jpg|thumb|A species plate from ''The Crossley ID Guide: Eastern Birds'', illustrating different plumages of the [[red knot]]]]
A '''field guide''' is a [[book]] designed to help the reader identify [[wildlife]] (plants or animals) or other objects of natural occurrence (e.g. [[mineral]]s). It is generally designed to be brought into the 'field' or local area where such objects exist to help distinguish between similar objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.illinois.edu/bix/fieldguides/index.html The International Field Guides Database]. Diane Schmidt. Accessed September 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Field guides are often designed to help users distinguish animals and plants that may be similar in appearance but are not necessarily closely related.

It will typically include a description of the objects covered, together with paintings or photographs and an index. More serious and scientific field identification books, including those intended for students, will probably include [[identification key]]s to assist with identification, but the publicly accessible field guide is more often a browsable picture guide organized by family, colour, shape, location or other descriptors.

==History==
Popular interests in identifying things in nature probably were strongest in bird and plant guides. Perhaps the first popular field guide to plants in the United States was the 1893 ''How to Know the Wildflowers'' by "Mrs. William Starr Dana" ([[Frances Theodora Parsons]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 1890, [[Florence Augusta Merriam Bailey|Florence Merriam]] published ''Birds Through an Opera-Glass'', describing 70 common species.  Focused on living birds observed in the field, the book is considered the first in the tradition of modern, illustrated bird guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrow|first=Mark V.|title=A Passion for Birds: American Ornithology after Audubon|date=1998|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691044026|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, now writing as Florence Merriam Bailey (having married the zoologist [[Vernon Orlando Bailey|Vernon Bailey]]), she published ''Handbook of Birds of the Western United States''.  By contrast, the ''Handbook'' is designed as a comprehensive reference for the lab rather a portable book for the field. It was arranged by [[taxonomic order]] and had clear descriptions of [[species]] size, distribution, feeding, and nesting habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kofalk|first=Harriet|title=No Woman Tenderfoot: Florence Merriam Bailey, Pioneer Naturalist|date=1989|publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University Press]]|location=College Station, TX|isbn=0-89096-378-9|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point into the 1930s, features of field guides were introduced by [[Chester A. Reed]] and others such as changing the size of the book to fit the pocket, including colour plates, and producing guides in uniform editions that covered subjects such as garden and woodland flowers, mushrooms, insects, and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunlap|first=Thomas R.|title=In the Field, Among the Feathered: A History of Birders &amp; Their Guides|date=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780199734597|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, [[Roger Tory Peterson]], using his fine skill as an artist, changed the way modern field guides approached identification. Using color plates with paintings of similar species together – and marked with arrows showing the differences – people could use his bird guide in the field to compare species quickly to make identification easier. This technique, the "[[Peterson Identification System]]", was used in most of Peterson's Field Guides from [[animal tracks]] to [[seashell]]s and has been widely adopted by other publishers and authors as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Today, each field guide has its own range, focus and organization.  Specialist publishers such as Croom Helm, along with organisations like the [[Audubon Society]],  the [[RSPB]], the [[Field Studies Council]], [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], [[HarperCollins]], and many others all produce quality field guides.

==Principles==

It is somewhat difficult to generalise about how field guides are intended to be used, because this varies from one guide to another, partly depending on how expert the targeted reader is expected to be.

For general public use, the main function of a field guide is to help the reader identify a bird, plant, rock, butterfly or other natural object down to at least the popular naming level. To this end some field guides employ simple keys and other techniques: the reader is usually encouraged to scan illustrations looking for a match, and to compare similar-looking choices using information on their differences. Guides are often designed to first lead readers to the appropriate section of the book, where the choices are not so overwhelming in number.

Guides for students often introduce the concept of [[identification key]]s. Plant field guides such as ''Newcomb's Wildflower Guide'' (which is limited in scope to the wildflowers of northeastern North America) frequently have an abbreviated key that helps limit the search.&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newcomb|first1=Lawrence|title=Newcomb's Wildflower Guide|date=1977|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-316-60442-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insect guides tend to limit identification to Order or Family levels rather than individual species, due to their diversity.

Many taxa show variability and it is often difficult to capture the constant features using a small number of photographs. Illustrations by artists or post processing of photographs help in emphasising specific features needed to for reliable identification. Peterson introduced the idea of lines to point to these key features. He also noted the advantages of illustrations over photographs:

{{quote|A drawing can do much more than a photograph to emphasize the field marks. A photograph is a record of a fleeting instant; a drawing is a composite of the artist's experience. The artist can edit out, show field marks to best advantage, and delete unnecessary clutter. He can choose position and stress basic color and pattern unmodified by transitory light and shade. ... The artist has more options and far more control .... Whereas a photograph can have a living immediacy a good drawing is really more instructive.  (This passage was written not by Roger Tory Peterson, but by his wife, Virginia Marie Peterson, in the preface to one of Peterson's field guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Roger Tory|title=A Field Guide to the Birds: Eastern and Central North America|date=1989|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|pages=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This passage was also quoted by Law and Lynch (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lists, Field Guides, and the Descriptive Organization of Seeing: Birdwatching as an Exemplary Observational Activity|author1=Law, John  |author2=Michael Lynch|journal= Human Studies|volume= 11|issue= 2/3|date=1988|pages=271–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;)}}

Field guides aid in improving the state of knowledge of various taxa. By making the knowledge of experienced museum specialists available to amateurs, they increase the gathering of information by amateurs from a wider geographic area and increasing the communication of these findings to the specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pearson, D. L.  |author2=Shetterly, J. A. |date=2006|title=How do published field guides influence interactions between amateurs and professionals in entomology? |journal=American Entomologist |volume=52|issue=4|pages=246–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13234">Some individuals and organizations have promoted designs for a [[flag]] representing the planet [[Earth]], though none have been officially recognized as such by any governmental body. The most widely recognized flags associated with Earth are the [[flag of the United Nations]] and the [[Earth Day]] flag.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Listed below are some of the unofficial contenders for a Flag of Earth:

==John McConnell's "Earth Day" flag==
[[File:Earth Day Flag.png|thumb|350px|The Earth Day flag, John McConnell's latest proposal]]
[[File:EarthFlag1.svg|thumb|350px|McConnell's original design]]

A flag designed by [[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]] in 1969 for the first [[Earth Day]] is a dark blue field [[Charge (heraldry)|charged]] with ''[[The Blue Marble]]'', a famous [[NASA]] photo of the [[Earth]] as seen from [[outer space]]. The first edition of McConnell's flag used [[screen-printing]] and used different colors: ocean and land were blue and the clouds were white. McConnell presented his flag to the United Nations as a symbol for consideration.&lt;ref name="Weir"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weir|title=Peace, Justice, Care of Earth|year=2007|publisher=Press On Publishing|isbn=0971749124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the political views of its creator and its having become a symbol of Earth Day, the flag is associated with [[Environmentalism|environmental awareness]], and the celebration of the global community.&lt;ref name="Weir"/&gt; It was offered for sale originally in the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]'', and is the only flag which was endorsed by McConnell.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthflag.net |title=Authentic Earth Flag |publisher=Earthflag.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Blue Marble'' image was placed in the public domain, and the public nature of this image was the basis of a legal battle that resulted in the invalidation of a trademark and copyright that was originally issued to the Earth Day flag through its original promotional entity, World Equity, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabberone.com/Trademarks/CopyrightLaw/Copyrightability/articles/EarthFlagVsAlamoFlag_A.shtml|title=Copyright Law - Copyrightability - Articles - Copyright Protection Not Available for Earth Flag|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This does not invalidate the official history of McConnell's flag, only the official documentation that was issued on it.&lt;ref name="Weir"/&gt;

===One Flag in Space===
The One Flag in Space initiative is an offshoot of the Space Generation Congress (SGC), the Space Generation Advisory Council's yearly world meeting. It promotes usage of the ''Blue Marble'' flag for [[space exploration]] (it does not explicitly mention it being McConnell's design).

==United Nations flag==
[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|350px|The [[Flag of the United Nations]]]]

Adopted in 1946, the [[flag of the United Nations]] has been used to indicate world unity, although it technically only represents the [[United Nations]] itself. It has a geographical representation of the planet, and its high visibility usage makes it a well-known contender for representing Earth. During the planning for NASA's moon landings of the 1960s, it was suggested that a UN flag be used in place of the flag of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Platoff |first=Anne |title=Where No Flag Has Gone Before: Political and Technical Aspects of Placing a Flag on the Moon (NASA Contractor Report 188251) |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |date=August 2003 |url=https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/flag/flag.htm |accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="World Peace Flag" of Universal Peace Congress==
{{main|Peace flag#Earth flag}}
[[File:Peace Congress flag.svg|thumb|350px|Van Kirk's World Peace Flag]]

James William van Kirk, a minister from Youngstown, Ohio, designed in 1913 a [[peace flag]] with [[Rainbow flag|rainbow stripes]], stars and a globe. With this flag, he twice made a peace tour through Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Corien Glaudemans, 'Een vredesapostel uit Ohio', in: ''Den Haag Centraal'', 16 oktober 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Peace Congress]] adopted this flag as its World Peace Flag.&lt;ref&gt;Devere Allen, "The Fight for Peace". 1940. p.553.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Olympic flag ==
[[File:Olympic flag.svg|thumb|right|350px|[[Olympic flag]]]]
Designed by [[Pierre de Coubertin]] in 1914 and adopted in [[Olympic games]] since 1920, the [[Olympic flag]] represents all mankind and has a white bar with 5 interlocking rings of 5 colors. The five rings represent the five [[continent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_1303.pdf|title=The Olympic symbols|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six colors (including the white color of the background) represent all of the world's nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_1303.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== "World Citizen" flag of World Service Authority ==
[[File:World Citizen Flag.svg|thumb|right|350px|World Citizen flag by Garry Davis]]
The [[Global citizenship#World citizen|World Citizen]] is a [[social movement]] for global [[citizenship]] under a proposed [[world government]]. In 1953, one of its activists, [[Garry Davis]], founded the [[World Service Authority]], which sells the [[World Passport]] (a fantasy travel document) with a proposed flag of the world.&lt;ref name="European Council"&gt;[http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/08/st16/st16225.en08.pdf Table of travel documents entitling the holder to cross the external borders and which may be endorsed with a visa - (Parts II and II) and Part V (documents to which visas cannot be affixed].

===James W. Cadle's "Flag of Earth"===
[[File:Flag of Earth.svg|thumb|350px|Flag of Earth by James Cadle]]
Another Earth flag was created around the same time in 1970 by a farmer from [[Homer, Illinois]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flagofearth.org/flown.html|title=The Flag of Earth - Flown|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; named James W. Cadle. Cadle's version of the Earth flag consists of a blue circle representing Earth in the center of the flag, a segment of a large yellow circle representing the sun and a small white circle for the moon, all on a black background. It is particularly popular amongst [[SETI]] researchers and is used by SETI worldwide. {{cn|date=June 2018}} The flag flies at the [[Ohio State University Radio Observatory]] and was lowered to [[half mast]] when [[Carl Sagan]] died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlkop/sagan.html |title=Carl Sagan |publisher=Xs4all.nl |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flag of Earth Co. International was also founded by Cadle which sold the flag. The Flag of Earth became [[public domain]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flagofearth.org/original.html|title=James Cadle's Flag of Earth Home Page|last=Cadle|first=James  W.|date=|website=|publisher=North American AstroPhysical Observatory (NAAPO)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-02|quote="The Flag of Earth is now 34-years-old, and on November 1, 2003, became part of the public domain."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flood risk assessment''' (FRA) is an [[Risk assessment|assessment of the risk]] of [[flood]]ing from all flooding mechanisms, the identification of flood mitigation measures and should provide advice on actions to be taken before and during a flood.

The sources of water which produce floods include:
* [[Groundwater]] (saturated groundwater)
* [[Vadose zone|Vadose]] (water flowing the ground in an unsaturated state)
* Surface water
* Artificial water (burst water mains, canals or reservoirs)
* Rivers, streams or watercourses
* Sewers and drains
*Flooding of low-lying coastal regions due to [[sea level rise]]

For each of the sources of water, different hydraulic intensities occur. Floods can occur because of a combination of sources of flooding, such as high groundwater and an inadequate surface water drainage system. The topography, hydrogeology and physical attributes of the existing or proposed development need to be considered. A flood risk assessment should be an evaluation of the flood risk and the consequences and impact and [http://planningguidance.planningportal.gov.uk/blog/guidance/flood-risk-and-coastal-change/flood-zone-and-flood-risk-tables/table-2-flood-risk-vulnerability-classification/ vulnerability].

''Non-professiona''l flood risk assessments can be produced by members of the public, Architects, environment assessors, or others who are not specifically professionally qualified in this field. However, it is a complex evaluation and such assessments they can be rejected by Authorities as inadequate, or could be considered as negligent in the event of a flooding event, damage and a claim to insurers being made.

'''In the UK, the writing of''' '''''professional''''' '''flood risk assessments''' '''is undertaken by Civil Engineering Consultants'''. They will have membership of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] and are bound by their [https://www.ice.org.uk/ICEDevelopmentWebPortal/media/Documents/About%20Us/ice-code-of-professional-conduct.pdf rules of professional conduct]. A key requirement is to ensure such professional flood risk assessments are independent to all parties by carrying out their professional duties with complete objectivity and impartiality. Their professional advice should be supported by [[professional indemnity insurance]] for such specific professional advice ultimately held with a [[Lloyd's of London]] underwriter.

Professional flood risk assessments can cover single buildings, or whole regions. They can part of a due-diligence process for existing householders or businesses, or can be required in England and Wales to provide independent evidence to a planning application on the flood risk.

==England and Wales==
In England and Wales, the [[Environment Agency]] requires a professional Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) to be submitted alongside planning applications in areas that are known to be at risk of flooding (within flood zones 2 or 3) and/ or are greater than 1ha in area, [[planning permission]] is not usually granted until the FRA has been accepted by the Environment Agency.

===PPS 25 – England only===
Flood Risk Assessments are required to be completed according to the National Planning Policy Framework,&lt;ref&gt;National Planning Policy Framework (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/6077/2116950.pdf) "National Planning Policy Framework"&lt;/ref&gt; which replaces [[Planning Policy Statement]] PPS 25: Development and Flood Risk. The initial legislation (PPG25) was introduced in 2001 and subsequently revised.&lt;ref&gt;HMSO (2006, Revised 2010) [http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/planningpolicystatement25.pdf ''Planning Policy Statement 25: Development and Flood Risk''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215083945/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/planningpolicystatement25.pdf |date=2010-02-15 }}, TSO, London. {{ISBN|978-0-11-754099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PPS 25]] was designed to "strengthen and clarify the key role of the planning system in managing flood risk and contributing to adapting to the impacts of climate change."&lt;ref&gt;Angela  Smith  MP (7 December 2006)
[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100408000121/http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/corporate/planning-policy-flooding Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 25: Flooding], Written Parliamentary Statement&lt;/ref&gt; and sets out policies for local authorities to ensure flood risk is taken into account during the planning process to prevent inappropriate development in high risk areas and to direct development away from areas at highest risk.

In its introduction, PPS25 states "flooding threatens life and causes substantial damage to property [and that] although [it] cannot be wholly prevented, its impacts can be avoided and reduced through good planning and management".&lt;ref&gt;Communities and Local Government (2006) [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080306200436/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/153740 ''Planning Policy Statement 25: Development and Flood Risk: Full Regulatory Impact Assessment'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composition of an FRA===
For a flood risk assessment to be written, information is needed concerning the existing and proposed developments, the Environment Agency modeled flood levels and topographic levels on site. At its most simple (and cheapest) level an FRA can provide an indication of whether a development will be allowed to take place at a site.

An initial idea of the risk of fluvial flooding to a local area can be found on the [http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/subjects/flood/ Environment Agency flood map website].

FRAs consist of a detailed analysis of available data to inform the Environment Agency of flood risk at an individual site and also recommend to the developer any mitigation measures. More costly analysis of flood risk can be achieved through detailed flood modelling to challenge the agency's modelled levels and corresponding flood zones.

The FRA takes into account the risk and impact of flooding on the site, and takes into consideration how the development may affect flooding in the local area. It also includes provides recommendations as to how the risk of flooding to the development can be mitigated.

FRAs should also consider flooding from all sources including fluvial, groundwater, surface water runoff and sewer flooding.

==Northern Ireland==
In 2006, the [[Planning Service]], part of [[Department of the Environment (Northern Ireland)|The Department of the Environment]], published Planning Policy Statement 15 (PPS15): Planning and flood risk.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Environment (2006) [http://www.planningni.gov.uk/index/policy/policy_publications/planning_statements/pps15-flood-risk.pdf Planning Policy Statement 15 (PPS 15): Planning and Flood Risk], The Planning Service, Belfast&lt;/ref&gt;  The guidelines are precautionary and advise against development in flood plains and areas subject to historical flooding. In exceptional cases a FRA can be completed to justify development in flood risk areas. Advice on flood risk assessment is provided to the Planning Service by the [[Rivers Agency]], which is the statutory drainage and flood defence authority for [[Northern Ireland]].

==Republic of Ireland==
In 2009, the [[Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government|Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government]] and [[Office of Public Works]] published planning guidelines requiring local authorities to apply a sequential approach to flood risk management.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Ireland (2009) [http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Planning/FileDownLoad,21708,en.pdf The Planning System and Flood Risk Management], The Stationery Office, Dublin {{ISBN|978-1-4064-2467-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The guidelines require that proposed development in flood risk areas must undergo a justification test, consisting of a flood risk assessment.

The '''hot-filament [[ionization gauge]]''', sometimes called a '''hot-filament gauge''' or '''hot-cathode gauge''', is the most widely used low-pressure (vacuum) measuring device for the region from 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; [[Torr (unit)|Torr]]. It is a [[triode]], with the filament being the [[cathode]].

''Note: Principles are mostly the same for hot-cathode ion sources in [[particle accelerator]]s to create electrons.''

== Function ==
A regulated electron current (typically 10&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere|mA]]) is emitted from a heated [[Electrical filament|filament]]. The electrons are attracted to the [[Helix|helical]] grid by a DC potential of about +150&amp;nbsp;[[Volt|V]]. Most of the electrons pass through the [[control grid|grid]] and collide with gas molecules in the enclosed volume, causing a fraction of them to be ionized. The gas ions formed by the electron collisions are attracted to the central ion collector wire by the negative voltage on the collector (typically −30&amp;nbsp;V). Ion currents are on the order of 1&amp;nbsp;mA/[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]. This current is amplified and displayed by a high-gain differential amplifier/[[electrometer]].

This [[ion current]] differs for different gases at the same pressure; that is, a hot-filament ionization gauge is composition-dependent. Over a wide range of [[molecular]] density, however, the ion current from a gas of constant composition is directly proportional to the molecular density of the gas in the gauge.

==Construction==
[[Image:Varian vacuum gauge.jpg|thumb|left|300 px|Tubulated hot-cathode ionization gauge]]
A hot-cathode ionization gauge is composed mainly of three electrodes, all acting as a [[triode]], wherein the [[cathode]] is the filament. The three electrodes are a collector or plate, a [[hot-cathode|filament]], and a [[control grid|grid]]. The collector current is measured in picoamperes by an [[electrometer]]. The filament voltage to ground is usually at a potential of 30 volts, while the grid voltage at 180–210 volts DC, unless there is an optional [[electron bombardment]] feature, by heating the grid, which may have a high potential of approximately 565 volts.
The most common ion gauge is the hot-cathode '''Bayard–Alpert gauge''', with a small collector inside the grid.&lt;ref&gt;R. T. Bayard and D. Alpert, "Extension of the Low Pressure Range of the Ionization Gauge" Rev. Sci. Instrum. '''21''', 571 (1950); doi: 10.1063/1.1745653.&lt;/ref&gt; A glass envelope with an opening to the vacuum can surround the electrodes, but usually the '''nude gauge''' is inserted in the vacuum chamber directly, the pins being fed through a ceramic plate in the wall of the chamber. Hot-cathode gauges can be damaged or lose their calibration if they are exposed to atmospheric pressure or even low vacuum while hot.

Electrons emitted from the filament move several times in back-and-forth movements around the grid before finally entering the grid. During these movements, some electrons collide with a gas molecule to form a pair of an ion and an electron ([[electron ionization]]). The number of these [[ions]] is proportional to the [[number density|gas molecule density]] multiplied by the electron current emitted from the filament, and these ions pour into the collector to form an ion current. Since the gas molecule density is proportional to the pressure, the pressure is estimated by measuring the ion current.

The low-pressure sensitivity of hot-cathode gauges is limited by the photoelectric effect. Electrons hitting the grid produce X-rays that produce photoelectric noise in the ion collector. This limits the range of older hot-cathode gauges to 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; [[Torr]] and the Bayard–Alpert gauges to about 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; Torr. Additional wires at cathode potential in the line of sight between the ion collector and the grid prevent this effect. In the extraction type the ions are not attracted by a wire but by an open cone. As the ions cannot decide which part of the cone to hit, they pass through the hole and form an ion beam. This ion beam can be passed on to a

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2774">The '''ion vibration current''' ('''IVI''') and the associated '''ion vibration potential''' is an [[electric]] signal that arises when an [[acoustic wave]] propagates through a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] fluid.

Historically, the IVI was the first known [[electroacoustic phenomena|electroacoustic phenomenon]]. It was predicted by [[Peter Debye]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Debye, P. |title=A method for the determination of the mass of electrolyte ions |journal=J. Chem. Phys. |volume=1 |page=13 |year=1933 |doi=10.1063/1.1749213|bibcode=1933JChPh...1...13D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] [[sound wave]] travels through a solvent, the associated pressure gradients push the fluid particles back and forth, and it is easy in practice to create such accelerations that measure thousands or millions of [[g-force|g's]]. If a solute molecule is more dense or less dense than the surrounding liquid, then in this accelerating environment, the molecule will move relative to the surrounding liquid. This relative motion is essentially the same phenomenon that occurs in a [[centrifuge]], or more simply, it is essentially the same phenomenon that occurs when low-density objects float to the top of a glass of water, and high-density particles sink to the bottom (see the [[equivalence principle]], which states that gravity is just like any other acceleration). The amount of relative motion depends on the balance between the molecule's effective mass (which includes both the mass of the molecule itself and any solvent molecules that are so tightly bound to the molecule that they follow along with the molecule's motion), its effective volume (related to [[buoyant force]]), and the viscous drag (friction) between the molecule and the surrounding fluid.

IVI concerns the case where the particles in question are [[anion]]s and [[cation]]s. In general, they will have different amounts of motion relative to the fluid during the sound wave oscillations, and that discrepancy creates an alternating [[electric potential]] between various points in a [[sound wave]].

This effect was extensively used in the 1950s and 1960s for characterizing ion [[solvation]]. These works are mostly associated with the names of Zana and Yaeger, who published a review of their studies in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authors=Zana, R. and Yeager, E. |title=Ultrasonic Vibration Potentials |journal=Mod.

'''Latent heat''' is thermal energy released or absorbed, by a body or a [[thermodynamic system]], during a constant-temperature process — usually a [[Phase_transition#Modern_classifications|first-order phase transition]].

Latent heat can be understood as heat energy in hidden form which is supplied or extracted to change the state of a substance without changing its temperature. Examples are [[latent heat of fusion]] and [[latent heat of vaporization]] involved in [[Phase transition|phase changes]], i.e. a substance condensing or vaporizing at a specified temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was introduced around 1762 by [[Great Britain|British]] [[chemist]] [[Joseph Black]]. It is derived from the Latin ''latere'' (''to lie hidden''). Black used the term in the context of [[calorimetry]] where a heat transfer caused a volume change in a body while its temperature was constant.

In contrast to latent heat, [[sensible heat]] is a heat transfer that results in a temperature change in a body.

==Usage==
The terms ″sensible heat″ and ″latent heat″ refer to types of heat transfer between a body and its surroundings;  they depend on the properties of the body. ″Sensible heat″ is ″sensed″ or felt in a process as a change in the body's temperature. ″Latent heat″ is heat transferred in a process without change of the body's temperature, for example, in a phase change ( solid / liquid / gas ).  

Both sensible and latent heats are observed in many processes of transfer of energy in nature. Latent heat is associated with the change of phase of atmospheric or ocean water,  [[vaporization]], [[condensation]], [[freezing]] or [[melting]], whereas sensible heat is energy transferred that is evident in change of the temperature of the atmosphere or ocean, or ice, without those phase changes, though it is associated with changes of pressure and volume.

The original usage of the term, as introduced by Black, was applied to systems that were intentionally held at constant temperature. Such usage referred to ''latent heat of expansion'' and several other related latent heats. These latent heats are defined independently of the conceptual framework of thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, G.H. (1907). ''Thermodynamics. An Introductory Treatise dealing mainly with First Principles and their Direct Applications'', B.G. Tuebner, Leipzig, pages 9, 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a body is heated at constant temperature by thermal radiation in a microwave field for example, it may expand by an amount described by its ''latent heat with respect to volume'' or ''latent heat of expansion'', or increase its pressure by an amount described by its ''latent heat with respect to pressure''.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C. (1872). ''Theory of Heat'', third edition, Longmans, Green, and Co., London, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Latent heat''' is energy released or absorbed, by a body or a [[thermodynamic system]], during a constant-temperature process.
Two common forms of latent heat are [[enthalpy of fusion|latent heat of fusion]] ([[melting]]) and [[enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]] ([[boiling]]).  These names describe the direction of energy flow when changing from one phase to the next: from solid to liquid, and liquid to gas.

In both cases the change is [[endothermic]], meaning that the system absorbs energy.
For example, when water evaporates, energy is required for the water molecules to overcome the forces of attraction between them, the transition from water to vapor requires an input of energy.

If the vapor then condenses to a liquid on a surface, then the vapor's latent energy absorbed during evaporation is released as the liquid's [[sensible heat]] onto the surface.

The large value of the [[enthalpy]] of condensation of water vapor is the reason that steam is a far more effective heating medium than boiling water, and is more hazardous.

===Meteorology===
In [[meteorology]], latent heat flux is the [[flux]] of heat from the Earth's surface to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that is associated with [[evaporation]] or [[transpiration]] of water at the surface and subsequent [[condensation]] of [[water vapor]] in the [[troposphere]]. It is an important component of Earth's surface energy budget.  Latent heat flux has been commonly measured with the [[Bowen ratio]] technique, or more recently since the mid-1900s by the [[eddy covariance|Jonathan]] [[eddy covariance|Beaver]] method.

==History==
The English word ''[[wikt:latent#English|latent]]'' comes from Latin ''[[wikt:latens#Latin|latēns]]'', meaning ''lying hidden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|latent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Charlton T. (1890). ''An Elementary Latin Dictionary''. Entry for [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0060%3Aentry%3Dlatens latens].&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''latent heat'' was introduced into calorimetry around 1750 when [[Joseph Black]], commissioned by producers of [[Scotch whisky]] in search of ideal quantities of fuel and water for their distilling process,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title= Credit Where It's Due | url           = | accessdate= | series= The Day the Universe Changed | serieslink= The Day the Universe Changed | credits= [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] | network= BBC | date= 1979 | number = 6  | time=50 (34 minutes)}}&lt;/ref&gt; to studying system changes, such as of volume and pressure, when the thermodynamic system was held at constant temperature in a thermal bath. [[James Prescott Joule]] characterised latent energy as the energy of interaction in a given configuration of particles, i.e. a form of [[potential energy]], and the sensible heat as an energy that was indicated by the thermometer,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

|quote=I am inclined to believe that both of these hypotheses will be found to hold good,&amp;mdash;that in some instances, particularly in the case of sensible heat, or such as is indicated by the thermometer, heat will be found to consist in the living force of the particles of the bodies in which it is induced; whilst in others, particularly in the case of latent heat, the phenomena are produced by the separation of particle from particle, so as to cause them to attract one another through a greater space.
}}, Lecture on Matter, Living Force, and Heat. May 5 and 12, 1847&lt;/ref&gt; relating the latter to [[thermal energy]].

==Specific latent heat==
A ''specific'' latent heat (''L'') expresses the amount of energy in the form of heat (''Q'') required to completely effect a phase change of a unit of mass (''m''), usually {{gaps|1|kg}}, of a substance as an [[intensive property]]:
:&lt;math&gt;L = \frac {Q}{m}.&lt;/math&gt;
Intensive properties are material characteristics and are not dependent on the size or extent of the sample. Commonly quoted and tabulated in the literature are the specific latent heat of fusion and the specific latent heat of vaporization for many substances.

From this definition, the latent heat for a given mass of a substance is calculated by
:&lt;math&gt;Q = {m}  {L}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''Q'' is the amount of energy released or absorbed during the change of phase of the substance (in [[kilojoule|kJ]] or in [[BTU]]),
:''m'' is the mass of the substance (in [[kg]] or in [[Pound (mass)|lb]]), and
:''L'' is the specific latent heat for a particular substance (kJ kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or in BTU lb&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), either ''L''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; for fusion, or ''L''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; for vaporization.

==Specific latent heat for condensation of water in clouds==
&lt;!-- Is this dependant on pressure ? - --&gt;
The specific latent heat of condensation of water in the temperature range from −25&amp;nbsp;°C to 40&amp;nbsp;°C is approximated by the following empirical cubic function:
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{water}(T) = (2500.8 - 2.36 T + 0.0016 T^2 - 0.00006 T^3)~\text{J/g},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="RYfit"&gt;[[Curve fitting#Fitting lines and polynomial curves to data points|Polynomial curve fit]]s to Table 2.1. {{cite book |author1=R.

where the temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is taken to be the numerical value in °C.

For [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] and [[deposition (physics)|deposition]] from and into ice, the specific latent heat is almost constant in the temperature range from −40&amp;nbsp;°C to 0&amp;nbsp;°C and can be approximated by the following empirical quadratic function:
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{ice}(T) = (2834.1 - 0.29 T - 0.004 T^2)~\text{J/g}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="RYfit"/&gt;

'''Life extension''' is the idea of extending the human [[life expectancy|lifespan]], either modestly &amp;ndash; through improvements in medicine &amp;ndash; or dramatically by increasing the [[maximum lifespan]] beyond its generally settled limit of 125 years.&lt;ref name=turner&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner BS |title=Can We Live Forever? A Sociological and Moral Inquiry |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2009 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to achieve such dramatic changes, however, does not currently exist.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt;

Some researchers in this area, and "life extensionists", "immortalists" or "longevists" (those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves), believe that future breakthroughs in tissue [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]], [[stem cell]]s, [[regenerative medicine]], [[molecular]] repair, [[gene therapy]], pharmaceuticals, and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] replacement (such as with artificial organs or [[xenotransplantation]]s) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans (agerasia&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|agerasia}}&lt;/ref&gt;) through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition. The ethical ramifications, if life extension becomes a possibility, are debated by [[bioethicist]]s.

The sale of purported anti-aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry. For example, the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the US market generated about $50&amp;nbsp;billion of revenue a year in 2009.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt; The use of such products has not been proven to be effective or safe.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holliday&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10522-008-9170-6 |pmid=18726707 |title=The extreme arrogance of anti-aging medicine |journal=Biogerontology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=223–8 |year=2008 |last1=Holliday |first1=Robin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PositionStatement"/&gt;&lt;ref name= EMBOSENS/&gt;

==Average and maximum lifespan==
{{Main|Senescence}}
During the process of [[aging]], an organism accumulates damage to its [[macromolecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cells]], [[biological tissue|tissues]], and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. Specifically, aging is characterized as and thought to be caused by "genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2013 | title = The hallmarks of aging | journal = Cell | volume = 153 | issue = 6| pages = 1194–1217 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.039 | pmid = 23746838 | pmc = 3836174 | author1 = López-Otín | first1 = C | last2 = Blasco | first2 = M. A. | last3 = Partridge | first3 = L | last4 = Serrano | first4 = M | last5 = Kroemer | first5 = G }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxidation]] damage to cellular contents caused by [[free radicals]] is believed to contribute to aging as well.&lt;ref name="Halliwell B 2007"&gt;Halliwell B, Gutteridge JMC (2007). Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, USA, {{ISBN|019856869X}}, {{ISBN|978-0198568698}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 1383772 | volume=275 | issue=3–6 | title=Oxidative and other DNA damages as the basis of aging: a review | date=September 1992 | pages=305–15 | doi=10.1016/0921-8734(92)90034-M | journal=Mutation Research/DNAging| author1=Holmes | first1=G.

The longest a human has ever been proven to live is 122 years, the case of [[Jeanne Calment]] who was born in 1875 and died in 1997, whereas the maximum lifespan of a [[wildtype]] [[mouse]], commonly used as a model in research on aging, is about three years.&lt;ref name="Mouse Genome Informatics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/other/mouse_facts1.shtml|title=Mouse Facts|publisher=informatics.jax.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of [[DNA repair]], [[antioxidant]] defenses, [[energy metabolism]], [[proteostasis]] maintenance, and recycling mechanisms such as [[autophagy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senescence.info/causes_of_aging.html|title=What Causes Aging? Damage-Based Theories of Aging|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Average lifespan in a population is lowered by [[infant mortality|infant]] and [[child mortality]], which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems. Later in life, vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age-related [[chronic disease]] such as [[cancer]] or [[cardiovascular disease]] play an increasing role in mortality. Extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care, [[vaccinations]], good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]].

[[Maximum lifespan]] is determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s and by environmental factors. Widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as [[nematode]]s, fruit flies, and mice include [[caloric restriction]], [[gene manipulation]], and administration of pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2012 | title = Aging biology: a new frontier for drug discovery | journal = Expert Opin Drug Discov | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 217–229 | doi = 10.1517/17460441.2012.660144 | pmid = 22468953 | author1 = Verdaguer | first1 = E | last2 = Junyent | first2 = F | last3 = Folch | first3 = J | last4 = Beas-Zarate | first4 = C | last5 = Auladell | first5 = C | last6 = Pallàs | first6 = M | last7 = Camins | first7 = A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another technique uses evolutionary pressures such as breeding from only older members or altering levels of extrinsic mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = The evolution of late life | journal = Ageing Res Rev. | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 14–32 | doi = 10.1016/j.arr.2005.06.003 | pmid = 16085467 | author1 = Rauser | first1 = C.

==Strategies ==
{{See also|Ageing#Prevention and reversal}}

===Diets and supplements===
Much life extension research focuses on nutrition—[[diet (nutrition)|diets]] or [[dietary supplement|supplements]]— although there is little evidence that they have an effect. The many diets promoted by anti-aging advocates are often contradictory. {{original research inline|date=January 2015}}

In some studies [[calorie restriction]] has been shown to extend the life of mice, yeast, and rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref name=redmanCR&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = Metabolic and behavioral compensations in response to caloric restriction: implications for the maintenance of weight loss | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 2| page = e4377 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004377 | pmid=19198647 | pmc=2634841 | author=[[Leanne Redman|Redman LM]], Heilbronn LK, Martin CK, de Jonge L, Williamson DA, Delany JP, Ravussin E| bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.4377R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=source6&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holloszy JO|author2= Fontana L | year = 2007 | title = Caloric restriction in humans | journal = Exp Gerontol | volume = 42 | issue = 8| pages = 709–12 | doi=10.1016/j.exger.2007.03.009 | pmid=17482403 | pmc=2020845}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more recent study did not find calorie restriction to improve survival in rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref name=mattisonCR&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2012 | title = Impact of caloric restriction on health and survival in rhesus monkeys from the NIA study | journal = Nature | volume = 489 | issue = 7415| pages = 318–321 | doi=10.1038/nature11432 | pmid=22932268 | pmc=3832985 | author=Mattison JA, Roth GS, Beasley TM, ''et al.''| bibcode=2012Natur.489..318M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans the long-term health effects of moderate caloric restriction with sufficient nutrients are unknown.&lt;ref name='Spindler, 2010'&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spindler |first1=Stephen R. |title=The Future of Aging |pages=367–438 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/978-90-481-3999-6_12 |chapter=Biological Effects of Calorie Restriction: Implications for Modification of Human Aging |isbn=978-90-481-3998-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[free-radical theory]] of [[aging]] suggests that [[antioxidant]] supplements might extend human life. However, evidence suggest that [[beta-Carotene|β-carotene]] supplements and high doses of vitamin&amp;nbsp;E increase mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bjelakovic, Goran|author2= Nikolova, Dimitrinka|author3= Lotte Gluud, Lise|author4= Simonetti Rosa G.|author5= Gluud Christian | year = 2007 | title = Mortality in Randomized Trials of Antioxidant Supplements for Primary and Secondary Prevention, a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 8| pages = 842–857 | doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842 | pmid=17327526}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resveratrol]] is a [[Sir2|sirtuin]] stimulant that has been shown to extend life in animal models, but the effect of resveratrol on lifespan in humans is unclear as of 2011.&lt;ref name=Fer2011&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fernández AF|author2= Fraga MF | title = The effects of the dietary polyphenol resveratrol on human healthy aging and lifespan | journal = Epigenetics | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 870–4 | date = Jul 2011 | pmid = 21613817 | doi = 10.4161/epi.6.7.16499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hormone treatment===
The anti-aging industry offers several [[hormone therapies]]. Some of these have been criticized for possible dangers and a lack of proven effect. For example, the [[American Medical Association]] has been critical of some anti-aging hormone therapies.&lt;ref name=AMA&gt;{{Cite news |first=Bruce |last=Japsen |date=15 June 2009 |title=AMA report questions science behind using hormones as anti-aging treatment |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-06-15/news/0906140132_1_anti-aging-hormones-ama-council |work=[[The Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[growth hormone]] (GH) decreases with age, the evidence for use of growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy is mixed and based mostly on animal studies. There are mixed reports that GH or [[IGF-1]] modulates the aging process in humans and about whether the direction of its effect is positive or negative.&lt;ref name=AgingMaleRev&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sattler FR | title = Growth hormone in the aging male | journal = Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 541–55 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 24054930 | doi = 10.1016/j.beem.2013.05.003 | quote = In animal models, alterations in GH/IGF-1 signaling with reductions in these somatotrophs appear to increase life span. &amp;nbsp;...

Studies relating GH and IGF-1 status to longevity provide inconsistent evidence as to whether decreased (somatopause) or high levels (e.g. acromegaly) of these hormones are beneficial or detrimental to longevity.&amp;nbsp;... It is difficult to reconcile the largely protective effects of GH/IGF-1 deficiency on longevity in animals with the inconsistent or deleterious effects of low levels or declining GH/IGF-1 during human aging.| pmc = 3940699 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The extension of life has been a desire of humanity and a mainstay motif in the history of scientific pursuits and ideas throughout history, from the Sumerian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and the Egyptian [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Smith medical papyrus]], all the way through the [[Taoists]], [[Ayurveda]] practitioners, [[alchemists]], [[hygienist]]s such as [[Luigi Cornaro]], Johann Cohausen and [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]], and philosophers such as [[Francis Bacon]], [[René Descartes]], [[Benjamin Franklin]] and Nicolas [[Condorcet]]. However, the beginning of the modern period in this endeavor can be traced to the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th century, to the so-called "[[fin-de-siècle]]" (end of the century) period, denoted as an "end of an epoch" and characterized by the rise of scientific optimism and therapeutic activism, entailing the pursuit of life extension (or life-extensionism). Among the foremost researchers of life extension at this period were the Nobel Prize winning biologist [[Elie Metchnikoff]] (1845-1916) -- the author of the cell theory of immunity and vice director of Institut Pasteur in Paris, and [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]] (1817-1894) -- the president of the French Biological Society and one of the founders of modern endocrinology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Ilia|title=A History of Life-Extensionism in the Twentieth Century|date=2014|publisher=Longevity History|isbn=1500818577|url=http://www.longevityhistory.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] claims that science has been tied to a cultural narrative of conquering death since the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. He cites [[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626) as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life, noting Bacon's novel ''[[New Atlantis]]'', wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life. [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691), founding member of the [[Royal Society]], also hoped that science would make substantial progress with life extension, according to Hughes, and proposed such experiments as "to replace the blood of the old with the blood of the young". Biologist [[Alexis Carrel]] (1873–1944) was inspired by a belief in indefinite human lifespan that he developed after experimenting with [[Cell (biology)|cells]], says Hughes.&lt;ref name="HughesTranshumanism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=James|author-link=James Hughes (sociologist)|title=Leadership in Science and Technology: A Reference Handbook|date=October 20, 2011|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|isbn=1452266522|page=587|chapter=Transhumanism|editor1-last=Bainbridge|editor1-first=William|editor1-link=William Sims Bainbridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the [[American Aging Association]] was formed under the impetus of [[Denham Harman]], originator of the [[free radical theory]] of [[aging]]. Harman wanted an organization of [[biogerontologist]]s that was devoted to research and to the sharing of information among scientists interested in extending human lifespan.

In 1976, futurists Joel Kurtzman and Philip Gordon wrote ''No More Dying. The Conquest Of Aging And The Extension Of Human Life'', ({{ISBN|0-440-36247-4}}) the first popular book on research to extend human lifespan. Subsequently, Kurtzman was invited to testify before the House Select Committee on Aging, chaired by [[Claude Pepper]] of Florida, to discuss the impact of life extension on the Social Security system.

[[Saul Kent]] published ''The Life Extension Revolution'' ({{ISBN|0-688-03580-9}}) in 1980 and created a [[nutraceutical]] firm called the [[Life Extension Foundation]], a non-profit organization that promotes dietary supplements. The Life Extension Foundation publishes a periodical called ''Life Extension Magazine''. The 1982 bestselling book ''[[Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach]]'' ({{ISBN|0-446-51229-X}}) by [[Durk Pearson]] and [[Sandy Shaw (writer)|Sandy Shaw]] further popularized the phrase "life extension".

Regulatory and legal struggles between the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and the Life Extension Foundation included seizure of merchandise and court action. In 1991, [[Saul Kent]] and Bill Faloon, the principals of the Foundation, were jailed. The LEF accused the FDA of perpetrating a "Holocaust" and "seeking gestapo-like power" through its regulation of drugs and marketing claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Ty |last=Clevenger |date=Summer 2000 |title=Internet pharmacies: cyberspace versus the regulatory state |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3048/is_2_15/ai_n28816595/ |journal=Journal of Law and Health |accessdate=17 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918191534/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3048/is_2_15/ai_n28816595/ |archivedate=18 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] published "The Immortal Cell: One Scientist's Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging," by [[Michael D. West]]. West emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=West, Michael D. |title=The Immortal Cell: One Scientist's Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZnuAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978-0-385-50928-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modern life extensionists include writer [[Gennady Stolyarov II|Gennady Stolyarov]], who insists that death is "the enemy of us all, to be fought with medicine, science, and technology";&lt;ref name="stolyarov"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Stolyarov|first1 = Gennady|title = Death is Wrong|date = November 25, 2013|publisher = Rational Argumentator Press|isbn = 978-0615932040|url = http://rationalargumentator.com/Death_is_Wrong_Second_Edition_Full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosopher [[Zoltan Istvan]], who proposes that the "transhumanist must safeguard one's own existence above all else";&lt;ref name="istvan"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Istvan|first1=Zoltan|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zoltan-istvan/the-three-laws-of-transhu_b_5853596.html |title=The Morality of Artificial Intelligence and the Three Laws of Transhumanism |publisher=Huffington Post |date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; futurist [[George Dvorsky]], who considers aging to be a problem that desperately needs to be solved;&lt;ref name=aja&gt;{{cite web|title=Futurist: 'I will reap benefits of life extension'|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/fault-lines/articles/2015/5/7/futurist-itll-start-to-become-ridiculous-not-to-talk-about-curing-aging.html|website=Al Jazeera America|date=May 7, 2015|quote=To Dvorsky, aging is a problem that’s desperately in need of solving.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recording artist [[Steve Aoki]], who has been called "one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension".&lt;ref name=tez&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tez|first1=Riva Melissa|title=Steve Aoki, Dan Bilzerian, a giraffe and the search for eternal life|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/steve-aoki-dan-bilzerian-a-giraffe-and-the-search-for-eternal-life|website=i-D|publisher=VICE|date=May 11, 2015|quote=Unknown to most, Steve is both an undeniable champion of life expansion as well as one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension.

[...] Set up by the Steve Aoki Charitable Fund, the profits from the Dan Bilzerian party went to life extension research.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific research===

In 1991, the [[American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine]] (A4M) was formed. The [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] recognizes neither anti-aging medicine nor the A4M's professional standing.&lt;ref name="NYTPoison"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Alex |last= Kuczynski |date=12 April 1998 |title=Anti-Aging Potion Or Poison? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/12/style/anti-aging-potion-or-poison.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Aubrey de Grey]] and [[David Gobel]] formed the [[Methuselah Foundation]], which gives financial grants to anti-aging research projects. In 2009, de Grey and several others founded the [[SENS Research Foundation]], a California-based scientific research organization which conducts research into aging and funds other anti-aging research projects at various universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sens.org/files/pdf/2011_Research_Report.pdf research report 2011]. Sens Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Google]] announced [[Calico (company)|Calico]], a new company based in San Francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/03/tech/innovation/google-calico-aging-death/|title=How Google's Calico aims to fight aging and 'solve death'|author=Arion McNicoll, Arion |date=3 October 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is led by [[Arthur D.

Barron]], [[David Botstein]], and [[Cynthia Kenyon]]. In 2014, biologist [[Craig Venter]] founded Human Longevity Inc., a company dedicated to scientific research to end aging through genomics and cell therapy. They received funding with the goal of compiling a comprehensive human genotype, microbiome, and phenotype database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/human-longevity-inc-hli-launched-to-promote-healthy-aging-using-advances-in-genomics-and-stem-cell-therapies-248379091.html|title=Human Longevity Inc.

Aside from private initiatives, aging research is being conducted in university laboratories, and includes universities such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. University researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/05/health/young-blood-mice-aging/|title=Young blood makes old mice more youthful|author=Landau, Elizabeth |date=5 May 2014|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/gdf11-protein-aging-mice-harvard/31929/ "Harvard researchers find protein that could reverse the aging process"].

==Ethics and politics ==
Politics relevant to the substances of life extension pertain mostly to communications and availability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;!--Need some clarification here. The title implies the discussion is on the politics/ethics of all life extension practices, not just marketing of pharma/surgery--&gt;

In the [[United States]], product claims on food and drug labels are strictly regulated. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] ([[freedom of speech]]) protects third-party publishers' rights to distribute fact, opinion and speculation on life extension practices. Manufacturers and suppliers also provide informational publications, but because they market the substances, they are subject to monitoring and enforcement by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), which polices claims by marketers. What constitutes the difference between truthful and false claims is hotly debated and is a central controversy in this arena.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}&lt;!--This is just the opening paragraph, describing the political arena and stage of conflict. More to follow.--&gt;

===Scientific controversy===
Some critics dispute the portrayal of aging as a disease. For example, [[Leonard Hayflick]], who determined that [[fibroblast]]s are limited to around 50&amp;nbsp;cell divisions, reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of [[entropy]]. Hayflick and fellow [[biogerontologist]]s [[S. Jay Olshansky|Jay Olshansky]] and Bruce Carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to what they see as unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti-aging [[dietary supplement|supplements]].&lt;ref name="PositionStatement"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Position statement on human aging |journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences |volume=57 |issue=8 |pages=B292–7 |date=1 August 2002 |pmid=12145354 |doi=10.1093/gerona/57.8.B292|author1=Olshansky |first1=S. J. |last2=Hayflick |first2=L |last3=Carnes |first3=B. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This may be a good place to link into the broader social debate on life extension ethics. Hayflick is not the only one to object to the portrayal/treatment of aging as a disease. Many doctors, social scientists, feminists, etc. do too--&gt;

===Consumer motivations ===
Research by Sobh and Martin (2011) suggests that people buy anti-aging products to obtain a hoped-for self (e.g., keeping a youthful skin) or to avoid a feared-self (e.g., looking old). The research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped-for self, it is expectations of success that most strongly drive their motivation to use the product. The research also shows why doing badly when trying to avoid a feared self is more motivating than doing well. When product use is seen to fail it is more motivating than success when consumers seek to avoid a feared-self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2011 | title = Feedback Information and Consumer Motivation.

===Political parties===
Though many scientists state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imminst.org/cureaging/ |title=Scientists' Open Letter on Aging |publisher=Imminst.org |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; that life extension and radical life extension are possible, there are still no international or national programs focused on radical life extension. There are political forces staying for and against life extension. By 2012, in Russia, the United States, Israel, and the Netherlands, the Longevity political parties started. They aimed to provide political support to radical life extension research and technologies, and ensure the fastest possible and at the same time soft transition of society to the next step – life without aging and with radical life extension, and to provide access to such technologies to most currently living people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php |title=A Single-Issue Political Party for Longevity Science |publisher=Fightaging.org |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silicon Valley===
Some tech innovators and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have invested heavily into anti-aging research. This includes [[Larry Ellison]] (founder of [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]), [[Peter Thiel]] (former [[Paypal]] CEO),&lt;ref&gt;Veritas Forum Q&amp;A with Peter Thiel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQHrJvwnOzo&amp;list=PLCNNepS_4NcyOSlUdWOcTUCeUbK8nuywQ&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Page]] (co-founder of [[Google]]), and [[Peter Diamandis]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/silicon-valleys-quest-to-live-forever&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentators===
[[Leon Kass]] (chairman of the US [[President's Council on Bioethics]] from 2001 to 2005) has questioned whether potential exacerbation of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] problems would make life extension unethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Simon |last=Smith |date=3 December 2002 |title=Killing Immortality |url=http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040607195722/http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4 |archivedate=7 June 2004 |publisher=Betterhumans |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states his opposition to life extension with the words:
{{Quote|"simply to covet a prolonged life span for ourselves is both a sign and a cause of our failure to open ourselves to procreation and to any higher purpose ... [The] desire to prolong youthfulness is not only a childish desire to eat one's life and keep it; it is also an expression of a childish and [[narcissistic]] wish incompatible with devotion to posterity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Leon |last=Kass |authorlink= Leon Kass |year=1985 |title=Toward a more natural science: biology and human affairs |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-02-918340-3 |oclc=11677465 |page= 316}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Harris, former editor-in-chief of the Journal of Medical Ethics, argues that as long as life is worth living, according to the person himself, we have a powerful moral imperative to save the life and thus to develop and offer life extension therapies to those who want them.&lt;ref&gt;Harris J. (2007) ''Enhancing Evolution: The ethical case for making better people''. Princeton University Press, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transhumanist]] [[philosopher]] [[Nick Bostrom]] has argued that any technological advances in life extension must be equitably distributed and not restricted to a privileged few.&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"&gt;{{Cite news |first=John |last=Sutherland |date=9 May 2006 |title=The ideas interview: Nick Bostrom |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/may/09/academicexperts.genetics |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 17 July 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an extended metaphor entitled "The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant", Bostrom envisions death as a monstrous dragon who demands human sacrifices. In the fable, after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed, the dragon is finally killed. Bostrom argues that political inaction allowed many preventable human deaths to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Bostrom, N |title=The fable of the dragon tyrant |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=273–7 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15863685 |pmc=1734155 |doi= 10.1136/jme.2004.009035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overpopulation concerns===

Controversy about life extension is due to fear of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and possible effects on society.&lt;ref name="Superlongevity Without Overpopulation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2005/02/superlongevity-without-overpopulation-1.php|title=Superlongevity Without Overpopulation|work=Fight Aging!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biogerontologist [[Aubrey De Grey]] counters the overpopulation critique by pointing out that the therapy could postpone or eliminate [[menopause]], allowing women to space out their pregnancies over more years and thus ''decreasing'' the yearly population growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-ethics-of-anti-aging-by-peter-singer|title=Peter Singer on Should We Live to 1,000? – Project Syndicate|work=Project Syndicate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the philosopher and futurist [[Max More]] argues that, given the fact the worldwide population growth rate is slowing down and is projected to eventually stabilize and begin falling, superlongevity would be unlikely to contribute to overpopulation.&lt;ref name="Superlongevity Without Overpopulation"/&gt;

===Opinion polls===

A Spring 2013 [[Pew Research]] poll in the United States found that 38% of Americans would want life extension treatments, and 56% would reject it. However, it also found that 68% believed most people would want it and that only 4% consider an "ideal lifespan" to be more than 120 years. The median "ideal lifespan" was 91 years of age and the majority of the public (63%) viewed medical advances aimed at prolonging life as generally good. 41% of Americans believed that radical life extension (RLE) would be good for society, while 51% said they believed it would be bad for society.&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt; One possibility for why 56% of Americans claim they would reject life extension treatments may be due to the cultural perception that living longer would result in a longer period of decrepitude, and that the elderly in our current society are unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Magalhães JP | year = 2014 | title = The scientific quest for lasting youth: prospects for curing aging | journal = Rejuvenation Res | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 458–67 | doi = 10.1089/rej.2014.1580 | pmid = 25132068 | pmc = 4203147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious people are no more likely to oppose life extension than the unaffiliated,&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/|title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans’ Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension|date=6 August 2013|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some variation exists between religious denominations.

==Aging as a disease==
Mainstream medical organizations and practitioners do not consider aging to be a disease. [[David Sinclair (biologist)|David Sinclair]] says: "I&amp;nbsp;don't see aging as a disease, but as a collection of quite predictable diseases caused by the deterioration of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hayden EC | year = 2007 | title = A new angle on 'old' | journal = Nature | volume = 450 | issue = 7170| pages = 603–603 | doi = 10.1038/450603a | pmid=18046373| bibcode = 2007Natur.450..603H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main arguments used are that aging is both inevitable and universal while diseases are not.&lt;ref&gt;Hamerman D. (2007) ''Geriatric Bioscience: The link between aging &amp; disease''. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not everyone agrees. Harry R. Moody, director of academic affairs for [[AARP]], notes that what is normal and what is disease strongly depend on a historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moody HR|title=Who's afraid of life extension?|journal= Generations|volume=25|issue= 4 |year=2002|pages= 33–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Gems, assistant director of the Institute of Healthy Ageing, argues that aging should be viewed as a disease.&lt;ref name=Gems1&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gems D | year = 2011 | title = Aging: To Treat, or Not to Treat? The possibility of treating aging is not just an idle fantasy | journal = American Scientist | volume = 99 | issue = 4| pages = 278–80 | doi = 10.1511/2011.91.278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the universality of aging, David Gems notes that it is as misleading as arguing that [[Basenji]] are not dogs because they do not bark.&lt;ref name=Gems2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gems D | year = 2011 | title = Tragedy and delight: the ethics of decelerated ageing | journal = Philos Trans R Soc B | volume = 366 | issue = 1561| pages = 108–112 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0288| pmc = 3001315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the universality of aging he calls it a "special sort of disease". Robert M. Perlman, coined the terms "aging syndrome" and "disease complex" in 1954 to describe aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Perlman RM | year = 1954 | title = The aging syndrome | journal = J Am Geriatr Soc | volume = 2 | pages = 123–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion whether aging should be viewed as a disease or not has important implications. One view is, this would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the United States of America, it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the FDA. Anti-aging now falls under the regulations for cosmetic medicine which are less tight than those for drugs.&lt;ref name=Gems2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 15197284| year = 2004| author1 = Mehlman| first1 = M.

==Research==
Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan in humans could be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues, reversal of harmful epigenetic changes, or the enhancement of enzyme [[telomerase]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rando TA|author2= Chang HY|authorlink2=Howard Y.

Research geared towards life extension strategies in various organisms is currently under way at a number of academic and private institutions. Since 2009, investigators have found ways to increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by 10-fold; the record in nematodes was achieved through [[genetic engineering]] and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and [[caloric restriction]].&lt;ref name=Shmookle&gt;{{cite journal | date = 2009 | title = Extreme-longevity mutations orchestrate silencing of multiple signaling pathways| journal = Biochim Biophys Acta | volume = 1790 | issue = 10| pages = 1075–83 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.05.011 | pmid = 19465083 | pmc=2885961| author1 = Shmookler Reis| first1 = R. J.| last2 = Bharill| first2 = P| last3 = Tazearslan| first3 = C| last4 = Ayyadevara| first4 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 review of longevity research noted: "Extrapolation from worms to mammals is risky at best, and it cannot be assumed that interventions will result in comparable life extension factors. Longevity gains from dietary restriction, or from mutations studied previously, yield smaller benefits to Drosophila than to nematodes, and smaller still to mammals. This is not unexpected, since mammals have evolved to live many times the worm's lifespan, and humans live nearly twice as long as the next longest-lived primate. From an evolutionary perspective, mammals and their ancestors have already undergone several hundred million years of natural selection favoring traits that could directly or indirectly favor increased longevity, and may thus have already settled on gene sequences that promote lifespan. Moreover, the very notion of a "life-extension factor" that could apply across taxa presumes a linear response rarely seen in biology."&lt;ref name=Shmookle/&gt;

===Anti-aging drugs===

There are a number of chemicals intended to slow the aging process currently being studied in [[animal model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Childs et al. (2015). [http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v21/n12/full/nm.4000.html Cellular senescence in aging and age-related disease: from mechanisms to therapy] Nature Medicine {{doi|10.1038/nm.4000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of research is related to the observed effects of a [[calorie restriction]] (CR) diet, which has been shown to extend lifespan in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last2 = Shanmuganayagam| first1 = M. | first2 = D.| last1 = Anderson| title = Caloric restriction and aging: studies in mice and monkeys| last3 = Weindruch | first3 = R.| journal = Toxicologic pathology| volume = 37| issue = 1| pages = 47–51| year = 2009| pmid = 19075044| doi = 10.1177/0192623308329476| pmc = 3734859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on that research, there have been attempts to develop drugs that will have the same effect on the aging process as a caloric restriction diet, which are known as [[Caloric restriction mimetic]] drugs.  Some drugs that are already approved for other uses have been studied for possible longevity effects on laboratory animals because of a possible CR-mimic effect; they include [[rapamycin]],&lt;ref name=source25&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = Rapamycin fed late in life extends lifespan in genetically heterogeneous mice | journal = Nature | volume = 460 |pages = 392–5 | doi=10.1038/nature08221 | pmid=19587680 | pmc=2786175 | author=Harrison DE, Strong R, Sharp ZD, ''et al.''| bibcode=2009Natur.460..392H }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[metformin]] and other [[geroprotector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2005 | title = Identification of Potential Caloric Restriction Mimetics by Microarray Profiling | journal = Physiological Genomics | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 343–50 | pmid = 16189280 | doi=10.1152/physiolgenomics.00069.2005 | author=Dhahbi JM, Mote PL, Fahy GM, Spindler SR}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MitoQ]], [[resveratrol]] and [[pterostilbene]] are [[dietary supplements]] that have also been studied in this context.&lt;ref name=Kaeberlein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaeberlein|first=Matt|title=Resveratrol, pterostilbene and rapamycin:are they anti-aging drugs?|journal=BioEssays|year=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=96–99|doi=10.1002/bies.200900171|pmid=20091754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Low Dose of Dietary Resveratrol Partially Mimics Caloric Restriction and Retards Aging Parameters in Mice | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 3| issue = 6| pages = e2264| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0002264 | pmid=18523577 | pmc=2386967 | year=2008 | author=Barger JL, Kayo T, Vann JM, ''et al.''| bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2264B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23691264 | doi=10.1155/2013/575482 | volume=2013 | title=A review of pterostilbene antioxidant activity and disease modification | pmc=3649683 | year=2013 | journal=Oxid Med Cell Longev | page=575482 | author=McCormack D, McFadden D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other attempts to create anti-aging drugs have taken different research paths. One notable direction of research has been research into the possibility of using the enzyme [[telomerase]] in order to counter the process of [[telomere shortening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Telomeres and Telomerase Basic Science Implications for Aging | journal = American Geriatrics Society | volume = 49 | issue = 8| pages = 1105–1109 | doi = 10.1046/j.1532-5415.2001.49217.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are potential dangers in this, since some research has also linked telomerase to cancer and to tumor growth and formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0147| pmid = 16179494| title = Telomerase and Cancer: Kirk A.

===Nanotechnology===
Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated [[Cell (biology)|cell]] repair machines, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical molecular [[computers]], in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]]. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=[[The Singularity Is Near]] |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical [[nanomachines]] (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Cloning and body part replacement===
Some life extensionists suggest that [[therapeutic cloning]] and [[stem cell]] research could one day provide a way to generate cells, body parts, or even entire bodies (generally referred to as [[reproductive cloning]]) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient. Recently, the US Department of Defense initiated a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Donald |last=Melanson |date=April 22, 2008 |title=DoD establishes institute tasked with regrowing body parts |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/04/22/dod-establishes-institute-tasked-with-regrowing-body-parts/ |publisher=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex biological structures, such as mammalian joints and limbs, have not yet been replicated. Dog and primate brain transplantation experiments were conducted in the mid-20th century but failed due to [[transplant rejection|rejection]] and the inability to restore nerve connections. As of 2006, the implantation of bio-engineered bladders grown from patients' own cells has proven to be a viable treatment for bladder disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Roxanne |last=Khamsi |date=April 4, 2006 |title=Bio-engineered bladders successful in patients |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8939-bioengineered-bladders-successful-in-patients.html |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of body part replacement and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life-extension technologies.

The use of human [[stem cells]], particularly [[embryonic stem cells]], is controversial. Opponents' objections generally are based on interpretations of religious teachings or ethical considerations.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Proponents of stem cell research point out that cells are routinely formed and destroyed in a variety of contexts. Use of stem cells taken from the umbilical cord or parts of the adult body may not provoke controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Christine |last=White |date=19 August 2005 |title=Umbilical stem cell breakthrough |url=http://www.stemcellnews.com/articles/stem-cells-umbilical-breakthrough.htm |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=17 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720054316/http://www.stemcellnews.com/articles/stem-cells-umbilical-breakthrough.htm |archivedate=20 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversies over cloning are similar, except general public opinion in most countries stands in opposition to [[reproductive cloning]]. Some proponents of therapeutic cloning predict the production of whole bodies, lacking consciousness, for eventual brain transplantation.

===Cyborgs===
{{Main|Cyborg}}
Replacement of biological (susceptible to diseases) organs with mechanical ones could extend life. This is the goal of the [[2045 Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;David Segal for the New York Times. 1 June 2013 [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/business/dmitry-itskov-and-the-avatar-quest.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 This Man Is Not a Cyborg. Yet.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryonics===
{{Main|Cryonics}}
For cryonicists (advocates of [[cryopreservation]]), storing the body at low temperatures after death may provide an "ambulance" into a future in which advanced medical technologies may allow resuscitation and repair. They speculate [[cryogenic]] temperatures will minimize changes in biological tissue for many years, giving the medical community ample time to cure all disease, rejuvenate the aged and repair any damage that is caused by the [[cryopreservation]] process.

Many cryonicists do not believe that [[legal death]] is "[[Medical definition of death|real death]]" because stoppage of [[heart rate|heartbeat]] and [[breath]]ing—the usual medical criteria for legal death—occur before biological death of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the body. Even at room [[temperature]], cells may take hours to die and days to [[decompose]]. Although [[neurological]] damage occurs within 4–6 minutes of cardiac arrest, the irreversible [[neurodegenerative disease|neurodegenerative]] processes do not manifest for hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Neuronal necrosis after middle cerebral artery occlusion in Wistar rats progresses at different time intervals in the caudoputamen and the cortex |journal=Stroke |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=636–42; discussion 643 |date=1995 |pmid=7709411 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.26.4.636 |author=Garcia JH, Liu KF, Ho KL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryonicists {{who|date=July 2017}}state that rapid cooling and [[heart|cardio]]-[[lung|pulmonary]] support applied immediately after certification of death can preserve [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[biological tissue|tissues]] for long-term preservation at [[cryogenic]] [[temperature]]s. People, particularly children, have survived up to an hour without heartbeat after submersion in ice water. In one case, full recovery was reported after 45 minutes underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Full recovery after 45 min accidental submersion |journal=Intensive Care Medicine |volume=28 |issue=4 |page=524 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11967613 |doi=10.1007/s00134-002-1245-2 |author=Perk L, Borger van de Burg F, Berendsen HH, van't Wout JW}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate rapid preservation of cells and tissue, cryonics "standby teams" are available to wait by the bedside of patients who are to be cryopreserved to apply cooling and cardio-pulmonary support as soon as possible after declaration of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcor.org/BecomeMember/standby.html |title=Comprehensive Member Standby |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[mammal]] has been successfully cryopreserved and brought back to life, with the exception of [[embryo cryopreservation|frozen human embryos]]. Resuscitation of a postembryonic human from [[cryonics]] is not possible with current science. Some scientists still support the idea based on their expectations of the [[technological singularity|capabilities of future science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imminst.org/cryonics_letter/ |title=Scientists' Open Letter on Cryonics |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcor.org/AboutCryonics/index.html |title=Advances in Cryonics |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategies for engineered negligible senescence===
{{Main|Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence|Genetics of aging}}
Another proposed life extension technology would combine existing and predicted future biochemical and genetic techniques. SENS proposes that rejuvenation may be obtained by removing aging damage via the use of [[stem cell]]s and [[tissue engineering]], [[telomere]]-lengthening machinery, [[allotopic expression]] of [[mitochondrial]] proteins, targeted ablation of cells, [[immunotherapy|immunotherapeutic]] clearance, and novel [[lysosome|lysosomal]] [[hydrolases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Aubrey |last=de Grey |authorlink=Aubrey de Grey |author2=Michael Rae |title=[[Ending Aging|Ending Aging: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime]] |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |year=2007 |location=[[New York City]] |isbn= 978-0-312-36706-0 |oclc=132583222}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic editing===
{{Main|Genome editing}}
[[Genome editing]], in which [[nucleic acid]] polymers are delivered as a [[Biologic medical product|drug]] and are either [[gene expression|expressed]] as proteins, interfere with the expression of proteins, or correct genetic mutations, has been proposed as a future strategy to prevent aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Neuroendocrinology of Aging: The Potential of Gene Therapy as an Interventive Strategy |journal=Gerontology |date=2001-01-08 |first=Rodolfo G. |last=Goya |author2=Federico Bolognani |author3=Claudia B.

A large array of genetic modifications have been found to increase lifespan in model organisms such as yeast, nematode worms, fruit flies, and mice. As of 2013, the longest extension of life caused by a single gene manipulation was roughly 50% in mice and 10-fold in [[nematode]] worms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks1155| pmid = 23193293| pmc = 3531213| title = Human Ageing Genomic Resources: Integrated databases and tools for the biology and genetics of ageing| journal = Nucleic Acids Research| volume = 41| issue = Database issue| pages = D1027–33| year = 2012| last1 = Tacutu | first1 = R.| last2 = Craig | first2 = T.| last3 = Budovsky | first3 = A.| last4 = Wuttke | first4 = D.| last5 = Lehmann | first5 = G.| last6 = Taranukha | first6 = D.| last7 = Costa | first7 = J.| last8 = Fraifeld | first8 = V.

===Fooling genes===
In ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] describes an approach to life-extension that involves "fooling genes" into thinking the body is young.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |origyear=1976|year=2006 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn= 978-0-19-929115-1 | pages = 41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins attributes inspiration for this idea to [[Peter Medawar]]. The basic idea is that our bodies are composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes, some when we are young and others when we are older. Presumably, these genes are activated by environmental factors, and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore, to extend life, we should be able to prevent these genes from switching on, and we should be able to do so by "identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |origyear=1976|year=2006 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn= 978-0-19-929115-1 | page = 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind uploading===
{{Main|Mind uploading}}
One hypothetical future strategy that, as some suggest,{{who|date=July 2017}} "eliminates" the complications related to a physical body, involves the copying or transferring (e.g. by progressively replacing neurons with transistors) of a conscious mind from a biological brain to a non-biological computer system or computational device. The basic idea is to scan the structure of a particular brain in detail, and then construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Anders|last=Sandberg| author1-link=Anders Sandberg|first2=Nick|last2=Boström| author2-link=Nick Bostrom|title=Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap|quote=''The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.''|url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Reports/2008-3.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2013|series= Technical Report #2008‐3|year=2008| publisher = Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not an exact copy of one's mind constitutes actual life extension is matter of debate.

===Young blood injection===

In 1539 Hampton Court Chase was created an 'Honour' by an [[Act of Parliament]] instigated by [[Henry VIII]] and passed as a public act by approval of Parliament and the King. The title holder increasingly over time referred to as '''Ranger''' or '''Keeper of Bushey Park''' held as his domain the right to build and rebuild a grand house in Bushy Park coupled with a degree of local power and exercise likewise to the monarch in hunting rights.&lt;ref name=page/&gt; Henry thereby created the first forest since the [[New Forest]] of William the Conqueror and obtained the rights to a share of cattle and game in the extent to append to his "close park" to Hampton Court Palace taken from [[Cardinal Wolsey|Wolsey]]. The area's other local landowners included principally manorial tenants of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|confiscated]] [[Chertsey Abbey|Chertsey]] and [[Westminster Abbey]]s &amp;ndash; and made all non-[[Chase (land)|mete]] parts an overall chase for royal and official hunting parties for [[wild boar|boar]], game birds, [[hare]], [[Rabbit|coneys]] and deer.&lt;ref name=ecook/&gt;{{refn|group=n|In the era in which the Chase was founded many private land interests 'escheated to' (owners failed to pay a relief to effect [[livery of seisin]] after [[inquisitions post mortem]]); 'were surrendered to' (were purchased by); or were forfeited by attainder/were among attainted estates (see [[attainder]]) to the Crown (monarch).}}  Holding all persons to account for animal grazing and wood-taking financially were added benefits.&lt;ref name=ecook/&gt; The statute set up a new forest or chase for the king, to be called 'Hampton Court Chase' but which was smaller than the many square miles the King wished:{{quote|But it plainly appeareth both by the kings...indenture [...of first October 1537...(legal deed)], and by the judgement of the whole parliament that the king could neither erect any chase or forest over any mans grounds without their consent and agreement.|Sir [[Edward Coke]], Fourth Part: [[Institutes of the Lawes of England]] published 1644|&lt;ref name=ecook&gt;

The bounds of the chase apart from Bushy Park took in the manors of [[Hampton, London|Hampton]], [[Hanworth]], [[Kempton Park, Surrey|Kempton]], [[Walton-on-Thames]]. Parliament, through the courts, was deemed to have strongly curtailed its royal forest rights so as not to impinge on freeholds nor main customary tenants lands in [[Molesey]], [[Weybridge]], [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham]] and part of [[Esher]], its furthest reach due to Henry's legal deed (indenture) of 1537.&lt;ref name=ecook/&gt;

The Ranger or Keeper in early years held the position of '''Housekeeper of the [[Hampton Court Palace|Palace]]'''. The rangership of the land in the bend of the river east of the Palace, the 'House' or 'Home' Park was usually separate.&lt;ref name=page/&gt; [[Christopher Villiers, 1st Earl of Anglesey|Kit Villiers]], an ennobled courtier by James I, inherited the honour from his brother and took as his official seat Ashley House (and [[Ashley Park]]) in [[Walton on Thames]].  Reinstatement in wealth and titles to the Villiers (Earls of Jersey and Anglesey) family after the [[English Civil War]] failed to reunite the more southerly lands associated with the honour which were taken and sold in the course of the 1649-1660 [[Commonwealth of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parishes: Walton on Thames, A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 3 |year=1911|pages= 467–475|url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43009 |accessdate= 27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some holders of the title lived in Bushy Park seasonally or as their main home. The monarch tended to grant the title to the main heir of the previous holder.  Parliament in the English Interregnum granted the title to General Monck, who remained in favour in the [[English Restoration]].

'''Mechanism''' is the belief that natural wholes (principally living things) are like complicated machines or artifacts, composed of parts lacking any intrinsic relationship to each other. Thus, the source of an apparent thing's activities is not the whole itself, but its parts or an external influence on the parts.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The doctrine of mechanism in [[philosophy]] comes in two different flavors. They are both doctrines of [[metaphysics]], but they are different in scope and ambitions: the first is a global doctrine about nature; the second is a local doctrine about humans and their minds, which is hotly contested. For clarity, we might distinguish these two doctrines as [[universal mechanism]] and [[anthropic mechanism]].

{{quote|There is no constant meaning in the history of philosophy for the word Mechanism. Originally, the term meant that cosmological theory which ascribes the motion and changes of the world to some external force. In this view material things are purely passive, while according to the opposite theory (i. e., Dynamism), they possess certain internal sources of energy which account for the activity of each and for its influence on the course of events; These meanings, however, soon underwent modification. The question as to whether motion is an inherent property of bodies, or has been communicated to them by some external agency, was very often ignored. With a large number of cosmologists the essential feature of Mechanism is the attempt to reduce all the qualities and activities of bodies to quantitative realities, i. e. to mass and motion. But a further modification soon followed. Living bodies, as is well known, present at first sight certain characteristic properties which have no counterpart in lifeless matter. Mechanism aims to go beyond these appearances. It seeks to explain all "vital" phenomena as physical and chemical facts; whether or not these facts are in turn reducible to mass and motion becomes a secondary question, although Mechanists are generally inclined to favour such reduction. The theory opposed to this biological mechanism is no longer Dynamism, but Vitalism or Neo-vitalism, which maintains that vital activities cannot be explained, and never will be explained, by the laws which govern lifeless matter.&lt;ref name="CE1913"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Mechanism |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1913 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Mechanism}}&lt;/ref&gt;|"Mechanism" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913)}}

== Universal mechanism&lt;!--'Universal mechanism' redirects here--&gt; ==

The older doctrine, here called '''universal mechanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, is the ancient philosophies closely linked with [[materialism]] and [[reductionism]], especially that of the [[atomism|atomists]] and to a large extent, [[stoicism|stoic physics]]. They held that the universe is reducible to completely mechanical principles—that is, the [[motion (physics)|motion]] and collision of [[matter]]. Later mechanists believed the achievements of the [[scientific revolution]] had shown that all phenomena could eventually be explained in terms of 'mechanical' laws, natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter that implied a thorough going [[determinism]]: if ''all'' phenomena could be explained ''entirely'' through the motion of matter under the laws of [[classical physics]], then even more surely than the gears of a clock determine that it must strike 2:00 an hour after striking 1:00, ''all'' phenomena must be completely determined: whether past, present or future. (One of the philosophical implications of modern [[quantum mechanics]] is that this view of determinism is not defensible.)

The French mechanist and determinist [[Pierre Simon de Laplace]] formulated the sweeping implications of this thesis by saying:

{{quote|We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of the past and the cause of the future. An intellect which at any given moment knew all of the forces that animate nature and the mutual positions of the beings that compose it, if this intellect were vast enough to submit the data to analysis, could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that of the lightest [[atom]]; for such an intellect nothing could be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|Pierre Simon Laplace|''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities''}}

One of the first and most famous expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1651). What is less frequently appreciated is that [[René Descartes]] was a staunch mechanist, though today, in the [[philosophy of mind]], he is remembered for introducing the [[mind–body problem]] in terms of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[physicalism]].

Descartes was a [[substance dualist]], and argued that reality was composed of two radically different types of substance: extended [[matter]], on the one hand, and immaterial [[mind]], on the other. Descartes argued that one cannot explain the conscious mind in terms of the spatial dynamics of mechanistic bits of matter cannoning off each other. Nevertheless, his understanding of biology was thoroughly mechanistic in nature:

:"I should like you to consider that these functions (including passion, memory, and imagination) follow from the mere arrangement of the machine’s organs every bit as naturally as the movements of a clock or other automaton follow from the arrangement of its counter-weights and wheels." (Descartes, Treatise on Man, p.108)

His scientific work was based on the traditional mechanistic understanding that animals and humans are completely mechanistic [[automaton|automata]]. Descartes' dualism was motivated by the seeming impossibility that mechanical dynamics could yield mental experiences.

[[Isaac Newton]] ushered in a much weaker acceptation of mechanism that tolerated the antithetical, and as yet inexplicable, [[action at a distance]] of [[gravity]]. However, his work seemed to successfully predict the motion of both celestial and terrestrial bodies according to that principle, and the generation of philosophers who were inspired by Newton's example carried the mechanist banner nonetheless. Chief among them were French [[philosophy|philosophers]] such as [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] and [[Denis Diderot]] (see also: [[French materialism]]).

== Anthropic mechanism&lt;!--'Anthropic mechanism' redirects here--&gt; ==

The thesis in '''anthropic mechanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is not that everything can be completely explained in mechanical terms (although some anthropic mechanists may ''also'' believe that), but rather that everything ''about human beings'' can be completely explained in mechanical terms, as surely as can everything about clocks or the internal combustion engine.

One of the chief obstacles that all mechanistic theories have faced is providing a mechanistic explanation of the human [[mind]]; Descartes, for one, endorsed [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] in spite of endorsing a completely mechanistic conception of the material world because he argued that mechanism and the notion of a mind were logically incompatible. Hobbes, on the other hand, conceived of the mind and the will as purely mechanistic, completely explicable in terms of the effects of perception and the pursuit of desire, which in turn he held to be completely explicable in terms of the materialistic operations of the nervous system. Following Hobbes, other mechanists argued for a thoroughly mechanistic explanation of the mind, with one of the most influential and controversial expositions of the doctrine being offered by [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] in his ''Man a Machine'' (1748).

Today, as in the past, the main points of debate between anthropic mechanists and anti-mechanists are mainly occupied with two topics: the mind — and consciousness, in particular — and [[free will]]. Anti-mechanists argue that anthropic mechanism is incompatible with our commonsense intuitions: in [[philosophy of mind]] they argue that unconscious matter cannot completely explain the phenomenon of consciousness, and in [[metaphysics]] they argue that anthropic mechanism implies determinism about human action, which (they argue) is incompatible with our understanding of ourselves as creatures with [[free will]]. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this position include [[Norman Malcolm]] and
[[David Chalmers]].

Anthropic mechanists typically respond in one of two ways. In the first, they agree with anti-mechanists that mechanism conflicts with some of our commonsense intuitions, but go on to argue that our commonsense intuitions are simply mistaken and need to be revised. Down this path lies [[eliminative materialism]] in [[philosophy of mind]], and [[hard determinism]] on the question of free will. This option is accepted by the eliminative materialist philosopher [[Paul Churchland]]. Some have questioned how eliminative materialism is compatible with the freedom of will apparently required for anyone (including its adherents) to make truth claims.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Jonas, ''The Phenomenon of Life: Toward a Philosophical Biology'' (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 2001/1966), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The second option, common amongst philosophers who adopt anthropic mechanism, is to argue that the [[argument]]s given for incompatibility are specious: whatever it is we mean by "consciousness" and "free will," they urge, it is fully compatible with a mechanistic understanding of the human mind and will. As a result, they tend to argue for one or another non-eliminativist [[Physicalism|physicalist]] theories of mind, and for [[compatibilism]] on the question of free will. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this sort of account include [[J. J. C. Smart]] and [[Daniel Dennett]].

===Gödelian arguments&lt;!--'Gödelian argument' and 'Gödelian arguments' redirect here--&gt;===
Some scholars have debated over what, if anything, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] imply about anthropic mechanism. Much of the debate centers on whether the human mind is equivalent to a [[Turing machine]], or by the [[Church-Turing thesis]], any finite machine at all. If it is, and if the machine is [[Consistency|consistent]], then Gödel's incompleteness theorems would apply to it.

'''Gödelian arguments'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; claim that a system of human mathematicians (or some idealization of human mathematicians) is both consistent and powerful enough to recognize its own consistency. Since this is impossible for a Turing machine, the Gödelian concludes that human reasoning must be non-mechanical.

However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent; that any consistent "idealized version" ''H'' of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter-intuitive open-minded skepticism about the consistency of ''H'' (otherwise ''H'' is provably inconsistent); and that Gödel's theorems do not lead to any valid argument against mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Graham Oppy]]|title=Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/#GdeArgAgaMec|website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=20 January 2015|quote=These Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are, however, problematic, and there is wide consensus that they fail.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Stuart J. Russell]]|author2=[[Peter Norvig]]|title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]|date=2010|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-604259-7|edition=3rd|chapter=26.1.2: Philosophical Foundations/Weak AI: Can Machines Act Intelligently?/The mathematical objection|quote=...even if we grant that computers have limitations on what they can prove, there is no evidence that humans are immune from those limitations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Colyvan. An introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. [[Cambridge University Press]], 2012. From 2.2.2, 'Philosophical significance of Gödel's incompleteness results': "The accepted wisdom (with which I concur) is that the Lucas-Penrose arguments fail."&lt;/ref&gt; This consensus that Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in ''[[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]]'': "''any'' attempt to utilize (Gödel's incompleteness results) to attack the [[computationalism|computationalist]] thesis is bound to be illegitimate, since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis."&lt;ref name=laforte&gt;LaForte, G., Hayes, P. J., Ford, K. M. 1998. Why Gödel's theorem cannot refute computationalism. [[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]], 104:265-286, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
One of the earliest attempts to use incompleteness to reason about human intelligence was by Gödel himself in his 1951 [[Josiah Willard Gibbs Lectureship|Gibbs Lecture]] entitled "Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their philosophical implications".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Gödel|Gödel, Kurt]], 1951, ''Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their implications'' in  [[Solomon Feferman]], ed., 1995. ''Collected works / Kurt Gödel, Vol. III''. Oxford University Press: 304-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this lecture, Gödel uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist [[Diophantine equations]] for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. Gödel finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a "certain fact".

In subsequent years, more direct anti-mechanist lines of reasoning were apparently floating around the intellectual atmosphere. In 1960, [[Hilary Putnam]] published a paper entitled "Minds and Machines," in which he points out the flaws of a typical anti-mechanist argument.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilary Putnam|Putnam, Hilary]], 1960, ''Minds and Machines'' in [[Sidney Hook]], ed., ''Dimensions of Mind: A Symposium''. New York University Press. Reprinted in Anderson, A. R., ed., 1964. ''Minds and Machines''. Prentice-Hall: 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  Informally, this is the argument that the (alleged) difference between "what can be mechanically proven" and "what can be seen to be true by humans" shows that human intelligence is not mechanical in nature. Or, as Putnam puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let T be a Turing machine which "represents" me in the sense that T can prove just the mathematical statements I prove. Then using Gödel's technique I can discover a proposition that T cannot prove, and moreover I can prove this proposition. This refutes the assumption that T "represents" me, hence I am not a Turing machine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hilary Putnam]] objects that this argument ignores the issue of consistency. Gödel's technique can only be applied to consistent systems. It is conceivable, argues Putnam, that the human mind is inconsistent. If one is to use Gödel's technique to prove the proposition that T cannot prove, one must first prove (the mathematical statement representing) the consistency of T, a daunting and perhaps impossible task. Later Putnam suggested that while Gödel's theorems cannot be applied to humans, since they make mistakes and are therefore inconsistent, it may be applied to the human faculty of science or mathematics in general. If we are to believe that it is consistent, then either we cannot prove its consistency, or it cannot be represented by a Turing machine.&lt;ref&gt;The Gödel Theorem and Human Nature, a talk given by [[Hilary Putnam]] in the Gödel centenary 2006  [http://www.logic.at/goedel2006/abstract.php?putnam]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. R. Lucas]] in ''[[Minds, Machines and Gödel]]'' (1961), and later in his book ''The Freedom of the Will'' (1970), lays out an anti-mechanist argument closely following the one described by Putnam, including reasons for why the human mind can be considered consistent.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lucas (philosopher)|Lucas, J. R.]], 1961, "[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/Godel/mmg.html Minds, Machines, and Gödel.]" ''Philosophy 36'':112-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lucas admits that, by Gödel's second theorem, a human mind cannot formally prove its own consistency, and even says (perhaps facetiously) that women and politicians are inconsistent. Nevertheless, he sets out arguments for why a male non-politician can be considered consistent. These arguments are philosophical in nature and are the subject of much debate; Lucas provides references to responses on his own [http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/Godel/referenc.html website].

Another work was done by [[Judson Webb]] in his 1968 paper "Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind".&lt;ref&gt;[[Judson Webb|Webb, Judson]], 1968, "Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind," ''Philosophy of Science 35'': 156-78.&lt;/ref&gt;  Webb claims that previous attempts have glossed over whether one truly can see that the Gödelian statement ''p'' pertaining to oneself, is true. Using a different formulation of Gödel's theorems, namely, that of [[Raymond Smullyan]] and [[Emil Post]], Webb shows one can derive convincing arguments for oneself of both the truth and falsity of ''p''. He furthermore argues that all arguments about the philosophical implications of Gödel's theorems are really arguments about whether the [[Church-Turing thesis]] is true.

Later, [[Roger Penrose]] entered the fray, providing somewhat novel anti-mechanist arguments in his books, ''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]''  (1989) [ENM] and ''[[Shadows of the Mind]]'' (1994) [SM]. These books have proved highly controversial.  [[Martin Davis]] responded to ENM in his paper [http://www.cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/davism/penrose.ps "Is Mathematical Insight Algorithmic?" (ps)], where he argues that Penrose ignores the issue of consistency.  [[Solomon Feferman]] gives a critical examination of SM in his paper [http://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/penrose.pdf "Penrose's Gödelian argument" (pdf)].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The response of the scientific community to Penrose's arguments has been negative, with one group of scholars calling Penrose's repeated attempts to form a persuasive Gödelian argument "a kind of intellectual shell game, in which a precisely defined notion to which a mathematical result applies... is switched for a vaguer notion".&lt;ref name=laforte /&gt;

A Gödel-based anti-mechanism argument can be found in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'', though Hofstadter is widely viewed as a known skeptic of such arguments:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Looked at this way, Gödel's proof suggests – though by no means does it prove! – that there could be some high-level way of viewing the mind/brain, involving concepts which do not appear on lower levels, and that this level might have explanatory power that does not exist – not even in principle – on lower levels. It would mean that some facts could be explained on the high level quite easily, but not on  lower levels at all. No matter how long and cumbersome a low-level statement were made, it would not explain the phenomena in question.
It is analogous to the fact that, if you make derivation after derivation in [[Peano arithmetic]], no matter how long and cumbersome you make them, you will never come up with one for G – despite the fact that on a higher level, you can see that the [[Gödel sentence]] is true.

What might such high-level concepts be? It has been proposed for eons, by various holistically or "soulistically" inclined scientists and humanists that consciousness is a phenomenon that escapes explanation in terms of brain components; so here is a candidate at least. There is also the ever-puzzling notion of free will. So perhaps these qualities could be "emergent" in the sense of requiring explanations which cannot be furnished by the physiology alone
  (''Gödel, Escher, Bach'', p. 708).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rationology.net/eGodel.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mediocrity principle''' is the [[philosophical]] notion that "if an item is drawn at random from one of several sets or categories, it's likelier to come from the most numerous category than from any one of the less numerous categories".&lt;ref name="Kukla2009"&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Kukla |year=2009 |title=Extraterrestrials: A Philosophical Perspective |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739142455 |lccn=2009032272 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkdqTFVNwmgC&amp;pg=PA20 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has been taken to suggest that there is nothing very unusual about the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|evolution of the Solar System]], [[Earth's history]], the [[evolution of biological complexity]], [[human evolution]], or any one [[nation]]. It is a [[heuristic]] in the vein of the [[Copernican principle]], and is sometimes used as a philosophical statement about the place of humanity. The idea is to assume mediocrity, rather than starting with the assumption that a phenomenon is special, privileged, exceptional, or even [[supremacism|superior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1377474/principle-of-mediocrity|title=principle of mediocrity - astrobiology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MediocrePZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_12.html#myerspz|title=THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2011 — Page 12|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraterrestrial life==
[[File:Grand prismatic spring.jpg|thumb|200px|Life is ubiquitous on Earth, but does it exist elsewhere?]]

The mediocrity principle suggests, given the existence of life on Earth, that [[life]] typically exists on [[Earth analog|Earth-like planet]]s throughout the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, Eric, and Steve McMillan. ''Astronomy: A Beginner’s Guide to the Universe.'' Ed. Nancy Whilton. San Francisco: Pearson, 2010.{{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other approaches==

The mediocrity principle is in contrast with the [[anthropic principle]], which asserts that the presence of an intelligent observer (humans) limits the circumstances to bounds under which intelligent life can be [[Observation bias|observed to exist]], no matter [[Rare Earth hypothesis|how improbable]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec24.html Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt; Both stand in contrast to the [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuning hypothesis]], which asserts that the natural conditions for intelligent life are implausibly rare.

The mediocrity principle implies that Earth-like environments are necessarily common, based in part on the evidence of [[Doomsday argument|any happening at all]], whereas the anthropic principle suggests that no assertion can be made about the probability of intelligent life based on a sample set of one ([[Dunning–Kruger effect|self-described]]) example, who are necessarily capable of making such an assertion about themselves.

It is also possible to handle the Mediocrity Principle as a statistical problem, a case of a single [[Data point]] statistics, also present in the [[German tank problem]].

==Other uses==
[[David Deutsch]] argues that the mediocrity principle is incorrect from a physical point of view, in reference to either humanity's part of the universe or to its species. Deutsch refers to [[Stephen Hawking]]'s quote: "The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies". Deutsch wrote that Earth's neighborhood in the universe is not typical (80% of the universe's matter is [[dark matter]]) and that a concentration of mass such as the Solar System is an "isolated, uncommon phenomenon". He also disagrees with [[Richard Dawkins]], who considers that humans, because of natural evolution, are limited to the capabilities of their species. Deutsch responds that even though evolution did not give humans the ability to detect [[neutrino]]s, scientists can currently detect them, which significantly expands their capabilities beyond what is available as a result of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-14-196969-5 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |author=[[David Deutsch]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

[[File:Apocalypse 38. A new heaven and new earth. Revelation cap 21. Mortier's Bible. Phillip Medhurst Collection.jpg|thumb|right|{{bibleref2|Rev.|21:1|NIV|''A new heaven and new earth''}}, Mortier's Bible, [[c:User:Phillip Medhurst|Phillip Medhurst]] Collection]]
The '''New Earth''' is an expression used in the [[Book of Isaiah]] (Is 65:17 &amp; 66:22), [[Second Epistle of Peter|2 Peter]] (2 Peter 3:13), and the [[Book of Revelation]] (Rev 21:1) in the [[Bible]] to describe the final state of [[Redemption (theology)|redeemed humanity]]. It is one of the central doctrines of [[Christian eschatology]] and is referred to in the [[Nicene Creed]] as the [[world to come]].

==Biblical references==
The twenty-first chapter of the Book of Revelation introduces the final state of perfection where, according to one commentator, "cosmic time has been turned into eternity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon J. Kistemaker]], ''Exposition of the Book of Revelation'' (New Testament Commentary; Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 2001), 554.&lt;/ref&gt;  In symbolic and visual language, God allows John to see the glory and beauty of the inheritance of His people. The first thing the reader notices about this vision is that it includes a "new heavens and a new earth" (21:1). To understand what the Bible teaches about eternity, the reader of the Apocalypse must understand the New Testament doctrine of the "[[New Heaven and New Earth|New Heavens and the New Earth]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Cottrell]], ''The Faith Once for All: Bible Doctrine for Today'' (Joplin, Mo.: College Press Pub., 2002), 564–572; David Martyn Lloyd-Jones, The Church and the Last Things (Wheaton, Ill.: Crossway Books, 1998), 246–248; G. C. Berkouwer, The Return of Christ (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1972), 210-234.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The basic difference with [[Mosaic covenant|the promises of the]] [[Old Testament]] is that in Revelation they also have an [[ontology|ontological]] value ({{bibleref2|Rev.|21:1;4|NIV}}: "Then I saw 'a new heaven and a new earth,' for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea...'He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death' or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away") and no longer just [[gnosiology|gnosiological]] ({{bibleref2|Isaiah|65:17|NIV}}: "See, I will create/new heavens and a new earth./The former things will not be remembered,/nor will they come to mind").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editors=[[Joel B.

There the divine king of creation promises to renew all of reality: “See, I am making all things new” (Rev. 21:5).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editors=Steve Moyise, Maarten J.J.

In addition to the passing of the former heaven and earth, John also asserts that the sea was no more in 21:1c.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;But, in accordance with [[New covenant|his promise]], we wait for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness is at home ({{bibleref2|2 Peter|3:13|NRSV}}).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Interpretation==
In [[Koine Greek]], there were two words that are translated as "new" in the English Bible; ''neos'' and ''kainos''. One Greek resource states:

{{quote|As distinct from néos, "new in time," kainós means "new in nature" (with an implication of "better"). Both words suggest "unfamiliar," "unexpected," "wonderful," and the distinction fades with time.&lt;ref&gt;G. Kittel, G. Friedrich, G. W. Bromiley (1995, c1985). Theological Dictionary of the New Testament. Translation of: Theologisches Wörterbuch zum Neuen Testament (Grand Rapids, Mich.: W. B. Eerdmans), 388.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  

That ''kainos'' should not be taken as something totally new can be seen in a passage like the following:
{{quote|If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away; see, everything has become new! (2 Corinthians 5:17)}}

Here the [[Apostle Paul]] uses ''kainos'' in the expression "new creation." Paul did not intend to convey the idea that this is a completely different individual. There is continuity between the old person and the new person to such an extent that it remains the same person, but renovated. The person is the same, but the quality of that person has been transformed.

In the same way, the biblical concept of the New Earth is one of renovation and restoration. Either on this current earth or on rebuilt new planet. This conclusion is supported by Peter's words in his public speech in the temple at Jerusalem. 

{{quote|Repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord; and that he may send Jesus, the Christ appointed for you, whom heaven must receive until the period of the restoration of all things about which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient time.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 3:19-21&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

This earth, however, will be either cleansed or destroyed by fire for the purpose of restoration as expressed in the following passage:
{{quote|But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and everything that is done on it will be disclosed. Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness, waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved, and the elements will melt with fire? (2 Peter 3:10-12)}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7924">'''Phylogenetic inertia''' or phylogenetic constraint refers to the limitations on the future [[evolution]]ary pathways that have been imposed by previous [[adaptation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=K|last2=McKinney|first2=F|last3=Sorenson|first3=M|date=1999|title=Phylogenetic constraint on male parental care in the dabbling ducks.|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B|volume=266|pages=759–763|doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0702|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] first recognized this phenomenon, though the term was later coined by Huber in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huber|first=B|date=1939|title=Siebrohrensystem unserer Baume und seine jahreszeitlichen Veranderungen.|url=|journal=Jahrbücher für Wissenschaftliche Botanik|volume=88|pages=176–242|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin explained the idea of phylogenetic inertia based on his observations; he spoke about it when explaining the "Law of Conditions of Existence".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Darwin also suggested that, after [[speciation]], the [[organism]]s do not start over from scratch, but have characteristics that are built upon already existing ones that were inherited from their ancestors; and these characteristics likely limit the amount of evolution seen in that new [[Taxon|taxa]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shanahan|first=Timothy|date=2011|title=Phylogenetic Inertia and Darwin's Higher Law|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49816525_Phylogenetic_Inertia_and_Darwin%27s_Higher_Law|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the main concept of phylogenetic inertia.

[[Richard Dawkins]] also explained these constraints by likening [[natural selection]] to a river in his 1982 book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Extended Phenotype: The Gene as a Unit of Selection|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic body plan has been phylogenetically constrained.]]Most terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s have a [[body plan]] that consist of four limbs. The phylogenetic inertia hypothesis suggests that this body plan is observed, not because it happens to be optimal, but because [[Evolution of tetrapods|tetrapods]] are derived from a [[clade]] of [[fish]]es ([[Sarcopterygii]]) which also have four limbs. Four limbs happened to be suitable means of locomotion, and so this body plan has not been selected against.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewin|first=Roger|date=1980|title=Evolutionary Theory Under Fire|url=|journal=Science|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modes of reproduction ===

[[Bird]]s are the only speciose group of vertebrates that are exclusively [[Oviparity|oviparous]], or egg laying. It has been suggested that birds are phylogenetically constrained, as being derived from [[reptile]]s, and likely have not overcome this constraint or diverged far enough away to develop [[viviparity]], or live birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKitrick|first=Mary|date=1993|title=Phylogenetic Constraint in Evolutionary Theory: Has it any Explanatory Power?|url=|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.24.110193.001515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackburn|first=Daniel|last2=Evans|first2=Howard|date=1986|title=Why are there no Viviparous Birds?|url=|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=128|issue=2|doi=10.1086/284552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homologous structures ===

* More specifically than the similarity in body plan, there are [[homology (biology)|homologous]] bones across [[mammal]]ian taxa. For example, the [[pentadactyl limb]] bone structure observed in the arms of [[primate]]s, front legs of equestrians, in the wings of [[bat]]s, and the flippers of [[Seal (animal)|seals]]. The fact that they are homologous is further evidence for phylogenetic inertia; these structures have been modified over time, but they are constrained by common ancestry.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Origin of Species|last=Darwin|first=Charles|publisher=|year=1859|isbn=|location=|pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Tests for phylogenetic inertia in study systems ==
There have been several studies that have been able to effectively test for phylogenetic inertia when looking into shared traits; predominantly with a comparative methods approach.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diniz-Filho|first=Jose Alexandre Felizola|last2=Sant'Ana|first2=Carlos Eduardo Ramos de|last3=Bini|first3=Luis Mauricio|date=1998-01-01|title=An Eigenvector Method for Estimating Phylogenetic Inertia|jstor=2411294|journal=Evolution|volume=52|issue=5|pages=1247–1262|doi=10.2307/2411294}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pienaar|first=Jason|last2=Ilany|first2=Amiyaal|last3=Geffen|first3=Eli|last4=Yom-Tov|first4=Yoram|date=2013-05-01|title=Macroevolution of life-history traits in passerine birds: adaptation and phylogenetic inertia|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12077/abstract|journal=Ecology Letters|volume=16|issue=5|pages=571–576|doi=10.1111/ele.12077|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morales|first=Eduardo|date=2000-04-01|title=Estimating Phylogenetic Inertia in Tithonia (asteraceae): A Comparative Approach|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00050.x/abstract|journal=Evolution||volume=54|issue=2|pages=475–484|doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00050.x|issn=1558-5646}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have used comparative methods and found evidence for certain traits attributed to adaptation, and some to phylogeny; there were also numerous traits that could be attributed to both.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another study developed a new method of comparative examination that showed to be a powerful predictor of phylogenetic inertia in a variety of situations. It was called Phylogenetic [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|Eigenvector]] Regression (PVR), which runs [[Principal component analysis|principal component analyses]] between species on a pairwise [[Distance matrices in phylogeny|phylogenetic distance matrix]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In another, different study, the authors described methods for measuring phylogenetic inertia, looked at effectiveness of various comparative methods, and found that different methods can reveal different aspects of drivers.

'''Primary energy''' ('''PE''') is an [[energy]] form found in nature that has not been subjected to any [[energy engineering|human engineered]] conversion process. It is energy contained in raw [[fuel|fuels]], and other forms of energy received as input to a [[system]]. Primary energy can be [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] or [[renewable energy|renewable]].

Where primary energy is used to describe fossil fuels, the [[embodied energy]] of the fuel is available as thermal energy and around 70% is typically lost in conversion to electrical or mechanical energy. There is a similar 60-80% conversion loss when solar and wind energy is converted to electricity, but today's UN conventions on energy statistics counts the electricity made from wind and solar as the primary energy itself for these sources. One consequence of this counting method is that the contribution of wind and solar energy is under reported compared to fossil energy sources, and there is hence an international debate on how to count primary energy from wind and solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sauar|first1=Erik|title=IEA underreports contribution solar and wind by a factor of three compared to fossil fuels|url=http://energypost.eu/iea-underreports-contribution-solar-wind-factor-three-compared-fossil-fuels/|website=energypost.eu|publisher=Energy Post|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Total primary energy supply''' ('''TPES''') is the sum of production and imports subtracting exports and storage changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2013-en/06/01/01/index.html?contentType=&amp;itemId=%2fcontent%2fchapter%2ffactbook-2013-41-en&amp;mimeType=text%2fhtml&amp;containerItemId=%2fcontent%2fserial%2f18147364&amp;accessItemIds=|title=OECD Factbook 2013: Economic, Environmental and Social Statistics|year=2013|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of primary energy is used in [[energy distance|energy statistics]] in the compilation of [[energy accounting|energy balances]], as well as in the field of [[energetics]]. In energetics, a primary energy source (PES) refers to the energy forms required by the energy sector to generate the supply of [[energy carrier|energy carriers]] used by human society.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Giampietro |first1=Mario |last2=Mayumi |first2=Kozo |title=The Biofuel Delusion: The Fallacy of Large Scale Agro-Biofuels Production |publisher=Earthscan, Taylor &amp; Francis group |year=2009 |pages=336 |isbn=978-1-84407-681-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary energy''' is a carrier of energy, such as electricity. These are produced by conversion from a primary energy source.

The use of primary energy as a measure ignores conversion efficiency. Thus forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency, particularly the thermal sources, coal, gas and nuclear are overstated, whereas energy sources such as hydroelectricity which are converted efficiently, while a small fraction of primary energy are significantly more important than their total raw energy supply may seem to imply.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

PE and TPES are better defined in the context of [[worldwide energy supply]].

==Examples of sources==
Primary energy sources should not be confused with the [[energy system]] components (or conversion processes) through which they are converted into energy carriers.

In certain situations, the use of resources by human society is performed at a much higher rate than the minimum rate at which it can be geophysically renewed. This is the rationale behind the differentiation between non-renewable primary energy sources (oil, coal, gas, uranium) and renewable primary energy sources (wind, solar, hydro).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usable energy==
{{main|exergy}}
[[File:Different energy forms (PES).png|thumb|Primary energy sources are transformed by the energy sector to generate energy carriers.]]
Primary energy sources are transformed in [[energy conversion]] processes to more convenient forms of energy that can directly be used by society, such as [[electrical energy]], refined [[fuels]], or synthetic fuels such as [[hydrogen fuel]]. In the field of [[energetics]], these forms are called [[energy carrier]]s and correspond to the concept of "secondary energy" in energy statistics.

===Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)===
Energy carriers are energy forms which have been transformed from primary energy sources. Electricity is one of the most common energy carriers, being transformed from various primary energy sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and wind. Electricity is particularly useful since it has low entropy (is highly ordered) and so can be converted into other forms of energy very efficiently. [[District heating]] is another example of secondary energy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference   U.S. EPA Energy STAR] Retrieved 2017-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[laws of thermodynamics]], primary energy sources cannot be produced. They must be available to society to enable the production of energy carriers.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009" /&gt;

[[Thermal efficiency|Conversion efficiency]] varies. For thermal energy, electricity and mechanical energy production is limited by [[Carnot's theorem]], and generates a lot of [[waste heat]]. Other non-thermal conversions can be more efficient. For example, while wind turbines do not capture all of the wind's energy, they have a high conversion efficiency and generate very little waste heat since wind energy is low entropy. In principle solar photovoltaic conversions could be very efficient, but current conversion can only be done well for narrow ranges of wavelength, whereas solar thermal is also subject to Carnot efficiency limits. Hydroelectric power is also very ordered, and converted very efficiently. The amount of usable energy is the [[exergy]] of a system.

===Site and source energy===
Site energy is the term used in North America for the amount of end-use energy of all forms consumed at a specified location. This can be a mix of primary energy (such as natural gas burned at the site) and secondary energy (such as electricity). Site energy is measured at the campus, building, or sub-building level and is the basis for energy charges on utility bills.&lt;ref name="NRCan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring energy: site energy vs. source energy in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/buildings/energy-benchmarking/update/getready/19453|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source energy, in contrast, is the term used in North America for the amount of primary energy consumed in order to provide a facility’s site energy. It is always greater than the site energy, as it includes all site energy and adds to it the energy lost during transmission, delivery, and conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torcellini|first=Paul|last2=Pless|first2=Shanti|last3=Deru|first3=Michael|last4=Crawley|first4=Drury|date=June 2006|title=Zero energy buildings: a critical look at the definition|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39833.pdf|journal=ACEEE Summer Study|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory/U.S. Department of Energy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While source or primary energy provides a more complete picture of energy consumption, it cannot be measured directly and must be calculated using conversion factors from site energy measurements.&lt;ref name="NRCan" /&gt; For electricity, a typical value is three units of source energy for one unit of site energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Site Energy vs Source Energy|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/energy/content/site-energy-vs-source-energy|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can vary considerably depending on factors such as the primary energy source or fuel type, the type of power plant, and the transmission infrastructure. One full set of conversion factors is available as technical reference from [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portfoliomanager.energystar.gov/pdf/reference/Source%20Energy.pdf|title=Technical Reference: Source Energy|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Either site or source energy can be an appropriate metric when comparing or analyzing energy use of different facilities. The U.S [[Energy Information Administration]], for example, uses primary (source) energy for its energy overviews&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/|title=Total Energy - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but site energy for its Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/terminology.php|title=Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Residential Building Energy Consumption Survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/terminology.php|title=Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]] program recommends using source energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference|title=The difference between source and site energy|website=www.energystar.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] uses site energy in its definition of a [[Zero-energy building|zero net energy building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/buildings/articles/doe-releases-common-definition-zero-energy-buildings-campuses-and|title=DOE Releases Common Definition for Zero Energy Buildings, Campuses, and Communities|website=Energy.gov|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Energy accidents}}

Energy accidents are accidents that occur in systems that provide energy or power. These can result in fatalities, as can the normal running of many systems, for example those deaths due to pollution.

Globally, coal is responsible for 100,000 deaths per trillion kWh.&lt;ref name=deadly&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/#2f9f079649d2 How Deadly Is Your Kilowatt? We Rank The Killer Energy Sources James Conca, June 10, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth is simple to manufacture, non-combustible, [[Thermal mass|thermally massive]], strong, and durable. However, structures such as walls can be laborious to construct of rammed earth without machinery, e. g., powered tampers, and they are susceptible to water damage if inadequately protected or maintained.

Edifices formed of rammed earth are on every continent except [[Antarctica]], in a range of environments including temperate, wet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rammedearthconsulting.com/rammed-earth-CAT-lecture-theatre.htm |title=Rammed Earth Lecture Theatre, CAT |first=Rowland |last=Keable  |work=Rammed Earth Consulting |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; semiarid desert, montane, and tropical regions. The availability of suitable soil and a [[architecture|building design]] appropriate for local [[climate|climatic conditions]] are the factors that favour its use.

==Composition and use==
{{Original research | section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Tapialdebarro.jpg|thumb|left|Model of construction of a wall of rammed earth on a foundation]]
Manufacturing rammed earth involves compressing a damp mixture of [[soil|earth]] that has suitable proportions of [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[clay]], and/or an added stabilizer into an externally supported frame or mold, forming either a solid wall or individual blocks. Historically, additives such as [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] or animal blood were used to stabilize it,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} while modern construction adds [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[cement]], or [[asphalt]] emulsions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} To add variety, some modern builders also add coloured oxides or other materials, e.g. bottles, tires, or pieces of timber.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The construction of an entire wall begins with a temporary frame, denominated the "[[formwork]]", which is usually made of wood or plywood, as a mold for the desired shape and dimensions of each section of wall. The form must be durable and well braced, and the two opposing faces must be clamped together to prevent bulging or deformation caused by the large compressing forces. Damp material is poured into the formwork to a depth of {{convert|10|to|25|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and then compacted to approximately 50% of its original height.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The material is compressed iteratively, in batches or courses, so as to gradually erect the wall up to the top of the [[formwork]]. Tamping was historically manual with a long ramming pole, and was very laborious, but modern construction can be made less so by employing [[pneumatic]]ally powered tampers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

[[File:Paderne Morrish Castle 26 Nov 2007 (6).JPG|thumb|right|Taipa fortifications at [[Paderne Castle]] in the Algarve, Portugal]]

After a wall is complete, it is sufficiently strong to immediately remove the formwork.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This is necessary if a surface texture is to be applied, e.g., by wire brushing, carving, or mold impression, because the walls become too hard to work after approximately one hour.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Construction is optimally done in warm weather so that the walls can dry and harden.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[compression strength]] of the rammed earth increases as it cures; some time is necessary for it to dry and as long as two years can be necessary for complete curing.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Exposed walls must be sealed to prevent water damage.

In modern variations of the technique, rammed-earth walls are constructed on top of conventional [[Foundation (architecture)|footings]] or a [[reinforced concrete]] slab base.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Where blocks made of rammed earth are used, they are generally stacked like regular blocks and are bonded together with a thin mud slurry instead of cement.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Special machines, usually powered by small engines and often portable, are used to compress the material into blocks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Presently more than 30% of the world's population uses earth as a building material.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Rammed earth has been used globally in a wide range of climatic conditions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed-earth housing may resolve homelessness caused by otherwise expensive construction techniques.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Qualities ==
[[File:Rammed earth wall surface.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the surface of a rammed-earth wall: apart from the patches of damage, the surface shows regular horizontal lines caused by the wooden [[formwork]] and subtler horizontal strata from successive courses.]]

The [[compressive strength]] of rammed earth is a maximum of {{convert|4.3|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}. This is less than that of [[concrete]] but more than sufficiently strong for domestic edifices.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webs.ashlandctc.org/jnapora/hum-faculty/syllabi/trad.html |title=A Traditional Research Paper: Rammed Earth Construction |first=Robert O. |last=Cassell  |work=Ashland  Community  and Technical College|date= 17 December 2001 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, properly constructed rammed earth endures for thousands of years, as many ancient structures that are still standing around the world demonstrate.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rammedearthconstructions.com.au/index.php?mp_id=5 |title=BENEFITS OF BUILDING IN RAMMED EARTH |work=Rammed Earth Constructions |publisher=Rammed Earth Constructions P/L |location=[[Maleny]], [[Australia]] |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rammed earth reinforced with [[rebar]], wood, or [[bamboo]] can prevent collapse caused by earthquakes or heavy storms,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} because unreinforced edifices of rammed earth resist earthquake damage extremely poorly. See [[1960 Agadir earthquake]] for an example of the total destruction which may be inflicted on such structures by an earthquake. Adding cement to soil mixtures poor in clay can also increase the load-bearing capacity of rammed-earth edifices.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] observed in 1925 that rammed-earth structures endure indefinitely and can be constructed for less than two-thirds of the cost of standard frame houses.&lt;ref name="USDA Farmer Bulletin 1500"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaronhauser.com/rammed-earth-books/farmers-bulletin-no-1500-rammed-earth-walls-for-buildings/ |title=Farmers' Bulletin No. 1500: Rammed Earth Walls for Buildings - Rammed Earth Books - The Boden Hauser |first1=Morris Cotgrave |last1=Betts |first2=Thomas Arrington Huntington |last2=Miller |work=The Boden Hauser |page=20 |date=May 1937 |origyear=1925 |accessdate=February 4, 2012 |oclc=600507592 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225224741/http://www.aaronhauser.com/rammed-earth-books/farmers-bulletin-no-1500-rammed-earth-walls-for-buildings/ |archivedate=February 25, 2012 |df= }} Originally published by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], Washington, DC, USA.

Soil is a widely available, inexpensive, and [[sustainable]] resource.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://earth.sustainablesources.com/#Soils |title=Soils for Rammed Earth, Caliche Block, and Soil Material Construction |publisher=Sustainable Sources |location=Austin, TX, USA| accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, construction with rammed earth is very viable.{{vague|date=July 2017|reason=Viable in what sense? Compared to what? Under which circumstances?}} Unskilled labour can do most of the necessary work.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; While the cost of rammed earth is low, rammed-earth construction without mechanical tools is very time-consuming and laborious; however, with a mechanical tamper and prefabricated [[formwork]] it can require only two or three days to construct the walls of a {{convert|200|to|220|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} house.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

One significant benefit of rammed earth is its high [[thermal mass]]: like [[brick]] or [[concrete]], it can absorb heat during daytime and nocturnally release it.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This action moderates daily temperature variations and reduces the need for [[air conditioning]] and [[heating]]. In colder climates, rammed-earth walls can be insulated with [[Styrofoam]] or a similar insert. It must also be protected from heavy rain and insulated with vapour barriers.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthstructures.com.au/rammed-earth-construction/ |title=Rammed Earth Construction |work=Earth Structures |location=Victoria, Australia |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth can effectively regulate humidity if unclad walls containing clay are exposed to an internal space. Humidity is regulated between 40% and 60%, which is the ideal range for [[asthma]] sufferers{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} and for the storage of susceptible objects such as books.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The material mass and clay content of rammed earth allows an edifice to breathe more than concrete edifices, which avoids problems of condensation but prevents significant loss of heat.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Untouched, rammed-earth walls have the colour and texture of natural earth. Moisture-impermeable finishes, such as cement render, are avoided because they impair the ability of a wall to desorb moisture,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} which quality is necessary to preserve its strength.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Well-cured walls accept nails and screws easily, and can be effectively patched with the same material used to build them.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Blemishes can be repaired using the soil mixture as a plaster and sanded smooth.

The thickness, typically {{convert|30|to|35|cm|in}}, and [[density]] of rammed-earth walls make them suitable for [[soundproofing]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} They are also inherently [[fireproof]], resistant to [[termite]] damage, and non-toxic.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Environmental effects and sustainability ==

[[File:rammed earth.jpg|thumb|left|Rammed-earth [[trombe wall]] constructed by [[Design Build Bluff]]]]

Edifices of rammed earth are thought{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly than popular techniques of construction. Because rammed-earth edifices use locally available materials, they usually have low [[embodied energy]] and generate very little waste.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The soils used are typically [[subsoil]]s low in [[clay]], between 5% and 15%,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} which conserve the [[topsoil]] for agriculture. When the soil excavated in preparation for a foundation can be used, the cost and energy consumption of transportation are minimal.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; Rammed earth is probably the least environmentally detrimental construction material and technique that is readily and commercially available today to construct solid masonry edifices.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed earth has potentially low manufacturing impact, contingent on the amount of cement and the amount that is locally sourced; it is often quarried aggregates rather than "earth".

[[Formwork]] is removable and can be reused, reducing the need for lumber.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.networkearth.org/naturalbuilding/ceb.html |title=Natural Building Colloquium: Compressed Earth Blocks |first=Wayne |last=Nelson |publisher=NetWorks Productions |date=21 May 2003 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mixing cement with the soil can counteract sustainable benefits such as low embodied energy and humidity regulation because manufacture of the cement itself adds to the global carbon dioxide burden at a rate of 1.25 tonnes per tonne of cement produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rammedearthconsulting.com/rammed-earth-cement-co2.htm |title=Rammed Earth – Pollution and Cement |first=Rowland |last=Keable  |work=Rammed Earth Consulting |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial substitution of cement with alternatives such as [[ground granulated blast furnace slag]] has not been demonstrated to be effective, and implicates other questions of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm |title=Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |location=Washington, DC, USA |date=7 April 2011 |accessdate=4 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122083859/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm |archivedate=22 January 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth can contribute to the overall energy efficiency of edifices: the density, thickness, and thermal conductivity of rammed earth render it an especially suitable material for [[passive solar]] heating. Warmth requires almost 12 hours to be conducted through a wall {{convert|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Rammed-earth construction may also reduce the ecological impacts of [[deforestation]] and the toxicity of artificial materials associated with conventional construction techniques.

Although it has low [[greenhouse emission]]s in theory, [[transportation]] and the production of [[cement]] can add significantly to the overall emissions of modern rammed earth construction. The most basic kind of traditional rammed earth has very low greenhouse gas emissions but the more engineered and processed variant of rammed earth has the potential for significant emissions.

== History ==
[[File:JiayuguanWall.jpg|thumb|right|A ''taipa'' section of the [[Great Wall of China]]]]
[[File:Grange.Bassey.Saint.Nicolas.Macherin.jpg|thumb|right|Rammed-earth edifice on a farm in [[France]]]]

Evidence of ancient use of rammed earth has been found in [[Neolithic]] archaeological  sites of the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] cultures along the [[Yellow River]] in [[China]], dating to 5000 BCE. By 2000 BCE, rammed-earth architectural techniques (夯土 ''Hāng tǔ'') were commonly used for walls and foundations in [[China]].&lt;ref name="Xujie Liu"&gt;{{cite book |last=Xujie |first=Liu  |editor1-first=Nancy Shatzman |editor1-last=Steinhardt  |display-authors=etal  |title=Chinese Architecture |publisher=New Haven, CT, USA: Yale University Press and Beijing, China: New World Press |date=2002 |pages = 12–14, 21–2 |oclc=186413872 |isbn=978-0-300-09559-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s, rammed earth was popularized in the [[United States]] by the book ''Rural Economy'' by S. W. Johnson. The technique was used to construct the [[Borough House Plantation]]&lt;ref name="Borough House"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743001/ |title=National Register Properties in South Carolina: Borough House Plantation, Sumter County (SC Hwy 261, vicinity of Stateburg) |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, SC, USA |work=National Register Sites in South Carolina |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church of the Holy Cross (Stateburg, South Carolina)|Church of the Holy Cross]]&lt;ref name="Church of the Holy Cross"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743002/index.htm |title=National Register Properties in South Carolina: Church of the Holy Cross, Sumter County (SC Hwy 261, Stateburg vicinity) |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, South Carolina, USA |work=National Register Sites in South Carolina |date=April 20, 2009 |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Stateburg, South Carolina]], both being [[National Historic Landmarks]].

An outstanding example of a rammed-earth edifice in [[Canada]] is [[St. Thomas Anglican Church (Shanty Bay, Ontario)|St. Thomas Anglican Church]] in [[Shanty Bay]], [[Ontario]], erected between 1838 and 1841.

From the 1920s through the 1940s rammed-earth construction in the US was studied. [[South Dakota State College]] extensively researched and constructed almost one hundred weathering walls of rammed earth.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} For over 30 years the college investigated the use of paints and plasters in relation to colloids in soil. In 1945, Clemson Agricultural College of [[South Carolina]] published the results of their research of rammed earth in a pamphlet titled "Rammed Earth Building Construction".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1936, on a homestead near [[Gardendale, Alabama]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] constructed an experimental community of rammed-earth edifices with architect Thomas Hibben.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The houses were inexpensively constructed and were sold to the public along with sufficient land for gardens and small plots for livestock. The project successfully provided valuable homes to low-income families.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

The [[US Agency for International Development]] is working with [[undeveloped countries]] to improve the engineering of rammed-earth houses.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} It also financed the authorship of the ''Handbook of Rammed Earth''&lt;ref name="Handbook For Building Homes of Earth"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wolfskill |first1=Lyle A. |last2=Dunlap |first2= Wayne A. |last3=Gallaway |first3=Bob M. |title=Handbook For Building Homes of Earth |url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAE689.pdf |publisher=[[Texas Transportation Institute]] |location=College Station, Texas, USA |work=Texas Transportation Institute bulletin |number=21 |edition=1453 |accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and the [[Texas Transportation Institute]]. The ''Handbook'' was unavailable for purchase by the public until the Rammed Earth Institute International gained permission to reprint it.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Interest in rammed earth declined after [[World War II]] when the cost of modern construction materials decreased.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed earth was considered substandard, and still is opposed by many contractors, engineers, and tradesmen who are unfamiliar with earthen construction techniques.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; The prevailing perception that such materials and techniques perform poorly in regions prone to earthquakes has prevented their use in much of the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In [[Chile]], for example, rammed earth edifices normally cannot be conventionally insured against damage or even be approved by the government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

A notable example of 21st century use of rammed earth is the façade of the [[Nk'Mip Desert Cultural Centre]] in southern [[British Columbia]], Canada. As of 2014 it is the largest rammed earth wall in [[North America]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that planets with complex life, like [[Earth]], are exceptionally rare]]
In [[planetary astronomy]] and [[astrobiology]], the '''Rare Earth hypothesis''' argues that the [[origin of life]] and the [[evolution of biological complexity]] such as [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]], [[multicellular organism]]s on [[Earth]] (and, subsequently, [[human intelligence]]) required an improbable combination of [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] and [[geology|geological]] events and circumstances.

According to the hypothesis, complex [[extraterrestrial life]] is an improbable phenomenon and likely to be rare. The term "Rare Earth" originates from ''[[Rare Earth (book)|Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe]]'' (2000), a book by [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]], a geologist and paleontologist, and [[Donald E. Brownlee]], an astronomer and astrobiologist, both faculty members at the [[University of Washington]].

A contrary view was argued in the 1970s and 1980s by [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Frank Drake]], among others. It holds that Earth is a typical [[Terrestrial planet|rocky planet]] in a typical [[planetary system]], located in a non-exceptional region of a common [[barred-spiral galaxy]]. Given the [[principle of mediocrity]] (in the same vein as the [[Copernican principle]]), it is probable that we are typical, and the universe teems with complex life. However, Ward and Brownlee argue that planets, planetary systems, and galactic regions that are as friendly to complex life as the Earth, the [[Solar System]], and our [[Milky Way|galactic]] region are rare.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Requirements for complex life==
{{Life timeline}}
The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the [[evolution of biological complexity]] requires a host of fortuitous circumstances, such as a [[galactic habitable zone]], a central star and planetary system having the requisite character, the [[circumstellar habitable zone]], a right-sized terrestrial planet, the advantage of a gas giant guardian like Jupiter and a large [[natural satellite]], conditions needed to ensure the planet has a [[magnetosphere]] and [[plate tectonics]], the chemistry of the [[lithosphere]], [[atmosphere]], and oceans, the role of "evolutionary pumps" such as massive [[glaciation]] and rare [[Meteoroid#Bolide|bolide]] impacts, and whatever led to the appearance of the [[eukaryote]] [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[sexual reproduction]] and the [[Cambrian explosion]] of [[animal]], [[plant]], and [[fungi]] [[phylum|phyla]]. The [[evolution of human intelligence]] may have required yet further events, which are extremely unlikely to have happened were it not for the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] 66 million years ago removing [[dinosaurs]] as the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s.

In order for a small rocky planet to support complex life, Ward and Brownlee argue, the values of several variables must fall within narrow ranges. The [[universe]] is so vast that it could contain many Earth-like planets. But if such planets exist, they are likely to be separated from each other by many thousands of [[light year]]s. Such distances may preclude communication among any intelligent species evolving on such planets, which would solve the [[Fermi paradox]]: "If extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious?"&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Webb|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The right location in the right kind of galaxy===
''Rare Earth'' suggests that much of the known universe, including large parts of our galaxy, are "dead zones" unable to support complex life. Those parts of a galaxy where complex life is possible make up the [[galactic habitable zone]], primarily characterized by distance from the [[Galactic Center]]. As that distance increases:
# Star [[metallicity]] declines. Metals (which in astronomy means all elements other than hydrogen and helium) are necessary to the formation of [[terrestrial planets]].
# The [[X-ray]] and [[gamma ray]] radiation from the [[Supermassive black hole|black hole]] at the galactic center, and from nearby [[neutron star]]s, becomes less intense. Thus the early universe, and present-day galactic regions where stellar density is high and [[supernova]]e are common, will be dead zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Gravitational perturbation of planets and [[planetesimals]] by nearby stars becomes less likely as the density of stars decreases. Hence the further a planet lies from the Galactic Center or a spiral arm, the less likely it is to be struck by a large [[Meteoroid#Bolide|bolide]] which could [[extinction|extinguish]] all complex life on a planet.

Item #1 rules out the outer reaches of a galaxy; #2 and #3 rule out galactic inner regions. Hence a galaxy's habitable zone may be a ring sandwiched between its uninhabitable center and outer reaches.

Also, a habitable planetary system must maintain its favorable location long enough for complex life to evolve. A star with an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] (elliptic or hyperbolic) galactic orbit will pass through some spiral arms, unfavorable regions of high star density; thus a life-bearing star must have a galactic orbit that is nearly circular, with a close synchronization between the orbital velocity of the star and of the spiral arms. This further restricts the galactic habitable zone within a fairly narrow range of distances from the Galactic Center.

Approximately 77% of observed galaxies are spiral,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Loveday, J. |date=February 1996 |title=The APM Bright Galaxy Catalogue |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=278 |issue=4 |pages=1025–1048 |bibcode=1996MNRAS.278.1025L |arxiv=astro-ph/9603040 |doi=10.1093/mnras/278.4.1025}}&lt;/ref&gt; two-thirds of all spiral galaxies are barred, and more than half, like the Milky Way, exhibit multiple arms.&lt;ref name="mihalas1968"&gt;{{Cite book |author=D.

Our galaxy also appears unusually favorable in suffering fewer collisions with other galaxies over the last 10 billion years, which can cause more supernovae and other disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sibling Rivalry |date=31 March 2012 |work=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328586.500-milky-way-mysteries-andromeda-our-sibling-rival.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Milky Way's central [[black hole]] seems to have neither too much nor too little activity.&lt;ref&gt;Scharf, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The orbit of the Sun around the center of the Milky Way is indeed almost perfectly circular, with [[Galactic year|a period of 226 Ma]] (million years), closely matching the rotational period of the galaxy. However, the majority of stars in barred spiral galaxies populate the spiral arms rather than the halo and tend to move in [[gravitationally aligned orbits]], so there is little that is unusual about the Sun's orbit. While the Rare Earth hypothesis predicts that the Sun should rarely, if ever, have passed through a spiral arm since its formation, astronomer Karen Masters has calculated that the orbit of the Sun takes it through a major spiral arm approximately every 100 million years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/physics/55-our-solar-system/the-sun/the-sun-in-the-milky-way/207-how-often-does-the-sun-pass-through-a-spiral-arm-in-the-milky-way-intermediate How often does the Sun pass through a spiral arm in the Milky Way?], Karen Masters, ''Curious About Astronomy''&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have suggested that several mass extinctions do correspond with previous crossings of the spiral arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dartnell|2007|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbiting at the right distance from the right type of star===
[[File:Estimated extent of the Solar Systems habitable zone.png|thumb|According to the hypothesis, Earth has an improbable orbit in the very narrow habitable zone (dark green) around the Sun.]]
The terrestrial example suggests that complex life requires liquid water, requiring an orbital distance neither too close nor too far from the central star, another scale of [[habitable zone]] or [[Goldilocks Principle]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hart, M.H. |title=Habitable Zones Around Main Sequence Stars |journal=Icarus |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=351–7 |date=January 1979 |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(79)90141-6 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103579901416 |bibcode=1979Icar...37..351H}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The habitable zone varies with the star's type and age.

For advanced life, the star must also be highly stable, which is typical of middle star life, about 4.6 billion years old. Proper [[metallicity]] and size are also important to stability. The Sun has a low 0.1% [[solar luminosity|luminosity]] variation. To date no [[Solar analog#Solar twin|solar twin]] star twin, with an exact match of the sun's luminosity variation, has been found, though some come close. The star must have no stellar companions, as in [[Binary star|binary systems]], which would disrupt the orbits of planets. Estimates suggest 50% or more of all star systems are binary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/08jan_sunclimate/ NASA, Science News, Solar Variability and Terrestrial Climate, 8 January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="astro.unl.edu"&gt;[http://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/stellarprops/stellarlum.html University of Nebraska-Lincoln astronomy education group, Stellar Luminosity Calculator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nap.edu"&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/catalog/13519/the-effects-of-solar-variability-on-earths-climate-a-workshop National Center for Atmospheric Research, The Effects of Solar Variability on Earth's Climate, 2012 Report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2013/06/05/most-of-earths-twins-arent-identical-or-even-close/ Most of Earth’s twins aren’t identical, or even close!, by Ethan on 5 June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The habitable zone for a main sequence star very gradually moves out over its lifespan until it becomes a white dwarf and the habitable zone vanishes.

The liquid water and other gases available in the habitable zone bring the benefit of [[Greenhouse effect|greenhouse warming]]. Even though the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] contains a water vapor concentration from 0% (in arid regions) to 4% (in rain forest and ocean regions) and – as of February 2018 – only 408.05{{cn|date=February 2018}} parts per million of {{CO2}}, these small amounts suffice to raise the average surface temperature by about 40&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the dominant contribution being due to water vapor, which together with clouds makes up between 66% and 85% of Earth's greenhouse effect, with {{CO2}} contributing between 9% and 26% of the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gavin |last=Schmidt |title=Water vapour: feedback or forcing? |date=6 April 2005 |publisher=RealClimate |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/04/water-vapour-feedback-or-forcing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocky planets must orbit within the habitable zone for life to form. Although the habitable zone of such hot stars as [[Sirius]] or [[Vega]] is wide, hot stars also emit much more [[ultraviolet radiation]] that [[ionize]]s any planetary [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]]. They may become [[red giant]]s before advanced life [[Evolution|evolve]]s on their planets.
These considerations rule out the massive and powerful stars of type F6 to O (see [[stellar classification]]) as homes to evolved [[metazoan life]].

Small [[red dwarf]] stars conversely have small [[habitable zone]]s wherein planets are in [[tidal lock]], with one very hot side always facing the star and another very cold side; and they are also at increased risk of solar flares (see [[Aurelia and Blue Moon#Aurelia|Aurelia]]). Life therefore cannot arise in such systems. Rare Earth proponents claim that only stars from F7 to K1 types are hospitable. Such stars are rare: G type stars such as the Sun (between the hotter F and cooler K) comprise only 9%&lt;ref name="RECONS1"&gt;[http://joy.chara.gsu.edu/RECONS/TOP100.posted.htm] The One Hundred Nearest Star Systems, Research Consortium on Nearby Stars.&lt;/ref&gt; of the hydrogen-burning stars in the Milky Way.

Such aged stars as [[red giant]]s and [[white dwarf]]s are also unlikely to support life. Red giants are common in globular clusters and [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]. White dwarfs are mostly dying stars that have already completed their red giant phase. Stars that become red giants expand into or overheat the habitable zones of their youth and middle age (though theoretically planets at a much greater distance [[Red giant#Prospects for habitability|may become habitable]]).

An energy output that varies with the lifetime of the star will likely prevent life (e.g., as [[Cepheid variable]]s). A sudden decrease, even if brief, may freeze the water of orbiting planets, and a significant increase may evaporate it and cause a [[greenhouse effect]] that prevents the oceans from reforming.

All known life requires the complex chemistry of [[metallicity|metallic]] elements. The [[absorption spectrum]] of a star reveals the presence of metals within, and studies of stellar spectra reveal that many, perhaps most, stars are poor in metals. Because heavy metals originate in [[supernova]] explosions, metallicity increases in the universe over time. Low metallicity characterizes the early universe: globular clusters and other stars that formed when the universe was young, stars in most galaxies other than large [[spiral galaxy|spirals]], and stars in the outer regions of all galaxies. Metal-rich central stars capable of supporting complex life are therefore believed to be most common in the quiet suburbs{{vague|date=March 2017}} of the larger spiral galaxies—where radiation also happens to be weak.&lt;ref name="Ward 2000 15–33"&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=15–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the right arrangement of planets===
[[File:Planets2013.jpg|right|thumb|Depiction of the Sun and planets of the Solar System and the sequence of planets. Rare Earth argues that without such an arrangement, in particular the presence of the massive gas giant Jupiter (fifth planet from the Sun and the largest), complex life on Earth would not have arisen.]]
Rare Earth proponents argue that a planetary system capable of sustaining complex life must be structured more or less like the Solar System, with small and rocky inner planets and outer gas giants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/08/070827-jupiter-comets_2.html |first=Anne |last=Minard |date=27 August 2007 |title=Jupiter Both an Impact Source and Shield for Earth |accessdate=14 January 2014 |quote=without the long, peaceful periods offered by Jupiter's shield, intelligent life on Earth would never have been able to take hold.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the protection of 'celestial vacuum cleaner' planets with strong gravitational pull, a planet would be subject to more catastrophic asteroid collisions.

Observations of exo-planets have shown that arrangements of planets similar to our Solar System are rare. Most planetary systems have super Earths, several times larger than Earth, close to their star, whereas our Solar System's inner region has only a few small rocky planets and none inside Mercury's orbit. Only 10% of stars have giant planets similar to Jupiter and Saturn, and those few rarely have stable nearly circular orbits distant from their star. [[Konstantin Batygin]] and colleagues argue that these features can be explained if, early in the history of the Solar System, Jupiter and Saturn drifted towards the Sun, sending showers of planetesimals towards the super-Earths which sent them spiralling into the Sun, and ferrying icy building blocks into the terrestrial region of the Solar System which provided the building blocks for the rocky planets. The two giant planets then drifted out again to their present position. However, in the view of Batygin and his colleagues: "The concatenation of chance events required for this delicate choreography suggest that small, Earth-like rocky planets – and perhaps life itself – could be rare throughout the cosmos."&lt;ref&gt;Batygin et al., pp. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===A continuously stable orbit===
Rare Earth argues that a gas giant must not be too close to a body where life is developing. Close placement of gas giant(s) could disrupt the orbit of a potential life-bearing planet, either directly or by drifting into the habitable zone.

Newtonian dynamics can produce [[n-body problem#Three-body problem|chaotic planetary orbits]], especially in a system having [[Jovian planets|large planets]] at high [[orbital eccentricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.astro.ku.dk/~tobiash/posters/Tobias_final_new.pdf |format=PDF |title=Chaos and Planet-Particle Dynamics within the Habitable Zone of Extrasolar Planetary Systems (A qualitative numerical stability study) |accessdate=31 October 2007 |last=Hinse |first=T.C. |publisher=Niels Bohr Institute |quote=Main simulation results observed: [1] The presence of high-order mean-motion resonances for large values of giant planet eccentricity [2] Chaos dominated dynamics within the habitable zone(s) at large values of giant planet mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for stable orbits rules out [[Extrasolar planet|stars with systems of planets]] that contain large planets with orbits close to the host star (called "[[hot Jupiters]]"). It is believed that hot Jupiters have migrated inwards to their current orbits. In the process, they would have catastrophically disrupted the orbits of any planets in the habitable zone.&lt;ref&gt;"Once you realize that most of the known extrasolar planets have highly eccentric orbits (like the planets in Upsilon Andromedae), you begin to wonder if there might be something special about our solar system" (UCBerkeleyNews quoting Extra solar planetary researcher Eric Ford.) {{Cite web |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/04/13_planet.shtml |first=Robert |last=Sanders |date=13 April 2005 |title=Wayward planet knocks extrasolar planets for a loop |accessdate=31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To exacerbate matters, hot Jupiters are much more common orbiting F and G class stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm Sol Company, Stars and Habitable Planets, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628175616/http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A terrestrial planet of the right size===
[[File:Size planets comparison.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|left|Planets of the Solar System to scale. Rare Earth argues that complex life cannot exist on large gaseous planets like Jupiter and Saturn (top row) or Uranus and Neptune (top middle) or smaller planets such as Mars and Mercury]]
It is argued that life requires terrestrial planets like Earth and as gas giants lack such a surface, that complex life cannot arise there.&lt;ref&gt;Ward &amp; Brownlee pg 220&lt;/ref&gt;

A planet that is too small cannot hold much atmosphere, making surface temperature low and variable and oceans impossible. A small planet will also tend to have a rough surface, with large mountains and deep canyons. The core will cool faster, and [[plate tectonics]] may be brief or entirely absent. A planet that is too large will retain too dense an atmosphere like [[Venus]]. Although Venus is similar in size and mass to Earth, its surface atmospheric pressure is 92 times that of Earth, and surface temperature of 735 K (462&amp;nbsp;°C; 863&amp;nbsp;°F). Earth had a similar early atmosphere to Venus, but may have lost it in the [[Giant-impact hypothesis|giant impact event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lissauer|1999}}, as summarized by {{harvnb|Conway Morris|2003|p=92}}; also see {{harvnb|Comins|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With plate tectonics===
[[File:Great American Biotic Interchange examples.svg|thumb|The [[Great American Interchange]] on Earth, around ~ 3.5 to 3 Ma, an example of species competition, resulting from continental plate interaction]]
[[File:Magnetosphere Levels.svg|thumb|right|An artist's rendering of the structure of Earth's magnetic field-magnetosphere that protects Earth's life from [[solar radiation]]. 1)&amp;nbsp;Bow shock. 2)&amp;nbsp;Magnetosheath. 3)&amp;nbsp;Magnetopause. 4)&amp;nbsp;Magnetosphere. 5)&amp;nbsp;Northern tail lobe. 6)&amp;nbsp;Southern tail lobe. 7)&amp;nbsp;Plasmasphere.]]
Rare Earth proponents argue that [[plate tectonics]] and a strong [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic field]] are essential for  [[biodiversity]], [[global temperature regulation]], and the [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The lack of [[mountain chain]]s elsewhere in the Solar System is direct evidence that Earth is the only body with plate tectonics, and thus the only nearby body capable of supporting life.&lt;ref&gt; {{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate tectonics depend on the right chemical composition and a long-lasting source of heat from [[radioactive decay]]. Continents must be made of less dense [[felsic]] rocks that "float" on underlying denser [[mafic]] rock. Taylor&lt;ref name=Taylor98/&gt; emphasizes that tectonic [[subduction]] zones require the lubrication of oceans of water. Plate tectonics also provides a means of [[Biogeochemical cycle|biochemical cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/4076-plate-tectonics-essential-alien-life.html Plate Tectonics Could Be Essential for Alien Life], By Lee Pullen, Astrobiology Magazine, February 19, 2009, SPACE.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate tectonics and as a result [[continental drift]] and the creation of separate land masses would create diversified [[ecosystem]]s and [[biodiversity]], one of the strongest defences against extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Ward, R. D. &amp; Brownlee, D.}} 2000. ''[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geophys/platelif.html Plate tectonics essential for complex evolution]'' - [[Rare Earth (book)|Rare Earth]] - [[Copernicus Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of species diversification and later competition on Earth's continents is the [[Great American Interchange]]. North and Middle America drifted into [[South America]] at around 3.5 to 3 Ma. The [[fauna]] of South America evolved separately for about 30 million years, since [[Antarctica]] separated. Many species were subsequently wiped out in mainly South America by competing [[North America|Northern American]] animals.

===A large moon===
[[File:Porto Covo February 2009-2.jpg|thumb|left|Tide pools resulting from tidal interaction of the Moon are said to have promoted the evolution of complex life.]]
The Moon is unusual because the other rocky planets in the Solar System either have no satellites ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]]), or only tiny satellites which are probably captured asteroids ([[Mars]]).

The [[Giant-impact hypothesis|Giant-impact theory]] hypothesizes that the Moon resulted from the impact of a [[Mars]]-sized body, dubbed [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], with the young Earth. This giant impact also gave the Earth its [[axial tilt]]  (inclination) and velocity of rotation.&lt;ref name=Taylor98&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid rotation reduces the daily variation in temperature and makes [[photosynthesis]] viable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-rotation-summer-solstice/ scientificamerican.com, Fact or Fiction: The Days (and Nights) Are Getting Longer, By Adam Hadhazy, 14 June 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rare Earth'' hypothesis further argues that the axial tilt cannot be too large or too small (relative to the [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]). A planet with a large tilt will experience extreme seasonal variations in climate. A planet with little or no tilt will lack the stimulus to evolution that climate variation provides.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In this view, the Earth's tilt is "just right". The gravity of a large satellite also stabilizes the planet's tilt; without this effect the [[precession|variation in tilt]] would be [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], probably making complex life forms on land impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dartnell|2007|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Earth had no Moon, the ocean [[tide]]s resulting solely from the Sun's gravity would be only half that of the lunar tides. A large satellite gives rise to [[tidal pool]]s, which may be essential for the formation of [[macromolecule|complex life]], though this is far from certain.&lt;ref&gt;A formal description of the hypothesis is given in: {{Cite journal |last=Lathe |first=Richard |date=March 2004 |title=Fast tidal cycling and the origin of life |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |volume=168 |issue=1 |pages=18–22 |quote=tidal cycling, resembling the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mechanism, could only replicate and amplify DNA-like polymers. This mechanism suggests constraints on the evolution of extra-terrestrial life. |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2003.10.018 |bibcode=2004Icar..168...18L |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001910350300383X}} It is taught less formally here: {{Cite web |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/lec25.html |title=Origin of Life |accessdate=31 October 2007 |first=James |last=Schombert |publisher=University of Oregon |quote=with the vastness of the Earth's oceans it is statistically very improbable that these early proteins would ever link up. The solution is that the huge tides from the Moon produced inland tidal pools, which would fill and evaporate on a regular basis to produce high concentrations of amino acids.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large satellite also increases the likelihood of [[plate tectonics]] through the effect of [[tidal force]]s on the planet's crust.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The impact that formed the Moon may also have initiated plate tectonics, without which the [[continental crust]] would cover the entire planet, leaving no room for [[oceanic crust]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} It is possible that the large scale [[mantle convection]] needed to drive plate tectonics could not have emerged in the absence of crustal inhomogeneity. A further theory indicates that such a large moon may also contribute to maintaining a planet's magnetic shield by continually acting upon a metallic planetary core as dynamo, thus protecting the surface of the planet from charged particles and cosmic rays, and helping to ensure the atmosphere is not stripped over time by solar winds.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Atmosphere===
A terrestrial planet of the right size is needed to retain an atmosphere, like Earth and Venus.

===One or more evolutionary triggers for complex life===
[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|This diagram illustrates the ''twofold cost of sex''. If each individual were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the sexual population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation]]
Regardless of whether planets with similar physical attributes to the Earth are rare or not, some argue that life usually remains simple bacteria. Biochemist [[Nick Lane]] argues that simple cells ([[prokaryote]]s) emerged soon after Earth's formation, but since almost half the planet's life had passed before they evolved into complex ones ([[eukaryote]]s) all of whom share a [[common ancestor]], this event can only have happened once. In some views, [[prokaryote]]s lack the cellular architecture to evolve into eukaryotes because a bacterium expanded up to eukaryotic proportions would have tens of thousands of times less energy available; two billion years ago, one simple cell incorporated itself into another, multiplied, and evolved into [[mitochondria]] that supplied the vast increase in available energy that enabled the evolution of complex life. If this incorporation occurred only once in four billion years or is otherwise unlikely, then life on most planets remains simple.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view is that mitochondria evolution was environmentally triggered, and that mitochondria-containing organisms appeared soon after the first traces of atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, W. &amp; Mentel, M. (2010)[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-origin-of-mitochondria-14232356# The Origin of Mitochondria. Nature Education] 3(9):58&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution and persistence of [[evolution of sexual reproduction|sexual reproduction]] is another mystery in biology. The purpose of [[sexual reproduction]] is unclear, as in many organisms it has a 50% cost (fitness disadvantage) in relation to [[asexual reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mating type]]s (types of [[gamete]]s, according to their compatibility) may have arisen as a result of [[anisogamy]] (gamete dimorphism), or the male and female genders may have evolved before anisogamy.&lt;ref&gt;T. Togashi, P. Cox (Eds.) ''The Evolution of Anisogamy''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; 2011, p. 22-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. &amp; Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Oxford University Press, p. 25 [https://books.google.com/books?id=d4cLBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Online resources, [http://www.oup.co.uk/companion/beukeboom].&lt;/ref&gt; It is also unknown why most sexual organisms use a binary [[mating system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Czárán |first1=T.L. |last2=Hoekstra |first2=R.F. |year=2006 |title=Evolution of sexual asymmetry |url=|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=4 |issue=|pages=34–46 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-4-34|pmid=15383154 |pmc=524165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and why some organisms have gamete dimorphism. [[Charles Darwin]] was the first to suggest that [[sexual selection]] drives [[speciation]]; without it, complex life would probably not have evolved.

===The right time in evolution===
[[File:Timeline evolution of life.svg|left|thumb|Timeline of evolution; [[History of writing|human writings]] exists for only 0.000218% of Earth's history.]] 
While life on Earth is regarded to have spawned relatively early in the planet's history, the evolution from multicellular to intelligent organisms took around 800 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~ulm/papers/ECh7.pdf 800 million years for complex organ evolution] - [[Heidelberg University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Civilizations on Earth have existed for about 12,000 years and radio communication reaching space has existed for less than 100 years. Relative to the age of the Solar System (~4.57 Ga) this is a short time, in which extreme climatic variations, super volcanoes, and large meteorite impacts were absent. These events would severely harm intelligent life, as well as life in general. For example, the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic mass extinction]], caused by widespread and continuous volcanic eruptions in an area the size of Western Europe, led to the extinction of 95% of known species around 251.2 [[Mega-annum|Ma]] ago. About 65 million years ago, the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub]] impact at the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (~65.5 Ma) on the [[Yucatán peninsula]] in [[Mexico]] led to a mass extinction of the most advanced species at that time.

If there were intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations able to make contact with distant Earth, they would have to live in the same 12Ka period of the 800Ma evolution of life.

==Rare Earth equation==
The following discussion is adapted from Cramer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cramer|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rare Earth equation is Ward and Brownlee's [[riposte]] to the [[Drake equation]]. It calculates &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the number of Earth-like planets in the Milky Way having complex life forms, as:
[[File:Pikaia gracilens B.jpg|thumb|upright|According to Rare Earth, the Cambrian explosion that saw extreme diversification of [[chordata]] from simple forms like Pikaia (pictured) was an improbable event]]
:&lt;math&gt;N=N^* \cdot n_e \cdot f_g \cdot f_p \cdot f_{pm} \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot f_l \cdot f_m \cdot f_j \cdot f_{me}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=271–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where:
* ''N*'' is the number of stars in the [[Milky Way]]. This number is not well-estimated, because the Milky Way's mass is not well estimated, with little information about the number of small stars. ''N*'' is at least 100 billion, and may be as high as 500 billion, if there are many low visibility stars.
* &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; is the average number of planets in a star's habitable zone. This zone is fairly narrow, because constrained by the requirement that the average planetary temperature be consistent with water remaining liquid throughout the time required for complex life to evolve. Thus &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt;=1 is a likely upper bound.
We assume &lt;math&gt;N^* \cdot n_e=5\cdot10^{11}&lt;/math&gt;. The Rare Earth hypothesis can then be viewed as asserting that the product of the other nine Rare Earth equation factors listed below, which are all fractions, is no greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; and could plausibly be as small as 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;. In the latter case, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; could be as small as 0 or 1. Ward and Brownlee do not actually calculate the value of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, because the numerical values of quite a few of the factors below can only be conjectured. They cannot be estimated simply because [[Anthropic principle|we have but one data point]]: the Earth, a rocky planet orbiting a [[Stellar classification#Class G|G2]] star in a quiet suburb of a large [[barred spiral galaxy]], and the home of the only intelligent species we know, namely ourselves.
* &lt;math&gt;f_g&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of stars in the galactic habitable zone (Ward, Brownlee, and Gonzalez estimate this factor as 0.1&lt;ref name=Gonzalez/&gt;).
* &lt;math&gt;f_p&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of stars in the [[Milky Way]] with planets.
* &lt;math&gt;f_{pm}&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planets that are rocky ("metallic") rather than gaseous.
* &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of habitable planets where microbial life arises. Ward and Brownlee believe this fraction is unlikely to be small.
* &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planets where complex life evolves. For 80% of the time since microbial life first appeared on the Earth, there was only bacterial life. Hence Ward and Brownlee argue that this fraction may be small.
* &lt;math&gt;f_l&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of the total lifespan of a planet during which complex life is present. Complex life cannot endure indefinitely, because the energy put out by the sort of star that allows complex life to emerge gradually rises, and the central star eventually becomes a [[red giant]], engulfing all planets in the planetary habitable zone. Also, given enough time, a catastrophic extinction of all complex life becomes ever more likely.
* &lt;math&gt;f_m&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of habitable planets with a large moon. If the [[giant impact theory]] of the Moon's origin is correct, this fraction is small.
* &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planetary systems with large Jovian planets. This fraction could be large.
* &lt;math&gt;f_{me}&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planets with a sufficiently low number of extinction events. Ward and Brownlee argue that the low number of such events the Earth has experienced since the [[Cambrian explosion]] may be unusual, in which case this fraction would be small.

The Rare Earth equation, unlike the [[Drake equation]], does not factor the probability that complex life evolves into [[intelligence|intelligent life]] that discovers technology (Ward and Brownlee are not [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]]). Barrow and Tipler&lt;ref&gt;{{BarrowTipler1986}} Section 3.2&lt;/ref&gt; review the consensus among such biologists that the evolutionary path from primitive Cambrian [[chordate]]s, e.g., ''[[Pikaia]]'' to ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', was a highly improbable event. For example, the large [[brain]]s of humans have marked adaptive disadvantages, requiring as they do an expensive [[metabolism]], a long [[gestation period]], and a childhood lasting more than 25% of the average total life span. Other improbable features of humans include:
*Being one of a handful of extant [[bipedal]] land (non-avian) [[vertebrate]]. Combined with an unusual [[eye–hand coordination]], this permits dextrous manipulations of the physical environment with the [[hand]]s;
*A [[vocal folds|vocal apparatus]] far more expressive{{citation needed|reason=What about dolphins? Their ability to communicate complex ideas is indisputable. Also, dolphins clearly have culture.|date=August 2016}} than that of any other mammal, enabling [[speech]]. Speech makes it possible for humans to interact cooperatively, to share knowledge, and to acquire a culture;
*The capability of formulating [[abstraction]]s to a degree permitting the invention of [[mathematics]], and the discovery of [[science]] and [[technology]]. Only recently did humans acquire anything like their current scientific and technological sophistication.

==Advocates==
Writers who support the Rare Earth hypothesis:
* [[Stuart Ross Taylor]],&lt;ref name=Taylor98/&gt; a specialist on the Solar System, firmly believes in the hypothesis. Taylor concludes that the Solar System is probably unusual, because it resulted from so many chance factors and events.
* Stephen Webb,&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"/&gt; a physicist, mainly presents and rejects candidate solutions for the [[Fermi paradox]]. The Rare Earth hypothesis emerges as one of the few solutions left standing by the end of the book.
* [[Simon Conway Morris]], a [[paleontologist]], endorses the Rare Earth hypothesis in chapter 5 of his ''Life's Solution: Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conway Morris|2003|loc=Ch. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cites Ward and Brownlee's book with approval.&lt;ref&gt;Conway Morris, 2003, p. 344, n. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank J. Tipler]] (1986. 3.2, 8.7, 9), [[cosmologist]]s, vigorously defend the hypothesis that humans are likely to be the only intelligent life in the [[Milky Way]], and perhaps the entire universe. But this hypothesis is not central to their book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'', a thorough study of the [[anthropic principle]] and of how the laws of physics are peculiarly suited to enable the emergence of complexity in nature.
* [[Ray Kurzweil]], a computer pioneer and self-proclaimed [[Singularitarian]], argues in ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that the coming [[Technological singularity|Singularity]] requires that Earth be the first planet on which sentient, technology-using life evolved. Although other Earth-like planets could exist, Earth must be the most evolutionarily advanced, because otherwise we would have seen evidence that another culture had experienced the [[Technological singularity|Singularity]] and expanded to harness the full computational capacity of the physical universe.

=={{anchor|Criticism}}Criticism==
Cases against the Rare Earth Hypothesis take various forms.

===Anthropic reasoning===
The hypothesis concludes, more or less, that complex life is rare because it can evolve only on the surface of an Earth-like planet or on a suitable satellite of a planet. Some biologists, such as [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]], believe this assumption too restrictive and unimaginative; they see it as a form of [[begging the question|circular reasoning]].

According to [[David Darling (astronomer)|David Darling]], the Rare Earth hypothesis is neither [[hypothesis]] nor [[prediction]], but merely a description of how life arose on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darling|2001|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his view Ward and Brownlee have done nothing more than select the factors that best suit their case.

&lt;blockquote&gt;What matters is not whether there's anything unusual about the Earth; there's going to be something [[idiosyncratic]] about every planet in space. What matters is whether any of Earth's circumstances are not only unusual but also essential for complex life. So far we've seen nothing to suggest there is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darling|2001|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics also argue that there is a link between the Rare Earth Hypothesis and the [[creationist]] ideas of [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, Kendrick. 'Was the 'Rare Earth' Hypothesis Influenced by a Creationist?' The Skeptical Inquirer. 1 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exoplanets around main sequence stars are being discovered in large numbers===
{{see also|Estimated frequency of Earth-like planets}}
An increasing number of [[extrasolar planet]] discoveries are being made with {{Extrasolar planet counts|planet_count}} planets in {{Extrasolar planet counts|system_count}} planetary systems known as of {{Extrasolar planet counts|asof}}.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |work=[[The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php |last=Schneider |first=Jean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rare Earth proponents argue life cannot arise outside Sun-like systems. However, [[Planetary habitability#Red dwarf systems|some exobiologists have suggested]] that stars outside this range may give [[Abiogenesis|rise to life]] under the right circumstances; this possibility is a central point of contention to the theory because these late-K and M category stars make up about 82% of all hydrogen-burning stars.&lt;ref name="RECONS1"/&gt;

Current technology limits the testing of important Rare Earth criteria: surface water, tectonic plates, a large moon and [[biosignature]]s are currently undetectable. Though planets the size of Earth are difficult to detect and classify, scientists now think that rocky planets are common around Sun-like stars.&lt;ref name="HowardSanchis-Ojeda2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Howard |first1=Andrew W. |display-authors=etal |title=A rocky composition for an Earth-sized exoplanet |journal=Nature |volume=503 |issue=7476 |year=2013 |pages=381–384 |doi=10.1038/nature12767 |pmid=24172898 |arxiv=1310.7988 |bibcode=2013Natur.503..381H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Earth Similarity Index]] (ESI) of mass, radius and temperature provides a means of measurement, but falls short of the full Rare Earth criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-11/21/exoplanet-indices |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925005119/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-11/21/exoplanet-indices |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Gary [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-22/new-recipe-in-search-for-alien-life/3686408/ New approach in search for alien life] ABC Online. 22 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that Rare Earth's estimates of rocky planets in habitable zones (&lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; in the Rare Earth equation) are too restrictive.

Ward and Brownlee argue that for complex life to evolve (Rare Earth equation factor &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt;), [[tectonics]] must be present to generate [[biogeochemical cycles]], and predicted that such geological features would not be found outside of Earth, pointing to a lack of observable mountain ranges and [[orogenic|subduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=191–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, no scientific consensus on the evolution of plate tectonics on Earth.

NASA scientists Hartman and McKay argue that plate tectonics may in fact slow the rise of oxygenation (and thus stymie complex life rather than promote it).&lt;ref&gt;Hartman H, McKay CP "Oxygenic photosynthesis and the oxidation state of Mars." Planet Space Sci. 1995 Jan-Feb;43(1-2):123-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer modelling by Tilman Spohn in 2014 found that plate tectonics on Earth may have arisen from the effects of complex life's emergence, rather than the other way around as the Rare Earth might suggest.

====A magnetic field may not be a requirement====
The importance of Earth's magnetic field to the development of complex life has been disputed. Kasting argues that the atmosphere provides sufficient protection against cosmic rays even during times of magnetic pole reversal and atmosphere loss by sputtering.&lt;ref name="Kasting 2001"/&gt; Kasting also dismisses the role of the magnetic field in the evolution of eukaryotes, citing the age of the oldest known [[magnetofossils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasting|2001|pp=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A large moon may neither be rare nor necessary===
The requirement of a large moon (Rare Earth equation factor &lt;math&gt;f_m&lt;/math&gt;) has also been challenged. Even if it were required, such an occurrence may not be as unique as predicted by the Rare Earth Hypothesis. Recent work by [[Edward Belbruno]] and [[J. Richard Gott]] of Princeton University suggests that giant impactors such as those that may have formed the [[Moon]] can indeed form in planetary [[trojan points]] ({{L4}} or {{L5}} [[Lagrangian point]]) which means that similar circumstances may occur in other planetary systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=E. |last=Belbruno |author2=J.

Rare Earth's assertion that the Moon's stabilization of Earth's obliquity and spin is a requirement for complex life has been questioned. Kasting argues that a moonless Earth would still possess habitats with climates suitable for complex life and questions whether the spin rate of a moonless Earth can be predicted.&lt;ref name="Kasting 2001"/&gt; Although the [[giant impact theory]] posits that the impact forming the Moon increased Earth's rotational speed to make a day about 5 hours long, the Moon has slowly "[[Tidal deceleration#Tidal deceleration|stolen]]" much of this speed to reduce Earth's solar day since then to about 24 hours and continues to do so: in 100 million years Earth's solar day will be roughly 24 hours 38 minutes (the same as Mars's solar day); in 1 billion years, 30 hours 23 minutes. Larger secondary bodies would exert proportionally larger tidal forces that would in turn decelerate their primaries faster and potentially increase the solar day of a planet in all other respects like Earth to over 120 hours within a few billion years. This long solar day would make effective heat dissipation for organisms in the tropics and subtropics extremely difficult in a similar manner to tidal locking to a red dwarf star. Short days (high rotation speed) causes high wind speeds at ground level. Long days (slow rotation speed) cause the day and night temperatures to be too extreme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/earth/what-would-happen-if-our-planet-became-tidally-locked-130202.htm discovery.com What If Earth Became Tidally Locked? 2 February 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rare Earth proponents argue that simple life may be common, though complex life requires specific environmental conditions to arise. Critics consider life could arise on a [[natural satellite|moon]] of a gas giant, though this is less likely if life requires volcanicity. The moon must have stresses to induce tidal heating, but not so dramatic as seen on Jupiter's Io. However, the moon is within the gas giant's intense radiation belts, sterilizing any biodiversity before it can get established. [[Dirk Schulze-Makuch]] disputes this, hypothesizing alternative biochemistries for alien life.&lt;ref name="Schulze-MakuchIrwin2008"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dirk Schulze-Makuch |author2=Louis Neal Irwin |title=Life in the Universe: Expectations and Constraints |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdjoTGAvrkkC&amp;pg=PA1 |date=2 October 2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3-540-76816-6 |pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Rare Earth proponents argue that only microbial extremophiles could exist in subsurface habitats beyond Earth, some argue that complex life can also arise in these environments.

[[Image:Schist detail.jpg|thumb|Schist specimen showing the characteristic "scaly" schistose texture, caused by platy micas]]

'''Schist''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɪ|s|t}} {{respell|SHIST|'}}) is a medium-[[Metamorphism#Metamorphic_grades|grade]] [[metamorphic rock]].&lt;ref name="GeologyDictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/geology/glossarys.html#schist |title=Schist definition |work=Dictionary of Geology |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schist has medium to large, flat, sheet-like grains in a preferred orientation (nearby grains are roughly parallel). It is defined by having more than 50% [[Crystal habit#List of crystal habits|platy]] and elongated minerals (such as micas or talc),&lt;ref name="Glossary"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfnSesBc-RgC&amp;pg=PA577&amp;dq=schist+definition+50%25+platy+-study&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xD75UrviN4O0hAfg8YCgBw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=schist%20definition%2050%25%20platy%20-study&amp;f=false | title=Glossary of Geology | publisher=Springer | author=Jackson J.A., Mehl J.P. &amp; Neuendorf K.K.E. | year=2005 | page=577 | isbn=9780922152766}}&lt;/ref&gt; often finely interleaved with quartz and [[feldspar]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge Guide"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnianWtB5WgC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=schist+quartz+feldspar+interleaved&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LUT5UuqcJc-ThQeUxYGgCQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=schist%20quartz%20feldspar%20interleaved&amp;f=false | title=Cambridge Guide to Minerals, Rocks and Fossils | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | author=Bishop A.C., Woolley A.R. &amp; Hamilton W.R. | year=1999 | page=153 | isbn=9780521778817}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lamellar (flat, planar) [[mineral]]s include [[mica]]s, [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[talc]], [[hornblende]], [[graphite]], and others. [[Quartz]] often occurs in drawn-out grains to such an extent that a particular form called quartz schist is produced. Schist is often [[garnet]]iferous. Schist forms at a higher temperature and has larger grains than [[phyllite]].&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; Geological [[Foliation (geology)|foliation]] (metamorphic arrangement in layers) with medium to large grained flakes in a preferred sheetlike orientation is called ''schistosity''.&lt;ref name=EG&gt;Essentials of Geology, 3rd Ed, Stephen Marshak&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of various schists are derived from their mineral constituents. For example, schists primarily composed of [[biotite]] and [[muscovite]] are called mica schists.&lt;ref name="GeologyDictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/693684089|title=Earth science|last=J.|first=Tarbuck, Edward|date=2012|publisher=Prentice Hall/Pearson|others=Lutgens, Frederick K.|isbn=0321688503|edition=13th|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|oclc=693684089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most schists are mica schists, but graphite and chlorite schists are also common. Schists are also named for their prominent or perhaps unusual mineral constituents, as in the case of [[garnet]] schist, [[tourmaline]] schist, and [[glaucophane]] schist.

The individual [[mineral]] grains in schist, drawn out into flaky scales by heat and pressure, can be seen with the naked eye. Schist is characteristically ''foliated'', meaning that the individual mineral grains split off easily into flakes or slabs. The word schist is derived ultimately from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''σχίζειν'' (''schízein'') meaning "to split",&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/schist | title=Schist | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | work=English Dictionary | accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a reference to the ease with which schists can be split along the plane in which the platy minerals lie.

Most schists are derived from [[clay]]s and [[mud]]s that have passed through a series of metamorphic processes involving the production of [[shale]]s, [[slate]]s and [[phyllite]]s as intermediate steps. Certain schists are derived from fine-grained [[igneous rock]]s such as [[basalt]]s and [[tuff]]s.

==Historical mining terminology==
Before the mid-18th century, the terms slate, shale and schist  were not sharply differentiated by those involved with mining.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Raymond, Slate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FpqFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA78 A Glossary of Mining and Metallurigical Terms], American Institute of Mining Engineers, 1881, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of underground [[coal mining]], shale was frequently referred to as [[slate]] well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Albert H. Fay, Slate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=y6hCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA622 A Glossary of the Mining and Mineral Industry], United States Bureau of Mines, 1920, p. 622.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
During metamorphism, rocks which were originally sedimentary, igneous or metamorphic are converted into schists and [[gneiss]]es. If the composition of the rocks was originally similar, they may be very difficult to distinguish from one another if the metamorphism has been great. A [[quartz-porphyry]], for example, and a fine grained feldspathic sandstone, may both be converted into a grey or pink mica-schist.  Usually, however, it is possible to distinguish between sedimentary and igneous schists and gneisses. If, for example, the whole district occupied by these rocks has traces of bedding, [[clastic]] structure, or [[Unconformity|unconformability]], then it may be a sign that the original rock was sedimentary. In other cases [[Intrusive rock|intrusive]] junctions, chilled edges, contact alteration or porphyritic structure may prove that in its original condition a metamorphic gneiss was an igneous rock. The last appeal is often to the chemistry, for there are certain rock types which occur only as sediments, while others are found only among igneous masses, and however advanced the metamorphism may be, it rarely modifies the chemical composition of the mass very greatly. Such rocks as [[limestone]]s, [[Dolostone|dolomite]]s, [[quartzite]]s and aluminous shales have very definite chemical characteristics which distinguish them even when completely recrystallized.

The schists are classified principally according to the minerals they consist of and on their chemical composition. For example, many metamorphic limestones, marbles, and calc-schists, with crystalline dolomites, contain silicate minerals such as mica, [[tremolite]], [[diopside]], [[scapolite]], quartz and [[feldspar]]. They are derived from calcareous sediments of different degrees of purity. Another group is rich in quartz (quartzites, quartz schists and quartzose gneisses), with variable amounts of white and black mica, [[garnet]], feldspar, [[zoisite]] and [[hornblende]]. These were once sandstones and arenaceous rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th Edition, [http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/s/schists.html], retrieved December 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The graphitic schists may readily be believed to represent sediments once containing coal or plant remains; there are also schistose [[ironstone]]s ([[hematite]]-schists), but metamorphic beds of salt or [[gypsum]] are exceedingly uncommon. Among schists of igneous origin there are the silky calc-schists, the foliated [[Serpentine group|serpentine]]s (once [[ultramafic]] masses rich in [[olivine]]), and the white mica-schists, porphyroids and banded [[halleflinta]]s, which have been derived from [[rhyolite]]s, quartz-porphyries and felsic [[tuff]]s. The majority of mica-schists, however, are altered [[claystone]]s and shales, and pass into the normal sedimentary rocks through various types of [[phyllite]] and mica-slates.  They are among the most common metamorphic rocks; some of them are [[Graphite|graphitic]] and others calcareous. The diversity in appearance and composition is very great, but they form a well-defined group not difficult to recognize, from the abundance of black and white micas and their thin, foliated, schistose character. A subgroup is the [[andalusite]]-, [[staurolite]]-, [[kyanite]]- and [[sillimanite]]-schists which usually make their appearance in the vicinity of gneissose granites, and have presumably been affected by contact metamorphism.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering considerations==
In [[geotechnical engineering]] a schistosity plane often forms a [[Discontinuity (Geotechnical engineering)|discontinuity]] that may have a large influence on the mechanical behavior (strength, deformation, etc.) of rock masses in, for example, [[tunnel]], [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]], or [[Slope stability analysis|slope]] construction.

[[File:Orion1 big.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Airglow made visible from aboard the [[International Space Station|ISS]]]]

'''Sky brightness''' refers to the [[visual perception]] of the [[sky]] and how it [[light scattering|scatters]] and [[diffuse sky radiation|diffuses]] light. The fact that the sky is not completely dark at [[night]] is easily visible. If light sources (e.g. the [[moonlight|Moon]] and [[light pollution]]) were removed from the [[night sky]], it would appear absolutely dark. [[Silhouette]]s of objects against the sky itself would not be visible.

The sky's brightness varies greatly over the day, and the primary cause differs as well. During [[daytime]], when the [[Sun]] is above the horizon, the [[Rayleigh scattering|direct scattering]] of [[sunlight]] is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. During [[twilight]] (the duration after [[sunset]] or before [[sunrise]] until or since, respectively, the full darkness of night), the situation is more complicated, and a further differentiation is required.

Twilight (both [[dusk]] and [[dawn]]) is divided into three 6° segments that mark the Sun's position below the horizon. At [[civil twilight]], the center of the Sun's disk appears to be between 1/4° and 6° below the horizon. At [[nautical twilight]], the Sun's [[horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] is between –6° and –12°. At [[astronomical twilight]], the Sun is between –12° and –18°. When the Sun's depth is more than 18°, the sky generally attains its maximum darkness.

Sources of the night sky's intrinsic brightness include [[airglow]], indirect scattering of [[sunlight]], scattering of [[starlight]], and [[skyglow|light pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=F. Patat |url=http://www.eso.org/~fpatat/science/skybright/ |title=The Brightness of the Night Sky |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airglow==
When physicist [[Anders Ångström]] examined the spectrum of the [[aurora borealis]], he discovered that even on nights when the aurora was absent, its characteristic green line was still present. It was not until the 1920s that scientists were beginning to identify and understand the [[emission line]]s in aurorae and of the sky itself, and what was causing them. The green line Angstrom observed is in fact an emission line with a wavelength of 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm, caused by the recombination of oxygen in the upper atmosphere.

Airglow is the collective name of the various processes in the upper atmosphere that result in the emission of photons, with the driving force being primarily [[ultraviolet|UV radiation]] from the Sun. Several emission lines are dominant: a green line from oxygen at 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm, a yellow doublet from sodium at 589.0 and 589.6&amp;nbsp;nm, and red lines from oxygen at 630.0 and 636.4&amp;nbsp;nm.

The sodium emissions come from a thin [[sodium layer]] approximately 10&amp;nbsp;km thick at an altitude of 90–100&amp;nbsp;km, above the [[mesopause]] and in the D-layer of the [[ionosphere]]. The red oxygen lines originate at altitudes of about 300&amp;nbsp;km, in the F-layer. The green oxygen emissions are more spatially distributed. How sodium gets to mesospheric heights is not yet well understood, but it is believed to be a combination of upward transport of [[sea salt]] and [[meteor]]itic dust.

In daytime, sodium and red oxygen emissions are dominant and roughly 1,000 times as bright as nighttime emissions because in daytime, the upper atmosphere is fully exposed to solar UV radiation. The effect is however not noticeable to the human eye, since the glare of [[Rayleigh scattering|directly scattered]] sunlight outshines and obscures it.

==Indirect scattering of sunlight==
[[Image:Illuminated-arimass.png|250px|thumb|Amount of air still illuminated after sunset, at the horizon. Normalized so that zenith is 1 airmass]]
Indirectly scattered sunlight comes from two directions. From the atmosphere itself, and from outer space. In the first case, the sun has just set but still illuminates the upper atmosphere directly. Because the amount of scattered sunlight is proportional to the number of scatterers (i.e. air molecules) in the line of sight, the intensity of this light decreases rapidly as the sun drops further below the horizon and illuminates less of the atmosphere.

When the sun's altitude is &lt; -6° 99% of the atmosphere in [[zenith]] is in the Earth's shadow and second order scattering takes over. At the horizon, however, 35% of the atmosphere along the line of sight is still directly illuminated, and continues to be until the sun reaches -12°. From -12° to -18° only the uppermost parts of the atmosphere along the horizon, directly above the spot where the sun is, is still illuminated. After that, all direct illumination ceases and astronomical darkness sets in.

A second source sunlight is the [[zodiacal light]], which is caused by reflection and scattering of sunlight on interplanetary dust. Zodiacal light varies quite a lot in intensity depending on the position of the earth, location of the observer, time of year, and composition and distribution of the reflecting dust.

==Scattered light from extraterrestrial sources==
Not only sunlight is scattered by the molecules in the air. Starlight and the diffuse light of the milky way are also scattered by the air, and it is found that stars up to V magnitude 16 contribute to the diffuse scattered starlight.

Other sources such as galaxies and nebulae don't contribute significantly.

The total brightness of all the stars was first measured by Burns in 1899, with a calculated result that the total brightness reaching earth was equivalent to that of 2,000 first-magnitude stars &lt;ref&gt;Burns, G. J., "The total amount of starlight and the brightness of the sky," ''The Observatory, Vol. 33'', p. 123-129, March 1910; available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1910Obs....33..123B SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System] (retrieved 27 Nov. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; with subsequent measurements by others.&lt;ref&gt;Yntema, L., "On the Brightness of the Sky and Total Amount of Starlight," ''Publications of the Kapteyn Astronomical Laboratory Groningen, vol. 22'', pp.1-55 (1909); available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1909PGro...22....1Y SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System] (retrieved 27 Nov. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
''

==Light pollution==
{{Main|Light pollution}}
Light pollution is an ever-increasing source of sky brightness in [[Urban area|urbanized area]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. In densely populated areas that do not have stringent light pollution control, the entire night sky is regularly 5 to 50 times brighter than it would be if all lights were switched off, and very often the influence of light pollution is far greater than natural sources (including moonlight). With [[urbanization]] and light pollution, one third of humanity, and the majority of those in developed countries, cannot see the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/10/milky-way-no-longer-visible-to-one-third-of-humanity-light-pollution|title=Milky Way no longer visible to one third of humanity, light pollution atlas shows|last=Davis|first=Nicola|date=2016-06-10|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twilight==
When the sun has just set, the brightness of the sky decreases rapidly, thereby enabling us to see the airglow that is caused from such high altitudes that they are still fully sunlit until the sun drops more than about 12° below the horizon. During this time, yellow emissions from the sodium layer and red emissions from the 630&amp;nbsp;nm oxygen lines are dominant, and contribute to the purplish color sometimes seen during civil and nautical twilight.

After the sun has also set for these altitudes at the end of nautical twilight, the intensity of light emanating from earlier mentioned lines decreases, until the oxygen-green remains as the dominant source.

When astronomical darkness has set in, the green 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm oxygen line is dominant, and atmospheric scattering of starlight occurs.

Differential refraction causes different parts of the spectrum to dominate, producing a [[Golden hour (photography)|golden hour]] and a [[blue hour]].

==Relative contributions==
The following table gives the relative and absolute contributions to night sky brightness at zenith on a perfectly dark night at middle latitudes without moonlight and in the absence of any [[light pollution]].

(The S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; unit is defined as the surface brightness of a star whose V-magnitude is 10 and whose light is smeared over one square degree, or 27.78 mag arcsec&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.)

The total sky brightness in zenith is therefore ~220 S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; or 21.9 mag/arcsec² in the V-band. Note that the contributions from Airglow and Zodiacal light vary with the time of year, the solar cycle, and the observer's latitude roughly as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Airglow}/{\rm S}_{10} = 145+108(S-0.8)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' is the solar 10.7&amp;nbsp;cm flux in MJy, and various sinusoidally between 0.8 and 2.0 with the 11-year solar cycle, yielding an upper contribution of ~270 S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; at solar maximum.

The intensity of zodiacal light depends on the [[Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitude and longitude]] of the point in the sky being observed relative to that of the sun. At ecliptic longitudes differing from the sun's by &gt; 90 degrees, the relation is 
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm ZodiacalLight}/{\rm S}_{10} = 140 - 90\sin(|\beta|)&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''β'' is the ecliptic latitude and is smaller than 60°, when larger than 60 degrees the contribution is that given in the table. Along the ecliptic plane there are enhancements in the zodiacal light where it is much brighter near the sun and with a secondary maximum opposite the sun at 180 degrees longitude (the [[gegenschein]]).

In extreme cases natural zenith sky brightness can be as high as ~21.0 mag/arcsec², roughly twice as bright as nominal conditions.

The concept of a spherical Earth displaced earlier beliefs in a [[flat Earth]]: In early [[Mesopotamian mythology]], the world was portrayed as a flat disk floating in the ocean with a hemispherical sky-dome above,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy|author=Otto E.

Other speculations on the shape of Earth include a seven-layered [[ziggurat]] or [[cosmic mountain]], alluded to in the [[Avesta]] and ancient [[Persian Empire|Persian]] writings (see [[seven climes]]).

The realization that the [[figure of the Earth]] is more accurately described as an [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] dates to the 17th century, as described by [[Isaac Newton]] in ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''. In the early 19th century, the flattening of the earth ellipsoid was determined to be of the order of 1/300 ([[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]], [[George Everest|Everest]]). The modern value as determined by the [[United States Department of Defense|US DoD]] [[World Geodetic System]] since the 1960s is close to 1/298.25.&lt;ref&gt;See [[figure of the Earth]] and [[Earth radius#Mean radii|Earth radius]] for details. Recent measurements from [[satellite]]s suggest that the Earth is, in fact, slightly [[pear]]-shaped.

==Cause==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}

The Earth is massive enough that [[gravity]] maintains it as a roughly spherical shape. Its formation into a sphere was made easy by its primordial hot, liquid phase.

===Formation===

The [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|Solar System formed]] from a dust cloud that was at least partially the remnant of one or more [[supernova]]s that created heavy elements by [[nucleosynthesis]]. Grains of matter accreted through electrostatic interaction. As they grew in mass, gravity took over in gathering yet more mass, releasing the [[potential energy]] of their collisions and in-falling as [[heat]]. The [[protoplanetary disk]] also had a greater proportion of radioactive elements than the Earth today because, over time, those elements decayed. Their decay heated the early Earth even further, and continue to contribute to [[Earth's internal heat budget]]. The early Earth was thus mostly liquid.

A sphere is the only stable shape for a non-rotating, gravitationally self-attracting liquid. The outward acceleration caused by the Earth's rotation is greater at the equator than at the poles (where is it zero), so the sphere gets deformed into an [[ellipsoid]], which represents the shape having the lowest potential energy for a rotating, fluid body. This ellipsoid is slightly fatter around the equator than a perfect sphere would be. Earth's shape is also slightly lumpy because it is composed of different materials of different densities that exert slightly different amounts of gravitational force per volume.

The liquidity of a hot, newly formed planet allows heavier elements to sink down to the middle and forces lighter elements closer to the surface, a process known as [[planetary differentiation]]. This event is known as the [[iron catastrophe]]; the most abundant heavier elements were [[iron]] and [[nickel]], which now form the [[Earth's core]].

{{further|History of Earth}}

===Later shape changes and effects===

Though the surface rocks of the Earth have cooled enough to solidify, the [[outer core]] of the planet is still hot enough to remain liquid. Energy is still being released; [[volcano|volcanic]] and [[tectonic]] activity has pushed rocks into hills and mountains and blown them out of [[caldera]]s. [[Meteor]]s also create [[impact crater]]s and surrounding ridges. However, if the energy release ceases from these processes, then they tend to [[Erosion|erode]] away over time and return toward the lowest potential-energy curve of the ellipsoid. [[Weather]] powered by [[solar energy]] can also move water, rock, and soil to make the Earth slightly out of round.

Earth undulates as the shape of its lowest potential energy changes daily due to the gravity of the Sun and Moon as they move around with respect to the Earth. This is what causes [[tides]] in the [[ocean]]s' water, which can flow freely along the changing potential.

===Shapes of other bodies===
[[File:Eros, Vesta and Ceres size comparison.jpg|thumb|Composite image showing the round dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]; the slightly smaller, mostly round [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]; and the much smaller, much lumpier [[433 Eros|Eros]]]]
[[File:Comet 67P on 19 September 2014 NavCam mosaic.jpg|thumb|The amorphous nucleus of the comet [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]]]]

The [[IAU definition of planet|IAU definitions of planet]] and [[dwarf planet]] require that a Sun-orbiting body has undergone the rounding process to reach a roughly spherical shape, an achievement known as [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. The same spheroidal shape can be seen from smaller rocky planets like [[Mars]] to [[gas giant]]s like [[Jupiter]].

Any natural Sun-orbiting body that has not reached hydrostatic equilibrium is classified by the IAU as a [[small Solar System body]] (SSB). These come in many non-spherical shapes which are lumpy masses accreted haphazardly by in-falling dust and rock; not enough mass falls in to generate the heat needed to complete the rounding. Some SSSBs are just collections of relatively small rocks that are weakly held next to each other by gravity but are not actually fused into a single big [[bedrock]]. Some larger SSSBs are nearly round but have not reached hydrostatic equilibrium. The small Solar System body [[4 Vesta]] is large enough to have undergone at least partial planetary differentiation.

Stars like the Sun are also spheroidal due to gravity's effects on their [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], which is a free-flowing [[fluid]]. Ongoing [[stellar fusion]] is a much greater source of heat for stars compared to the initial heat released during formation.

==Effects and empirical confirmation==

The roughly spherical shape of the Earth can be confirmed by many different types of observation from ground level, aircraft, and spacecraft.  The shape causes a number of phenomena that a flat Earth would not.  Some of these phenomena and observations would be possible on other shapes, such as a curved [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] or [[torus]], but no other shape would explain all of them.

===Spacecraft===

Many pictures have been taken of the entire Earth by satellites launched by a variety of governments and private organizations. From high orbits, where half the planet can be seen at once, it is plainly spherical.  The only way to piece together all the pictures taken of the ground from lower orbits so that all the surface features line up seamlessly and without distortion is to put them on an approximately spherical surface.

Astronauts in [[low Earth orbit]] can personally see the curvature of the planet, and travel all the way around several times a day.

The astronauts who travelled to the Moon have seen the entire Moon-facing half at once, and can watch the sphere rotate once a day (approximately; the Moon is also moving with respect to the Earth).

===Aircraft===

People in high-flying aircraft or skydiving from high-altitude balloons can plainly see the curvature of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OnJCqtTxsA James May Witnesses Curvature of Earth] (at {{convert|70000|ft}})&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial aircraft do not necessarily fly high enough to make this obvious.  Trying to measure the curvature of the horizon by taking a picture is complicated by the fact that camera lenses can produce distorted images depending on the angle used.  An extreme version of this effect can be seen in the [[fisheye lens]].  Scientific measurements would require a carefully calibrated lens.

The fastest way for an airplane to travel between two distant cities is a [[great circle]] route, which deviates significantly from what would be the fastest straight-line travel path on a flat Earth.

Photos of the ground taken from airplanes over a large enough area also do not fit seamlessly together on a flat surface, but do fit on a roughly spherical surface. Aerial photographs of large areas must be corrected to account for curvature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asprs.org/wp-content/uploads/pers/1958journal/dec/1958_dec_751-756.pdf The Effects of Earth's Curvature and Refraction on the Mensuration of Vertical Photographs]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visibility of distant objects===

{{main|Horizon#Distance to the horizon}}

On a completely flat Earth with no visual interference (such as trees, hills, or atmospheric haze) the ground itself would never obscure distant objects; one would be able to see all the way to the edge of the surface.  A spherical surface has a [[horizon]] which is closer when viewed from a lower altitude.&lt;ref name="smarter"&gt;[https://www.popsci.com/10-ways-you-can-prove-earth-is-round 10 easy ways you can tell for yourself that the Earth is not flat]&lt;/ref&gt;  In theory, a person standing on the surface with eyes {{convert|1.8|m}} above the ground can see the ground up to about {{convert|4.79|km}} away, but a person at the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]] at {{convert|273|m}} can see the ground up to about {{convert|58.98|km}} away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/june32012/index.html Consequences of a living on a sphere]&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon would seem to present a method to verify that the Earth's surface is locally [[wikt:convex|convex]].  If the degree of curvature was determined to be the same everywhere on the Earth's surface, and that surface was determined to be large enough, it would show that the Earth is spherical.

In practice, this turns out to be an unreliable method of measurement, due to variations in atmospheric [[refraction]].  This additional effect can give the impression that the earth's surface is flat, curved more convexly than it is, or even that it is [[wikt:concave|concave]], by bending light travelling near the surface of the earth (as happened in various trials of the famous [[Bedford Level experiment]]).

The phenomenon of variable atmospheric bending can be empirically confirmed by noting that sometimes the refractive layers of air can cause the image of a distant object to be broken into pieces or even turned upside down.  This is commonly seen at sunset, when the sun's shape is distorted, but has also been photographed happening for ships, and has caused the city of Chicago to appear normally, upside down, and broken into pieces from across Lake Michigan (from where it is normally below the horizon).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/earth/the-perfectly-scientific-explanation-for-why-chicago-appeared-upside-down-in-michigan/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc57.com/story/28925566/mirage-of-chicago-skyline-seen-from-michigan-shoreline&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their longer wavelengths, radio waves are even more susceptible to atmospheric refraction and reflection, which can cause radio and television signals to be received from towers thousands of miles away which cannot be seen with visible light.

When the atmosphere is relatively well-mixed, the visual effects generally expected of a spherical Earth can be observed.  For example, ships travelling on large bodies of water (such as the ocean) disappear over the horizon progressively, such that the highest part of the ship can still be seen even when lower parts cannot, proportional to distance from the observer.  The same is true of the coastline or mountain when viewed from a ship or from across a large lake or flat terrain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bco_p4V7-QU A video showing the curvature of the Earth] (using island coastline)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="headsup" /&gt;

===Lunar eclipses ===

The shadow of the Earth on the Moon during a [[lunar eclipse]] is always a dark circle that moves from one side of the moon to the other (partially grazing it during a partial eclipse).  This could be produced by a flat disc that always faces the Moon head-on during the eclipse, but this is inconsistent with the fact that the Moon is only rarely directly overhead during an eclipse. For each eclipse, the local surface of the Earth is pointed in a somewhat different direction.  The shadow of a circular disc held at an angle is an oval, not a circle as is seen during the eclipse.  The idea of the Earth being a flat disc is also inconsistent with the fact that a given lunar eclipse is only visible from half of the Earth at a time.

The only shape that casts a round shadow no matter which direction it is pointed is a sphere, and the ancient Greeks deduced that this must mean the Earth is spherical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollack|first1=Rebecca|title=Ancient Myths Revised with Lunar Eclipse|url=https://www.astro.umd.edu/openhouse/3about-the-obs/news/2003-11-10.html|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observation of the stars at altitude===

On a perfectly spherical Earth, flat terrain or ocean, when viewed from the surface, blocks exactly half the sky - a hemisphere of 180°. Moving away from the surface of the Earth means that the ground blocks less and less of the sky.  For example, when viewed from the Moon, the Earth blocks only a small portion of the sky, because it is so distant.  This phenomenon of geometry means that when viewed from a high mountain, flat ground or ocean blocks less than 180° of the sky. The rate of change in the angle blocked by the sky as altitude increases is different for a disc than a sphere, and values observed show that the Earth is locally convex.  (The angles blocked would also be different for a mountain close to the edge of a flat Earth compared to a mountain in the middle of a flat Earth, and this is not observed.)  In theory, measurements of this type from all around the Earth would confirm that it is a complete sphere (as opposed to some other shape with convex areas) though actually taking all those measurements would be very expensive.

Using other evidence to hypothesize a spherical shape, the medieval Iranian scholar [[Al-Biruni]] used this phenomenon to calculate the Earth's circumference to within {{convert|16.8|km}} of the correct value.&lt;ref name="headsup" /&gt;

===Observation of the fixed stars from different locations===

The [[fixed stars]] can be demonstrated to be very far away, by [[diurnal parallax]] measurements (a technique known at least as early as Ancient Greece).  Unlike the Sun, Moon, and planets, they do not change position with respect to one another (at least not perceptibly over the span of a human lifetime); the shapes of the [[constellation]]s are always the same.  This makes them a convenient reference background for determining the shape of the Earth.  Adding distance measurements on the ground allows calculation of the Earth's size.

The fact that different stars are visible from different locations on the Earth was noticed in ancient times. [[Aristotle]] wrote that some stars are visible from Egypt which are not visible from Europe.&lt;ref name="headsup"&gt;[http://headsup.boyslife.org/ten-reasons-we-know-earth-is-round/ How We Know the Earth Is Actually Round]&lt;/ref&gt; This would not be possible if the Earth was flat.&lt;ref name="smarter" /&gt;

At the [[North Pole]] it is continuously nighttime for six months of the year and the same hemisphere of stars (a 180° view) are always visible making one counterclockwise rotation every 24 hours. The star [[Polaris]] (the "North Star") is almost at the center of this rotation (which is directly overhead). Some of the [[88 modern constellations]] visible are [[Ursa Major]] (including the [[Big Dipper]]), [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], and [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]. The other six months of the year, it is continuously daytime and the light from the Sun mostly blots out the stars.  (The location of the poles can be defined by these phenomena, which only occur there; more than 24 hours of continuous daylight can occur north of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]].)

At the [[South Pole]], a completely non-overlapping set of constellations are visible during the six months of continuous nighttime, including [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Crux]], and [[Centaurus]].  This 180° hemisphere of stars rotate clockwise once every 24 hours, around a point directly overhead (where there do not happen to be any particularly bright stars).

The fact that the stars visible from the north and south poles do not overlap must mean that the two observation spots are on opposite sides of the Earth, which is not possible if the Earth is a single-sided disc, but is possible for other shapes (like a sphere, but also any other convex shape like a donut or dumbbell).

From any point on the [[equator]], 360° of stars are visible over the course of the night, as the sky rotates around a line drawn from due north to due south (which could be defined as "the directions to walk to get to the poles in the shortest amount of time").  When facing east, the stars visible from the north pole are on the left, and the stars visible from the south pole are on the right.  This means the equator must be facing at a 90° angle from the poles.

The direction any intermediate spot on the Earth is facing can also be calculated by measuring the angles of the fixed stars and determining how much of the sky is visible.  For example, [[New York City]] is about 40° north of the equator.  The apparent motion of the Sun blots out slightly different parts of the sky from day to day, but over the course of the entire year it sees a dome of 280° (360° - 80°).  So for example, both [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] and the [[Big Dipper]] are visible during at least part of the year.

Making stellar observations from a representative set of points across the Earth, combined with knowing the shortest on-the-ground distance between any two given points makes an approximate sphere the only possible shape for the Earth.

Knowing the difference in angle between two points on the Earth's surface and the surface distance between them allows a calculation of the Earth's size.  Using observations at [[Rhodes]] (in Greece) and [[Alexandria]] (in Egypt) and the distance between them, the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Posidonius#Geography, ethnology, and geology|Posidonius]] actually did use this technique to calculate the circumference of the planet to within perhaps 4% of the correct value (though modern equivalents of his units of measure are not precisely known).

===Surface circumnavigation===

Since the 1500s, many people have sailed or flown completely around the world in all directions, and none have discovered an edge or impenetrable barrier.  (See [[Circumnavigation]], [[Arctic exploration]], and [[History of Antarctica]].)

Some flat Earth theories that propose the world is a north-pole-centered disc, conceive of Antarctica as an impenetrable ice wall that encircles the planet and hides any edges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.testingtheglobe.com/quest2.html&lt;/ref&gt; This disc model explains east-west circumnavigation as simply moving around the disc in a circle.  (East-west paths form a circle in both disc and spherical geometry.)  It is possible in this model to traverse the North Pole, but it is not possible to perform a circumnavigation that includes the South Pole (which it posits does not exist).

Explorers, government researchers, commercial pilots, and tourists have been to [[Antarctica]] and found that it is not a large ring that encircles the entire world, but actually a roughly disc-shaped continent smaller than South America but larger than Australia, with an interior that can in fact be traversed in order to take a shorter path from e.g. the tip of South America to Australia than would be possible on a disc.

The first land crossing of the entirety of Antarctica was the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] in 1955-58, and many exploratory airplanes have since passed over the continent in various directions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/2300322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/2372669/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observing the Sun===

On a flat Earth, an omnidirectional Sun (emitting light in all directions, as it does) would illuminate the entire surface at the same time, and all places would experience sunrise and sunset at the horizon at the same time (with some small variations due to mountains and valleys). With a spherical Earth, half the planet is in daylight at any given time (the hemisphere facing the Sun) and the other half is experiencing nighttime. When a given location on the spherical Earth is in sunlight, its [[antipodes|antipode]] - the location exactly on the opposite side of the Earth - is always experiencing nighttime. The spherical shape of the Earth causes the Sun to rise and set at different times in different places, and different locations get different amounts of sunlight each day. 

In order to explain day and night, time zones, and the seasons, some flat Earth theorists propose that the Sun does not emit light in all directions, but acts more like a spotlight, only illuminating part of the flat Earth at a time.&lt;ref&gt;claimed by http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=58309.0#.VuJqbULlyPZ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="takes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2017/10/28/what-does-take-believe-world-flat/0gdgl2JMPhBpgJK5mGXPkI/story.html |title=What does it take to believe the world is flat? |date=28 October 2017 |author=Courtney Humphries}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is not consistent with observation; at sunrise and sunset, a spotlight Sun would be up in the sky at least a little bit, rather than at the horizon where it is always actually observed. A spotlight Sun would also appear at different angles in the sky with respect to a flat ground than it does with respect to a curved ground. Assuming light travels in straight lines, actual measurements of the Sun's angle in the sky from locations very distant from each other are only consistent with a geometry where the Sun is very far away and is being seen from a hemispherical surface (the daylight half of the Earth).  These two phenomena are related: a low-altitude spotlight Sun would spent most of the day near the horizon for most locations on Earth (which is not observed), but rise and set fairly close to the horizon.  A high-altitude Sun would spend more of the day away from the horizon, but rise and set fairly far from the horizon (which is not observed).

====Local solar time and time zones====

{{main|Time zone}}

Ancient timekeeping reckoned "noon" as the time of day when the sun is highest in the sky, with the rest of the hours in the day measured against that.  During the day, the [[apparent solar time]] can be measured directly with a [[sundial]].  In ancient Egypt, the first known sundials divided the day into 12 hours, though because the length of the day changed with the season, the length of the hours also changed.  Sundials that defined hours as always being the same duration appeared in the [[Renaissance]].  In Western Europe, [[clock tower]]s and [[striking clock]]s were used in the Middle Ages to keep people nearby appraised of the local time, though compared to modern times this was less important in a largely agrarian society.

Because the Sun reaches its highest point at different times for different [[longitude]]s (about four minutes of time for every degree of longitude difference east or west), the local solar noon in each city is different except for those directly north or south of each other.  This means that the clocks in different cities could be offset from each other by minutes or hours.  As clocks became more precise and industrialization made timekeeping more important, cities switched to [[mean solar time]], which ignores minor variations in the timing of local solar noon over the year, due to the elliptical nature of the Earth's orbit, and its tilt.

The differences in clock time between cities was not generally a problem until the advent of [[railroad]] travel in the 1800s, which both made travel between distant cities much faster than by walking or horse, and also required passengers to show up at specific times to meet their desired trains.  In the [[United Kingdom]], railroads gradually switched to [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (set from local time at the Greenwich observatory in London), followed by public clocks across the country generally, forming a single time zone.  In the United States, railroads published schedules based on local time, then later based on standard time for that railroad (typically the local time at the railroad's headquarters), and then finally based on four standard time zones shared across all railroads, where neighboring zones differed by exactly one hour.  At first railroad time was synchronized by portable [[Railroad chronometer|chronometer]]s, and then later by [[telegraph]] and [[radio]] signals.

[[San Francisco]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gaisma.com/en/location/richmond-virginia.html&lt;/ref&gt; is at 122.41°W longitude and [[Richmond, Virginia]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gaisma.com/en/location/san-francisco-california.html&lt;/ref&gt; is at 77.46°W longitude.  They are both at about 37.6°N latitude (±.2°).  The approximately 45° of longitude difference translates into about 180 minutes, or 3 hours, of time between sunsets in the two cities, for example.  San Francisco is in the [[Pacific Time]] zone, and Richmond is in the [[Eastern Time]] zone, which are three hours apart, so the local clocks in each city show that the sun sets at about the same time when using the local time zone.  But a phone call from Richmond to San Francisco at sunset will reveal that there are still three hours of daylight left in California.

====Length of the day====

On a flat Earth with an omnidirectional Sun, all places would experience the same amount of daylight every day, and all places would get daylight at the same time.  Actual day length varies considerably, with places closer to the poles getting very long days in the summer and very short days in the winter, with northerly summer happening at the same time as southerly winter.  Places north of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]] get no sunlight for at least one day a year, and get 24-hour sunlight for at least one day a year.  Both the poles experience sunlight for 6 months and darkness for 6 months, at opposite times.

The movement of daylight between the northern and southern hemispheres happens because of the [[axial tilt]] of the Earth.  The imaginary line around which the Earth spins, which goes between the North Pole and South Pole, is tilted about 23° from the oval that describes its orbit around the Sun.  The Earth always points in the same direction as it moves around the Sun, so for half the year ([[summer]] in the Northern Hemisphere), the North Pole is pointed slightly toward the Sun, keeping it in daylight all the time because the Sun lights up the half of the Earth that is facing it (and the North Pole is always in that half due to the tilt).  For the other half of the orbit, the South Pole is tilted slightly toward the Sun, and it is [[winter]] in the Northern Hemisphere.  This means that at the equator, the Sun is not directly overhead at noon, except around the [[autumnal equinox]] and [[vernal equinox]], when one spot on the equator is pointed directly at the Sun.

The length of the day varies because as the Earth rotates some places (near the poles) pass through only a short curve near the top or bottom of the sunlight half; other places (near the equator) travel along much longer curves through the middle.

The length of [[twilight]] would be very different on a flat Earth. On a round Earth, the atmosphere above the ground is lit for a while before sunrise and after sunset are observed at ground level, because the Sun is still visible from higher altitudes.  Longer twilights are observed at higher latitudes (near the poles) due to a shallower angle of the Sun's apparent movement compared to the horizon.  On a flat Earth, the Sun's shadow would reach the upper atmosphere very quickly, except near the closest edge of the Earth, and would always set at the same angle to the ground (which is not what is observed).  The "spotlight Sun" theory is also not consistent with this observation, since the air cannot be lit without the ground below it also being lit (except for shadows of mountains and other surface obstacles).

====Determining the shape of the Earth====

On a given day, if many different cities measure the angle of the Sun at local noon, the resulting data, when combined with the known distances between cities, shows that the Earth has 180 degrees of north-south curvature.  (A full range of angles will be observed if the north and south poles are included, and the day chosen is either the autumnal or spring equinox.)  This is consistent with many rounded shapes, including a sphere, and is inconsistent with a flat shape.

Some claim that this experiment assumes a very distant Sun, such that the incoming rays are essentially parallel, and if a flat Earth is assumed, that the measured angles can allow one to calculate the distance to the Sun, which must be small enough that its incoming rays are not very parallel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=58309.0#.VuJqbULlyPZ&lt;/ref&gt; However, if more than two relatively well-separated cities are included in the experiment, the calculation will make clear whether the Sun is distant or nearby.  For example, on the equinox, the 0 degree angle from the North Pole and the 90 degree angle from the equator predict a Sun which would have to be located essentially next to the surface of a flat Earth, but the difference in angle between the equator and New York City would predict a Sun much further away if the Earth is flat.  Because these results are contradictory, the surface of the Earth cannot be flat; the data ''is'' consistent with a nearly spherical Earth and a Sun which is very far away compared with the diameter of the Earth.

====Determining the size of the Earth====

Using the knowledge that the Sun is very far away, the ancient Greek geographer Eratosthenes [[Eratosthenes#Measurement_of_the_Earth.27s_circumference|performed an experiment]] using the differences in the observed angle of the Sun from two different locations to calculate the circumference of the Earth. Though modern telecommunications and timekeeping were not available, he was able to make sure the measurements happened at the same time by having them taken when the Sun was highest in the sky (local noon) at both locations. Using slightly inaccurate assumptions about the locations of two cities, he came to a result within 15% of the correct value.

====Watching the sun set twice====

On level ground, the difference in the distance to the horizon between lying down and standing up is large enough to watch the Sun set twice by quickly standing up immediately after seeing it set for the first time while lying down.  This also can be done with a [[cherry picker]]&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.xkcd.com/2009/04/06/a-date-idea-analyzed/&lt;/ref&gt; or a tall building with a fast elevator.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/5917230/did-you-know-that-the-burj-khalifa-is-so-tall-that-you-can-watch-two-sunsets-on-the-same-day Did You Know That the Burj Khalifa Is So Tall That you Can Watch Two Sunsets On the Same Day?]&lt;/ref&gt; On a flat Earth, one would not be able to see the Sun again (unless standing near the edge closest to the Sun) due to a much faster-moving Sun shadow.&lt;ref name="headsup" /&gt; 

When the supersonic [[Concorde]] took off not long after sunset from London and flew westward to New York faster than the sunset was advancing westward on the ground, passengers observed a sunrise in the west. After landing in New York, passengers saw a second sunset in the west.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/concorde-and-supersonic-travel-the-days-when-the-sun-rose-in-the-west-8888836.html Concorde and supersonic travel: The days when the sun rose in the west]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the speed of the Sun's shadow is slower in polar regions (due to the steeper angle), even a subsonic aircraft can overtake the sunset when flying at high latitudes. One photographer used a roughly circular route around the North Pole to take pictures of 24 sunsets in the same 24-hour period, pausing westward progress in each time zone to let the shadow of the Sun catch up.&lt;ref name="twenty_four"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2788267/here-comes-suns-photographer-travels-time-zone-capture-24-sunsets-one-day.html Here comes the suns! Photographer travels through every time zone to capture 24 sunsets in ONE DAY]&lt;/ref&gt; The surface of the Earth rotates at {{convert|180.17|mph}} at 80° north or south, and {{convert|1040.4|mph}} at the equator.&lt;ref name="twenty_four" /&gt;

===Spherical vs. flat triangles===
[[Image:Triangles (spherical geometry).jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram showing how the interior angles of triangles add up to about 180° when plotted on a small, nearly flat area of the Earth, but add up to more than 180° (in this case 230°) when plotted on a large area with significant curvature]]
Because the Earth is spherical, long-distance travel sometimes requires heading in different directions than one would head on a flat Earth.

For example, consider an airplane that travels {{convert|10000|km}} in a straight line, takes a 90-degree right turn, travels another {{convert|10000|km}}, takes another 90-degree right turn, and travels {{convert|10000|km}} a third time.  On a flat Earth, the aircraft would have travelled along three sides of a square, and arrive at a spot about {{convert|10000|km}} from where it started. But because the Earth is spherical, in reality it will have travelled along three sides of a triangle, and arrive back very close to its starting point.  If the starting point is the North Pole, it would have travelled due south from the North Pole to the equator, then west for a quarter of the way around the Earth, and then due north back to the North Pole.

In [[spherical geometry]], the sum of angles inside a triangle is greater than 180° (in this example 270°, having arrived back at the north pole a 90° angle to the departure path) unlike on a flat surface, where it is always exactly 180°.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/tripleright.jpg Triple-right triangle on a sphere (image)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grids are distorted by spherical ground===

A [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of [[longitude]] is a line where local solar noon occurs at the same time each day.  These lines define "north" and "south".  These are perpendicular to lines of [[latitude]] that define "east" and "west", where the Sun is at the same angle at local noon on the same day.  If the Sun were travelling from east to west over a flat Earth, meridian lines would always be the same distance apart - they would form a square grid when combined with lines of latitude. In reality, meridian lines get farther apart as one travels toward the equator, which is only possible on a round Earth.  In places where land is plotted on a grid system, this causes discontinuities in the grid.  For example, in areas of the [[Midwestern United States]] that use the [[Public Land Survey System]], the northernmost and westernmost sections of a [[township]] deviate from what would otherwise be an exact square mile.  The resulting discontinuities are sometimes reflected directly in local roads, which have kinks where the grid cannot follow completely straight lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/gerco-de-ruijter-grid-corrections-highways-driving-wichita Mysterious Detour While Driving? It Could Be Due to the Curvature of the Earth]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weather systems===

Low-pressure weather systems with inward winds (such as a [[hurricane]]) spin counterclockwise north of the equator, but clockwise south of the equator.  This is due to the [[Coriolis force]], and requires that (assuming they are attached to each other and rotating in the same direction) the north and southern halves of the Earth are angled in opposite directions (e.g. the north is facing toward Polaris and the south is facing away from it).

===Gravity===

The laws of [[gravity]], [[chemistry]], and [[physics]] that explain the formation and rounding of the Earth are well-tested through experiment, and applied successfully to many engineering tasks.

From these laws, we know the amount of mass the Earth contains, and that a non-spherical planet the size of the Earth would not be able to support itself against its own gravity.  A flat disc the size of the Earth, for example, would likely crack, heat up, liquefy, and re-form into a roughly spherical shape.  On a disc strong enough to maintain its shape, gravity would not pull downward with respect to the surface, but would pull toward the center of the disc,&lt;ref name="smarter" /&gt; contrary to what is observed on level terrain (and which would create major problems with oceans flowing toward the center of the disk).

Ignoring the other concerns, some flat Earth theorists explain the observed surface "gravity" by proposing that the flat Earth is constantly accelerating upwards.&lt;ref name="takes" /&gt; Such a theory would also leave open for explanation the [[tide]]s seen in Earth's oceans, which are conventionally explained by the gravity exerted by the Sun and Moon.

===Technology===

Observation of [[Foucault pendulum]]s, popular in science museums around the world, demonstrate both that the world is spherical and that it rotates (not that the stars are rotating around it).

The mathematics of navigation by [[GPS]] assume that satellites are moving in known orbits around an approximately spherical surface.  The accuracy of GPS navigation in determining latitude and longitude and the way these numbers map onto locations on the ground show that these assumptions are correct.  The same is true for the operational [[GLONASS]] system run by Russia, and the in-development European [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], Chinese [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|BeiDou]], and Indian [[Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System|IRNSS]].

Satellites, including communications satellites used for television, telephone, and Internet connections, would not stay in orbit unless the modern theory of gravitation were correct.  The details of which satellites are visible from which places on the ground at which times prove an approximately spherical shape of the Earth.  (Undersea cables are also used for intercontinental communications.)

Radio transmitters are mounted on tall towers because they generally rely on [[line-of-sight propagation]]. The distance to the [[horizon]] is further at higher altitude, so mounting them higher significantly increases the area they can serve.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popsci.com/bob-released-neil-degrasse-tyson-diss-track&lt;/ref&gt; Some signals can be transmitted at much longer distances, but only if they are at frequencies where they can use [[groundwave propagation]], [[tropospheric propagation]], [[tropospheric scatter]], or [[ionospheric propagation]] to reflect or refract signals around the curve of the Earth.

===Architecture===

The design of some large structures needs to take the shape of the Earth into account.  For example, the towers of the [[Humber Bridge]], although both vertical with respect to gravity, are {{convert|36|mm|in|1|abbr=in}} farther apart at the top than the bottom due to the local curvature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitgrimsby.co.uk/humber.htm|publisher=Visit Grimsby|title=The Humber Bridge|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the earliest written mention of a spherical Earth comes from ancient Greek sources, there is no account of how the sphericity of the Earth was discovered.&lt;ref name="evans47"&gt;James Evans, (1998), ''The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy'', page 47, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; A plausible explanation is that it was "the experience of travellers that suggested such an explanation for the variation in the observable [[altitude]] of the pole and the change in the area of circumpolar stars, a change that was quite drastic between [[Greek colonies|Greek settlements]]"&lt;ref name="Neugebauer.575–6"/&gt; around the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]], particularly those between the [[Nile Delta]] and [[Crimea]].&lt;ref name="Neugebauer.575–6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy|author=Otto E.

In ''The Histories'', written 431–425&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Herodotus]] cast doubt on a report of the Sun observed shining from the north.

To modern historians, these details confirm the truth of the Phoenicians' report and even open the possibility that the Phoenicians knew about the spherical model. However, nothing certain about their knowledge of geography and navigation has survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friis|first=Herman Ralph|title=The Pacific Basin: A History of Its Geographical Exploration|date=1967|publisher=[[American Geographical Society]]|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veuwAAAAIAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"My conviction is that the Earth is a round body in the centre of the heavens, and therefore has no need of air or of any similar force to be a support".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Phaedo]]|author=Plato|page=108|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; If man could soar high above the clouds, Earth would resemble "one of those balls which have leather coverings in twelve pieces, and is decked with various colours, of which the colours used by painters on Earth are in a manner samples."&lt;ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC) was Plato's prize student and "the mind of the school".&lt;ref&gt;David Johnson and Thomas Mowry, ''Mathematics: A Practical Odyssey'', [[Cengage Learning]], 2011, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle observed "there are [[star]]s seen in [[Egypt]] and [...] [[Cyprus]] which are not seen in the northerly regions." Since this could only happen on a curved surface, he too believed Earth was a sphere "of no great size, for otherwise the effect of so slight a change of place would not be quickly apparent." (''De caelo'', 298a2–10)

Aristotle provided physical and observational arguments supporting the idea of a spherical Earth:

* Every portion of the Earth tends toward the centre until by compression and convergence they form a sphere. (''De caelo'', 297a9–21)
* Travelers going south see southern constellations rise higher above the horizon; and
* The shadow of Earth on the Moon during a [[lunar eclipse]] is round. (''De caelo'', 297b31–298a10).

The concepts of symmetry, equilibrium and cyclic repetition permeated Aristotle's work. In his [[Meteorology (Aristotle)|''Meteorology'']] he divided the world into five climatic zones: two temperate areas separated by a torrid zone near the [[equator]], and two cold inhospitable regions, "one near our upper or northern pole and the other near the [[...]] southern pole," both impenetrable and girdled with ice (''Meteorologica'', 362a31–35). Although no humans could survive in the frigid zones, inhabitants in the southern temperate regions could exist.

[[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|Aristotle's theory of natural place]] relied on a spherical Earth to explain why [[Earth (classical element)|heavy things]] go down (toward what Aristotle believed was the center of the Universe), and things like [[Air (classical element)|air]] and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] go up. In this [[geocentric model]], the structure of the universe was believed to be a series of perfect spheres. The Sun, Moon, planets and fixed stars were believed to move on [[celestial spheres]] around a stationary Earth.

Though Aristotle's theory of physics survived in the Christian world for many centuries, the [[heliocentric model]] was eventually shown to be a more correct explanation of the [[Solar System]] than the geocentric model, and [[atomic theory]] was shown to be a more correct explanation of the nature of matter than [[classical element]]s like earth, water, air, fire, and aether.

=====Archimedes=====
In proposition 2 of the First Book of his treatise "On floating bodies," [[Archimedes]] demonstrates that "The surface of any fluid at rest is the surface of a sphere whose centre is the same as that of the earth,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | translator-last = Heath | translator-first = T.

=====Eratosthenes=====
[[Eratosthenes]], a Greek [[Hellenistic astronomy|astronomer]] from [[Hellenistic]] [[Cyrenaica]] (276–194&amp;nbsp;BC), estimated [[Earth]]'s circumference around 240&amp;nbsp;BC. He had heard that in [[Syene]] the [[Sun]] was directly overhead at the summer [[solstice]] whereas in [[Alexandria]] it still cast a shadow. Using the differing angles the shadows made as the basis of his trigonometric calculations he estimated a circumference of around 250,000 ''[[Ancient Greek units of measurement|stades]]''. The length of a 'stade' is not precisely known, but Eratosthenes's figure only has an error of around five to fifteen percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Albert | last = Van Helden | title = Measuring the Universe: Cosmic Dimensions from Aristarchus to Halley | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 1985 | pages = 4–5 | isbn = 0-226-84882-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/F_JSC_NES_School_Measures_Up.html|title=JSC NES School Measures Up|publisher=NASA|date=11 April 2006|accessdate=7 Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Scolumb.htm|title=The Round Earth|publisher=NASA|date=12 December 2004|accessdate=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eratosthenes used rough estimates and round numbers, but depending on the length of the [[stadia (length)|stadion]], his result is within a margin of between 2% and 20% of the actual [[meridional]] [[circumference]], {{convert|40008|km}}. Note that [[Eratosthenes]] could only measure the circumference of the Earth by assuming that the [[distance to the Sun]] is so great that the rays of [[sunlight]] are practically [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Lloyd | first = G.

Seventeen hundred years after Eratosthenes, Christopher Columbus studied Eratosthenes's findings before sailing west for the Indies. However, ultimately he rejected Eratosthenes in favour of other maps and arguments that interpreted Earth's circumference to be a third smaller than reality. If, instead, Columbus had accepted Eratosthenes findings, then he may have never gone west, since he didn't have the supplies or funding needed for the much longer voyage.&lt;ref&gt;

=====Seleucus of Seleucia=====
[[Seleucus of Seleucia]] (c.&amp;nbsp;190&amp;nbsp;BC), who lived in the city of [[Seleucia]] in [[Mesopotamia]], wrote that the Earth is spherical (and actually orbits the [[Sun]], influenced by the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]] of [[Aristarchus of Samos]]).

=====Posidonius=====
[[Posidonius]] (c. 135 – 51 BC) put faith in Eratosthenes's method, though by observing the star [[Canopus]], rather than the sun in establishing the Earth's circumference. In Ptolemy's ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'', his result was favoured over that of Eratosthenes. Posidonius furthermore expressed the distance of the sun in earth radii.

====Roman Empire====
From its Greek origins, the idea of a spherical earth, along with much of [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomical thought]], slowly spread across the globe and ultimately became the adopted view in all major astronomical traditions.&lt;ref name="Krüger: Roman and medieval continuation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ragep: Islamic adoption"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pingree: Indian adoption"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martzloff, Cullen: Chinese adoption"/&gt;

In the West, the idea came to the Romans through the lengthy process of cross-fertilization with [[Hellenistic civilization]]. Many Roman authors such as [[Cicero]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] refer in their works to the rotundity of the earth as a matter of course.&lt;ref name="Reinhard Krüger"&gt;Krüger, Reinhard: [https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/bitstream/11682/5268/1/ReinhardKrueger.pdf "Ein Versuch über die Archäologie der Globalisierung.

=====Strabo=====
[[File:Shiphorp.jpg|thumb|When a ship is at the horizon, its [[Hull-down|lower part is obscured]] by the Earth's curvature. This was one of the first arguments favouring a round-Earth model.]]
It has been suggested that seafarers probably provided the first observational evidence that the Earth was not flat, based on observations of the [[horizon]]. This argument was put forward by the geographer [[Strabo]] (c.&amp;nbsp;64&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– 24&amp;nbsp;AD), who suggested that the spherical shape of the Earth was probably known to seafarers around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] since at least the time of [[Homer]],&lt;ref name=strabo&gt;Hugh Thurston, ''Early Astronomy'', (New York: Springer-Verlag), p. 118. {{ISBN|0-387-94107-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; citing a line from the ''[[Odyssey]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'', Bk. 5 393: "As he rose on the swell he looked eagerly ahead, and could see land quite near." [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler's]] translation is [http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/odyssey.5.v.html#284 available online].&lt;/ref&gt; as indicating that the poet [[Homer]] knew of this as early as the 7th or 8th century BC. [[Strabo]] cited various phenomena observed at sea as suggesting that the Earth was spherical. He observed that elevated lights or areas of land were visible to sailors at greater distances than those less elevated, and stated that the curvature of the sea was obviously responsible for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title= The Geography of Strabo, in Eight Volumes | author= Strabo | others= Loeb Classical Library edition, translated by Horace Leonard Jones, A.M., Ph.D. | date= 1960 | origyear= 1917 | location= London | publisher= William Heinemann }}, Vol.I Bk. I para. 20, pp.41, 43. An earlier edition is [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/1A*.html#1.20 available online].&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Claudius Ptolemy=====
[[Claudius Ptolemy]] (90–168&amp;nbsp;AD) lived in [[Alexandria]], the centre of scholarship in the 2nd century. In the ''[[Almagest]],'' which remained the standard work of astronomy for 1,400 years, he advanced many arguments for the spherical nature of the Earth. Among them was the observation that when a ship is sailing towards [[mountain]]s, observers note these seem to rise from the sea, indicating that they were hidden by the curved surface of the sea. He also gives separate arguments that the Earth is curved north-south and that it is curved east-west.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ptolemy | title = Almagest | pages = I.4}} as quoted in {{Cite book| first = Edward | last = Grant | title = A Source Book in Medieval Science | publisher = Harvard University Press | date = 1974 | pages = 63–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He compiled an eight-volume ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' covering what was known about the earth. The first part of the ''Geographia'' is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. As with the model of the Solar System in the ''Almagest'', Ptolemy put all this information into a grand scheme. He assigned [[coordinate]]s to all the places and geographic features he knew, in a [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] that spanned the globe (although most of this has been lost). [[Latitude]] was measured from the [[equator]], as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred to express it as the length of the longest day rather than [[degree (angle)|degrees of arc]] (the length of the [[midsummer]] day increases from 12h to 24h as you go from the equator to the [[polar circle]]). He put the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of 0 [[longitude]] at the most western land he knew, the [[Canary Islands]].

''Geographia'' indicated the countries of "[[Seres|Serica]]" and "Sinae" ([[China]]) at the extreme right, beyond the island of "Taprobane" ([[Sri Lanka]], oversized) and the "Aurea Chersonesus" ([[Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian peninsula]]).

Ptolemy also devised and provided instructions on how to create maps both of the whole inhabited world (''oikoumenè'') and of the Roman provinces. In the second part of the ''Geographia,'' he provided the necessary [[topographic]] lists, and captions for the maps. His ''oikoumenè'' spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Canary Islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to [[China]], and about 81 degrees of latitude from the Arctic to the [[East Indies]] and deep into [[Africa]]. Ptolemy was well aware that he knew about only a quarter of the globe.

=====Late Antiquity=====
Knowledge of the spherical shape of the Earth was received in scholarship of [[Late Antiquity]] as a matter of course, in both [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Early Christianity]]. [[Calcidius]]'s fourth-century [[Latin language|Latin]] commentary on and translation of Plato's ''Timaeus'', which was one of the few examples of Greek scientific thought that was known in the Early Middle Ages in Western Europe, discussed [[Hipparchus]]'s use of the geometrical circumstances of eclipses to compute the [[On Sizes and Distances|relative diameters]] of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McCluskey | first = Stephen C. | title = Astronomies and Cultures in Early Medieval Europe | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 1998 | pages = 119–120 | isbn = 978-0-521-77852-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Calcidius | author-link = Calcidius | editor-last = Klibansky| editor-first = Raymond| editor-link = Raymond Klibansky| date = 1962 | title = Timaeus a Calcidio translatus commentarioque instructus | series = Corpus Platonicum Medii Aevi, Plato Latinus | volume = 4 | publisher = Brill / Warburg Institute| publication-place = Leiden / London | pages = 141–144 | isbn = 9780854810529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theological doubt informed by the [[flat Earth]] model implied in the [[Hebrew Bible]] inspired some early Christian scholars such as [[Lactantius]], [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], but this remained an eccentric current. Learned Christian authors such as [[Basil of Caesarea]], [[Ambrose]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] were clearly aware of the sphericity of the Earth. "Flat Earthism" lingered longest in [[Syriac Christianity]], which tradition laid greater importance on a literalist interpretation of the Old Testament. Authors from that tradition, such as [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]], presented the Earth as flat as late as in the 6th century. This last remnant of the ancient model of the cosmos disappeared during the 7th century. From the 8th century and the beginning [[Early Middle Ages|medieval period]], "no cosmographer worthy of note has called into question the sphericity of the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Anselm Vogel, "Sphaera terrae – das mittelalterliche Bild der Erde und die kosmographische Revolution," PhD dissertation Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, 1995, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
Greek ethnographer [[Megasthenes]], c.&amp;nbsp;300&amp;nbsp;BC, has been interpreted as stating that the contemporary Brahmans believed in a spherical earth as the center of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the spread of [[Hellenistic period|Greek culture]] in the east, [[Hellenistic astronomy]] filtered eastwards to [[ancient India]] where its profound influence became apparent in the early centuries AD.&lt;ref name="Pingree (1978), 533, 554f."/&gt; The Greek concept of an Earth surrounded by the spheres of the planets and that of the fixed stars, vehemently supported by astronomers like [[Varahamihir]] and [[Brahmagupta]], strengthened the astronomical principles. Some ideas were found possible to preserve, although in altered form.&lt;ref name="Pingree (1978), 533, 554f."&gt;D.

The works of the classical [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomer]] and [[Indian mathematics|mathematician]], [[Aryabhatta]] (476–550 AD), deal with the sphericity of the Earth and the motion of the planets. The final two parts of his [[Sanskrit]] magnum opus, the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'', which were named the ''Kalakriya'' ("reckoning of time") and the ''Gol'' ("sphere"), state that the Earth is spherical and that its circumference is 4,967 [[yojana]]s.

===Middle Ages===
Knowledge of the sphericity of the Earth survived into the medieval corpus of knowledge by direct transmission of the texts of Greek antiquity ([[Aristotle]]), and via authors such as [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Beda Venerabilis]].
It became increasingly traceable with the rise of [[scholasticism]] and [[Medieval university|medieval learning]].&lt;ref name="Reinhard Krüger"/&gt;
Spread of this knowledge beyond the immediate sphere of Greco-Roman scholarship was necessarily gradual, associated with the pace of [[Christianisation]] of Europe. For example, the first evidence of knowledge of the spherical shape of the Earth in [[Scandinavia]] is a 12th-century [[Old Icelandic]] translation of ''[[Elucidarius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Simek, ''Altnordische Kosmographie'', Berlin, 1990, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-exhaustive list of more than a hundred [[Latin]] and vernacular writers from [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]] who were aware that the earth was spherical has been compiled by Reinhard Krüger, professor for Romance literature at the [[University of Stuttgart]].&lt;ref name="Reinhard Krüger"/&gt;{{seemore|message=Krüger's list of the 79 authors known by name can be studied by clicking on}}

;Isidore of Seville
Bishop [[Isidore of Seville]] (560–636) taught in his widely read encyclopedia, ''The [[Etymologiae|Etymologies]],'' that the Earth was "round".&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''Etymologiae,'' XIV.ii.1 [3].&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop's confusing exposition and choice of imprecise Latin terms have divided scholarly opinion on whether he meant a sphere or a disk or even whether he meant anything specific.&lt;ref&gt;Referring to Isidore's five circles in ''De Natura Rerum'' X 5, ERnest Brehaut wrote: "The explanation of the passage and of the figure which illustrates it seems to be that Isidore accepted the terminology of the spherical earth from Hyginus without taking the time to understand it—if indeed he had the ability to do so—and applied it without compunction to the flat earth." {{cite book|title=Encyclopedist of the Flat Earth|author=Ernest Brehaut|page=30|date=1912}} Similarly, J. Fontaine refers to this passage as a "scientific absurdity".{{cite book|title=Traité de la Nature|author=Isidore of Seville|editor=J. Fontaine|date=1960|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable recent scholars claim that he taught a spherical earth.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley M. Stevens, "The Figure of the Earth in Isidore's 'De natura rerum," ''Isis'', 71(1980): 268–277.&lt;/ref&gt; Isidore did not admit the possibility of people dwelling at the antipodes, considering them as legendary&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''Etymologiae,'' XIV.v.17 [4].&lt;/ref&gt; and noting that there was no evidence for their existence.&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''Etymologiae,'' IX.ii.133 [5].&lt;/ref&gt;

;Bede the Venerable

The monk [[Bede]] (c.&amp;nbsp;672–735) wrote in his influential treatise on computus, ''The Reckoning of Time'', that the Earth was round. He explained the unequal length of daylight from "the roundness of the Earth, for not without reason is it called 'the orb of the world' on the pages of Holy Scripture and of ordinary literature. It is, in fact, set like a sphere in the middle of the whole universe." (De temporum ratione, 32). The large number of surviving manuscripts of ''The Reckoning of Time,'' copied to meet the Carolingian requirement that all priests should study the computus, indicates that many, if not most, priests were exposed to the idea of the sphericity of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Faith Wallis, trans., ''Bede: The Reckoning of Time,'' (Liverpool: Liverpool Univ. Pr., 2004), pp. lxxxv–lxxxix.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ælfric of Eynsham]] paraphrased Bede into Old English, saying, "Now the Earth's roundness and the Sun's orbit constitute the obstacle to the day's being equally long in every land."&lt;ref&gt;Ælfric of Eynsham, ''On the Seasons of the Year,'' Peter Baker, trans&lt;/ref&gt;

Bede was lucid about earth's sphericity, writing "We call the earth a globe, not as if the shape of a sphere were expressed in the diversity of plains and mountains, but because, if all things are included in the outline, the earth's circumference will represent the figure of a perfect globe... For truly it is an orb placed in the centre of the universe; in its width it is like a circle, and not circular like a shield but rather like a ball, and it extends from its centre with perfect roundness on all sides."&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;Russell, Jeffrey B. 1991. ''Inventing the Flat Earth''. New York: Praeger Publishers. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Anania Shirakatsi
The 7th-century [[Armenia]]n scholar [[Anania Shirakatsi]] described the world as "being like an egg with a spherical yolk (the globe) surrounded by a layer of white (the atmosphere) and covered with a hard shell (the sky)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hewsen |first1=Robert H. |authorlink1=Robert H.

====Islamic astronomy====
[[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Islamic astronomy]] was developed on the basis of a spherical earth inherited from [[Hellenistic astronomy]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia of Islam: Astronomy"&gt;Ragep, F. Jamil: "Astronomy", in: Krämer, Gudrun (ed.) et al.: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', THREE, Brill 2010, without page numbers&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic theoretical framework largely relied on the fundamental contributions of [[Aristotle]] (''[[De caelo]]'') and [[Ptolemy]] (''[[Almagest]]''), both of whom worked from the premise that the earth was spherical and at the centre of the universe ([[geocentric model]]).&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia of Islam: Astronomy"/&gt;

Early Islamic scholars recognized Earth's sphericity,&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad Hamidullah]]. ''L'Islam et son impulsion scientifique originelle'', Tiers-Monde, 1982, vol. 23, n° 92, p. 789.&lt;/ref&gt; leading [[Islamic mathematics|Muslim mathematicians]] to develop [[spherical trigonometry]]&lt;ref&gt;David A. King, ''Astronomy in the Service of Islam'', (Aldershot (U.K.): Variorum), 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to further mensuration and to calculate the distance and direction from any given point on the Earth to [[Mecca]]. This determined the ''[[Qibla]],'' or Muslim direction of prayer.

;Al-Ma'mun
Around 830&amp;nbsp;AD, Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] commissioned a group of [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]] and [[Islamic geography|geographers]] to measure the distance from Tadmur ([[Palmyra]]) to [[Raqqa]] in modern Syria. They found the cities to be separated by one degree of [[latitude]] and the [[meridian arc]] distance between them to be 66{{frac|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;miles and thus calculated the Earth's circumference to be 24,000&amp;nbsp;miles.&lt;ref&gt;''Gharā'ib al-funūn wa-mulah al-`uyūn'' (The Book of Curiosities of the Sciences and Marvels for the Eyes), 2.1 "On the mensuration of the Earth and its division into seven climes, as related by Ptolemy and others," (ff. 22b–23a)[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/bookofcuriosities]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another estimate given by his astronomers was 56{{frac|2|3}} Arabic miles (111.8&amp;nbsp;km) per degree, which corresponds to a circumference of 40,248&amp;nbsp;km, very close to the currently modern values of 111.3&amp;nbsp;km per degree and 40,068&amp;nbsp;km circumference, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Kennedy, ''Mathematical Geography'', pp=187–8, in {{Harv|Rashed|Morelon|1996|pp=185–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Ibn Hazm
[[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[polymath]] [[Ibn Hazm]] stated that the proof of the Earth's sphericity "is that the Sun is always vertical to a particular spot on Earth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/how-islamic-inventors-changed-the-world-6106905.html "How Islamic inventors changed the world"]. ''[[The Independent]]''. March 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Al-Farghānī
[[Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathīr al-Farghānī|Al-Farghānī]] (Latinized as Alfraganus) was a Persian astronomer of the 9th century involved in measuring the diameter of the Earth, and commissioned by Al-Ma'mun. His estimate given above for a degree (56{{frac|2|3}} Arabic miles) was much more accurate than the 60{{frac|2|3}} Roman miles (89.7&amp;nbsp;km) given by Ptolemy. [[Christopher Columbus]] uncritically used Alfraganus's figure as if it were in Roman miles instead of in Arabic miles, in order to prove a smaller size of the Earth than that propounded by Ptolemy.&lt;ref&gt;Felipe Fernández-Armesto, ''Columbus and the Conquest of the Impossible'', pp. 20–1, Phoenix Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Biruni
[[File:Abu Reyhan Biruni-Earth Circumference.svg|thumb|Biruni's method for calculation of Earth's radius]]
[[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] (973–1048) used a new method to accurately compute the Earth's [[circumference]], by which he arrived at a value that was close to modern values for the Earth's circumference.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Aber (2003). Alberuni calculated the Earth's circumference at a small town of Pind Dadan Khan, District Jhelum, Punjab, Pakistan.[http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/histgeol/biruni/biruni.htm Abu Rayhan al-Biruni], [[Emporia State University]].&lt;/ref&gt; His estimate of 6,339.6&amp;nbsp;km for the [[Earth radius]] was only 31.4&amp;nbsp;km less than the modern mean value of 6,371.0&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="Moritz2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moritz |first=H. |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=March 2000 |title=Geodetic Reference System 1980 |journal=Journal of Geodesy |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=128–133 |doi=10.1007/s001900050278 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/0bgccvjj5bedgdfu/about/ |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 2000JGeod..74..128. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to his predecessors, who measured the Earth's circumference by sighting the Sun simultaneously from two different locations, Biruni developed a new method of using [[Trigonometry|trigonometric]] calculations based on the angle between a [[plain]] and [[mountain]] top. This yielded more accurate measurements of the Earth's circumference and made it possible for a single person to measure it from a single location.&lt;ref&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (1992), ''Avicenna'', p. 31, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-01929-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Savizi&gt;

Biruni's method was intended to avoid "walking across hot, dusty deserts," and the idea came to him when he was on top of a tall mountain in India. From the top of the mountain, he sighted the angle to the horizon which, along with the mountain's height (which he calculated beforehand), allowed him to calculate the curvature of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Chicago Press| isbn = 978-0-226-31635-2| pages = 182–184| editor = J.

According to John J. O'Connor and Edmund F. Robertson,
{{quote|Important contributions to [[geodesy]] and [[Islamic geography|geography]] were also made by Biruni. He introduced techniques to measure the earth and distances on it using [[triangulation]]. He found the [[Earth radius|radius of the earth]] to be 6339.6 km, a value not obtained in the West until the 16th century.

;Applications
Muslim scholars who held to the round Earth theory used it for a quintessentially Islamic purpose: to calculate the distance and direction from any given point on the Earth to [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;In the 11th century, [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|al-Biruni]] used spherical trigonometry to find the direction of Mecca from many cities and published it in ''The Determination of the Co-ordinates of Cities''. See Lyons, 2009, p85&lt;/ref&gt; This determined the [[Qibla]], or Muslim direction of prayer.

A terrestrial globe (Kura-i-ard) was among the presents sent by the Persian Muslim astronomer [[Jamal ad-Din (astronomer)|Jamal-al-Din]] to [[Kublai Khan]]'s [[China|Chinese]] court in 1267. It was made of wood on which "seven parts of water are represented in green, three parts of land in white, with rivers, lakes etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1959|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho Peng Yoke remarks that "it did not seem to have any general appeal to the Chinese in those days".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Ho Peng Yoke|title=Li, Qi and Shu, An introduction to Science and Civilisation in China|date=1985|publisher=New York, Dover Publications|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====High and late medieval Europe====

[[File:John Gower world Vox Clamantis.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Gower]] prepares to shoot the world, a sphere with compartments representing earth, air, and water (''[[Vox Clamantis]]'', around 1400)]]
During the [[High Middle Ages]], the astronomical knowledge in Christian Europe was extended beyond what was transmitted directly from ancient authors by transmission of learning from [[Medieval Islamic astronomy]]. An early student of such learning was Gerbert d'Aurillac, the later [[Pope Sylvester II]].

Saint Hildegard ([[Hildegard von Bingen]], 1098–1179), depicted the spherical earth several times in her work ''Liber Divinorum Operum''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/galileopalazzostrozzi/object/HildegardOfBingenLiberDivinorumOperum.html Hildegard of Bingen, Liber divinorum operum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes de Sacrobosco]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1195 – c.&amp;nbsp;1256&amp;nbsp;AD) wrote a famous work on Astronomy called ''[[Tractatus de Sphaera]],'' based on Ptolemy, which primarily considers the sphere of the sky. However, it contains clear proofs of the earth's sphericity in the first chapter.&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Pedersen, "In Quest of Sacrobosco", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy,'' 16(1985): 175–221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=The Sphere of Sacrobosco|others=trans. Lynn Thorndike|date=1949|url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] commentators on Aristotle's ''[[On the Heavens]]'' and Sacrobosco's ''Treatise on the Sphere'' unanimously agreed that the earth is spherical or round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Grant | first = Edward | author-link = Edward Grant | title = Planets, Stars, &amp; Orbs: The Medieval Cosmos, 1200–1687 | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 1996 | pages = 620–622, 737–738 | isbn = 0-521-56509-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant observes that no author who had studied at a [[medieval university]] thought that the earth was flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Grant | first = Edward | author-link = Edward Grant | title = God and Reason in the Middle Ages | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 2001 | page = 339 | isbn = 0-521-00337-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Elucidarium'' of [[Honorius Augustodunensis]] (c. 1120), an important manual for the instruction of lesser clergy, which was translated into [[Middle English]], [[Old French]], [[Middle High German]], [[Old Russian]], [[Middle Dutch]], [[Old Norse]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and several Italian dialects, explicitly refers to a spherical Earth. Likewise, the fact that [[Bertold von Regensburg]] (mid-13th century) used the spherical Earth as an illustration in a [[sermon]] shows that he could assume this knowledge among his congregation. The sermon was preached in the vernacular German, and thus was not intended for a learned audience.

Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]],'' written in Italian in the early 14th century, portrays Earth as a sphere, discussing implications such as the different stars visible in the [[southern hemisphere]], the altered position of the [[sun]], and the various [[timezone]]s of the Earth.

The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] exploration of [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s voyage to the [[Americas]] (1492) and, finally, [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s circumnavigation of the earth (1519–21) provided practical evidence of the global shape of the earth.

===Early Modern period===

====Circumnavigation of the globe====
{{further|Age of Discovery}}
[[File:Behaims Erdapfel.jpg|thumb|150px|The ''[[Erdapfel]]'', the oldest surviving terrestrial globe (1492/93)]]

The first direct demonstration of Earth's sphericity came in the form of the first circumnavigation in history, an expedition captained by Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]].&lt;ref&gt;Nowell, Charles E. ed. (1962). Magellan's Voyage around the World: Three Contemporary Accounts. Evanston: NU Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was financed by the Spanish Crown. On August 10, 1519, the five ships under Magellan's command departed from [[Seville]]. They crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean]], passed through what is now called the [[Strait of Magellan]], crossed the Pacific, and arrived in [[Cebu]], where Magellan was killed by Philippine natives in a battle. His second in command, the Spaniard [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], continued the expedition and, on September 6, 1522, arrived at Seville, completing the circumnavigation. [[Charles I of Spain]], in recognition of his feat, gave Elcano a [[coat of arms]] with the motto ''Primus circumdedisti me'' (in Latin, "You went around me first").&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs(2006), "The story of geographical discovery" p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

A circumnavigation alone does not prove that the earth is spherical. It could be cylindric or irregularly globular or one of many other shapes. Still, combined with trigonometric evidence of the form used by Eratosthenes 1,700 years prior, the Magellan expedition removed any reasonable doubt in educated circles in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = ICSE Geography IX|author = RK Jain|publisher = Ratna Sagar|page = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Transglobe Expedition]] (1979–1982) was the first expedition to make a circumpolar circumnavigation, traveling the world "vertically" traversing both of the poles of rotation using only surface transport.

====Ming China====
In the 17th century, the idea of a spherical Earth, now considerably advanced by [[Scientific revolution|Western astronomy]], ultimately spread to [[Ming China]], when [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]], who held high positions as astronomers at the imperial court, successfully challenged the Chinese belief that the Earth was flat and square.&lt;ref name="Jean-Claude Martzloff 69"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/ans/eastm/back/cs11/cs11-4-martzloff.pdf|title=Jean-Claude Martzloff, "Space and Time in Chinese Texts of Astronomy and of Mathematical Astronomy in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries", ''Chinese Science'' 11 (1993–94): 66–92 (69)|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305205943/http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/ans/eastm/back/cs11/cs11-4-martzloff.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Cullen (1980)"&gt;Christopher Cullen, “Joseph Needham on Chinese Astronomy”, ''Past and Present'', No. 87. (May, 1980), pp. 39–53 (42 &amp; 49)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Cullen (1976)"&gt;Christopher Cullen, "A Chinese Eratosthenes of the Flat Earth: A Study of a Fragment of Cosmology in Huai Nan Tzu 淮 南 子", ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', Vol. 39, No. 1 (1976), pp. 106–127 (107–109)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ge zhi cao'' (格致草) treatise of Xiong Mingyu (熊明遇) published in 1648 showed a printed picture of the Earth as a spherical globe, with the text stating that "the round Earth certainly has no square corners".&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 499"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. pp. 499.&lt;/ref&gt; The text also pointed out that sailing ships could return to their port of origin after circumnavigating the waters of the Earth.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 499"/&gt;

The influence of the map is distinctly Western, as traditional maps of Chinese cartography held the graduation of the sphere at 365.25 degrees, while the Western graduation was of 360 degrees. Also of interest to note is on one side of the world, there is seen towering [[Chinese pagoda]]s, while on the opposite side (upside-down) there were European [[cathedral]]s.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 499"/&gt; The adoption of European astronomy, facilitated by the failure of indigenous astronomy to make progress, was accompanied by a [[sinocentric]] reinterpretation that declared the imported ideas Chinese in origin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;European astronomy was so much judged worth consideration that numerous Chinese authors developed the idea that the Chinese of antiquity had anticipated most of the novelties presented by the missionaries as European discoveries, for example, the rotundity of the Earth and the "heavenly spherical star carrier model." Making skillful use of philology, these authors cleverly reinterpreted the greatest technical and literary works of Chinese antiquity. From this sprang a new science wholly dedicated to the demonstration of the Chinese origin of astronomy and more generally of all European science and technology.&lt;ref name="Jean-Claude Martzloff 69"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although mainstream Chinese science until the 17th century held the view that the earth was flat, square, and enveloped by the [[celestial sphere]], this idea was criticized by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin-dynasty]] scholar [[Yu Xi]] (fl. 307–345), who suggested that the Earth could be either square or round, in accordance with the shape of the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling. (1995) [1959]. ''Science and Civilization in China: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth'', vol. 3, reprint edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-05801-5}}, pp. 220, 498–499.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan-dynasty]] mathematician [[Li Ye (mathematician)|Li Ye]] (c. 1192–1279) firmly argued that the Earth was spherical, just like the shape of the heavens only smaller, since a square Earth would hinder the movement of the heavens and celestial bodies in his estimation.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling. (1995) [1959]. ''Science and Civilization in China: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth'', vol. 3, reprint edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-05801-5}}, pp. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th-century ''Ge zhi cao'' treatise also used the same terminology to describe the shape of the Earth that the [[Eastern Han dynasty|Eastern-Han]] scholar [[Zhang Heng]] (78–139 AD) had used to describe the shape of the sun and moon (i.e. that the former was as round as a [[crossbow]] bullet, and the latter was the shape of a ball).&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling. (1995) [1959]. ''Science and Civilization in China: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth'', vol. 3, reprint edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-05801-5}}, pp. 227, 499.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement and representation==
{{Main|Geodesy}}
[[Geodesy]], also called geodetics, is the scientific discipline that deals with the measurement and representation of the Earth, its [[gravitation]]al field and geodynamic phenomena ([[polar motion]], Earth [[tide]]s, and crustal motion) in three-dimensional time-varying space.

Geodesy is primarily concerned with positioning and the gravity field and geometrical aspects of their temporal variations, although it can also include the study of Earth's [[magnetic field]]. Especially in the [[German language|German]] speaking world, geodesy is divided into [[geomensuration]] ("Erdmessung" or "höhere Geodäsie"), which is concerned with measuring the Earth on a global scale, and [[Geophysical survey|surveying]] ("Ingenieurgeodäsie"), which is concerned with measuring parts of the surface.

The Earth's shape can be thought of in at least two ways;
* as the shape of the [[geoid]], the mean sea level of the world ocean; or
* as the shape of Earth's land surface as it rises above and falls below the sea.

As the science of [[geodesy]] measured Earth more accurately, the shape of the geoid was first found not to be a perfect sphere but to approximate an [[spheroid|oblate spheroid]], a specific type of [[ellipsoid]]. More recent measurements have measured the geoid to unprecedented accuracy, revealing [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentration]]s beneath Earth's surface.

[[File:Suction-lifter-one-cup.jpg|thumb|right|One cup suction lifter.]]

A '''suction cup''', also known as a '''sucker''', is a device or object that uses the negative [[Pressure#Fluid pressure|fluid pressure]] of air or water to adhere to [[Porosity|nonporous]] surfaces, creating a [[Vacuum|partial vacuum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/suction%20cup|title="Suction Cup" m-w.com |publisher=Merriam Webster: An Encyclopædia Britannica Company |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suction cups are peripherial traits of some animals such as [[octopus]]es and [[squid]]s, and have been reproduced artificially for numerous purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/48054-octopus-inspired-technology.html|title=Well-Armed Design: 8 Octopus-Inspired Technologies |publisher=livescience.com |accessdate= July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==

The working face of the suction cup is made of elastic, flexible material and has a curved surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US2055397|title="Suction Cup" google.com |publisher=[[Google Patents]] |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the center of the suction cup is pressed against a flat, non-porous surface, the volume of the space between the suction cup and the flat surface is reduced, which causes the air or water between the cup and the surface to be expelled past the rim of the circular cup. The cavity which develops between the cup and the flat surface has little to no air or water in it because most of the fluid has already been forced out of the inside of the cup, causing a lack of pressure. The pressure difference between the atmosphere on the outside of the cup and the low-pressure cavity on the inside of the cup keeps the cup adhered to the surface.

When the user ceases to apply physical pressure to the outside of the cup, the elastic substance of which the cup is made tends to resume its original, curved shape. The length of time for which the suction effect can be maintained depends mainly on how long it takes for air or water to leak back into the cavity between the cup and the surface, equalizing the pressure with the surrounding atmosphere. This depends on the porosity and flatness of the surface and the properties of the cup's rim.

== Calculations ==
The force required to detach an ideal suction cup by pulling it directly away from the surface is given by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;F = AP&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''F'' is the [[force]],
:''A'' is the area of the surface covered by the cup,
:''P'' is the pressure outside the cup (typically [[atmospheric pressure]])

This is derived from the definition of pressure, which is:
:&lt;math&gt;P = F/A&lt;/math&gt;
For example, a suction cup of radius 2.0&amp;nbsp;cm has an area of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;(0.020 m)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0013 square meters. Using the force formula (''F'' = ''AP''), the result is
''F'' = (0.0013 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(100,000 Pa) = about 130 [[newton (unit)|newtons]].

The above formula relies on several assumptions:
# The outer diameter of the cup does not change when the cup is pulled.
# No air leaks into the gap between the cup and the surface.
# The pulling force is applied perpendicular to the surface so that the cup does not slide sideways or peel off.

== Artificial use ==
[[File:Mobiles Navigationsgeraet Navigon im Einsatz.JPG|thumb|right|[[SatNav]] devices often ship with suction cup holders for mounting on windscreens.]]
[[File:GoPro camera mounted on car.jpg|thumb|GoPro camera attached to car with suction cup]]

Artificial suction cups are believed to have first been used in the third century, [[Anno Domini|B.C.]], and were made out of [[gourd]]s. They were used to suction "bad blood" from internal organs to the surface. [[Hippocrates]] is believed to have invented this procedure.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The first modern suction cup patents were issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office during the 1860s. TC Roche was awarded U.S. Patent No. 52,748 in 1866 for a "Photographic Developer Dipping Stick"; the patent discloses a primitive suction cup means for handling photographic plates during developing procedures. In 1868, Orwell Needham patented a more refined suction cup design, U.S. Patent No. 82,629, calling his invention an "Atmospheric Knob" purposed for general use as a handle and drawer opening means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US52748 |title=United States Patent 52,748}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US82629 |title=United States Patent 82,629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suction cups have a number of commercial and industrial applications:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22297">Transcription Activator Like Effector Likes ('''TALE-likes''')  are a group of bacterial [[DNA-binding protein|DNA binding proteins]] named for the first and still best studied group, the [[TAL effector|TALEs]] of ''Xanthomonas'' bacteria. TALEs are important factors in the plant diseases caused by ''Xanthomonas'' bacteria, but are known primarily for their role in biotechnology as programmable DNA binding proteins, particularly in the context of [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALE nucleases]].  TALE-likes have additionally been found in many strains of the [[#RipTALs|''Ralstonia solanacearum'']] bacterial species complex, in  [[#Burkholderia TALE-likes|''Burkholderia rhizoxinica'' strain HKI 454]], and in [[#MOrTL1 and MOrTL2|two unknown marine bacteria]]. Whether or not all these proteins from a single phylogenetic grouping is as yet unclear.

The unifying feature of the TALE-likes are their tandem arrays of DNA binding repeats. These repeats are, with few exceptions, 33-35 amino acids in length, and composed of two alpha-helices on either side of a flexible loop containing the DNA base binding residues and with neighbouring repeats joined by flexible linker loops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deng|first1=Dong|last2=Yan|first2=Chuangye|last3=Wu|first3=Jianping|last4=Pan|first4=Xiaojing|last5=Yan|first5=Nieng|title=Revisiting the TALE repeat|journal=Protein &amp; Cell|date=14 March 2014|volume=5|issue=4|pages=297–306|doi=10.1007/s13238-014-0035-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this common structure comes in part from solved crystal structures of TALEs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deng|first1=D.|last2=Yan|first2=C.|last3=Pan|first3=X.|last4=Mahfouz|first4=M.|last5=Wang|first5=J.|last6=Zhu|first6=J.-K.|last7=Shi|first7=Y.|last8=Yan|first8=N.|title=Structural Basis for Sequence-Specific Recognition of DNA by TAL Effectors|journal=Science|date=5 January 2012|volume=335|issue=6069|pages=720–723|doi=10.1126/science.1215670|pmid=22223738|pmc=3586824|bibcode=2012Sci...335..720D}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a ''Burkholderia'' TALE-like,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stella|first1=Stefano|last2=Molina|first2=Rafael|last3=López-Méndez|first3=Blanca|last4=Juillerat|first4=Alexandre|last5=Bertonati|first5=Claudia|last6=Daboussi|first6=Fayza|last7=Campos-Olivas|first7=Ramon|last8=Duchateau|first8=Phillippe|last9=Montoya|first9=Guillermo|title=BuD, a helix–loop–helix DNA-binding domain for genome modification|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section D|date=29 June 2014|volume=70|issue=7|pages=2042–2052|doi=10.1107/S1399004714011183|pmid=25004980|pmc=4089491}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also from the conservation of the code that all TALE-likes use to recognise DNA-sequences.

== TALEs ==
[[TAL effector|TALEs]] are the first identified, best-studied and largest group within the TALE-likes. TALEs are found throughout the bacterial genus ''Xanthomonas'',&lt;ref name=Ferreira2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferreira|first1=Rafael Marini|last2=de Oliveira|first2=Amanda Carolina P.|last3=Moreira|first3=Leandro M.|last4=Belasque|first4=José|last5=Gourbeyre|first5=Edith|last6=Siguier|first6=Patricia|last7=Ferro|first7=Maria Inês T.|last8=Ferro|first8=Jesus A.|last9=Chandler|first9=Michael|last10=Varani|first10=Alessandro M.|title=A TALE of Transposition: Tn-Like Transposons Play a Major Role in the Spread of Pathogenicity Determinants of Xanthomonas citri and Other Xanthomonads|journal=mBio|date=17 February 2015|volume=6|issue=1|pages=e02505-14|doi=10.1128/mBio.02505-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising mostly plant pathogens. Those TALEs which have been studied have all been shown to be secreted as part of the Type III secretion system into host plant cells. Once inside the host cell they translocate to the nucleus, bind specific DNA sequences within host promoters and turn on downstream genes. Every part of this process is thought to be conserved across all TALEs. The single meaningful difference between individual TALEs, based on current understanding, is the specific DNA sequence that each TALE binds. TALEs from even closely related strains differ in the composition of repeats that make up their DNA binding domain.&lt;ref name=PerezQunitero2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pérez-Quintero|first1=Alvaro L.|last2=Lamy|first2=Léo|last3=Gordon|first3=Jonathan L.|last4=Escalon|first4=Aline|last5=Cunnac|first5=Sébastien|last6=Szurek|first6=Boris|last7=Gagnevin|first7=Lionel|title=QueTAL: a suite of tools to classify and compare TAL effectors functionally and phylogenetically|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|date=3 August 2015|volume=6|doi=10.3389/fpls.2015.00545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeat composition determines DNA binding preference. In particular position 13 of each repeat confers the DNA base preference of each repeat. During early research it was noted that almost all the differences between repeats of a single TALE repeat array are found in positions 12 and 13 and this finding led to the hypothesis that these residues determine base preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boch|first1=Jens|last2=Schornack|first2=Sebastian|title=Unraveling a 20-Year Enigma|journal=IS-MPMI reporter|date=2010|issue=1|pages=3–4|url=http://www.ismpmi.org/members/IS-MPMI-Reporter/Documents/Archives/1001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact repeat positions 12 and 13, referred to jointly as the Repeat Variable Diresidue (RVD) are commonly said to confer base specificity despite clear evidence that position 13 is the base determining residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Lange|first1=Orlando|last2=Binder|first2=Andreas|last3=Lahaye|first3=Thomas|title=From dead leaf, to new life: TAL effectors as tools for synthetic biology|journal=The Plant Journal|date=June 2014|volume=78|issue=5|pages=753–771|doi=10.1111/tpj.12431}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the repeat domain TALEs  also possess a number of conserved features in the domains flanking the repeats. These include domains for type-III-secretion, nuclear localization and transcriptional activation. This allows TALEs to carry out their biological role as effector proteins secreted into host plant cells to activate expression of specific host genes.

'''Diversity and evolution'''

Whilst the RVD positions are commonly the only variable positions within a single TALE repeat array it should be noted that there are more differences when comparing repeat arrays of different TALEs. The diversity of TALEs across the Xanthomonas genus is considerable, but a particularly striking finding is that the evolutionary history one arrives at by comparing repeat compositions differs from that found when comparing non-repeat sequences.&lt;ref name=PerezQunitero2015/&gt; Repeat arrays of TALEs are thought to evolve rapidly, with a number of recombinatorial processes suggested to shape repeat array evolution.&lt;ref name=Ferreira2015/&gt; Recombination of TALE repeat arrays has been demonstrated in a forced-selection experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Bing|last2=Sugio|first2=Akiko|last3=White|first3=Frank F.|title=Avoidance of Host Recognition by Alterations in the Repetitive and C-Terminal Regions of AvrXa7, a Type III Effector of                            pv.|journal=Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions|date=February 2005|volume=18|issue=2|pages=142–149|doi=10.1094/MPMI-18-0142}}&lt;/ref&gt; This evolutionary dynamism is though to be made possible by the very high sequence identity of TALE repeats, which is a unique feature of TALEs as opposed to other TALE-likes.

'''T-zero'''

Another unique feature of TALEs is a set of four repeat structures at the N-terminal flank of the core repeat array. These structures, termed non-canonical or degenerate repeats have been shown to be vital for DNA binding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gao|first1=Haishan|last2=Wu|first2=Xiaojing|last3=Chai|first3=Jijie|last4=Han|first4=Zhifu|title=Crystal structure of a TALE protein reveals an extended N-terminal DNA binding region|journal=Cell Research|date=13 November 2012|volume=22|issue=12|pages=1716–1720|doi=10.1038/cr.2012.156|pmc=3515758}}&lt;/ref&gt; though all but one do not contact DNA bases and thus make no contribution to sequence preference. The one exception is repeat -1, which encodes a fixed T-zero preference to all TALEs. This means that the target sequences of TALEs are always preceded by a thymine base. This is thought to be common to all TALEs, with the possible exception of TalC from ''Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae'' strain AXO1947.

'''Discovery and molecular properties'''

It was noted in the 2002 publication of the genome of reference strain ''[[Ralstonia solanacearum]]'' GMI1000 that its genome encodes a protein similar to ''Xanthomonas'' TALEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salanoubat|first1=M.|last2=Genin|first2=S.|last3=Artiguenave|first3=F.|last4=Gouzy|first4=J.|last5=Mangenot|first5=S.|last6=Arlat|first6=M.|last7=Billault|first7=A.|last8=Brottier|first8=P.|last9=Camus|first9=J.

A.|title=Genome sequence of the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum|journal=Nature|date=31 January 2002|volume=415|issue=6871|pages=497–502|doi=10.1038/415497a|pmid=11823852}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on similar domain structure and repeat sequences it was presumed that this gene and homologs in other ''Ralstonia'' strains would encode proteins with the same molecular properties as TALEs, including sequence-specific DNA binding. In 2013 this was confirmed by two studies.&lt;ref name= deLange2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Lange|first1=Orlando|last2=Schreiber|first2=Tom|last3=Schandry|first3=Niklas|last4=Radeck|first4=Jara|last5=Braun|first5=Karl Heinz|last6=Koszinowski|first6=Julia|last7=Heuer|first7=Holger|last8=Strauß|first8=Annett|last9=Lahaye|first9=Thomas|title=Breaking the DNA-binding code of                            TAL effectors provides new possibilities to generate plant resistance genes against bacterial wilt disease|journal=New Phytologist|date=August 2013|volume=199|issue=3|pages=773–786|doi=10.1111/nph.12324|pmid=23692030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Lixin|last2=Atef|first2=Ahmed|last3=Piatek|first3=Agnieszka|last4=Ali|first4=Zahir|last5=Piatek|first5=Marek|last6=Aouida|first6=Mustapha|last7=Sharakuu|first7=Altanbadralt|last8=Mahjoub|first8=Ali|last9=Wang|first9=Guangchao|last10=Khan|first10=Suhail|last11=Fedoroff|first11=Nina V.|last12=Zhu|first12=Jian-Kang|last13=Mahfouz|first13=Magdy M.|title=Characterization and DNA-Binding Specificities of Ralstonia TAL-Like Effectors|journal=Molecular Plant|date=July 2013|volume=6|issue=4|pages=1318–1330|doi=10.1093/mp/sst006|pmid=23300258|pmc=3716395}}&lt;/ref&gt; These genes and the proteins they encode are referred to as RipTALs (Ralstonia injected protein TALE-like) in line with the standard nomenclature of Ralstonia effectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peeters|first1=Nemo|last2=Carrère|first2=Sébastien|last3=Anisimova|first3=Maria|last4=Plener|first4=Laure|last5=Cazalé|first5=Anne-Claire|last6=Genin|first6=Stephane|title=Repertoire, unified nomenclature and evolution of the Type III effector gene set in the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex|journal=BMC Genomics|date=2013|volume=14|issue=1|pages=859|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-14-859|pmid=24314259|pmc=3878972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the DNA binding code of the core repeats is conserved with TALEs, RipTALs do not share the T-zero preference, instead they have a strict G-zero requirement.&lt;ref name=deLange2013/&gt; In addition repeats within a single RipTAL repeat array have multiple sequence differences beyond the RVD positions, unlike the near-identical repeats of TALEs.

'''Biological role'''

Several lines of evidence support the idea that RipTALs function as effector proteins, promoting bacterial growth or disease by manipulating the expression of plant genes. They are secreted into plant cells by the [[Type three secretion system|Type III secretion system]], which is the main delivery system for effector proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mukaihara|first1=Takafumi|last2=Tamura|first2=Naoyuki|last3=Iwabuchi|first3=Masaki|title=Genome-Wide Identification of a Large Repertoire of Ralstonia solanacearum Type III Effector Proteins by a New Functional Screen|journal=Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions|volume=23|issue=3|pages=251–262|doi=10.1094/mpmi-23-3-0251|url=http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/MPMI-23-3-0251}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are able to function as sequence-specific transcription factors in plant cells.&lt;ref name=deLange2013/&gt; In addition a strain lacking its RipTAL was shown to grow slower inside eggplant leaf tissue than the wild type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macho|first1=Alberto P.|last2=Guidot|first2=Alice|last3=Barberis|first3=Patrick|last4=Beuzón|first4=Carmen R.|last5=Genin|first5=Stéphane|title=A Competitive Index Assay Identifies Several                            Type III Effector Mutant Strains with Reduced Fitness in Host Plants|journal=Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions|date=September 2010|volume=23|issue=9|pages=1197–1205|doi=10.1094/MPMI-23-9-1197|url=https://zenodo.org/record/853028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a study based on DNA polymorphisms in ''ripTAL'' repeat domain sequences and host plants found a statistically significant connection between host plant and repeat domain variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heuer|first1=H.|last2=Yin|first2=Y.-N.|last3=Xue|first3=Q.-Y.|last4=Smalla|first4=K.|last5=Guo|first5=J.-H.|title=Repeat Domain Diversity of avrBs3-Like Genes in Ralstonia solanacearum Strains and Association with Host Preferences in the Field|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=27 April 2007|volume=73|issue=13|pages=4379–4384|doi=10.1128/AEM.00367-07|pmid=17468277|pmc=1932761}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expected if the RipTALs of different strains are adapted to target genes in specific host plants. Despite this to date no target genes have been identified for any RipTAL.

== ''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes ==
'''Discovery'''

The publication of the genome of bacterial strain [[Burkholderia rhizoxinica|''Bukrholderia rhizoxinica'']] HKI 454, in 2011 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lackner|first1=Gerald|last2=Moebius|first2=Nadine|last3=Partida-Martinez|first3=Laila P|last4=Boland|first4=Sebastian|last5=Hertweck|first5=Christian|title=Evolution of an endofungal Lifestyle: Deductions from the Burkholderia rhizoxinica Genome|journal=BMC Genomics|date=2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=210|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-12-210|pmid=21539752|pmc=3102044}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to the discovery of a set of TALE-like genes that differed considerably in nature from the TALEs and RipTALS. The proteins encoded by these genes were studied for their DNA binding properties by two groups independently and named the Bats (Burkholderia TALE-likes &lt;ref name=Batpaper2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Lange|first1=Orlando|last2=Wolf|first2=Christina|last3=Dietze|first3=Joern|last4=Elsaesser|first4=Janett|last5=Morbitzer|first5=Robert|last6=Lahaye|first6=Thomas|title=Programmable DNA-binding proteins from Burkholderia provide a fresh perspective on the TALE-like repeat domain|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=3 May 2014|volume=42|issue=11|pages=7436–7449|doi=10.1093/nar/gku329|pmid=24792163|pmc=4066763}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or BurrH.&lt;ref name=Juillerat2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Juillerat|first1=Alexandre|last2=Bertonati|first2=Claudia|last3=Dubois|first3=Gwendoline|last4=Guyot|first4=Valérie|last5=Thomas|first5=Séverine|last6=Valton|first6=Julien|last7=Beurdeley|first7=Marine|last8=Silva|first8=George H.|last9=Daboussi|first9=Fayza|last10=Duchateau|first10=Philippe|title=BurrH: a new modular DNA binding protein for genome engineering|journal=Scientific Reports|date=23 January 2014|volume=4|doi=10.1038/srep03831|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E3831J}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research showed that the repeat units of the ''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes bind DNA with the same code as TALEs, governed by position 13 of each repeat. There are, however, a number of differences.

'''Biological role'''

''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes are composed almost entirely of repeats, lacking the large non-repetitive domains found flanking the repeats in TALEs and RpTALs. Those domains are key to the functions of TALEs and RipTALs allowing them to infiltrate the plant nucleus and turn on gene expression.  It is therefore currently unclear what the biological roles of ''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes are. What is clear is that they are not effector proteins secreted into plant cells to act as transcription factors, the biological role of TALEs and RipTALs. It is not unexpected that they may differ in biological roles from TALEs and RipTALs since the life style of the bacterium they derive from is very unlike that of TALE and RipTAL bearing bacteria. ''B. rhizoxinica'' is an endosymbiont, living inside a fungus, ''Rhizopus microsporus'', a plant pathogen. The same fungus is also an opportunistic human pathogen in immuno-compromised patients, but whereas ''B. rhizoxinica'' is necessary for pathogenicity on plant hosts it is irrelevant to human infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Partida-Martinez|first1=Laila P.|last2=Bandemer|first2=Sabine|last3=Rüchel|first3=Reinhard|last4=Dannaoui|first4=Eric|last5=Hertweck|first5=Christian|title=Lack of evidence of endosymbiotic toxin-producing bacteria in clinical Rhizopus isolates|journal=Mycoses|date=May 2008|volume=51|issue=3|pages=266–269|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0507.2007.01477.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unclear whether the ''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes are ever secreted either into the fungus, let alone into host plants.
 
'''Uses in Biotechnology'''

As noted in the publications on ''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes there may be some advantages to using these proteins as a scaffold for programmable DNA-binding proteins to function as transcription factors or designer-nucleases, compared to TALEs.&lt;ref name="Batpaper2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Juillerat2014" /&gt; These advantages are a shorter repeat size, more compact domain structure (no large non-repeat domains), greater repeat sequence diversity enabling the use of PCR on the genes encoding them and making them less vulnerable  to recombinatorial repeat loss. In addition Burkholderia TALE-likes have no T-zero requirement relaxing the constraints on DNA target selection. However, to  uses of Burkholderia TALE-likes as programmable DNA binding proteins have been published, outside of the original characterization publications.

== MOrTL1 and MOrTL2 ==

'''Discovery'''

In 2007 the results of a sweep of the world's oceans by the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] were made publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yooseph|first1=Shibu|last2=Sutton|first2=Granger|last3=Rusch|first3=Douglas B|last4=Halpern|first4=Aaron L|last5=Williamson|first5=Shannon J|last6=Remington|first6=Karin|last7=Eisen|first7=Jonathan A|last8=Heidelberg|first8=Karla B|last9=Manning|first9=Gerard|last10=Li|first10=Weizhong|last11=Jaroszewski|first11=Lukasz|last12=Cieplak|first12=Piotr|last13=Miller|first13=Christopher S|last14=Li|first14=Huiying|last15=Mashiyama|first15=Susan T|last16=Joachimiak|first16=Marcin P|last17=van Belle|first17=Christopher|last18=Chandonia|first18=John-Marc|last19=Soergel|first19=David A|last20=Zhai|first20=Yufeng|last21=Natarajan|first21=Kannan|last22=Lee|first22=Shaun|last23=Raphael|first23=Benjamin J|last24=Bafna|first24=Vineet|last25=Friedman|first25=Robert|last26=Brenner|first26=Steven E|last27=Godzik|first27=Adam|last28=Eisenberg|first28=David|last29=Dixon|first29=Jack E|last30=Taylor|first30=Susan S|last31=Strausberg|first31=Robert L|last32=Frazier|first32=Marvin|last33=Venter|first33=J. Craig|last34=Eddy|first34=Sean|title=The Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling Expedition: Expanding the Universe of Protein Families|journal=PLoS Biology|date=13 March 2007|volume=5|issue=3|pages=e16|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050016|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050016|pmid=17355171|pmc=1821046}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper in 2014 on ''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes &lt;ref name=Juillerat2014/&gt; was also the first to report that two entries from that database resembled TALE-likes, based on sequence similarity. These were further characterized and assessed for their DNA-binding potential in 2015.&lt;ref name = MOrTLspaper2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Lange|first1=Orlando|last2=Wolf|first2=Christina|last3=Thiel|first3=Philipp|last4=Krüger|first4=Jens|last5=Kleusch|first5=Christian|last6=Kohlbacher|first6=Oliver|last7=Lahaye|first7=Thomas|title=DNA-binding proteins from marine bacteria expand the known sequence diversity of TALE-like repeats|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=19 October 2015|pages=gkv1053|doi=10.1093/nar/gkv1053|pmid=26481363|pmc=4787788|volume=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The repeat units encoded by these sequences were found to mediate DNA binding with base preference matching the TALE code, and judged likely to form structures nearly identical to Bat1 repeats based on [[molecular dynamics]] simulations. The proteins encoded by these DNA sequences were therefore designated Marine Organism TALE-likes (MOrTLs) 1 and 2.

'''Evolutionary relationship to other TALE-likes'''

Whilst repeats of MOrTL1 and 2 both conform structurally and functionally to the TALE-like norm, they differ considerably at the sequence level both from all other TALE-likes and from one another. It is not known whether they are truly homologous to the other TALE-likes, and thus constitute together with the TALEs, RipTALs and Bats a true [[Protein family|protein-family]]. Alternatively they may have evolved independently. It is particularly difficult to judge the relationship to the other TALE-likes because almost nothing is known of the organisms that MOrTL1 and MOrTL2 come from. It is known only that they were found in two separate sea-water samples from the Gulf of Mexico and are likely to be bacteria based on size-exclusion before DNA sequencing.&lt;ref name=MOrTLspaper2014/&gt;

A '''[[astronomical transit|transit]] of Earth across the Sun as seen from Mars''' takes place when the planet [[Earth]] passes directly between the [[Sun]] and [[Mars]], obscuring a small part of the Sun's disc for an observer on Mars. During a transit, Earth would be visible from Mars as a small black disc moving across the face of the Sun. They occur every 26, 79 and 100 years, and every 1,000 years or so there is an extra 53rd-year transit.

==Conjunctions==
Transits of Earth from Mars usually occur in pairs, with one following the other after 79 years; rarely, there are three in the series. The transits also follow a 284-year cycle, occurring at intervals of 100.5, 79, 25.5, and 79 years; a transit falling on a particular date is usually followed by another transit 284 years later. Transits occurring when Mars is at its [[ascending node]] are in May, those at [[descending node]] happen in November. This cycle corresponds fairly closely to 151 Mars orbits, 284 Earth orbits, and 133 [[synodic period]]s, and is analogous to the cycle of [[transit of Venus|transits of Venus from Earth]], which follow a cycle of 243 years (121.5, 8, 105.5, 8). There are currently four such active series, containing from 8 to 25 transits. A new one is set to begin in 2394. The last series ending was in 1211.

==View from Mars==
No one has ever seen a transit of Earth from Mars, but the next transit will take place on November 10, 2084.&lt;ref name="Mars2084"/&gt; The last such transit took place on May 11, 1984.&lt;ref name="Earth1984"/&gt;

During the event, the [[Moon]] could almost always  also be seen in transit, although due to the distance between Earth and Moon, sometimes one body completes the transit before the other begins (this last occurred in the 1800 transit, and will happen again in 2394).

==View from Earth==
A transit of Earth from Mars corresponds to Mars being perfectly uniformly illuminated at [[astronomical opposition|opposition]] from Earth, its phase being 180.0° without any [[defect of illumination]]. During the 1879 event, this permitted [[Charles Augustus Young]] to attempt a careful measurement of the [[oblateness]] (polar compression) of Mars. He obtained the value 1/219, or 0.0046. This is close to the modern value of 1/154 (many sources will cite somewhat different values, such as 1/193, because even a difference of only a couple of kilometers in the values of Mars' polar and equatorial radii gives a considerably different result).

Much more recently, better measurements of the oblateness of Mars have been made by using [[radar]] from the Earth. Also, better measurements have been made by using artificial satellites that have been put into orbit around Mars, including ''[[Mariner 9]]'', ''[[Viking 1]]'', ''[[Viking 2]]'', and Soviet orbiters, and the more recent orbiters that have been sent from the Earth to Mars.

==In science fiction==
A [[science fiction]] short story published in 1971 by [[Arthur C. Clarke]],  called "Transit of Earth", depicts a doomed astronaut on Mars observing the transit in 1984. This short story was first published in the January 1971 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.

==Grazing and simultaneous transits==
Sometimes Earth only grazes the Sun during a transit. In this case it is possible that in some areas of Mars a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 30 April 1211, and the next such transit will occur on 27 November [[5th millennium|4356]]. It is also possible that a transit of Earth can be seen in some parts of Mars as a partial transit, while in others Earth misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 26 October 664, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December [[6th millennium|5934]].

The simultaneous occurrence of a [[Transit of Venus from Mars|transit of Venus]] and a transit of Earth is extremely rare, and will next occur in the year [[Timeline of the far future#Astronomical events|571,471]].

{{quantum mechanics}}
'''Vacuum energy''' is an underlying background [[energy]] that exists in [[space]] throughout the entire [[Universe]]. This behavior is codified in Heisenberg's [[Uncertainty principle#Energy–time uncertainty principle|energy–time uncertainty principle]]. Still, the exact effect of such fleeting bits of energy is difficult to quantify. The vacuum energy is a special case of [[zero-point energy]] that relates to the [[quantum vacuum]].&lt;ref&gt;Scientific American. 1997. FOLLOW-UP: What is the 'zero-point energy' (or 'vacuum energy') in quantum physics? Is it really possible that we could harness this energy? – Scientific American. [ONLINE] Available at: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/follow-up-what-is-the-zer/. [Accessed 27 September 2016].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unsolved|physics|Why does the [[zero-point energy]] of the vacuum not cause a large [[cosmological constant]]? What cancels it out?}}
The effects of vacuum energy can be experimentally observed in various phenomena such as [[spontaneous emission]], the [[Casimir effect]] and the [[Lamb shift]], and are thought to influence the behavior of the Universe on [[Physical cosmology|cosmological scales]]. Using the upper limit of the [[cosmological constant]], the vacuum energy of free space has been estimated to be 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule]]s (10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; [[erg]]s) per cubic meter.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Carroll, Sr Research Associate – Physics, [[California Institute of Technology]], June 22, 2006[[C-SPAN]] broadcast of Cosmology at Yearly Kos Science Panel, Part 1&lt;/ref&gt; However, in both [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) and [[stochastic electrodynamics]] (SED), consistency with the principle of [[Lorentz covariance]] and with the magnitude of the [[Planck constant]] suggest a much larger value of 10&lt;sup&gt;113&lt;/sup&gt; joules per cubic meter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Peter W. Milonni]] – "The Quantum Vacuum"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de la Pena and Cetto "The Quantum Dice: An Introduction to Stochastic Electrodynamics"&lt;/ref&gt; This huge discrepancy is known as the [[cosmological constant problem]].

==Origin==
[[Quantum field theory]] states that all fundamental [[field (physics)|fields]], such as the [[electromagnetic field]], must be [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] at each and every point in space{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. A field in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs, and the strength of the field is like the displacement of a ball from its rest position. The theory requires "vibrations" in, or more accurately changes in the strength of, such a field to propagate as per the appropriate [[wave equation]] for the particular field in question. The [[second quantization]] of quantum field theory requires that each such ball–spring combination be quantized, that is, that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space. Canonically, if the field at each point in space is a [[Harmonic oscillator|simple harmonic oscillator]], its quantization places a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] at each point. Excitations of the field correspond to the [[elementary particle]]s of [[particle physics]]. Thus, according to the theory, even the [[vacuum]] has a vastly complex structure and all calculations of quantum field theory must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum.

The theory considers vacuum to implicitly have the same properties as a particle, such as [[spin (physics)|spin]] or [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] in the case of [[light]], energy, and so on. According to the theory, most of these properties cancel out on average leaving the vacuum empty in the literal sense of the word. One important exception, however, is the vacuum energy or the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the energy. The quantization of a simple harmonic oscillator requires the lowest possible energy, or [[zero-point energy]] of such an oscillator to be:

&lt;math&gt;{E}  =\frac{1}{2} h \nu. &lt;/math&gt;

Summing over all possible oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity.  To remove this infinity, one may argue that only differences in energy are physically measurable, much as the concept of [[potential energy]] has been treated in [[classical mechanics]] for centuries. This argument is the underpinning of the theory of [[renormalization]]. In all practical calculations, this is how the infinity is handled.

Vacuum energy can also be thought of in terms of [[virtual particles]] (also known as vacuum fluctuations) which are created and destroyed out of the vacuum. These particles are always created out of the vacuum in particle–[[antiparticle]] pairs, which in most cases shortly annihilate each other and disappear. However, these particles and antiparticles may interact with others before disappearing, a process which can be mapped using [[Feynman diagrams]]. Note that this method of computing vacuum energy is mathematically equivalent to having a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] at each point and, therefore, suffers the same renormalization problems.

Additional contributions to the vacuum energy come from [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] in [[quantum field theory]].

==Implications==
Vacuum energy has a number of consequences. In 1948, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[physicist]]s [[Hendrik Casimir|Hendrik B. G. Casimir]] and [[Dirk Polder]] predicted the existence of a tiny attractive force between closely placed metal plates due to [[resonance]]s in the vacuum energy in the space between them. This is now known as the [[Casimir effect]] and has since been extensively experimentally verified. It is therefore believed that the vacuum energy is "real" in the same sense that more familiar conceptual objects such as electrons, magnetic fields, etc., are real. However, alternative explanations for the Casimir effect have since been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Jaffe: ''The Casimir Effect and the Quantum Vacuum''. In: ''Physical Review D''. Band 72, 2005 [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0503158]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other predictions are harder to verify. Vacuum fluctuations are always created as particle–antiparticle pairs. The creation of these virtual particles near the [[event horizon]] of a [[black hole]] has been hypothesized by physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] to be a mechanism for the eventual [[Hawking radiation|"evaporation" of black holes]].&lt;ref name="Page"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Page |first=Don N. |date=1976 |title=Particle emission rates from a black hole: Massless particles from an uncharged, nonrotating hole |journal=Physical Review D |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=198–206 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.13.198 |bibcode = 1976PhRvD..13..198P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If one of the pair is pulled into the black hole before this, then the other particle becomes "real" and energy/mass is essentially radiated into space from the black hole. This loss is cumulative and could result in the black hole's disappearance over time. The time required is dependent on the mass of the black hole (the equations indicate that the smaller the black hole, the more rapidly it evaporates) but could be on the order of [[Googol|10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;]] years for large solar-mass black holes.&lt;ref name="Page" /&gt;

The vacuum energy also has important consequences for [[physical cosmology]]. [[General relativity]] predicts that energy is equivalent to mass, and therefore, if the vacuum energy is "really there", it should exert a [[gravity|gravitational]] force. Essentially, a non-zero vacuum energy is expected to contribute to the [[cosmological constant]], which affects the [[expansion of the universe]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  In the special case of vacuum energy, [[general relativity]] stipulates that the gravitational field is proportional to {{nowrap|''ρ'' + 3''p''}} (where ''ρ'' is the mass–energy density, and ''p'' is the pressure). Quantum theory of the vacuum further stipulates that the pressure of the zero-state vacuum energy is always negative and equal in magnitude to ''ρ''.  Thus, the total is {{nowrap|1=''ρ'' + 3''p'' = ''ρ'' − 3''ρ'' = −2''ρ''}}, a negative value. If indeed the vacuum ground state has non-zero energy, the calculation implies a repulsive gravitational field, giving rise to [[Accelerating universe|acceleration of the expansion of the universe]],{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}. However, the vacuum energy is mathematically infinite without [[renormalization]], which is based on the assumption that we can only measure energy in a relative sense, which is not true if we can observe it indirectly via the [[cosmological constant]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The existence of vacuum energy is also sometimes used as theoretical justification for the possibility of free-energy machines. It has been argued that due to the broken symmetry (in QED), free energy does not violate conservation of energy, since the laws of thermodynamics only apply to equilibrium systems.  However, consensus amongst physicists is that this is unknown as the nature of vacuum energy remains an unsolved problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/Personal/dabbott/publications/EDU_abbott1996.pdf IEEE Trans. Ed., 1996, p.7]&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] is unaffected by the existence of vacuum energy.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  However, in [[Stochastic Electrodynamics]], the energy density is taken to be a classical random noise wave field which consists of real electromagnetic noise waves propagating isotropically in all directions.  The energy in such a wave field would seem to be accessible, e.g., with nothing more complicated than a [[directional coupler]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  The most obvious difficulty appears to be the spectral distribution of the energy, which compatibility with [[Lorentz invariance]] requires to take the form ''Kf''{{i sup|3}}, where ''K'' is a constant and ''f'' denotes frequency.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de la Pena and Cetto "The Quantum Dice:  An Introduction to Stochastic Electrodynamics"&lt;/ref&gt;  It follows that the energy and momentum flux in this wave field only becomes significant at extremely short wavelengths where directional coupler technology is currently lacking.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==History==
In 1934, [[Georges Lemaître]] used an unusual [[ideal gas|perfect-fluid]] [[equation of state]] to interpret the cosmological constant as due to vacuum energy. In 1948, the [[Casimir effect]] provided an experimental method for a verification of the existence of vacuum energy; in 1955, however, [[Evgeny Lifshitz]] offered a different origin for the Casimir effect. In 1957, [[Tsung-Dao Lee|Lee]] and [[Chen Ning Yang|Yang]] proved the concepts of broken symmetry and [[parity violation]], for which they won the Nobel prize. In 1973, [[Edward Tryon]] proposed the [[zero-energy universe]] hypothesis: that the Universe may be a large-scale quantum-mechanical vacuum fluctuation where positive [[mass]]–energy is balanced by negative gravitational [[potential energy]]. During the 1980s, there were many attempts to relate the fields that generate the vacuum energy to specific fields that were predicted by attempts at a [[Grand unification theory]] and to use observations of the Universe to confirm one or another version. However, the exact nature of the particles (or fields) that generate vacuum energy, with a density such as that required by inflation theory, remains a mystery.

There is no formal definition for the '''water-energy nexus''' - the concept refers to the relationship between the [[water]] used for [[energy production]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Spang, E. S., Moomaw, W. R., Gallagher, K. S., Kirshen, P. H., and Marks, D. H. (2014). "The water consumption of energy production: an international comparison." ''Environmental Research Letters'', 9(10), 105002.&lt;/ref&gt; including both [[electricity]] and sources of fuel such as [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]], and the energy consumed to extract, purify, deliver, heat/cool, treat and dispose of water (and wastewater) sometimes referred to as the [[energy intensity]] (EI). The relationship is not truly a closed loop as the water used for energy production need not be the same water that is processed using that energy, but all forms of energy production require some input of water making the relationship inextricable.

Among the first studies to evaluate the water and energy relationship was a [[life-cycle analysis]] conducted by [[Peter Gleick]] in 1994 that highlighted the interdependence and initiated the joint study of water and energy.&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, P. H. (1994). "Water and Energy." ''Annual Review of Energy and the Environment'', 19(1), 267-299.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the [[US Department of Energy]] (DOE) released their report on the water-energy nexus citing the need for joint water-energy policies and better understanding of the nexus and its susceptibility to [[climate change]] as a matter of [[national security]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bauer, D., Philbrick, M., and Vallario, B. (2014). "The Water-Energy Nexus: Challenges and Opportunities." U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/ref&gt; The hybrid Sankey diagram in the DOE's 2014 water-energy nexus report summarizes water and [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flows]] in the US by sector, demonstrating [[interdependence]] as well as singling out [[Electric power|thermoelectric power]] as the single largest user of water, used mainly for cooling. 

==  Water Used for Energy Production ==
[[File:Spang-2014-The water consumption of energy production.tif|thumb|486x486px|Figure 1. Total WCEP by energy category, 2008]]
All types of energy generation consume water either to process the raw materials used in the facility, constructing and maintaining the plant, or to just generate the electricity itself. Renewable power sources such as [[Photovoltaic solar cell|photovoltaic solar]] and [[wind power]], which require little water to produce energy, require water in processing the raw materials to build. Water can either be ''used'' or ''consumed,'' and can be categorised as fresh, ground, surface, blue, grey or green among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Water is considered used if it does not reduce the supply of water to downstream users, i.e. water that is taken and returned to the same source (instream use), such as in thermoelectric plants that use water for cooling and are by far the largest users of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While used water is returned to the system for downstream uses, it has usually been degraded in some way, mainly due to thermal or chemical pollution, and the natural flow has been altered which does not factor into an assessment if only the quantity of water is considered. Water is consumed when it is removed completely from the system, such as by evaporation or consumption by crops or humans. When assessing water use all these factors must be considered as well as spatiotemporal considerations making precise determination of water use very difficult.

Spang et al. (2014) conducted a study looking at the water consumption for energy production (WCEP) internationally that both showed the variation in energy types produced across countries as well as the vast differences in efficiency of energy production per unit of water use (figure 1).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Operations of water distribution systems and power distribution systems under emergency conditions of limited power and water availability is an important consideration for improving the overall resilience of the water - energy nexus.

== Energy Intensity ==

=== US (California) ===
In 2001 operating water systems in the US consumed approximately 3% of the total annual electricity (~75 TWh).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Cohen, R., Nelson, B., and Wolff, G. (2004). "Energy Down The Drain: The Hidden Costs of California’s Water Supply." E. Cousins, ed., Natural Resources Defense Council&lt;/ref&gt; The California's [[State Water Project]] (SWP) and [[Central Valley Project]] (CVP) are together the largest water system in the world with the highest water lift, over 2000&amp;nbsp;ft. across the [[Tehachapi mountains]], delivering water from the wetter and relatively rural north of the state, to the [[agricultural]]ly intensive central valley, and finally to the [[arid]] and heavily populated south. Consequently, the SWP and CVP are the single largest consumers of electricity in California consuming approximately 5 TWh of electricity each per year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2001, 19% of the state’s total electricity use (~48 TWh/year) was used in processing water including end uses, with the urban sector accounting for 65% of this.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Klein, G., Krebs, M., Hall, V., O’Brien, T., and Blevins, B. B. (2005). "California's Water – Energy Relationship." California Energy Commission, Sacramento, California.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to electricity, 30% of California’s natural gas consumption was due to water-related processes, mainly residential water heating, and 88 million gallons of diesel was consumed by groundwater pumps for agriculture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The residential sector alone accounted for 48% of the total combined electricity and natural gas consumed for water-related processes in the state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) Energy Division’s Embedded Energy in Water Studies report:&lt;blockquote&gt;''“'[[Energy Intensity]]' refers to the average amount of energy needed to transport or treat water or wastewater on a per unit basis"''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Energy Intensity is sometimes used synonymously with embedded or [[embodied energy]]. In 2005, water deliveries to Southern California were assessed to have an average EI of 12.7 MWh/MG, nearly two-thirds of which was due to transportation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Following the findings that a fifth of California’s electricity is consumed in water-related processes including end-use,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the CPUC responded by authorising a statewide study into the relationship between energy and water that was conducted by the California Institute for Energy and Environment (CIEE), and developed programs to save energy through water conservation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Bennett, B., and Park, L. (2010). "Embedded Energy in Water Studies Study 1: Statewide and Regional Water-Energy Relationship." California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, B., and Park, L. (2010). "Embedded Energy in Water Studies Study 2: Water Agency and Function Component Study and Embedded Energy- Water Load Profiles." California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydroelectricity ==
[[Hydroelectricity]] is a special case of water used for energy production mainly because hydroelectric power generation is regarded as being clean and [[renewable]], and dams (the main source of hydroelectric production) serve multiple purposes besides energy generation, including flood prevention, storage, control and recreation which make justifiable allocation analyses difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, the impacts of hydroelectric power generation can be hard to quantify both in terms of evaporative consumptive losses and altered quality of water, since damming results in flows that are much colder than for flowing streams. In some cases the moderation of flows can be seen as a rivalry of water use in time may also need to accounted for in impact analysis.

[[File:Joukowsky-Pressure-Shock-01.jpg|thumbnail|300px|Effect of a pressure surge on a float gauge]]
'''Water hammer''' (or, more generally, '''fluid hammer''', also called '''hydraulic shock''') is a [[pressure]] surge or wave caused  when a [[fluid]], usually a liquid but sometimes also a gas, in motion is forced to stop or change direction suddenly, a momentum change. A water hammer commonly occurs when a valve closes suddenly at an end of a [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] system, and a pressure wave propagates in the pipe.

This pressure wave can cause major problems, from noise and vibration to pipe collapse. It is possible to reduce the effects of the water hammer pulses with [[Hydraulic accumulator|accumulators]], [[expansion tank]]s, [[surge tank]]s, [[blowoff valve]]s, and other features.

Rough calculations can be made either using the [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Zhukovsky]] (Joukowsky) equation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Practical Hydraulics |author=Kay, Melvyn |year=2008 |edition=2nd |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=0-415-35115-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0415351154&amp;pg=PA120}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more accurate ones using the method of characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Modelling vaporous cavitation on fluid transients | journal = International Journal of Pressure Vessels and Piping | year = 2003 | first = Jian-Jun | last = Shu | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 187–195 | doi = 10.1016/S0308-0161(03)00025-5 | arxiv = 1409.8042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In the 1st century B.C., [[Vitruv|Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]] described the effect of water hammer in lead pipes and stone tubes of the Roman public water supply.&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius Pollio with Morris Hicky Morgan, trans. ''The Ten Books on Architecture'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts:  Harvard University Press, 1914) ; Book 8, Chapter 6, sections 5-8 , [https://archive.org/stream/vitruviustenbook00vitruoft#page/n281/mode/2up pp. 245-246.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711025315/http://archive.org/stream/vitruviustenbook00vitruoft |date=2012-07-11 }}  Vitruvius states that when a water pipe crosses a wide valley, it must sometimes be constructed as an inverted siphon.  He states that cavities ("venters") must be constructed periodically along the pipe "and in the venter, water cushions must be constructed to relieve the pressure of the air." "But if there is no such venter made in the valleys, nor any substructure built on a level, but merely an elbow, the water will break out, and burst the joints of the pipes."  Swiss engineer Martin Schwarz — Martin Schwarz, "Neue Forschungsergebnisse zu Vitruvs ''colliviaria''" [New research results on Vitruvius' ''colliviaria''], pp.  353-357,  in:  Christoph Ohlig, ed., ''Cura Aquarum in Jordanien'' (Siegburg, Germany:  Deutschen Wasserhistorischen Gesellschaft, 2008) — argues that Vitruvius' phrase ''vis spiritus'' referred not to air pressure, but to pressure transients (water hammer) in the water pipes.  He found stone plugs (''colliviaria'') in Roman water pipes, which could be expelled by water hammer, allowing water in the pipe to flood the air chamber above the pipe, instead of rupturing the pipe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Andreas |last=Ismaier |title=Untersuchung der fluiddynamischen Wechselwirkung zwischen Druckstößen und Anlagenkomponenten in Kreiselpumpensystemen |language=German |trans-title=Investigation of the fluid dynamic interaction between pressure surges and system components in centrifugal pumping systems |year=2011 |publisher=Shaker |volume=11 |series=Schriftenreihe des Lehrstuhls für Prozessmaschinen und Anlagentechnik, Universität Erlangen; Nürnberg Lehrstuhl für Prozessmaschinen und Anlagentechnik |isbn=978-3-8322-9779-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Water hammer was exploited before there was even a word for it; in 1772, Englishman [[John Whitehurst]] built a [[hydraulic ram]] for a home in Cheshire, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Whitehurst |first=John |year=1775 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nXg1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA277#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Account of a machine for raising water, executed at Oulton, in Cheshire, in 1772 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=65 |issue= |pages=277–279 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1775.0026 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328203126/https://books.google.com/books?id=nXg1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA277#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2017-03-28 |df= }} See also plate preceding page 277.&lt;/ref&gt; In  1796, French inventor [[Joseph Michel Montgolfier]] (1740–1810) built a hydraulic ram for his paper mill in [[Voiron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Montgolfier |first=J.

==Cause and effect==
When a pipe is suddenly closed at the outlet (downstream), the mass of water before the closure is still moving, thereby building up high pressure and a resulting [[shock wave]]. In domestic [[plumbing]] this is experienced as a loud banging resembling a hammering noise. Water hammer can cause pipelines to break if the pressure is high enough. Air traps or stand pipes (open at the top) are sometimes added as [[Wiktionary:damper|dampers]] to water systems to absorb the potentially damaging forces caused by the moving water.

In [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric generating stations]], the water traveling along the tunnel or pipeline may be prevented from entering a turbine by closing a valve. For example, if there is 14&amp;nbsp;km of tunnel of 7.7 m diameter full of water travelling at 3.75&amp;nbsp;m/s,&lt;ref&gt;http://communities.bentley.com/products/hydraulics___hydrology/f/5925/p/60896/147250.aspx#147250&lt;/ref&gt; that represents approximately 8000 megajoules of kinetic energy that must be arrested.

As the water rises up the shaft its kinetic energy is converted into potential energy, which causes the water in the tunnel to decelerate. At some HEP stations, such as the Saxon Falls Hydro [[List of power stations in Michigan#Hydropower|Power Plant In Michigan]], what looks like a [[water tower]] is actually one of these devices, known in these cases as a [[surge tank|surge drum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.xcelenergy.com/energy_portfolio/electricity/power_plants/saxon|title=Saxon Falls Hydro Generating Station {{!}} Xcel Energy|website=www.xcelenergy.com|access-date=2017-08-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816195209/https://www.xcelenergy.com/energy_portfolio/electricity/power_plants/saxon|archivedate=2017-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the home, a water hammer may occur when a [[dishwasher]], [[washing machine]] or [[toilet]] shuts off water flow. The result may be heard as a loud bang, repetitive banging (as the shock wave travels back and forth in the plumbing system), or as some shuddering.

On the other hand, when an upstream [[valve]] in a pipe closes, water downstream of the valve attempts to continue flowing creating a vacuum that may cause the pipe to collapse or [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implode]]. This problem can be particularly acute if the pipe is on a downhill slope. To prevent this, air and vacuum [[relief valve]]s or air vents are installed just downstream of the valve to allow air to enter the line to prevent this vacuum from occurring.

Other causes of water hammer are pump failure and [[check valve]] slam (due to sudden deceleration, a check valve may slam shut rapidly, depending on the dynamic characteristic of the check valve and the mass of the water between a check valve and tank). To alleviate this situation, it is recommended to install non-slam check valves as they do not rely on gravity or fluid flow for their closure. For vertical pipes, other suggestions include installing new piping that can be designed to include air chambers to alleviate the possible shockwave of water due to excess water flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dft-valves.com/preventing-water-hammer/|title=How To Prevent Water Hammer {{!}} DFT Valves|work=DFT Valves|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816193649/http://www.dft-valves.com/preventing-water-hammer/|archivedate=2017-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Blown expansion joint.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Expansion joints on a steam line that have been destroyed by steam hammer]]

Steam distribution systems may also be vulnerable to a situation similar to water hammer, known as ''steam hammer''. In a steam system, a water hammer most often occurs when some of the steam condenses into water in a horizontal section of the piping.  Steam picks up the water, forming a "[[slug (projectile)|slug]]", and hurls this at high velocity into a pipe fitting, creating a loud hammering noise and greatly stressing the pipe.  This condition is usually caused by a poor condensate drainage strategy.

Where air filled traps are used, these eventually become depleted of their trapped air over a long period through absorption into the water. This can be cured by shutting off the supply, opening taps at the highest and lowest locations to drain the system (thereby restoring air to the traps), and then closing the taps and re-opening the supply.

On [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[internal combustion engine]]s, a fluid hammer can take place when the throttle is closed while the turbocharger is forcing air into the engine. A [[pressure relief valve]] placed before the throttle prevents the air from surging against the throttle body by diverting it elsewhere, thus protecting the turbocharger from pressure damage. This valve can either recirculate the air into the turbocharger's intake (recirculation valve), or it can blow the air into the atmosphere and produce the distinctive hiss-flutter of an aftermarket turbocharger ([[blowoff valve]]).

==Water hammer from a jet of water==
If a stream of high pressure water impinges on a surface, water hammer can quickly [[erosion|erode]] and destroy it. In the [[2009 Sayano–Shushenskaya hydroelectric power station accident]], the lid to a 640 MW turbine was ejected upwards, hitting the ceiling above. During the accident, the rotor was seen flying through the air, still spinning, about 3 meters  above the floor. Unrestrained, {{convert|256|m3|gal|sigfig=3}} per second of water began to spray all over the generator hall.&lt;ref name=pm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/gonzo/4344681 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213154304/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/gonzo/4344681 |archivedate=2011-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The geyser caused the structural failure of steel ceiling joists, precipitating a roof collapse around the failed turbine.

==Water hammer during an explosion==
When an explosion happens in an enclosed space, water hammer can cause the walls of the container to deform. However, it can also impart momentum to the enclosure if it is free to move. An underwater explosion in the [[SL-1]] [[nuclear reactor]] vessel caused the water to accelerate upwards through {{convert|2.5|ft}} of air before it struck the vessel head at {{convert|160|ft/s}} with a pressure of {{convert|10000|psi}}. This pressure wave caused the {{convert|26000|lb}} steel vessel to jump 9 feet 1 inch (2.77 m) into the air before it dropped into its prior location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.id.doe.gov/foia/PDF/IDO-19313.pdf |id=IDO-19313 |title=Additional Analysis of the SL-1 Excursion: Final Report of Progress July through October 1962 |date=November 21, 1962 |author=Flight Propulsion Laboratory Department, General Electric Company, Idaho Falls, Idaho |publisher=U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Division of Technical Information |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927065809/http://www.id.doe.gov/foia/PDF/IDO-19313.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df= }}; also TM-62-11-707&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative to perform ongoing preventative maintenance to avoid water hammer as the results of these powerful explosions have resulted in fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/07/nyregion/us-blames-con-ed-error-for-fatal-plant-explosion.html|title=U.S. Blames Con Ed Error For Fatal Plant Explosion|last=Wald|first=Matthew L.|date=1993-05-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816194725/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/07/nyregion/us-blames-con-ed-error-for-fatal-plant-explosion.html|archivedate=2017-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigating measures==
Water hammer has caused accidents and fatalities, but usually damage is limited to breakage of pipes or appendages. An engineer should always assess the risk of a pipeline burst. Pipelines transporting hazardous liquids or gases warrant special care in design, construction, and operation. Hydroelectric power plants especially must be carefully designed and maintained because the water hammer can cause water pipes to fail catastrophically.

The following characteristics may reduce or eliminate water hammer:
* Reduce the pressure of the water supply to the building by fitting a regulator.
* Lower fluid velocities. To keep water hammer low, pipe-sizing charts for some applications recommend flow velocity at or below {{convert|1.5|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}
* Fit slowly closing valves. Toilet fill valves are available in a quiet fill type that closes quietly.
* High pipeline pressure rating (expensive).
* Good pipeline control (start-up and shut-down procedures).
* [[Water tower]]s (used in many [[drinking water]] systems) help maintain steady flow rates and trap large pressure fluctuations.
* Air vessels work in much the same way as water towers, but are pressurized. They typically have an air cushion above the fluid level in the vessel, which may be regulated or separated by a bladder. Sizes of air vessels may be up to hundreds of cubic meters on large pipelines. They come in many shapes, sizes and configurations. Such vessels often are called accumulators or expansion tanks.
* A [[hydropneumatic device]] similar in principle to a [[shock absorber]] called a 'Water Hammer Arrestor' can be installed between the water pipe and the machine, to absorb the shock and stop the banging.
* Air valves often remediate low pressures at high points in the pipeline. Though effective, sometimes large numbers of air valves need be installed. These valves also allow air into the system, which is often unwanted.
* Shorter branch pipe lengths.
* Shorter lengths of straight pipe, i.e. add elbows, expansion loops. Water hammer is related to the speed of sound in the fluid, and elbows reduce the influences of pressure waves.
* Arranging the larger piping in loops that supply shorter smaller run-out pipe branches. With looped piping, lower velocity flows from both sides of a loop can serve a branch.
* [[Flywheel]] on a pump.
* Pumping station bypass.

==The magnitude of the pulse==
[[Image:Water hammer pressure.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Typical pressure wave caused by closing a valve in a pipeline]]

One of the first to successfully investigate the water hammer problem was the Italian engineer [[Lorenzo Allievi]].

Water hammer can be analyzed by two different approaches—''rigid column theory'', which ignores compressibility of the fluid and elasticity of the walls of the pipe, or by a full analysis that includes elasticity.  When the time it takes a valve to close is long compared to the propagation time for a pressure wave to travel the  length of the pipe, then rigid column theory is appropriate; otherwise considering elasticity may be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Bruce |first1=S. |last2=Larock |first2=E. |last3=Jeppson |first3=R. W. |last4=Watters |first4=G. Z. |title=Hydraulics of Pipeline Systems |location= |publisher=CRC Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-8493-1806-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Below are two approximations for the peak pressure, one that considers elasticity, but assumes the valve closes instantaneously, and a second that neglects elasticity but includes a finite time for the valve to close.

===Instant valve closure; compressible fluid===
The pressure profile of the water hammer pulse can be calculated from the [[Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Joukowsky]] equation&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Thorley |first=A. R. D. |title=Fluid Transients in Pipelines |edition=2nd |publisher=Professional Engineering Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=0-79180210-8 |doi= }}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} =\rho a \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

So for a valve closing instantaneously, the maximum magnitude of the water hammer pulse is:

::&lt;math&gt;\Delta P =\rho a_0 \Delta v &lt;/math&gt;

where Δ''P'' is the magnitude of the pressure wave (Pa), ''&amp;rho;'' is the density of the fluid (kg m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;), ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the speed of sound in the fluid (ms&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and Δ''v'' is the change in the fluid's velocity (ms&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The pulse comes about due to [[Newton's second law of motion|Newton's laws of motion]] and the [[continuity equation]] applied to the deceleration of a fluid element.&lt;ref name=SW&gt;{{Citation |last=Streeter |first=V. L. |last2=Wylie |first2=E. B. |title=Fluid Mechanics |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |edition=International 9th Revised |year=1998 |isbn= |doi= }}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Equation for wave speed====
As the speed of sound in a fluid is &lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{\frac B \rho}&lt;/math&gt;, the peak pressure depends on the fluid compressibility if the valve is closed abruptly.

::&lt;math&gt;B = \frac K {(1+V/a)[1+c(K/E)(D/t)]}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* ''a'' = wave speed
* ''B'' = equivalent bulk modulus of elasticity of the system fluid-pipe
* ''&amp;rho;'' = density of the fluid
* ''K'' = bulk modulus of elasticity of the fluid
* ''E'' = [[elastic modulus]] of the pipe
* ''D'' = internal pipe diameter
* ''t'' = pipe wall thickness
* ''c'' = dimensionless parameter due to system pipe-constraint condition on wave speed&lt;ref name="SW"/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2012}}

===Slow valve closure; incompressible fluid===
When the valve is closed slowly compared to the transit time for a pressure wave to travel the length of the pipe, the elasticity can be neglected, and the phenomenon can be described in terms of [[inertance]] or rigid column theory:
:&lt;math&gt;F = m a = P A = \rho L A {dv \over dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming constant deceleration of the water column (''dv''/''dt'' = ''v''/''t''), gives:
:&lt;math&gt;P = \rho L v/t.&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''F'' = force, N
* ''m'' = mass of the fluid column, kg
* ''a'' = acceleration, m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''P'' = pressure, Pa
* ''A'' = pipe cross section, m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* &amp;rho; = fluid density, kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''L'' = pipe length, m
* ''v'' = [[flow velocity]], m/s
* ''t'' = valve closure time, s

The above formula becomes, for water and with imperial unit: P = 0.0135 V L/t.
For practical application, a safety factor of about 5 is recommended:

:&lt;math&gt;P =0.07 V L/t +P_1&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the inlet pressure in psi, ''V'' is the flow velocity in ft/sec, ''t'' is the valve closing time in seconds and ''L'' is the upstream pipe length in feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plastomatic.com/water-hammer.html "Water Hammer &amp; Pulsation"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701193833/http://www.plastomatic.com/water-hammer.html |date=2008-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expression for the excess pressure due to water hammer==

When a valve with a volumetric flow rate Q is closed, an excess pressure &amp;Delta;P is created upstream of the valve, whose value is given by the [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Joukowsky]] equation:

::&lt;math&gt;\Delta P = Z \, Q&lt;/math&gt;

In this expression:&lt;ref&gt;Faisandier, J., Hydraulic and Pneumatic Mechanisms, 8th edition, Dunod, Paris, 1999 ({{ISBN|2100499483}})
&lt;/ref&gt;
* overpressurization &amp;Delta;P is expressed in Pa;
* ''Q'' is the volumetric flow in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s;
* ''Z'' is the hydraulic impedance, expressed in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/s.
The hydraulic impedance ''Z'' of the pipeline determines the magnitude of the water hammer pulse. It is itself defined by:

::&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{\sqrt{\rho \, B}}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

with:
* ''ρ'' the density of the liquid, expressed in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;;
* ''A'' cross sectional area of the pipe, m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;;
* ''B'' equivalent modulus of compressibility of the liquid in the pipe, expressed in Pa.

The latter follows from a series of hydraulic concepts: 
*compressibility of the liquid, defined by its adiabatic compressibility modulus ''B''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting from the equation of state of the liquid generally available from thermodynamic tables;
*the elasticity of the walls of the pipe, which defines an equivalent bulk modulus of compressibility for the solid ''B''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. In the case of a pipe of circular cross section whose thickness ''t'' is small compared to the diameter ''D'', the equivalent modulus of compressibility is given by the following formula: &lt;math&gt;B = \frac{t}{D} E &lt;/math&gt;; in which ''E'' is the Young's modulus (in Pa) of the material of the pipe;
*possibly compressibility ''B''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; of gas dissolved in the liquid, defined by: &lt;math&gt;B_g = \frac{\gamma}{\alpha} P&lt;/math&gt;
** γ being the [[specific heat ratio]] of the gas
** α the rate of ventilation (the volume fraction of undissolved gas)
** and ''P'' the pressure (in Pa).

Thus, the equivalent elasticity is the sum of the original elasticities:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{B} = \frac{1}{B_l} + \frac{1}{B_{s}} + \frac{1}{B_g}&lt;/math&gt;

As a result, we see that we can reduce the water hammer by:
*increasing the pipe diameter at constant flow, which reduces the flow velocity and hence the deceleration of the liquid column;
* employing the solid material as tight as possible with respect to the internal fluid bulk (solid Young modulus low with respect to fluid bulk modulus);
*introducing a device that increases the flexibility of the entire hydraulic system, such as a hydraulic accumulator;
*where possible, increasing the percentage of undissolved gases in the liquid.

==Dynamic equations==
The water hammer effect can be simulated by solving the following partial differential equations.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}+ \frac{1}{B}\frac{dP}{dt}=0\, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dt}+ \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}+\frac{f}{2D}V|V|=0\, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is the fluid velocity inside pipe, ''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;'' is the fluid density and ''B'' is the '''equivalent''' bulk modulus, ''f'' is the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation|Darcy-Weisbach friction factor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chaudhry |first1=Hanif |title=Applied Hydraulic Transients |date=1979 |publisher=New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Column separation==
Column separation is a phenomenon that can occur during a water-hammer event.  If the pressure in a pipeline drops below the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid, [[cavitation]] will occur (some of the liquid vaporizes, forming a bubble in the pipeline, keeping the pressure close to the vapor pressure).  This is most likely to occur at specific locations such as closed ends, high points or knees (changes in pipe slope).  When subcooled liquid flows into the space previously occupied by vapor the area of contact between the vapor and the liquid increases.  This causes the vapor to condense into the liquid reducing the pressure in the vapor space.  The liquid on either side of the vapor space is then accelerated into this space by the pressure difference.  The collision of the two columns of liquid (or of one liquid column if at a closed end) causes a large and nearly instantaneous rise in pressure.  This pressure rise can damage [[hydraulic machinery]], individual pipes and supporting structures.  Many repetitions of cavity formation and collapse may occur in a single water-hammer event.&lt;ref&gt;Bergeron, L., 1950. Du Coup de Bélier en Hydraulique - Au Coup de Foudre en Electricité. (Waterhammer in hydraulics and wave surges in electricity.) Paris: Dunod (in French). (English translation by ASME Committee, New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1961.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simulation software==
Most water hammer [[software]] packages use the [[method of characteristics]]&lt;ref name=SW/&gt; to solve the [[differential equation]]s involved. This method works well if the wave speed does not vary in time due to either air or gas entrainment in a pipeline. The Wave Method (WM) is also used in various software packages. WM lets operators analyze large networks efficiently. Many commercial and non commercial packages are available.

Software packages vary in complexity, dependent on the processes modeled. The more sophisticated packages may have any of the following features:

:* Multiphase flow capabilities
:* An [[algorithm]] for [[cavitation]] growth and collapse
:* Unsteady friction: the pressure waves dampens as turbulence is generated and due to variations in the flow velocity distribution
:* Varying bulk modulus for higher pressures (water becomes less compressible)
:* Fluid structure interaction: the pipeline reacts on the varying pressures and causes pressure waves itself

==Applications==
* The water hammer principle can be used to create a simple water [[pump]] called a [[hydraulic ram]].
* Leaks can sometimes be detected using water hammer.
* Enclosed air pockets can be detected in pipelines.

A '''withy''' or '''withe''' is a strong flexible [[willow]] stem, typically used in [[thatching]] and for gardening.

Several species and hybrid [[cultivar]]s of willows (often known as osiers) are grown for withy production; typical species include ''[[Salix acutifolia]]'', ''[[Salix daphnoides]]'', ''[[Salix × mollissima]]'', ''[[Salix purpurea]]'', ''[[Salix triandra]]'', and ''[[Salix viminalis]]''.&lt;ref name=rdm&gt;Meikle, R. D. (1984). ''Willows and Poplars of Great Britain and Ireland''. BSBI Handbook No. 4. {{ISBN|0-901158-07-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also sometimes used to describe any type of flexible rod used in [[rural crafts]] such as [[hazel]] or [[Fraxinus|ash]].

Withies traditionally serve to mark minor tidal channels in UK harbours and estuaries. In many places they remain in use {{as of | 2015 | lc = on}} and are often marked on navigation charts. At high tide the tops of a line of withies stuck in the mud on one or both sides of a channel will show above water to indicate where the deeper water lies. Note the images of international navigation-chart symbols for withies (port and starboard).
[[File:NChart-Symbol INT Withy Port.svg|thumb|NChart-Symbol INT Withy Port]]
[[File:NChart-Symbol INT Withy Starboard.svg|thumb|NChart-Symbol INT Withy Starboard]]

Places such as [[Wythenshawe]] and Withy Grove (both in [[Manchester]]) take their names from the willow woods and groves that grew there in earlier times. The [[Somerset Levels]] remain the only area in the UK growing basket willow commercially.

The '''world''' is the planet [[Earth]] and all [[life]] upon it, including [[human civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/world Merriam-webster.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423111522/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/world |date=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a philosophical context, the "world" is the whole of the physical [[Universe]], or an [[ontology|ontological]] world (the "world" of an [[individual]]). In a theological context, the ''world'' is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred spheres. "[[Eschatology|End of the world]]" scenarios refer to the end of human history, often in religious contexts.

The [[history of the world]] is commonly understood as spanning the major geopolitical developments of about five millennia, from the [[Cradle of civilization|first civilizations]] to the present. In terms such as [[world religion]], [[world language]], [[world government]], and [[world war]], the term ''world'' suggests an international or intercontinental scope without necessarily implying participation of every part of the world.

The [[world population]] is the sum of all human populations at any time; similarly, the [[world economy]] is the sum of the economies of all societies or countries, especially in the context of [[globalization]]. Terms such as "[[world championship]]", "[[gross world product]]", and "[[world flags]]" imply the sum or combination of all [[sovereign state]]s.

==Etymology and usage==
The [[English language|English]] word ''[[:wikt:world|world]]'' comes from the [[Old English]] ''weorold (-uld), weorld, worold (-uld, -eld)'', a compound of ''[[were|wer]]'' "man" and ''eld'' "age," which thus means roughly "Age of Man."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE588.html ''American Heritage Dictionary'' ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512075921/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE588.html |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Old English is a reflex of the [[Common Germanic]] ''*wira-alđiz'', also reflected in [[Old Saxon]] ''werold'', [[Old Dutch]] ''werilt'', [[Old High German]] ''weralt'', [[Old Frisian]] ''warld'' and [[Old Norse]] ''verǫld'' (whence the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''[[wikt:en:veröld|veröld]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Orel, Vladimir (2003). ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology'' Leiden: Brill. pg. 462. {{ISBN|90-04-12875-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The corresponding word in [[Latin]] is ''mundus'', literally "clean, elegant", itself a loan translation of Greek ''[[cosmos]]'' "orderly arrangement." While the Germanic word thus reflects a mythological notion of a "domain of Man" (compare [[Midgard]]), presumably as opposed to the divine sphere on the one hand and the [[chthonic]] sphere of the underworld on the other, the Greco-Latin term expresses a notion of [[creation myth|creation]] as an act of establishing order out of [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]].

"World" distinguishes the entire [[planet]] or [[population]] from any particular [[country]] or [[region]]: ''world affairs'' pertain not just to one place but to the whole world, and ''[[world history]]'' is a field of [[history]] that examines events from a global (rather than a national or a regional) perspective. ''Earth'', on the other hand, refers to the planet as a physical entity, and distinguishes it from other planets and physical objects.

"World" was also classically used to mean the material universe, or the cosmos: "The worlde is an apte frame of heauen and earthe, and all other naturall thinges contained in them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=R|last=Record|year=1556|title=Castle of Knowledge}} cited in {{cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary|at=World, sense 8|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/230262?rskey=BRZMwD|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earth was often described as "the center of the world".&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite book|author=Sacrobosco|title=Treatise on the Sphere|year=1230|at=trans by Lynn Thorndike, 1949|url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519151919/http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm|archivedate=2013-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term can also be used attributively, to mean "global", or "relating to the whole world", forming usages such as [[world community]] or world canonical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawpark.jimdo.com''World Canonical Texts'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, a ''world'' may refer to any planet or [[heavenly body]], especially when it is thought of as inhabited, especially in the context of [[science fiction]] or [[futurology]].

''World'', in its original sense, when qualified, can also refer to a particular domain of [[human]] [[experience]].

* The ''world of work'' describes paid work and the pursuit of a [[career]], in all its social aspects, to distinguish it from home life and [[academia|academic]] study.
* The ''fashion world'' describes the environment of the designers, [[fashion house]]s and [[consumer]]s that make up the [[fashion industry]].
* historically, the ''[[New World]]'' vs. the ''[[Old World]]'', referring to the parts of the world colonized in the wake of the [[age of discovery]]. Now mostly used in zoology and botany, as in [[New World monkey]].

==Philosophy==
[[File:The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch High Resolution.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' triptych by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] ({{Circa|1503}}) shows the "garden" of mundane pleasures flanked by [[Paradise]] and [[Hell]]. 

The exterior panel shows the world before the appearance of humanity, depicted as a [[flat earth|disc]] enclosed in a [[firmament|sphere]].]]

In philosophy, the term world has several possible meanings. In some contexts, it refers to everything that makes up [[reality]] or the physical [[universe]]. In others, it can mean have a specific [[ontology|ontological]] sense (see [[world disclosure]]). While clarifying the [[concept]] of world has arguably always been among the basic tasks of [[Western philosophy]], this theme appears to have been raised explicitly only at the start of the twentieth century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Heidegger |first=Martin |title=Basic Problems of Phenomenology |location=Bloomington |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |year=1982 |page=165 |isbn=0-253-17686-7 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the subject of continuous debate. The question of what the world is has by no means been settled.

===Parmenides===
The traditional interpretation of [[Parmenides]]' work is that he argued that the everyday perception of reality of the physical world (as described in ''[[Parmenides#The Way of Opinion (doxa)|doxa]]'') is mistaken, and that the reality of the world is 'One Being' (as described in aletheia): an unchanging, ungenerated, indestructible whole.

===Plato===
In his [[Allegory of the Cave]], [[Plato]] distinguishes between forms and ideas and imagines two distinct worlds: the sensible world and the intelligible world.

===Hegel===
In [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s [[philosophy of history]], the expression ''Weltgeschichte ist Weltgericht'' (World History is a tribunal that judges the World) is used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions. Science is born from the desire to transform the World in relation to Man; its final end is technical application.

===Schopenhauer===
''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' is the central work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].
Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation; the Kantian thing-in-itself. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body.

===Wittgenstein===
Two definitions that were both put forward in the 1920s, however, suggest the range of available opinion. "The world is everything that is the case," wrote [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in his influential ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', first published in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|date=3 March 2014|accessdate=3 December 2017|first1=Anat|first2=Anat|last1=Biletzki|last2=Matar|edition=Fall 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition would serve as the basis of [[logical positivism]], with its assumption that there is exactly one world, consisting of the totality of facts, regardless of the interpretations that individual people may make of them.

===Heidegger===
[[Martin Heidegger]], meanwhile, argued that "the surrounding world is different for each of us, and notwithstanding that we move about in a common world".&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger (1982), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The world, for Heidegger, was that into which we are always already "thrown" and with which we, as beings-in-the-world, must come to terms. His conception of "[[world disclosure]]" was most notably elaborated in his 1927 work ''[[Being and Time]]''.

===Freud===
In response, [[Sigmund Freud]] proposed that we do not move about in a common world, but a common thought process. He believed that all the actions of a person are motivated by one thing: lust. This led to numerous theories about reactionary consciousness.

===Other===
Some philosophers, often inspired by [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], argue that metaphysical concepts such as possibility, probability, and necessity are best analyzed by comparing ''the'' world to a range of [[possible world]]s; a view commonly known as [[modal realism]].

==Religion and mythology==

[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Yggdrasil]], a modern attempt to reconstruct the Norse [[world tree]] which connects the [[heaven]]s, the world, and the [[underworld]].]]
[[Mythological cosmology|Mythological cosmologies]] often depict the world as centered on an ''[[axis mundi]]'' and delimited by a boundary such as a [[Oceanus|world ocean]], a [[Jörmungandr|world serpent]] or similar. In some religions, worldliness (also called carnality{{citation needed|date=October 2018}})&lt;ref&gt;Hemer, C. J. “Worldly.” Edited by Geoffrey W. Bromiley. The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Revised. Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1979–1988.&lt;/ref&gt; is that which relates to this world as opposed to other worlds or realms.

===Buddhism===

In [[Buddhism]], the world means society, as distinct from the [[monastery]]. It refers to the material world, and to worldly gain such as wealth, reputation, jobs, and war. The spiritual world would be the path to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], and changes would be sought in what we could call the psychological realm.

===Christianity===

In [[Christianity]], the term often connotes the concept of the [[fall of man|fallen]] and corrupt world order of human society, in contrast to the [[World to Come]]. The world is frequently cited alongside ''the [[flesh (theology)|flesh]]'' and ''the [[Devil]]'' as a source of [[temptation]] that Christians should flee. [[Monk]]s speak of striving to be "''in'' this world, but not ''of'' this world"—as [[Jesus]] said—and the term "worldhood" has been distinguished from "monkhood", the former being the status of merchants, princes, and others who deal with "worldly" things.

This view is clearly expressed by king [[Alfred the Great]] of England (d. 899) in his famous Preface to the ''[[Cura Pastoralis]]'':
{{quote|"Therefore I command you to do as I believe you are willing to do, that you free yourself from worldly affairs ''([[Old English]]: woruldðinga)'' as often as you can, so that wherever you can establish that wisdom that God gave you, you establish it. Consider what punishments befell us in this world when we neither loved wisdom at all ourselves, nor transmitted it to other men; we had the name alone that we were Christians, and very few had the practices."}}

Although Hebrew and Greek words meaning "world" are used in Scripture with the normal variety of senses, many examples of its use in this particular sense can be found in the teachings of [[Jesus]] according to the [[Gospel of John]], e.g. 7:7, 8:23, 12:25, 14:17, 15:18-19, 17:6-25, 18:36. For contrast, a relatively newer concept is [[Catholic imagination]].

''[[Contemptus mundi]]'' is the name given to the recognition that the world, in all its vanity, is nothing more than a futile attempt to hide from God by stifling our desire for the good and the holy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm Contemptus mundi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708140237/http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm |date=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been criticized as a "pastoral of fear" by modern historian [[Jean Delumeau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm Parish Missions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605035017/http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Vatican Council]], there was a novel attempt to develop a positive theological view of the World, which is illustrated by the pastoral optimism of the constitutions ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'', ''[[Lumen gentium]]'', ''[[Unitatis redintegratio]]'' and ''[[Dignitatis humanae]]''.

====Eastern Christianity====

In Eastern Christian monasticism or [[asceticism]], the world of mankind is driven by passions. Therefore, the passions of the World are simply called "the world". Each of these passions are a link to the world of mankind or order of human society. Each of these passions must be overcome in order for a person to receive salvation ([[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]). The process of theosis is a personal relationship with God. This understanding is taught within the works of ascetics like [[Evagrius Ponticus]], and the most seminal ascetic works read most widely by Eastern Christians, the [[Philokalia]] and the [[Ladder of Divine Ascent]] (the works of Evagrius and [[John Climacus]] are also contained within the Philokalia). At the highest level of world [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] is [[hesychasm]] which culminates into the [[theoria|Vision of God]].

====Orbis Catholicus====

''Orbis Catholicus'' is a Latin phrase meaning ''Catholic world'', per the expression [[Urbi et Orbi]], and refers to that area of [[Christendom]] under [[papal supremacy]]. It is somewhat similar to the phrases secular world, Jewish world and [[Islamic world]].

===Islam===
{{Main|Dunya}}
''Dunya'' derives from the root word "dana" that means to bring near. In that sense, "dunya" is "what is brought near".&lt;ref&gt;Attas, Islam and Secularism, p.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

===Hinduism===
'''Hinduism''' is an [[Indian religion]] and ''[[dharma]]'', or a way of life,{{refn|group=note|name="definition"}} widely practised in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It includes a number of Indian religious traditions with a loose sense of interconnection, as different from Jainism and Buddhism, and (since medieaval and modern times) Islam and Christianity. Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world,{{refn|group=note|See:
