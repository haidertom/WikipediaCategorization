'''''A Letter to a Friend''''' (written 1656; published posthumously in 1690), by Sir [[Thomas Browne]], the 17th century [[philosopher]] and [[physician]], is a medical treatise of case-histories and witty speculations upon the [[human condition]].

It is believed to be the source of a term Mary Leitao found in 2001 to describe her son's skin condition. She chose the name "[[Morgellons]] disease" from a skin condition described by Browne in ''Letter to a Friend'', thus:

:''"...&amp;nbsp;that endemial distemper of children in Languedoc, called the morgellons, wherein they critically break out with harsh hairs on their backs."''&lt;ref&gt;"The Major Works of Sir Thomas Browne", edited and with an Introduction by C.&amp;nbsp;A. Partides. Penguin 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

There is, however, no suggestion that the symptoms described by Browne are linked to the alleged modern cases of Morgellons.

In many fields of mathematics and physics, almost all scientific papers are [[self-archiving|self-archived]] on the arXiv repository. Begun on August 14, 1991, arXiv.org passed the half-million-article milestone on October 3, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Ginsparg |first=Paul |eprint=1108.2700 |title=It was twenty years ago today&amp;nbsp;...|class= cs.DL|date=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.library.cornell.edu/content/online-scientific-repository-hits-milestone |title=Online Scientific Repository Hits Milestone: With 500,000 Articles, arXiv Established as Vital Library Resource |publisher=News.library.cornell.edu |date=October 3, 2008 |accessdate=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had hit a million by the end of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=One Million Preprints and Counting: A conversation with arXiv founder Paul Ginsparg|journal=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]|first=Tracy|last=Vence|date=December 29, 2014|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/41677/title/Q-A--One-Million-Preprints-and-Counting/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dddmag2015" /&gt;  By October 2016 the submission rate had grown to more than 10,000 per month.&lt;ref name="dddmag2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/show_monthly_submissions |title=arXiv monthly submission rate statistics |publisher=Arxiv.org |accessdate=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:ArXiv 1994.png|thumb|A screenshot of the arXiv taken in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/physics/blurb/fig3.gif&lt;/ref&gt; using the browser [[Mosaic (web browser)|NCSA Mosaic]]. At the time, [[Form (HTML)|HTML forms]] were a new technology.]]

arXiv was made possible by the low-bandwidth [[TeX]] file format, which allowed scientific papers to be easily transmitted over the [[Internet]] and rendered [[client-side]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=O'Connell|first1=Heath|title=Physicists Thriving with Paperless Publishing |date=2000 |arxiv=physics/0007040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1990, [[Joanne Cohn]] began emailing [[physics]] preprints to colleagues as TeX files, but the number of papers being sent soon filled mailboxes to capacity. [[Paul Ginsparg]] recognized the need for central storage, and in August 1991 he created a central [[Disciplinary repository|repository]] mailbox stored at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] which could be accessed from any computer. Additional modes of access were soon added: [[FTP]] in 1991, [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] in 1992, and the [[World Wide Web]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="dddmag2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ginsparg [http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/35983 "The global-village pioneers"] ''[[Physics World]]'' October 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[e-print]] was quickly adopted to describe the articles.

It began as a physics archive, called the [[LANL]] preprint archive, but soon expanded to include astronomy, mathematics, computer science, [[quantitative biology]] and, most recently, statistics. Its original domain name was &lt;tt&gt;xxx.lanl.gov&lt;/tt&gt;. Due to LANL's lack of interest in the rapidly expanding technology, in 2001 Ginsparg changed institutions to [[Cornell University]] and changed the name of the repository to &lt;tt&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now hosted principally by Cornell, with eight [[mirror website|mirrors]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=arXiv mirror sites|url=https://arxiv.org/servers.html|publisher=arXiv|accessdate=September 25, 2014| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140810055824/http://arxiv.org/help/mirrors| archivedate= August 10, 2014 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its existence was one of the precipitating factors that led to the current movement in [[scientific publishing]] known as [[open access (publishing)|open access]]. [[Mathematician]]s and scientists regularly upload their papers to arXiv.org for worldwide access&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Glanz |title=The World of Science Becomes a Global Village; Archive Opens a New Realm of Research |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/01/science/world-science-becomes-global-village-archive-opens-new-realm-research.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 1, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes for reviews before they are published in [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal|journals]]. Ginsparg was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellowship]] in 2002 for his establishment of arXiv.

The annual budget for arXiv is approximately $826,000 for 2013 to 2017, funded jointly by Cornell University Library, the [[Simons Foundation]] (in both gift and challenge grant forms) and annual fee income from member institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://confluence.cornell.edu/download/attachments/127116484/arXiv+Business+Model.pdf |format=PDF |title=CORNELL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY ARXIV FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS FOR 2013-2017 |date=March 28, 2012 |website=Confluence.cornell.edu |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model arose in 2010, when Cornell sought to broaden the financial funding of the project by asking institutions to make annual voluntary contributions based on the amount of download usage by each institution. Each member institution pledges a five-year funding commitment to support arXiv. Based on institutional usage ranking, the annual fees are set in four tiers from $1,000 to $4,400. Cornell's goal is to raise at least $504,000 per year through membership fees generated by approximately 220 institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://confluence.cornell.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=340900096|title=arXiv Member Institutions (2018) - arXiv public wiki - Dashboard|website=confluence.cornell.edu|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Cornell University Library took overall administrative and financial responsibility for arXiv's operation and development.  Ginsparg was quoted in the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' as saying it "was supposed to be a three-hour tour, not a life sentence".&lt;ref name="CHE 2011"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/the-first-free-research-sharing-site-arxiv-turns-20/32778 | title=The First Free Research-Sharing Site, arXiv, Turns 20 With an Uncertain Future | work=Chronicle of Higher Education | date=August 10, 2011 | accessdate=August 12, 2011 | author=Fischman, Joah}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Ginsparg remains on the &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/help/scientific_ad_board arXiv Scientific Advisory Board] and on the [https://arxiv.org/new/physics.html arXiv Physics Advisory Committee]&lt;/span&gt;.

== Moderation process and endorsement ==
Although arXiv is not [[peer review]]ed, a collection of moderators for each area review the [[Electronic submission|submissions]]; they may recategorize any that are deemed off-topic,&lt;ref name="mckinney"&gt;{{citation|last=McKinney|first=Michelle|title=arXiv.org|journal=Reference Reviews|volume=25|issue=7|year=2011|pages=35–36|doi=10.1108/09504121111168622}}&lt;/ref&gt; or reject submissions that are not scientific papers. The lists of moderators for many sections of arXiv are publicly available,&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/corr/subjectclasses Computing Research Repository Subject Areas and Moderators]; [http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/categories/math Mathematics categories];
[https://arxiv.org/new/stat.html Statistics archive]; [https://arxiv.org/new/q-bio.html Quantitative Biology archive]; [https://arxiv.org/new/physics.html Physics archive]&lt;/ref&gt; but moderators for most of the physics sections remain unlisted.

Additionally, an "endorsement" system was introduced in 2004 as part of an effort to ensure content is relevant and of interest to current research in the specified disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=As we may read|last=Ginsparg|first=Paul|year=2006|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=26|issue=38|pages=9606–9608|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3161-06.2006|pmid=16988030}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the system, for categories that use it, an author must be endorsed by an established arXiv author before being allowed to submit papers to those categories. Endorsers are not asked to review the paper for errors, but to check whether the paper is appropriate for the intended subject area.&lt;ref name="mckinney" /&gt; New authors from recognized academic institutions generally receive automatic endorsement, which in practice means that they do not need to deal with the endorsement system at all.  However, the endorsement system has attracted criticism for allegedly restricting scientific inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics|date=July 2005|volume=44|issue=7|pages=691–692|title=Preface to the Proceedings of Quantum Structures 2002|first1=Richard|last1=Greechie|first2=Sylvia|last2=Pulmannova|first3=Karl|last3=Svozil|doi=10.1007/s10773-005-7053-z|quote=The new endorsement system may contribute to an effective barrier, a digital divide|bibcode = 2005IJTP...44..691G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of the [[e-print]]s are also submitted to [[scientific journal|journals]] for publication, but some work, including some very influential papers, remain purely as e-prints and are never published in a peer-reviewed journal.  A well-known example of the latter is an outline of a proof of [[Thurston's geometrization conjecture]], including the [[Poincaré conjecture]] as a particular case, uploaded by [[Grigori Perelman]] in November 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|author=Perelman, Grisha|title=The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications|eprint = math.DG/0211159|date=November 11, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perelman appears content to forgo the traditional peer-reviewed journal process, stating: "If anybody is interested in my way of solving the problem, it's all there {{bracket|on the arXiv}}{{spnd}}let them go and read about it".&lt;ref&gt;Nadejda Lobastova and Michael Hirst, [http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/maths-genius-living-in-poverty/2006/08/20/1156012411120.html "Maths genius living in poverty"], Sydney Morning Herald, August 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this non-traditional method of publication, other mathematicians recognized this work by offering the [[Fields Medal]] and [[Millennium Prize Problems|Clay Mathematics Millennium Prizes]] to Perelman, both of which he refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/01/AR2010070106247.html|title=Russian mathematician wins $1 million prize, but he appears to be happy with $0|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 2, 2010|first=Marc|last=Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Submission formats ==

Papers can be submitted in any of several formats, including [[LaTeX]], and [[PDF]] printed from a [[word processor]] other than TeX or LaTeX. The [[Electronic submission|submission]] is rejected by the arXiv software if generating the final PDF file fails, if any image file is too large, or if the total size of the submission is too large.  arXiv now allows one to store and modify an incomplete submission, and only finalize the submission when ready. The time stamp on the article is set when the submission is finalized.

== Access ==
The standard access route is through the arXiv.org website or one of several mirrors. Several other interfaces and access routes have also been created by other un-associated organisations. These include the [[University of California, Davis]]'s ''front'', a [[web portal]] that offers additional search functions and a more self-explanatory interface for arXiv.org, and is referred to by some mathematicians as (the) Front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/ |title=Front for the arXiv |publisher=Front.math.ucdavis.edu |date=September 10, 2007 |accessdate=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar function used to be offered by eprintweb.org, launched in September 2006 by the [[Institute of Physics]], and was switched off on June 30, 2014. Carnegie Mellon provides Table&lt;sup&gt;arXiv&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/eager/arxiv/ |title=Table&lt;sup&gt;arXiv&lt;/sup&gt;  |accessdate=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a search engine for tables extracted from arXiv publications.  [[Google Scholar]] and [[Live Search Academic]] (now defunct) can also be used to search for items in arXiv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy Stevens (andy.stevens@iop.org) |url=http://eprintweb.org |title=eprintweb |publisher=eprintweb |accessdate=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full text and author search engine for arXiv is provided by [[Scientillion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.scientillion.com/service/about |title=eprintweb |publisher=eprintweb |accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, researchers can select sub-fields and receive daily e-mailings or [[RSS feed]]s of all submissions in them.

== Copyright status of files ==
Files on arXiv can have a number of different copyright statuses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/help/license |title=arXiv License Information |publisher=Arxiv.org |accessdate=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Some are [[public domain]], in which case they will have a statement saying so.
#Some are available under either the [[Creative Commons]] 3.0 [[Creative Commons licenses|Attribution-ShareAlike license]] or the Creative Commons 3.0 [[Creative Commons licenses|Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike license]].
#Some are copyright to the publisher, but the author has the right to distribute them and has given arXiv a non-exclusive irrevocable license to distribute them.
#Most are copyright to the author, and arXiv has only a non-exclusive irrevocable license to distribute them.

== Controversy ==
While arXiv does contain some dubious e-prints, such as those claiming to refute famous theorems or proving famous conjectures such as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] using only high-school mathematics, they are "surprisingly rare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=this source is 14 years old, when arXiv was only 11 years old|date=February 2016}}  arXiv generally re-classifies these works, e.g. in "General mathematics", rather than deleting them;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/ifaq#7.1 |title=Front: (In)frequently asked questions |publisher=Front.math.ucdavis.edu |accessdate=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, some authors have voiced concern over the lack of transparency

The '''BSSN formalism''' is a [[Scientific formalism#In modern physics|formalism]] of [[general relativity]] that was developed by Thomas W. &lt;u&gt;B&lt;/u&gt;aumgarte, Stuart L. &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;hapiro, Masaru &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;hibata and Takashi &lt;u&gt;N&lt;/u&gt;akamura between 1987 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ksc.re.kr/kcnr/Presentations/26thNR/26thNRJKim.pdf |title=General Relativistic Hydrodynamics Using BSSN formalism |date=2008-07-28 |author=Jinho Kim |publisher=[[Seoul National University]] |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66TbfxEOa?url=http://www.ksc.re.kr/kcnr/Presentations/26thNR/26thNRJKim.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a modification of the [[ADM formalism]] developed during the 1950s.

The ADM formalism is a [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formalism that does not permit stable and long-term numerical simulations. In the BSSN formalism, the ADM equations are modified by introducing auxiliary variables. The formalism has been tested for a long-term evolution of linear gravitational waves and used for a variety of purposes such as simulating the non-linear evolution of [[gravitational wave]]s or the evolution and collision of [[black hole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/listing/bibliography/pram/Masaru_Shibata/ |title=Status of numerical relativity |date=October 2004 |author=Masaru Shibata |publisher=[[Indian Academy of Sciences]] |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=4338837 |title=Formation of black hole and emission of gravitational waves |year=2006 |author=Takashi Nakamura |journal=[[Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Series B]] |volume=82 |issue=9 |pages=311–327 |bibcode=2006PJAB...82..311N |doi=10.2183/pjab.82.311 |pmid=25792793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MetricImperialUSCustomaryUnits.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A baby bottle with measurements in metric, imperial and US customary]]

Both the [[Imperial unit|imperial]] and [[United States customary units|United States customary]] [[systems of measurement]] derive from earlier [[English units|English systems]] used in the Middle Ages, that were the result of a combination of the local [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] units inherited from German tribes and [[Ancient Roman weights and measures|Roman units]] brought by [[William the Conqueror]] after the [[Norman Conquest of England]] in 1066.

Having this shared heritage, the two systems are quite similar, but there are differences. The US customary system is based on English systems of the 18th century, while the Imperial system was defined in 1824, after [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|American independence]].

==Volume==

Volume may be measured either in terms of units of cubic length or with specific volume units. The units of cubic length (the cubic inch, cubic foot, cubic mile, etc.) are the same in the imperial and US customary systems but with the specific units of volume (the [[bushel]], [[gallon]], [[fluid ounce]], etc.) they differ. The US customary system has one set of units for fluids and another set for dry goods. The imperial system has only one set defined independently of and subdivided differently from its US counterparts.

By the end of the eighteenth century various systems of volume measurement were in use throughout the British Empire. Wine was measured with [[English wine cask units|units]] based on the [[wine gallon|Queen Anne's gallon]] of 231 cubic inches (3.785&amp;nbsp;L). Beer was measured with [[English brewery cask units|units]] based on an ale gallon of 282 cubic inches (4.621&amp;nbsp;L). Grain was measured with the [[Winchester measure]] with a gallon of approximately 268.8 cubic inches (one eighth of a Winchester bushel or 4.405&amp;nbsp;L). In 1824 these were replaced with a single system based on the imperial gallon.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Wine gallons, however, continued to be used for tax purposes in the UK until the late 1990s.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Originally defined as the volume of {{convert|10|lb|kg|1|lk=in}} of distilled water (under certain conditions),&lt;ref group=note&gt;The water was to be weighed in air with brass weights with the barometer standing at {{convert|30|inHg|0|lk=in}} at a temperature of {{convert|62|°F|°C|0|lk=in}}. In 1963 these conditions were redefined such that the water was to have a density of {{val|0.998859|u=g/mL}} and to be weighed in air of density {{val|0.001217|u=g/mL}} against weights of density 8.136&amp;nbsp;g/mL.&lt;/ref&gt; then redefined by the [[Weights and Measures Act 1985]] to be exactly {{val|4.54609|u=L}} (277.4&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in), the imperial gallon is close in size to the old ale gallon&lt;!-- 1.6243% smaller --&gt;.

The Winchester measure was made obsolete in the British Empire but remained in use in the US.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Originally defined as the volume of a cylinder {{convert|18+1/2|in}} in diameter and {{convert|8|in}} deep, the Winchester bushel was redefined in the US as {{val|2150.42}} cubic inches.&lt;/ref&gt; The Winchester bushel was replaced with an imperial bushel of 8 imperial gallons.  The subdivisions of the bushel were maintained. As with US dry measures the imperial system divides the bushel into 4 pecks, 8 gallons, 32 quarts or 64 pints. Thus all of these imperial measures are about 3% larger than their US dry measure counterparts.

Fluid measure is not as straightforward. The American colonists adopted a system based on the 231-cubic-inch wine gallon for all fluid purposes. This became the US fluid gallon. Both the imperial and US fluid gallon are divided into 4 quarts, 8 pints or 32 [[Gill (unit)|gills]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;The gill is no longer in common use.&lt;/ref&gt; However, whereas the US gill is divided into 4 US fluid ounces, the imperial gill is divided into 5 imperial fluid ounces. So whilst the imperial gallon, quart, pint and gill are about 20% larger than their US fluid measure counterparts, the fluid ounce is about 4% smaller.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The now rarely used [[apothecaries' system]] of fluid measures further divides the fluid ounce into 8 [[dram (unit)|fluid drams]] or 480 [[minim (unit)|minims]]. Also in the imperial system there is a fluid scruple of 20 minims which is absent from the US customary system. Like the fluid ounce the dram and minim are about 4% smaller in the imperial system.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that one [[avoirdupois|avoirdupois ounce]] of water has an approximate volume of one imperial fluid ounce at 62&amp;nbsp;°F (16.67&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref group=note&gt;160 imperial fluid ounces is equivalent to one imperial gallon, which is the approximate volume of 10 pounds or 160 avoirdupois ounces of water at 62&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;/ref&gt; This convenient fluid-ounce-to-avoirdupois-ounce relation does not exist in the US system.

One noticeable comparison between the imperial system and the US system is between some Canadian and American beer bottles. Many Canadian brewers package beer in a 12-imperial-fluid-ounce bottles, which are 341&amp;nbsp;mL each. American brewers package their beer in 12-US-fluid-ounce bottles, which are 355&amp;nbsp;mL each. This results in the Canadian bottles being labelled as 11.5&amp;nbsp;fl&amp;nbsp;oz in US units when imported into the United States. Because Canadian beer bottles predate the adoption of the Metric System in that country, they are still sold and labelled in Canada as 341&amp;nbsp;mL. Canned beer in Canada is sold and labelled in 355&amp;nbsp;mL cans, and when exported to the US are labelled as 12&amp;nbsp;fl&amp;nbsp;oz.

==Length==
The international [[yard]] is defined as exactly 0.9144 [[metre]]s. This definition was agreed by the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand through the [[international yard and pound]] agreement of 1959.

The US survey [[foot (unit)|foot]] and survey mile have been maintained as separate units for surveying purposes to avoid the accumulation of error that would follow replacing them with the international versions, particularly with [[State Plane Coordinate System]]s. (The choice of unit for [[surveying]] purposes is based on the unit used when the [[Earth ellipsoid|overall framework]] or [[geodetic datum]] for the region was established, so that - for example - much of the former British empire still uses the Clarke foot for surveying.) The US survey foot is defined so that 1 metre is exactly 39.37&amp;nbsp;[[inch]]es, making the international foot of 0.3048&amp;nbsp;metres exactly two parts per million shorter. This is a difference of just over 3.2&amp;nbsp;mm or a little over one eighth of an inch per mile.

The main units of length (inch, foot, yard and international [[mile]]) were the same in the US, though the US rarely uses some of the intermediate units, such as the [[chain (unit)|(surveyor's) chain]] (22&amp;nbsp;yards) and the [[furlong]] (220&amp;nbsp;yards).

At one time the definition of the [[nautical mile]] was based on the sphere whose surface is the same as the Clarke Ellipsoid.  In the US, the full value of 1853.256 metres was used, but in the Commonwealth, this was rounded to 6080&amp;nbsp;feet (1853.184&amp;nbsp;m). These have been replaced by the international version, which rounds the sixtieth part of the 45° to the nearest metre, as 1852 metres.

==Weight and mass==
[[File:English mass units graph.svg|250px|thumbnail|right|Relation of English mass weights to one another]]
Traditionally, both Britain and the US used three different weight systems:  [[troy weight]] for precious metals, [[avoirdupois]] weight for most other purposes and [[apothecaries' weight]] for medicines.  However, apothecaries' weight has now been superseded by the metric system.

One important difference is the widespread use in Britain of the [[stone (weight)|stone]] of 14 pounds ({{val|6.35029318|u=kg}}) for body weight. This unit is not used in the United States, although its influence was seen in the practice, until World War II, of selling [[flour]] by a barrel of 196 pounds (14 stone). Another difference arose when Britain abolished the ''[[troy pound]]'' ({{val|373.2417216|u=g}}) on January 6, 1879, &lt;!-- should this be 1 Jan? It's in Weights and Measures Act of 1878 --&gt;leaving only the ''[[troy ounce]]'' ({{val|31.1034768|u=g}}) and its [[decimal]] subdivisions, whereas the troy pound (of 12 troy ounces) and [[pennyweight]] are still legal in the United States, although no longer widely used.

In all the systems, the fundamental unit is the [[pound (mass)|pound]] (lb), and all other units are defined as fractions or multiples of it. The tables of imperial troy mass and apothecaries' mass are the same as the corresponding United States tables, except for the British spelling "drachm" in the table of apothecaries' mass. The table of imperial avoirdupois mass is the same as the United States table up to 1 pound, but above that point the tables differ.

The imperial system has a hundredweight, defined as eight stone or 112&amp;nbsp;lb ({{val|50.80234544|u=kg}}), whereas a US hundredweight is 100&amp;nbsp;lb ({{val|45.359237|u=kg}}). In both systems, 20 hundredweights make a [[ton]]. In the US, the terms ''[[long ton]]'' ({{val|2240|u=lb}}, {{val|1016.0469088|u=kg}}) and ''[[short ton]]'' ({{val|2000|u=lb}}; {{val|907.18474|u=kg}}) are used to distinguish them. The term ''metric ton'' is also used to denote a [[tonne]] ({{val|1000|u=kg}}, {{val|2204.622|u=lb}}), which is about 2% less than the long ton.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17216">A '''concept inventory''' is a [[criterion-referenced test]] designed to help determine whether a student has an accurate working [[knowledge]] of a specific set of concepts. Historically, concept inventories have been in the form of [[multiple-choice test]]s in order to aid interpretability and facilitate administration in large classes.  Unlike a typical, teacher-authored multiple-choice test, questions and response choices on concept inventories are the subject of extensive research. The aims of the research include ascertaining (a) the range of what individuals think a particular question is asking and (b) the most common responses to the questions. Concept inventories are evaluated to ensure test [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[validity (statistics)|validity]]. In its final form, each question includes one correct answer and several distractors.

Ideally, a score on a criterion-referenced test reflects the amount of content knowledge a student has mastered. Criterion-referenced tests differ from [[norm-referenced tests]] in that (in theory) the former is not used to compare an individual's score to the scores of the group. Ordinarily, the purpose of a criterion-referenced test is to ascertain whether a student mastered a predetermined amount of content knowledge; upon obtaining a test score that is at or above a [[cutscore|cutoff score]], the student can move on to study a body of content knowledge that follows next in a learning sequence. In general, item difficulty values ranging between 30% and 70% are best able to provide information about student understanding.

The distractors are incorrect or irrelevant answers that are usually (but not always) based on students' commonly held misconceptions.&lt;ref&gt;"Development and Validation of Instruments to Measure Learning of Expert-Like Thinking." W. K. Adams &amp; C. E. Wieman, 2010. International Journal of Science Education, 1-24. iFirst, {{doi|10.1080/09500693.2010.512369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Test developers often research student misconceptions by examining students' responses to open-ended essay questions and conducting "think-aloud" interviews with students. The distractors chosen by students help researchers understand student thinking and give instructors insights into students' prior knowledge (and, sometimes, firmly held beliefs).  This foundation in research underlies instrument construction and design, and plays a role in helping educators obtain clues about students' ideas, [[scientific misconceptions]], and [[didaskalogenic]] ("teacher-induced" or "teaching-induced") confusions and conceptual lacunae that interfere with learning.

==Concept inventories in use==
Concept inventories are education-related diagnostic tests.&lt;ref name="Tregust, 1988"&gt;Tregust, D.F. 1988. Development and use of diagnostic tests to evaluate students' misconceptions in science.  International Journal of Science Education 10: 159-169 [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0950069880100204#.VKMeQsZl5FI]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985 Halloun and Hestenes introduced a "multiple-choice mechanics diagnostic test" to examine students' concepts about motion.&lt;ref name="Halloun and Hestenes"&gt;Hallouin, I. A., &amp; Hestenes, D. Common sense concepts about motion (1985). American Journal of Physics, 53, 1043-1055&lt;/ref&gt;  It evaluates student understanding of basic concepts in classical (macroscopic) mechanics. A little later, the [[Force Concept Inventory]] (FCI), another concept inventory, was developed.&lt;ref name="Halloun and Hestenes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hestenes D, Wells M, Swackhamer G 1992 Force concept inventory. The Physics Teacher 30: 141-166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/vsearch/servlet/VerityServlet?KEY=AJPIAS&amp;CURRENT=NO&amp;ONLINE=YES&amp;smode=strresults&amp;sort=rel&amp;maxdisp=25&amp;threshold=0&amp;pjournals=AJPIAS&amp;pyears=2001%2C2000%2C1999&amp;possible1=465&amp;possible1zone=fpage&amp;fromvolume=66&amp;SMODE=strsearch&amp;OUTLOG=NO&amp;viewabs=AJPIAS&amp;key=DISPLAY&amp;docID=1&amp;page=1&amp;chapter=0 Hestenes D 1998. Am. J. Phys. 66:465]&lt;/ref&gt; The FCI was designed to assess student understanding of the [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian]] concepts of force.  Hestenes (1998) found that while "nearly 80% of the [students completing introductory college physics courses] could state [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Third Law]] at the beginning of the course. FCI data showed that less than 15% of them fully understood it at the end".These results have been replicated in a number of studies involving students at a range of institutions (see sources section below).   That said, there remains questions as what exactly the FCI measures.&lt;ref name="Huffman"&gt;Huffman, D. &amp; P. Heller. 1995. What does the force concept inventory actually measure? The Physics Teacher 33: 138-143; Heller, P. &amp; D. Huffman. 1995.[http://www.physics.emory.edu/faculty/weeks//journal/hestenes-tpt95c.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Results from Hake (1998) using the FCI have led to greater recognition in the [[science education]] community of the importance of students' "interactive engagement" with the materials to be mastered.&lt;ref name="Hake"&gt;Hake, R. R. 1998. Interactive-engagement versus traditional methods: a six-thousand-student survey of mechanics test data for introductory physics courses. Am. J. Physics 66, 64-74.[http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp/66/1/10.1119/1.18809]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Hake Plot.JPG|right|thumb|This is a schematic of the Hake plot (see Redish page&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.umd.edu/perg/papers/redish/nas/nas.htm Redish page.

Since the development of the FCI, other physics instruments have been developed. These include the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation developed by Thornton and Sokoloff&lt;ref name="Thornton"&gt;Thornton RK, Sokoloff DR (1998) Assessing student learning of Newton's laws: The Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation and Evaluation of Active Learning Laboratory and Lecture Curricula. .

In many areas, foundational scientific concepts transcend disciplinary boundaries. An example of an inventory that assesses knowledge of such concepts is an instrument developed by  Odom and Barrow (1995) to evaluate understanding of [[diffusion]] and [[osmosis]].&lt;ref name="Odom"&gt;Odom AL, Barrow LH 1995 Development and application of a two-tier diagnostic test measuring college biology students' understanding of diffusion and osmosis after a course of instruction. Journal of Research In Science Teaching 32: 45-61.&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition, there are non-multiple choice conceptual instruments, such as the essay-based approach suggested by Wright et al. (1998)&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;[http://bioliteracy.colorado.edu/Readings/Wright.pdf Wright et al., 1998. J. Chem. Educ. 75: 986-992]&lt;/ref&gt; and the essay and oral exams used by Nehm and Schonfeld (2008).&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"/&gt; and Cooper et al &lt;ref&gt;Cooper, M. M.; Underwood, S.

==Caveats associated with concept inventory use==
Some concept inventories are problematic.  The concepts tested may not be fundamental or important in a particular discipline, the concepts involved may not be explicitly taught in a class or curriculum, or answering a question correctly may require only a superficial understanding of a topic.  It is therefore possible to either over-estimate or under-estimate student content mastery.  While concept inventories designed to identify trends in student thinking may not be useful in monitoring learning gains as a result of pedagogical interventions, disciplinary mastery may not be the variable measured by a particular instrument.  Users should be careful to ensure that concept inventories are actually testing conceptual understanding, rather than test-taking ability, language skills, or other abilities that can influence test performance.

The use of multiple-choice exams as concept inventories is not without controversy.   The very structure of multiple-choice type concept inventories raises questions involving the extent to which complex, and often nuanced situations and ideas must be simplified or clarified to produce unambiguous responses.  For example, a multiple-choice exam designed to assess knowledge of key concepts in natural selection&lt;ref name="AFN"/&gt; does not meet a number of standards of quality control.&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2010"/&gt; One problem with the exam is that the two members of each of several pairs of parallel items, with each pair designed to measure exactly one key concept in natural selection, sometimes have very different levels of difficulty.&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"/&gt; Another problem is that the multiple-choice exam overestimates knowledge of natural selection as reflected in student performance on a diagnostic essay exam and a diagnostic oral exam, two instruments with reasonably good [[construct validity]].&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"/&gt;   Although scoring concept inventories in the form of essay or oral exams is labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to implement with large numbers of students, such exams can offer a more realistic appraisal of the actual levels of students' conceptual mastery as well as their misconceptions.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"/&gt; Recently, however, computer technology has been developed that can [[Automated essay scoring|score essay responses]] on concept inventories in biology and other domains (Nehm, Ha, &amp; Mayfield, 2011),&lt;ref&gt;Nehm, R.H., Ha, M., Mayfield, E.

'''Crystal Palace School of Art, Science, and Literature''', which opened in 1854, was set up by the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Company]] as a new enterprise to occupy part of its buildings when it  re-erected the Crystal Palace in suburban [[Sydenham]] in 1853. Civil engineer and later first director of the [[Royal College of Music]], [[George Grove]] was appointed secretary. It was a part of the great movements for educational and social reform of the nineteenth century.

The main buildings were destroyed by fire in 1936.

The end of the Crystal Palace brings to mind  memories of the School of Engineering which was housed  in the South Tower, fortunately still standing firm as a rock. This school, founded by J. W. Wilson, M.I.M.E., an engineer who helped to build the Great Exhibition of 1851, sent many of its students to the four quarters of the globe. The curriculum of the school included mechanical and civil courses and about five of the circular rooms were used. There was a fitting shop, pattern shop, and drawing office. Those in the mechanical section built a 4 h.p. vertical engine which was generally exhibited at the head of the stairs on the south side of the Palace. In the Civil Engineering section we surveyed the whole of the grounds, and drew plans and made estimates for an imaginary railway which extended from one side to the other. This entailed all the necessary estimates for embankments, a cantilever bridge etc. Then there was the Colonial section presided over by a most congenial superintendent, who had no doubt seen much of a pioneer's life and infused his enthusiasm into those who belonged to his section. Concerning the rigidity of the South Tower, I was working in a high storey soon after joining the school when there was a strong wind, and, feeling giddy, I mentioned it to the superintendent. He informed me that it rocked several inches at the top, which made it safer than absolute rigidity.–Mr F. C. Bell, 74, Berners Street, Ipswich.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Developmentally appropriate practice''' (or DAP) is a perspective within [[early childhood education]] whereby a [[teacher]] or child caregiver nurtures a child's social/emotional, physical, and cognitive development by basing all practices and decisions on (1) theories of [[child development]], (2) individually identified strengths and needs of each child uncovered through [[authentic assessment]], and (3) the child's cultural background as defined by his [[community]], [[family history]], and [[types of family|family structure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bredekamp, V.S.|author2=Copple, C.|last-author-amp=yes  |date=1997 |title=Developmentally Appropriate Practice in Early Childhood Programs |publisher=Washington, DC: NAEYC |url=http://sales.naeyc.org/Itemdetail.aspx?Stock_No=2349&amp;Category= |accessdate=2007-01-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228050845/http://sales.naeyc.org/Itemdetail.aspx?Stock_No=2349&amp;Category= |archivedate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

'''Developmentally Appropriate Practice''' (DAP) is the practice of an excellent educator who knows and changes his/her teaching practices to meet the students where they are developmentally. In order to adjust teaching practices to meet these students' needs, the teacher must research and be educated on child development and a variety of approaches in order to teach the children. Every approach or teaching strategy should be appropriate for the students in the classroom. Teachers can use multiple strategies in one lesson to ensure all children are learning. To ensure each students' needs are being met the educator must know each student and know where he/she is developmentally and what works for him/her. Meeting the students' needs and adjusting the way a skill or concept is being taught does not mean the educator makes the task easier for the student. Instead, the educator challenges the student by setting a goal that is attainable without frustrating the student. Along with adjusting to meet the students where they are developmentally the educator must take into consideration the students' cultural and social contexts. These practices and this knowledge base are a foundation or a starting point for educators as they make decisions in their classrooms.[1]

==Position Statement==

'''The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC)''' wrote a position statement to outline best practices for teachers and educators of all kinds. The position statement was adopted in 2009 and is written solely based on research about child development, child learning, and effective educational practices. Educators have the responsibility to narrow the achievement gap for students who come from all kinds of backgrounds and give them learning opportunities they may not have the ability to experience outside of the school. Giving the child experiences that are both led by them and led by the teacher are important for the child's development and learning. Child-led experiences can come from play, which is an extremely important way to learn and spend time as a child. Children may not have the opportunity at home to have well developed or engaging play where they will learn social skills, cognitive skills, or emotional skills. These are very important skills for children to develop. Teacher-led experiences should be well developed, well thought out, consist of a variety of approaches and be completely focused on the children. This position statement gives educators and teachers guidance and principles to keep in mind in decision making, classroom community, enhancing planning curriculum for development, assessing child development and building relationships with families.[2]

==Developmentally Appropriate Practice in Preschool Years (3-5)==

Children ages 3-5 are referred to as preschoolers. The preschool years are a vitally important period of learning and development in all areas of human functioning- physical, social and emotional, cognitive (including perception, reasoning, memory, and other aspects of academic and intellectual development), and language. It is also established that best development and learning during these years is most likely to occur when children establish positive and caring relationships with adults and other children; receive carefully planned, intentional adult guidance and assistance; and explore interesting environments with many things to do and learn.

Early childhood teachers, in collaboration with families, are responsible for ensuring that that program promotes the development and enhances the learning of each individual child served; in other words, professionals must ensure that the program is developmentally appropriate. Ensuring this requires that teachers have a great deal of knowledge, skill, and training. Children entering preschool vary significantly in what they know and can do.

Considerable growth and change occur in children during the preschool years in all areas of development. To function most effectively, preschool teachers need to know about the goals, sequences, and trajectories of development in all of those areas- to avoid a scaled-down version of curriculum intended for older children and to understand the importance of communicating with kindergarten and other teachers and aligning the curriculum accordingly.

Three-year-olds are no longer toddlers, but they behave like toddlers at times, and they are not steady in their gains. Children's social skills are still uncertain, they are still working on how to regulate and appropriately express their emotions, and they are not yet able to communicate their ideas and feelings in skilled, complex ways. They believe in fairies and monsters and have trouble with logical sequences that seem basic to adults- which is why adults tend to underestimate their abilities. Yet at other times, their language ability, motor skills, reasoning abilities, and other behaviors make them seem older than they are.

The challenge for the preschool teacher is to maintain appropriate expectations, providing each child with the right amount of challenge, support, sensitivity, and stimulation that promotes development and learning- all of which can only happen within the context of a close, nurturing teacher-child relationship.

Preschoolers revel in their increasing coordination, using their bodies cheerfully and enthusiastically. They thrive in environments that encourage them to experiment with new materials, roles, and ideas through various projects and especially through play. They have great interest in feelings and are better able to express and label their emotions and identify others' emotions. They make some important gains in cognition, allowing them the pleasure of representing their world in pretend play, symbols, objects, drawings, and words. And, given a rich language environment, they show impressive gains in language skills.

Preschoolers are an enchanting, enthusiastic, curious, and inherently playful and imaginative bunch, providing the adults who work with them entry to a world of great charm and delight!

==Developmentally Appropriate Practice in the Kindergarten Year (5-6 y/o)==

In the Kindergarten Year, children are 5-6 years old, learning through play, community, and social interaction with peers. As a kindergarten teacher it is developmentally appropriate to be modeling positive social interactions in the classroom, fostering positive relationships between students of different cultures and ethnicities, give children leadership roles in the classroom, and teach in whole and small group settings, with peer interaction during instruction. It is important in this year that children spend the majority of the day moving, with little time sitting down and still. They should be working and developing their fine and gross motor skills through this daily movement. Children should also be spending time playing outside everyday, with a regular physical education schedule.

In kindergarten children should be learning body and spatial awareness, as well as key movements like balancing, jumping and catching objects of varied size. Children should have time daily to exercise their fine motor skills, such as through writing with utensils of varied size, using scissors, play dough, puzzles, etc. Along with physical development, kindergarten is a time when students should be developing self-help skills, which should be promoted by teachers through giving students daily activities that teach them to care for themselves. These activities would look like washing their hands, putting on jackets and cleaning up after their own classroom activity.

Teachers should be giving regular time in the classroom for students to be conversing with others, and working in small groups on projects that teach communication, listening and understanding skills. Teachers should provide opportunities for students to verbally respond to questions, describe scenarios, retell stories, and give directions. It is important that English Second Language students are integrated and involved in these discussions and peer work time, in order to develop their listening, speaking and understanding skills.

Academically students should be introducing phonological and phonemic awareness by implementing songs, poems, books, etc. Students should have books read to them on a daily basis. Books should be available in a classroom library at all times and contain a variety of story types. It is appropriate at this age that students be taught the sounds of letters, and writing should be encouraged throughout. Math is taught through manipulatives, block play, games, etc., and at this age it is natural for students to begin to try and make sense of the world through mathematics. Science is based off students natural curiosity and experiences. Science should be a hands on activity.

Technology should be integrated into the classroom through computers, and any other available technology in the classroom, but should foster problem solving and thinking, and by teachers to document children.

Copple, C. &amp; Bredekamp, S. (2009). Developmentally appropriate practice in early childhood programs: Serving children from birth through age 8. 3d ed. Washington, DC: National Association for the Education of Young Children.

==Developmentally Appropriate Practice in Primary Grades (6-8)==

During the early grades, children gain increasing mastery in every area, both in their development and their learning. The exploring, problem solving, communicating, etc. that children do during this time period enthuses and interests them, which teachers can use at this age to create a lifelong love for learning. In order for primary children to prosper, they need warm and sensitive teaching, integrated learning, authentic assessment, and a mix of child and teacher-guided activities.

During the primary grades, it is essential for children to learn how to read. It, however, is equally important that the children develop the desire to read. This sets the tone for almost everything in the classroom and, most often times, determines what type of student the child will be. Teacher's build such enthusiasm by showing interest in each individual child's needs and show genuine excitement for their learning. Teachers should provide a variety of ways for students to learn being that every individual learns in their own way. This will encourage student effort, despite the type of learner the child is.

Physically, children in the primary grades grow around 2-3 inches in height, with their face maturing a good bit as well. It is during this time that the child's face starts to elongate to accommodate permanent teeth. The child's major gross motor skills have typically developed by this time. As far as fine motor skills, some children have started to develop them by this age, while some are still refining these skills.

Socially, primary aged children need an atmosphere characterized by good conversation, laughter, and excitement over accomplishments. It is important that a teacher creates this type of atmosphere in the classroom in order to promote what is developmentally appropriate for these grade levels.

As far as emotionally, children in the primary grades are largely guided by their emotions and they are the main force guiding behavior as well as learning from infancy through adulthood. The ability to infer other's thoughts, feelings, and intentions is a key component to help kids develop and maintain relationships. It is during the primary grades that students become increasingly able to consider the feelings and emotions of others.

Cognitively, primary aged children are making great strides. A significant, yet gradual, change occurs in most children between the ages of five and seven. This being because they become able to think about things more dimensionally, which allows them to solve a wider range of problems. Due to this cognitive growth, children in the primary grades enjoy challenges that test their growing skills. That is, as long as they are able to experience success following these challenges. This is something that teachers should keep in mind in the primary grades when they are creating material.

As far as language goes, children experience a drastic growth in the primary grades following the already substantial growth that happens in the preschool years. It is during this time period that children start to develop actual writing and reading skills, as opposed to the preschool and kindergarten years where listening, speaking, and reading skills are only just emerging.

[[File:Galileos Dialogue Title Page.png|thumb|300px|right|Frontispiece and title page of the ''Dialogue'', 1632]]
The '''''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems''''' (''Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo'') is a 1632 [[Italian-language]] book by [[Galileo Galilei]] comparing the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] system with the traditional [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] system. It was translated into Latin as ''Systema cosmicum''&lt;ref&gt;Maurice A. Finocchiaro: [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVMy7yoGbdIC&amp;pg=PA61 ''Retrying Galileo, 1633-1992''], University of California Press, 2007 {{ISBN|0-520-25387-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-520-25387-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-en|Cosmic System}}) in 1635 by [[Matthias Bernegger]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSe6AAAAIAAJ Journal for the history of astronomy, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was dedicated to Galileo's patron, [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], who received the first printed copy on February 22, 1632.&lt;ref name="Gindikin1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gindikin|first=Semen Grigorʹevich|title=Tales of physicists and mathematicians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vhx--jfFN8IC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=22 February 2011|year=1988|publisher=[[Birkhäuser]]|isbn=978-0-8176-3317-2|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]], the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun, while in the [[Ptolemaic system]], everything in the Universe circles around the Earth. The ''Dialogue'' was published in [[Florence]] under a formal license from the [[Inquisition]]. In 1633, Galileo was found to be "vehemently suspect of [[heresy]]" based on the book, which was then placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Forbidden Books]]'', from which it was not removed until 1835 (after the theories it discussed had been permitted in print in 1822).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/galileo/galileochronology.html The Trial of Galileo: A Chronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205213233/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/galileo/galileochronology.html |date=2007-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an action that was not announced at the time, the publication of anything else he had written or ever might write was also banned in Catholic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|_note-publication-ban}}See [[Galileo affair#note-publication-ban|Galileo affair]] for more details, including sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
While writing the book, Galileo referred to it as his ''Dialogue on the Tides'', and  when the manuscript went to the Inquisition for approval, the title was ''Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea''. He was ordered to remove all mention of tides from the title and to change the preface because granting approval to such a title would look like approval of his theory of the [[tide]]s using the motion of the Earth as proof. As a result, the formal title on the title page is ''Dialogue'', which is followed by Galileo's name, academic posts, and followed by a long subtitle. The name by which the work is now known was extracted by the printer from the description on the title page when permission was given to reprint it with an approved preface by a Catholic theologian in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Galileo: Pioneer Scientist|first=Stillman|last=Drake|year=1990|page=187|publisher=U of Toronto Press |isbn=0-8020-2725-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This must be kept in mind when discussing Galileo's motives for writing the book. Although the book is presented formally as a consideration of both systems (as it needed to be in order to be published at all), there is no question that the Copernican side gets the better of the argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sleepwalkers|first=Arthur|last=Koestler|page=480|publisher=Penguin Arkana|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
The book is presented as a series of discussions, over a span of four days, among two philosophers and a layman:

* Salviati argues for the Copernican position and presents some of Galileo's views directly, calling him the "Academician" in honor of Galileo's membership in the [[Accademia dei Lincei]]. He is named after Galileo's friend [[Filippo Salviati]] (1582–1614).
* Sagredo is an intelligent layman who is initially neutral. He is named after Galileo's friend [[Giovanni Francesco Sagredo]] (1571–1620).
* Simplicio, a dedicated follower of [[Ptolemy]] and [[Aristotle]], presents the traditional views and the arguments against the Copernican position.  He is supposedly named after [[Simplicius of Cilicia]], a sixth-century commentator on Aristotle, but it was suspected the name was a double entendre, as the Italian for "simple" (as in "simple minded") is "semplice".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Koestler, ''The Sleepwalkers: A History of Man's Changing Vision of the Universe'' (1959), Penguin Books, 1986 edition: {{ISBN|0-14-055212-X}}, 978014055212X 1990 reprint: {{ISBN|0-14-019246-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-14-019246-9}} [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0140192468]&lt;/ref&gt;  Simplicio is modeled on two contemporary conservative philosophers, [[Lodovico delle Colombe]] (1565–1616?), Galileo's opponent, and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]] (1550–1631), a Paduan colleague who had refused to look through the telescope.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman Drake: ''Galileo at Work: His Scientific Biography'', Courier Dover Publications, 2003, {{ISBN|0-486-49542-6}}, page 355 : Cremonini and delle Colombe&lt;/ref&gt; Colombe was the leader of a group of Florentine opponents of Galileo's, which some of the latter's friends referred to as "the pigeon league".&lt;ref&gt;"La legha del pippione". "Pippione" is a pun on Colombe's surname—which is the plural of the Italian word for dove. Galileo's friends, the painter, [[:it:Cigoli|Lodovico Cardi da Cigoli]] {{it icon}}, his former student, [[Benedetto Castelli]], and a couple of his other correspondents often referred to Colombe as "il Colombo", which means "the Pigeon".  Galileo himself used this term a couple of times in a letter to Cigoli of October, 1611 [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-214 (Edizione Nazionale 11:214)]. The more derisive nickname, "il Pippione", sometimes used by Cigoli [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-176 (Edizione Nazionale 11:176,] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-229 11:229,] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-476 11:476,][http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-502 11:502)], is a now archaic Italian word with a triple entendre.   Besides meaning "young pigeon", it is also a jocular term for a testicle, and a Tuscan dialect word for a fool.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content===
The discussion is not narrowly limited to astronomical topics, but ranges over much of contemporary science. Some of this is to show what Galileo considered good science, such as the discussion of [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]'s work on magnetism.  Other parts are important to the debate, answering erroneous arguments against the Earth's motion.

A classic argument against earth motion is the lack of speed sensations of the earth surface, though it moves, by the earth's rotation, at about 1700&amp;nbsp;km/h at the equator. In this category there is a [[thought experiment]] in which a man is below decks on a [[Galileo's ship|ship]] and cannot tell whether the ship is docked or is moving smoothly through the water: he observes water dripping from a bottle, fish swimming in a tank, butterflies flying, and so on; and their behavior is just the same whether the ship is moving or not.   This is a classic exposition of the [[Inertial frame of reference]] and refutes the objection that if we were moving hundreds of kilometres an hour as the Earth rotated, anything that one dropped would rapidly fall behind and drift to the west.

The bulk of Galileo's arguments may be divided into three classes:

* Rebuttals to the objections raised by traditional philosophers; for example, the thought experiment on the ship.
* Observations that are incompatible with the Ptolemaic model: the [[phases of Venus]], for instance, which simply couldn't happen, or the apparent motions of [[sunspot]]s, which could only be explained in the Ptolemaic or Tychonic systems as resulting from an implausibly complicated precession of the Sun's axis of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, [[#Reference-Drake-1970|(1970]], pp.191–196), Linton [[#Reference-Linton-2004|(2004]], pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B4br4XJFj0MC&amp;pg=PA211 211–12)], Sharratt [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|(1994]], p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-TgYAq3P0P8C&amp;pg=PA166 166)].  This is not true, however, for geocentric systems—such as that proposed by [[Longomontanus]]—in which the Earth rotated.  In such systems the apparent motion of sunspots could be accounted for just as easily as in Copernicus's.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arguments showing that the elegant unified theory of the Heavens that the philosophers held, which was believed to prove that the Earth was stationary, was incorrect; for instance, the mountains of the [[Moon]], the moons of [[Jupiter]], and the very existence of sunspots, none of which was part of the old astronomy.

Generally, these arguments have held up well in terms of the knowledge of the next four centuries.  Just how convincing they ought to have been to an impartial reader in 1632 remains a contentious issue.

Galileo attempted a fourth class of argument:

* Direct physical argument for the Earth's motion, by means of an explanation of tides.

As an account of the causation of tides or a proof of the Earth's motion, it is a failure. The fundamental argument is internally inconsistent and actually leads to the conclusion that tides do not exist. But, Galileo was fond of the argument and devoted the "Fourth Day" of the discussion to it. The degree of its failure is—like nearly anything having to do with Galileo—a matter of controversy.  On the one hand, the whole thing has recently been described in print as "cockamamie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Science, Religion, and the Galileo Affair |author=Timothy Moy |date=September 2001 |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |url=http://csicop.org/si/2001-09// |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=43–49 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129142753/http://csicop.org/si/2001-09// |archivedate=January 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] used a rather different description:

[[File:Dialogo Galileo SWRI.jpg|thumb|250px|A copy of the ''Dialogo'', Florence edition, located at the [[Tom Slick]] rare book collection at [[Southwest Research Institute]], in [[Texas]].]]
The ''Dialogue'' does not treat the [[Tychonic system]], which was becoming the preferred system of many astronomers at the time of publication and which was ultimately proven incorrect.  The Tychonic system is a motionless Earth system but not a Ptolemaic system;  it is a hybrid system of the Copernican and Ptolemaic models.  Mercury and Venus orbit the Sun (as in the Copernican system) in small circles, while the sun in turn orbits a stationary Earth;  Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn orbit the Sun in much larger circles, which means they also orbit the earth.  The Tychonian system is mathematically equivalent to the Copernican system, except that the Copernican system predicts a [[Stelaar parralax|stellar parallax]], while the Tychonian system predicts no stellar parallax.  Stellar parallax was not measurable until the 19th century, and therefore there was at the time no valid disproof of the Tychonic system on empirical grounds, nor any decisive observational evidence for the Copernican system.

Galileo never took Tycho's system seriously, as can be seen in his correspondence, regarding it as an inadequate and physically unsatisfactory compromise.  A reason for the absence of Tycho's system (in spite of many references to Tycho and his work in the book) may be sought in Galileo's theory of the tides, which provided the original title and organizing principle of the ''Dialogue''.  For, while the Copernican and Tychonic systems are equivalent geometrically, they are quite different dynamically. Galileo's tidal theory entailed the actual, physical movement of the Earth; that is, if true, it would have provided the kind of proof that [[Foucault pendulum|Foucault's pendulum]] apparently provided two centuries later.  With reference to Galileo's tidal theory, there would be no difference between the Ptolemaic and Tychonic systems.

Galileo also fails to discuss the possibility of non-circular orbits, although [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler's]] proposal of an elliptical orbit for Mars had been published in 1609. Prince Cesi's letter to Galileo of 1612 treated the two laws of 1609 as common knowledge. Kepler's third law was published in 1619. A heliocentric system with planets in approximately elliptical orbits is deducible from [[Isaac Newton#Mechanics and gravitation|Newton's laws of motion and gravity]], but these were not published until 1687.

==Summary==
'''Preface: To the Discerning Reader'''
refers to the ban on the "Pythagorean opinion that the earth moves" and says that the author "takes the Copernican side with a pure mathematical hypothesis". He introduces the friends [[Giovanni Francesco Sagredo|Sagredo]] and [[Filippo Salviati|Salviati]] with whom he had had discussions as well as the [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] philosopher [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicio]].

===Day one===

He starts with Aristotle's proof of the completeness and perfection of the world (i.e. the universe) because of its three dimensions. Simplicio points out that three was favoured by the Pythagoreans whereas Salviati can't understand why three legs are better than two or four. He suggests that the numbers were "trifles which later spread among the vulgar" and that their definitions, such as those of straight lines and right angles, were more useful in establishing the dimensions. Simplicio's response was that Aristotle thought that in physical matters mathematical demonstration wasn't always needed. 

Salviati attacks Aristotle's definition of the heavens as incorruptible and unchanging whilst only the lunar-bound zone shows change. He points to the changes seen in the skies: the new stars of [[SN 1572|1572]] and [[Kepler's Supernova|1604]] and [[Sunspot#17th and 18th centuries|sunspots]], seen through the new [[telescope]]. There is a discussion about Aristotle's use of ''a priori'' arguments. Salviati suggests that he uses his experience to choose an appropriate argument to prove just as others do and that he would change his mind in the present circumstances.

Simplicio argues that sunspots could simply be small opaque objects passing in front of the sun, but Salviati points out that some appear or disappear randomly and those at the edge are flattened, unlike separate bodies. Therefore, "it is better Aristotelian philosophy to say 'Heaven is alterable because my senses tell me' than 'Heaven is unalterable because Aristotle was so persuaded by reasoning'".

Experiments with a mirror are used to show that the moon's surface must be opaque and not a perfect crystal sphere as Simplicio believes. He  refuses to accept that mountains on the moon cause shadows, or that reflected light from the earth is responsible for the faint outline in a crescent moon.

Sagredo holds that he considers the earth noble because of the changes in it whereas Simplicio says that change in the moon or stars would be useless because they do not benefit man. Salviati points out that days on the moon are a month long and despite the varied terrain that the telescope has disclosed, it wouldn't sustain life. Humans acquire mathematical truths slowly and hesitantly, whereas God knows the full infinity of them intuitively. And when one looks into the marvellous things men have understood and contrived, then clearly the human mind is one of the most excellent of God's works.

===Day two===

Salviati starts by repeating that Aristotle would be changing his opinions if he saw what they were seeing. "It is the followers of Aristotle who have crowned him with authority, not he who has usurped or appropriated it to himself."

There is one supreme motion—that by which the sun, moon, planets and fixed stars appear to be moved from east to west in the space of 24 hours. This may as logically belong to the earth alone as to the rest of the universe. Aristotle and Ptolemy, who understood this, do not argue against any other motion than this diurnal one.

Motion is relative: the position of the sacks of grain on a ship can be identical at the end of the voyage despite the movement of the ship. Why should we believe that nature moves all these extremely large bodies with inconceivable velocities rather than simply moving the moderately sized earth? If the earth is removed from the picture, what happens to all the movement?

The movement of the skies from east to west is the opposite of all the other motions of the heavenly bodies which are from west to east; making the earth rotate brings it into line with all the others. Although Aristotle argues that circular motions are not contraries, they could still lead to collisions.

The great orbits of the planets take longer than the shorter: Saturn and Jupiter take many years, Mars two, whereas the moon takes only a month. Jupiter's moons take even less. This is not changed if the earth rotates every day, but if the earth is stationary then we suddenly find that the sphere of the fixed stars rotates in 24 hours. Given the distances, that would more reasonably be thousands of years.

In addition some of these stars have to travel faster than others: if the Pole Star was precisely at the axis, then it would be entirely stationary whereas those of the equator have unimaginable speed. The solidity of this supposed sphere is incomprehensible. Make the earth the [[primum mobile]] and the need for this extra sphere disappears.

[[File:Dialogue-day2-9.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Actual path of cannonball B is from C to D]]
They consider three main objections to the motion of the earth: that a falling body would be left behind by the earth and thus fall far to the west of its point of release; that a cannonball fired to the west would similarly fly much further than one fired to the east; and that a cannonball fired vertically would also land far to the west. Salviati shows that these do not take account of the [[Theory of impetus|impetus]] of the cannon.

He also points out that attempting to prove that the earth doesn't move by using vertical fall commits the logical fault of [[paralogism]] (assuming what is to be proved), because if the earth is moving then it is only in appearance that it is falling vertically; in fact it is falling at a slant, as happens with a cannonball rising through the cannon (illustrated).

In rebutting a work which claims that a ball falling from the moon would take six days to arrive, the odd-number rule is introduced: a body falling 1 unit in an interval would fall 3 units in the next interval, 5 units in the subsequent one, etc. This gives rise to the rule by which the distance fallen is according to the square of the time. Using this he calculates the time is really little more than 3 hours. He also points out that density of the material doesn't make much difference: a lead ball might only accelerate twice as fast as one of cork.

In fact, a ball falling from such a height wouldn't fall behind but ahead of the vertical because the rotational motion would be in ever-decreasing circles. What makes the earth move is similar to whatever moves Mars or Jupiter and is the same as that which pulls the stone to earth. Calling it [[gravity]] doesn't explain what it is.

===Day three===

Salviati starts by dismissing the arguments of a book against the [[nova]]s he has been reading overnight.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|first=Scipio|last=Chiaramonti|title=De tribus novis stellis|year=1628}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike comets, these were stationary and their lack of parallax easily checked and thus could not have been in the sublunary sphere.

Simplicio now gives the greatest argument against the annual motion of the earth that if it moves then it can no longer be the center of the zodiac, the world. Aristotle gives proofs that the universe is finite bounded and spherical. Salvatius points out that these disappear if he denies him the assumption that it is movable, but allows the assumption initially in order not to multiply disputes.

[[File:Dialogue-day3-1.png|thumb|right|The solar system]]
He points out that if anything is the centre, it must be the sun not the earth, because all the planets are closer or further away from the earth at different times, Venus and Mars up to eight times. He encourages Simplicio to make a plan of the planets, starting with Venus and Mercury which are easily seen to rotate about the sun. Mars must also go about the sun (as well as the earth) since it is never seen [[Crescent|horned]], unlike Venus now seen through the telescope; similarly with Jupiter and Saturn. Earth, which is between Mars with a period of two years and Venus with nine months, has a period of a year which may more elegantly be attributed to motion than a state of rest.

Sagredo brings up two other common objections. If the earth rotated, the mountains would soon be in a position that one would have to descend them rather than ascend.  Secondly, the motion would be so rapid that someone at the bottom of a well would have only a brief instance to glimpse a star as it traversed. Simplicio can see that the first is no different from travelling over the globe, as any who have circumnavigated but though he realises the second is the same as if the heavens were rotating, he still doesn't understand it. Salviati says the first is no different from those who deny the antipodes. For the second, he encourages Simplicio to decide what fraction of the sky can be seen from down the well.

Salviati brings up another problem, which is that Mars and Venus are not as variable as the theory would suggest. He explains that the size of a star to the human eye is affected by the brightness and the sizes are not real. This is resolved by use of the telescope which also shows the crescent shape of Venus. A further objection to the movement of the earth, the unique existence of the moon, has been resolved by the discovery of the [[moons of Jupiter]], which would appear like our moon to any Jovian.

[[File:Dialogue-day3-2.png|thumb|right|How retrogression is explained by Copernicus]]
Copernicus has succeeded in reducing some of the uneven motions of Ptolemy who had to deal with motions that sometimes go fast, sometimes slow, and sometimes backwards, by means of vast [[epicycle]]s. Mars, above the sun's sphere, often falls far below it, then soars above it. These anomalies are cured by the annual movement of the earth. This is explained by a diagram in which the varying motion of Jupiter is shown using the earth's orbit.

Simplicio produces another booklet in which theological arguments are mixed with astronomic, but Salviati refuses to address the issues from Scripture. So he produces the argument that the fixed stars must be at an inconceivable distance with the smallest larger than the whole orbit of the earth. Salviati explains that this all comes from a misrepresentation of what Copernicus said, resulting in a huge over-calculation of the size of a sixth magnitude star. But many other famous astronomers over-estimated the size of stars by ignoring the brightness factor. Not even Tycho, with his accurate instruments, set himself to measure the size of any star except the sun and moon. But Salviati (Galileo) was able to make a reasonable estimate simply by hanging a cord to obscure the star and measuring the distance from eye to cord.

But still many cannot believe that the fixed stars can individually be as big or bigger than the sun. To what end are these? Salviati maintains that "it is brash for our feebleness to attempt to judge the reasons for God's actions, and to call everything in the universe vain and superfluous which does not serve us".

Has Tycho or any of his disciples tried to investigate in any way phenomena that might affirm or deny the movement of the earth? Do any of them know how much [[Variation (astronomy)|variation]] is needed in the fixed stars? Simplicio objects to conceding that the distance of the fixed stars is too great for it to be detectable. Salviati points out how difficult it is even to detect the varying distances of Saturn. Many of the positions of the fixed stars are not known accurately and far better instruments than Tycho's are needed: say using a sight with a fixed position 60 miles away.

Sagredo then asks Salviati to explain how the Copernican system explains the seasons and inequalities of night and day. This he does with the aid of a diagram showing the position of the earth in the four seasons. He points out how much simpler it is than the Ptolemaic system. But Simplicio thinks Aristotle was wise to avoid too much geometry. He prefers Aristotle's axiom to avoid more than one simple motion at a time.

===Day four===

They are in Sagredo's house in [[Venice]], where tides are an important issue, and Salviati wants to show the effect of the earth's movement on the tides. He first points out the three periods of the tides: ''daily (diurnal)'', generally with intervals of 6 hours of rising and six more of falling; ''monthly'', seemingly from the moon, which increases or decreases these tides; and ''annual'', leading to different sizes at the equinoxes.

He considers first the daily motion. Three varieties are observed: in some places the waters rise and fall without any forward motion; in others they move towards the east and back to the west without rising or falling; in still others there is a combination of both—this happens in Venice where the waters rise on entering and fall on leaving. In the [[Straits of Messina]] there are very swift currents between [[Scylla and Charybdis]]. In the open [[Mediterranean]] the alteration of height is small but the currents are noticeable.

Simplicio counters with the [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] explanations, which are based on the depths of the sea, and the dominion of the moon over the water, though this doesn't explain the risings when the moon is below the horizon. But he admits it could be a miracle.

When the water in Venice rises, where does it come from? There is little rise in Corfu or Dubrovnik. From the ocean through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]]? It's much too far away and the currents are too slow.

So could the movement of the container cause the disturbance? Consider the  barges that bring water into Venice. When they hit an obstacle, the water rushes forward; when they speed up it will go to the back. For all this disturbance there is no need for new water and the level in the middle stays largely constant though the water there rushes backwards and forwards.

Consider a point on the earth under the joint action of the annual and diurnal movements. At one time these are added together and 12 hours later they act against each other, so there is an alternate speeding up and slowing down. So the ocean basins are affected in the same way as the barge particularly in an east-west direction. Note also that the length of the barge makes a difference to the speed of oscillations, just as the length of a plumb bob changes its speed. The depth of water also makes a difference to the size of vibrations.

The primary effect only explains tides once a day; one must look elsewhere for the six-hour change, to the oscillation periods of the water. In some places, such as the [[Hellespont]] and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] the periods are briefer and variable. But a north-south sea like the [[Red Sea]] has very little tide whereas the Messina Strait carries the pent up effect of two basins.

Simplicio objects that if this accounts for the water, should it not even more be seen in the winds? Salviati suggests that the containing basins are not so effective and the air does not sustain its motion. Nevertheless, these forces are seen by the [[Trade wind|steady winds]] from east to west in the oceans in the [[torrid zone]].

It seems that the moon also is taking part in the production of the daily effects, but that is repugnant to his mind. The motions of the moon have caused great difficulty to astronomers. It's impossible to make a full account of these things given the irregular nature of the sea basins.

Although Shen was previously a highly renowned government official and military general, he compiled this enormous written work while virtually isolated on his lavish garden [[Estate (house)|estate]] near modern-day [[Zhenjiang]], [[Jiangsu]] province. He named the book after the name he gave to his estate, the "Dream Brook". The literal translated meaning is ''Brush Talks from a Dream Brook'', and Shen Kuo is quoted as saying:&lt;ref&gt;in his biography in the ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography'' (New York 1970–1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|Because I had only my [[writing brush]] and [[ink slab]] to converse with, I call it ''Brush Talks''.}}

== History ==

As the historian Chen Dengyuan points out, much of Shen Kuo's written work was probably purged under the leadership of minister [[Cai Jing]] (1046–1126).&lt;ref name="sivin III 44"&gt;Sivin, III, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, only six of Shen's books remain, and four of these have been significantly altered since the time they were penned by the author.&lt;ref name="sivin III 44 45"&gt;Sivin, III, 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dream Pool Essays'' was first quoted in a Chinese written work of 1095 AD, showing that even towards the end of Shen's life his final book was becoming widely printed.&lt;ref name="sivin III 45" /&gt; The book was originally 30 chapters long, yet an unknown Chinese author's edition of 1166 AD edited and reorganized the work into 26 chapters.&lt;ref name="sivin III 45"&gt;Sivin, III, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; There is one surviving copy of this 1166 edition housed now in Japan, while a Chinese reprint was produced in 1305 as well.&lt;ref name="sivin III 45" /&gt; In 1631 another edition was printed, but it was heavily reorganized into three broad chapters.&lt;ref name="sivin III 45" /&gt;

== Quotes ==

=== Geological theory ===

With Shen's writings on [[fossil]]s, [[geomorphology]], and shifting [[geographical]] [[climate]]s, he states in the following passages:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the Zhi-ping [[Chinese era name|reign period]] [1064–67 AD] a man of Zezhou was digging a well in his garden, and unearthed something shaped like a squirming serpent, or dragon. He was so frightened by it that he dared not touch it, but after some time, seeing that it did not move, he examined it and found it to be stone. The ignorant country people smashed it, but Zheng Boshun, who was magistrate of [[Jincheng]] at the time, got hold of a large piece of it on which scale-like markings were to be seen exactly like those on a living creature. Thus a serpent or some kind of [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] snake (''chhen'') had certainly been turned to stone, as happens with the 'stone-crabs'.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 618"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 618.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chan 15"&gt;Chan, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In recent years [cca. 1080] there was a landslide on the bank of a large river in Yong-ning Guan near Yanzhou. The bank collapsed, opening a space of several dozens of feet, and under the ground a forest of bamboo shoots was thus revealed. It contained several hundred [[bamboo]] with their roots and trunks all complete, and all turned to stone...Now bamboos do not grow in Yanzhou. These were several dozens of feet below the present surface of the ground, and we do not know in what dynasty they could possibly have grown. Perhaps in very ancient times the climate was different so that the place was low, damp, gloomy, and suitable for bamboos. On the Jin-hua Shan in [[Wuzhou]] there are stone pine-cones, and stones formed from peach kernels, stone bulrush roots, stone fishes, crabs, and so on, but as these are all (modern) native products of that place, people are not very surprised at them. But these petrified bamboos appeared under the ground so deep, though they are not produced in that place today. This is a very strange thing.&lt;ref name="chan 15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 614"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 614.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Astronomy===

When the Director of the Astronomical [[Observatory]] asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the sun and moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained his reasoning for the former:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If they were like balls they would surely obstruct each other when they met. I replied that these celestial bodies were certainly like balls. How do we know this? By the waxing and waning of the moon. The moon itself gives forth no light, but is like a ball of silver; the light is the light of the sun (reflected). When the brightness is first seen, the sun(-light passes almost) alongside, so the side only is illuminated and looks like a crescent. When the sun gradually gets further away, the light shines slanting, and the moon is full, round like a bullet. If half of a sphere is covered with (white) powder and looked at from the side, the covered part will look like a crescent; if looked at from the front, it will appear round. Thus we know that the celestial bodies are spherical.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 415 416" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the director of the astronomical observatory asked Shen Kuo why eclipses occurred only on an occasional basis while in conjunction and opposition once a day, Shen Kuo wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I answered that the ecliptic and the moon's path are like two rings, lying one over the other, but distant by a small amount. (If this obliquity did not exist), the sun would be eclipsed whenever the two bodies were in conjunction, and the moon would be eclipsed whenever they were exactly in position. But (in fact) though they may occupy the same degree, the two paths are not (always) near (each other), and so naturally the bodies do not (intrude) upon one another.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 415 416"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 415–416.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the use of the sighting tube to fix the position of the [[pole star]], Shen Kuo wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Before [[Han dynasty|Han times]] it was believed that the pole star was in the center of the sky, so it was called Jixing (Summit star). [[Zu Geng (mathematician)|Zu Geng(-zhi)]] found out with the help of the sighting tube that the point in the sky which really does not move was a little more than 1 degree away from the summit star. In the Xining reign-period (1068–1077) I accepted the order of the emperor to take charge of the Bureau of the [[Chinese calendar|Calendar]]. I then tried to find the true pole by means of the tube. On the very first night I noticed that the star which could be seen through the tube moved after a while outside the field of view. I realized, therefore, that the tube was too small, so I increased the size of the tube by stages. After three months' trials I adjusted it so that the star would go round and round within the field of view without disappearing. In this way I found that the pole star was distant from the true pole somewhat more than 3 degrees. We used to make the diagrams of the field, plotting the positions of the star from the time when it entered the field of view, observing after nightfall, at midnight, and early in the morning before dawn. Two hundred of such diagrams showed that the 'pole star' was really a [[circumpolar star]]. And this I stated in my detailed report to the emperor.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 262"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 262.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Movable type printing===

On the methods of [[Bi Sheng]]'s invention of [[movable type]] [[printing]] between the years 1041 to 1048 AD, Shen Kuo wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Bi Sheng] took sticky clay and cut in it characters as thin as the edge of a coin. Each character formed, as it were, a single type. He baked them in the fire to make them hard. He had previously prepared an iron plate and he had covered his plate with a mixture of pine resin, wax, and paper ashes. When he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone. If one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 201"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 201.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Personal beliefs and philosophy===

Of [[Daoism]] and the inability of empirical science to explain everything in the world, Shen Kuo wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Those in the world who speak of the regularities underlying the phenomena, it seems, manage to apprehend their crude traces. But these regularities have their very subtle aspect, which those who rely on mathematical astronomy cannot know of. Still even these are nothing more than traces. As for the spiritual processes described in the [''[[Book of Changes]]''] that "when they are stimulated, penetrate every situation in the realm," mere traces have nothing to do with them. This spiritual state by which foreknowledge is attained can hardly be sought through changes, of which in any case only the cruder sort are attainable. What I have called the subtlest aspect of these traces, those who discuss the celestial bodies attempt to know by depending on mathematical astronomy; but astronomy is nothing more than the outcome of conjecture.&lt;ref name="ropp 170"&gt;Ropp, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dissertation on the ''Timberwork Manual''===

Below are two passages from Shen's book outlining the basics contained in [[Yu Hao]]'s ''Timberwork Manual''. Yu Hao was a Chinese architect of the earlier 10th, and Kuo was one to praise his work. In the first quote, Shen Kuo describes a scene where Yu Hao gives advice to another artisan architect about slanting [[strut]]s for diagonal wind bracing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When Mr. Qian (Wei-yan) was Governor of the two [[Zhejiang]] provinces, he authorized the building of a wooden pagoda at the Fan-tian Si ([[Brahma]]-Heaven Temple) in [[Hangzhou]] with a design of twice three stories. While it was under construction General Chhien went up to the top and was worried because it swayed a little. But the Master-Builder explained that as the tiles had not yet been put on, the upper part was still rather light, hence the effect. So then they put on all the tiles, but the sway continued as before. Being at a loss what to do, he privately sent his wife to see the wife of Yu Hao with a present of golden [[Hairpin (fashion)|hair pin]]s, and enquire about the cause of the motion. (Yu) Hao laughed and said: 'That's easy, just fit in struts (pan) to settle the work, fixed with (iron) [[nail (fastener)|nails]], and it will not move any more.' The Master-Builder followed his advice, and the tower stood quite firm. This is because the nailed struts filled in and bound together (all the members) up and down so that the six planes (above and below, front and back, left and right) were mutually linked like the cage of the [[thorax]]. Although people might walk on the struts, the six planes grasped and supported each other, so naturally there could be no more motion. Everybody acknowledged the expertise thus shown.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 141"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this next quote, Shen Kuo describes the dimensions and types of architecture outlined in Yu Hao's book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Methods of building construction are described in the ''Timberwork Manual'', which, some say, was written by [[Yu Hao]]. (According to that book), buildings have three basic units of proportion, what is above the cross-beams follows the Upperwork Unit, what is above the ground floor follows the Middlework Unit, and everything below that (platforms, foundations, paving, etc.) follows the Lowerwork Unit. The length of the cross-beams will naturally govern the lengths of the uppermost cross-beams as well as the rafters, etc. Thus for a (main) cross-beam of (8&amp;nbsp;ft) length, an uppermost cross-beam of (3.5&amp;nbsp;ft) length will be needed. (The proportions are maintained) in larger and smaller halls. This (2/28) is the Upperwork Unit. Similarly, the dimensions of the foundations must match the dimensions of the columns to be used, as also those of the (side-) [[rafter]]s, etc. For example, a column (11&amp;nbsp;ft) high will need a platform (4.5&amp;nbsp;ft) high. So also for all the other components, [[corbel]]led brackets, projecting rafters, other rafters, all have their fixed proportions. All these follow the Middlework Unit (2/24). Now below of ramps (and steps) there are three kinds, steep, easy-going, and intermediate. In places these gradients are based upon a unit derived from the imperial litters. Steep ramps are ramps for ascending which the leading and trailing bearers have to extend their arms fully down and up respectively (ratio 3/35). Easy-going ramps are those for which the leaders use elbow length and the trailers shoulder height (ratio 1/38); intermediate ones are negotiated by the leaders with downstretched arms and trailers at shoulder height (ratio 2/18). These are the Lowerwork Units. The book (of Yu Hao) had three chapters. But builders in recent years have become much more precise and skillful (yen shan) than formerly. Thus for some time past the old Timberwork Manual has fallen out of use. But (unfortunately) there is hardly anybody capable of writing a new one. To do that would be a masterpiece in itself!&lt;ref name="Needham volume 4 82 84"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, 82–84.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Botany and zoology===

Shen Kuo described the natural predator [[insect]] similarly shaped to the ''gou-he'' ("dog-grubs") which preyed upon the agricultural pest infestation of ''zi-fang'', the moth ''[[Leucania]] separata'':&lt;ref name="needham volume 6 part 1 545"&gt;Needham, Volume 6, Part 1, 545.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the Yuan-Feng reign period (1078–1085), in the [[Qingzhou]] region, an outbreak of ''zi-fang'' insects caused serious damage to the crops in the fields in autumn. Suddenly another insect appeared in swarms of thousands and tens of thousands, covering the entire ground area. It was shaped like earth-burrowing ''gou-he'' (dog grubs), and its mouth was flanked by pincers. Whenever it met a ''zi-fang'', it would seize it with the pincers and break the poor beast into two bits. Within ten days all the ''zi-fang'' had disappeared, so the locality had an abundant harvest. Such kinds of insects have been known since antiquity and the local people call them ''pang-bu-ken'' ("not allowing other [insects] to be").&lt;ref name="needham volume 6 part 1 545" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Natural phenomena===

Around 1078, Shen Kuo wrote an accurate description of the damaging effects of [[lightning]] to buildings and to the specific materials of objects within. Taking an objective and speculative viewpoint, he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A house belonging to Li Shunju was struck by lightning. Brilliant sparkling light was seen under the eaves. Everyone thought that the hall would be burnt, and those who were inside rushed out. After the thunder had abated, the house was found to be alright, though its walls and the paper on the windows were blackened. On certain wooden shelves, certain [[lacquer]]ed vessels with [[silver]] mouths had been struck by the lightning, so that the silver had melted and dropped to the ground, but the lacquer was not even scorched. Also, a valuable [[sword]] made of strong [[steel]] had been melted to liquid, without the parts of the house nearby being affected. One would have thought that the thatch and wood would have been burnt up first, yet here were metals melted and no injury to thatch and wood. This is beyond the understanding of ordinary people. There are [[Buddhist]] books which speak of 'dragon fire' which burns more fiercely when it meets with water instead of being extinguished by water like 'human' fire.{{Cref|i}} Most people can only judge of things by the experiences of ordinary life, but phenomena outside the scope of this are really quite numerous. How insecure it is to investigate natural principles using only the light of common knowledge, and subjective ideas.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 482"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 482.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== "Strange Happenings" ===
A passage called "Strange Happenings" contains a peculiar account of an [[unidentified flying object]]. Shen wrote that, during the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Song|Emperor Renzong]] (1022–1063), an object as bright as a pearl occasionally hovered over the city of [[Yangzhou]] at night, but described first by local inhabitants of eastern [[Anhui]] and then in [[Jiangsu]].&lt;ref name="dong 2000 69"&gt;Dong (2000), 69. (Professor Zhang Longqiao of the Chinese Department of [[Peking Teachers' College]], who popularized this account in Beijing's ''Guang Ming Daily'' on February 18, 1979, in an article called "Could It Be That A Visitor From Outer Space Visited China Long Ago?", states is "a clue that a flying craft from some other planet once landed somewhere near [[Yangzhou]] in China.")&lt;/ref&gt; Shen wrote that a man near [[Khanka Lake|Xingkai Lake]] observed this curious object; allegedly it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...opened its door and a flood of intense light like sunbeams darted out of it, then the outer shell opened up, appearing as large as a bed with a big pearl the size of a fist illuminating the interior in silvery white. The intense silver-white light, shot from the interior, was too strong for human eyes to behold; it cast shadows of every tree within a radius of ten miles. The spectacle was like the rising Sun, lighting up the distant sky and woods in red. Then all of a sudden, the object took off at a tremendous speed and descended upon the lake like the Sun setting.&lt;ref name="dong 2000 69 70"&gt;Dong (2000), 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shen went on to say that Yibo, a poet of [[Gaoyou]], wrote a poem about this "pearl" after witnessing it. Shen wrote that since the "pearl" often made an appearance around Fanliang in Yangzhou, the people there erected a "Pearl Pavilion" on a wayside, where people came by boat in hopes to see the mysterious flying object.&lt;ref name="dong 2000 70 71"&gt;Dong (2000), 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swords===

Around 1065 Shen Kuo wrote about the assembly methods for [[sword]]s, and the [[pattern welding|patterns]] produced in the steel:&lt;ref&gt;"A History of Metallography" by Cyril Smith (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ancient people use ''chi kang'', (combined steel), for the edge, and ''jou thieh'' (soft iron) for the back, otherwise it would often break. Too strong a weapon will cut and destroy its own edge; that is why it is advisable to use nothing but combined steel. As for the ''yu-chhang'' (fish intestines) effect, it is what is now called the 'snake-coiling' steel sword, or alternatively, the 'pine tree design'. If you cook a fish fully and remove its bones, the shape of its guts will be seen to be like the lines on a 'snake-coiling sword'.&lt;ref&gt;"A History of Metallography" by Cyril Smith (1960) Page 45&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Chinese clothing===

Shen Kuo observed that the Chinese since some centuries prior had entirely adopted barbarian fashions.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
中國衣冠，自北齊以來，乃全用胡服。窄袖、緋綠短衣、長靿靴、有鞢帶，皆胡服也。窄袖利於馳射，短衣、長靿皆便於涉草。胡人樂茂草，常寢處其間，予使北時皆見之。雖王庭亦在深荐中。予至胡庭日，新雨過，涉草，衣褲皆濡，唯胡人都無所沾。帶衣所垂蹀躞，蓋欲佩帶弓劍、帨、算囊、刀勵之類。

The clothing of China since the [[Northern Qi]] [550–557] onward has been entirely made barbarian. Narrow sleeves, short dark red or green robes, tall boots and metal girdle ornaments are all barbarian garb. The narrow sleeves are useful when shooting while galloping. The short robes and tall boots are convenient when passing through tall grass. The barbarians all enjoy thick grass as they always sleep in it. I saw them all do it when I was sent north. Even the king's court is in the deep grasses. On the day I had arrived at the barbarian court the new rains had passed and I waded through the grass. My robes and trousers were all soaked, but the barbarians were not at all wet. With things hanging from robe and belt they walk about. One perhaps might want to hang items like a bow and blade, handkerchief, coin purse or knife from the belt.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Eggdrop1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A package designed to protect three [[eggs (food)|eggs]] from a fall of ten meters is dropped by a [[physics]] teacher on a lift.]]
The '''egg drop contest''' is an experiment usually performed by [[college]] or primary [[school]] students. Competitors typically attempt to create a device that can keep a raw [[chicken]] [[egg (food)|egg]] intact when dropped from a height. Students are asked to build a device made from a limited or not limited amount of materials to support an egg when dropped from various heights.

==Naked egg drop==
A variation of the egg drop competition is the naked egg drop, in which an exposed raw egg is dropped into a container below that must catch the egg and keep it from breaking. 

==Egg hurl==
Another common variation on the egg drop competition is the egg hurl competition, where the containers are hurled by a device such as a [[trebuchet]] or [[Pneumatic weapon|air cannon]].  This variation is often used by schools that lack tall structures from which to drop the containers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.hartdistrict.org/glyle/projects/egg_hurl_project/index.htm Canyon High School Egg Hurl Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518070740/http://staff.hartdistrict.org/glyle/projects/egg_hurl_project/index.htm |date=18 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/lincolnshire/content/articles/2009/06/15/egg_throwing09_feature.shtml "The Rowntree's Randoms Egg Throwing Championships - Swaton 28 June"] ''[[BBC]]''-[[Lincolnshire]], June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The egg hurl variation adds additional difficulties to the design of the container, since it is initially hurled at high speed and has to cope with horizontal as well as vertical velocities upon landing.

==Regional competitions==
Often schools work together to make larger competitions that pit more students against each other.  One of the larger regional egg drop competitions is the Winston-Salem / Forsyth County Egg Drop Competition that takes place during Engineers Week (late February) each year. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsfceggdrop.com Forsyth County Egg Drop Competition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Egg drop is one of 18 events in the [http://www.sciencenc.com/ North Carolina Science Olympiad] elementary competition. More than 100 teams compete in this annual competition. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenc.com/event-help/EggDrop.php North Carolina Science Olympiad Egg Drop ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Five Billion Years of Change: A History of the Land''''' (2003, {{ISBN|157230958X}}) is a book by [[Denis Wood]] that attempts a [[holism|holistic]] view of reality that ranges from the [[Big Bang]] to the [[World Wide Web]]. Specifically, this books deals with the formation of various structures:
*the [[universe]]
*the [[Earth]] and its [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[ocean]]s, and [[continent]]s
*the [[origin of life]]
*the evolution of [[human]]s
*the development of [[agriculture]]
*the rise and fall of [[civilization]]s
*contemporary [[globalization]]&lt;ref name=amazon&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Denis |title=Five Billion Years of Global Change: A History of the Land |url=https://www.amazon.com/Five-Billion-Years-Global-Change/dp/157230958X|accessdate=June 2014|edition=1st Paperback|date=2003 |publisher=[[Guilford Press]]|isbn=157230958X|pages=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key [[theme (literary)|theme]] is repeated through this book: humans have a tendency to divide our understandings into "[[history]]" and "[[prehistory]]". People are shocked when some event from prehistory intrudes upon their current lives; Wood likens the shock of this intrusion to an expulsion from the [[Garden of Eden]].  This division is a metaphor for various artificial divisions; for example:
*the formation of the earth, the pre-biotic chemistry, and the [[origin of life]]
*before the [[Industrial Revolution]] and our subsequent modern era
Instead of thinking in terms of artificial divisions of "now" and "back then", readers should develop an intuitive mindset of graduated changes in which the "[[fossil]]s" of the ancient past are intermingled with contemporary objects; for instance, the "[[oxygen catastrophe|oxygen holocaust]]" of the [[paleoproterozoic]] eon exists in today's oxygen-rich atmosphere.

Also, the [[hero]]ic saga induces another faulty thinking style that obscures the true nature of the world.  To understand the real story of humanity, Wood argues that people must focus on the mass actions of people or of large impersonal forces rather than a few heroes or kings.  [[Hollywood]] movies dealing with ecological threats are especially misleading; rather than imparting an accurate image of ecological issues, movies present a [[villain]] such as a [[mad scientist]] or a greedy, evil [[business]] person.  Instead, such entertainment and much news reporting distracts us from our individual actions that are at the heart of ecological problems.

Inaccurate ways of thinking induce a passive [[learned helplessness|helplessness]].  Instead, by presenting a sweeping story of successive, interlinked, long term trends, the author hopes to give readers a flexible, authentic [[Physical model|model]] of the world.  With that model, readers will be capable of understanding (and possibly dealing with) current global challenges.

The '''Five Ws''' (sometimes referred to as '''Five Ws and How''', '''5W1H''', or '''Six Ws''')&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt; are questions whose answers are considered basic in information gathering or problem solving. They are often mentioned in [[journalism]] (''cf.'' [[news style]]), [[research]] and  [[police]] [[Crimianal procedure|investigation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = December 4, 2012|url = http://mediasmarts.ca/sites/mediasmarts/files/lesson-plans/lesson_deconstructing_web_pages.pdf|title=Deconstructing Web Pages of Cyberspace|work=MediaSmarts}}&lt;/ref&gt; They constitute a formula for getting the complete story on a subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/media-tips/writing-a-press-release|website=owenspencer-thomas.com |title=Press release: getting the facts straight|first=Owen|last=Spencer-Thomas |authorlink=Owen Spencer-Thomas| &lt;!-- D.Litt. ???--&gt; |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the principle of the Five Ws, a report can only be considered complete if it answers these questions starting with an [[interrogative word]]:&lt;ref name=Hart&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 30, 2012|url=http://www.geoff-hart.com/articles/2002/fivew.htm|title=The Five Ws of Online Help|work=by Geoff Hart, TECHWR-L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Who'' was involved?
* ''What'' happened?
* ''Where'' did it take place?
* ''When'' did it take place?
* ''Why'' did that happen?
 
Some authors add a sixth question, ''how'', to the list:&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt; 
 
* ''How'' did it happen?

Each question should have a factual answer — facts necessary to include for a report to be considered complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=September 12, 2008|url=http://www.inlandpress.org/archives/article_1ddd4a01-b7a6-5f95-a33b-ba585bc80344.html|title=Five More Ws for Good Journalism|work=Copy Editing, InlandPress}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Importantly, none of these questions can be answered with a simple [[yes and no|"yes" or "no"]].

In the United Kingdom (excluding Scotland), the Five Ws are used in [[Key Stage 2]] and [[Key Stage 3]] lessons.&lt;ref name="5ws-in-ks3"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tes.co.uk/teaching-resource/The-Five-W-s-of-Drama-6001931/ |title= The Five Ws of Drama |date= 4 Sep 2008 |publisher= [[Times Educational Supplement]] |accessdate= 10 Mar 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
The Five Ws and How were long attributed to [[Hermagoras of Temnos]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robertson|first=D.W.|date=1946|title=A Note on the Classical Origin of ' Circumstances ' in the Medieval Confessional|url=|journal=Studies in Philology|volume=43|issue=1|page=9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in 2010, Sloan&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sloan|first=M.C.|date=2010|title=Aristotle 's Nicomachean Ethics as the Original Locus for the Septem Circumstantiae|url=|journal=Classical Philology|volume=105|pages=236–251|doi=10.1086/656196|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; established [[Aristotle]]'s [[Nicomachean Ethics]] as the source of the elements of circumstance or ''Septem Circumstantiae''. [[Thomas Aquinas]] had much earlier acknowledged Aristotle as the originator of the elements of circumstances, providing a detailed commentary on Aristotle 's system in his “Treatise on human acts” and specifically in part one of two Q7 “Of the Circumstances of Human Acts”. Thomas Aquinas examines the concept of Aristotle's voluntary and involuntary action in his ''[[Summa Theologia]]'' as well as a further set of questions about the elements of circumstance.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Summa Theologica|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|work=Great Books of the Western World|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|year=1952|isbn=|editor-last=Sullivan|editor-first=Daniel J.|volume=19|location=|pages=Q7. Art. 3. Obj. 3.|translator-last=Fathers of the English Dominican Province}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily he asks "Whether a circumstance is an accident of a human act" (Article 1), "Whether Theologians should take note of the circumstances of human acts?" (Article 2), "Whether the circumstances are properly set forth (in Aristotle's) third book of Ethics" (Article 3) and "Whether the most important circumstances are 'Why' and 'In What the act consists'? (Article 4). &lt;blockquote&gt;For in acts we must take note of ''who'' did it, by what aids or instruments he did it (''with''), ''what'' he did, ''where'' he did it, ''why'' he did it, ''how'' and ''when'' he did it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For Aristotle, the elements are used in order to distinguish voluntary or involuntary action. &lt;blockquote&gt;Because Aristotle employs this schema as a primordial crucible for defining the difference between voluntary and involuntary agents (a topic of incalculable importance in the works of Aristotle), the benefits of locating this schema within Aristotle, and ultimately providing clarification of the passage, ''may prove helpful to a number of disciplines''(Sloan 2010, 236).&lt;/blockquote&gt;These elements of circumstances are used by Aristotle as a framework to describe and evaluate moral action in terms of What was/should be done, Who did it, How it was done, Where it happened, and most importantly for what reason (Why), and so on for all the other elements. He outlines them as follows in the Ethics as translated by Sloan.&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore it is not a pointless endeavor to divide these circumstances by kind and number; (1) the ''Who'', (2) the ''What'', (3) around what place (''Where'') or (4) in which time something happens (''When''), and sometimes (5) with what, such as an instrument (''With''), (6) for the sake of what (''Why''), such as saving a life, and (7) the (''How''), such as gently or violently…And it seems that the most important circumstances are those just listed, including the ''Why''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For Aristotle (in Sloan), ignorance of any of these elements can imply involuntary action.&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, with ignorance as a possibility concerning all these things, that is, ''the circumstances of the act'', the one who acts in ignorance of any of them seems to act involuntarily, and especially regarding the most important ones. And it seems that the most important circumstances are those just listed, including the ''Why''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]], Aristotle illustrates why the elements are important in terms of human (moral) action.&lt;blockquote&gt;I mean, for instance (a particular circumstance or movement or action), How could we advise the Athenians whether they should go to war or not, if we did not know their strength (''How much''), whether it was naval or military or both (''What kind''), and how great it is (''How many''), what their revenues amount to (''With''), Who their friends and enemies are (''Who''), what wars, too they have waged (''What''), and with what success; and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politica|last=Aristotle|first=|work=The Works of Aristotle|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1921|isbn=|editor-last=Ross|editor-first=W.D.|volume=X|location=|publication-place=Oxford|pages=1396a7-11|translator-last=Jowett|translator-first=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Essentially, these elements of circumstances provide a theoretical framework that can be used to particularize, explain or predict ''any'' given set of circumstances of action. [[Hermagoras of Temnos|Hermagoras]] went so far as to claim that ''all'' [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]  are derived from these seven circumstances.&lt;blockquote&gt;In other words, no hypothetical question, or question involving particular persons and actions, can arise without reference to these circumstances, and no demonstration of such a question can be made without using them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In any particular act or situation, one needs to interrogate these questions in order to determine the actual circumstances of the action.&lt;blockquote&gt;It is necessary for students of virtue to differentiate between the Voluntary and Involuntary; such a distinction should even prove useful to the lawmaker for assigning honors and punishments. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This aspect is encapsulated by Aristotle in Rhetoric as ''forensic speech'' and is used to determine ''"The characters and circumstances which lead men to commit wrong, or make them the victims of wrong”'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetoric|last=Aristotle|first=|work=The Works of Aristotle|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1920|isbn=|editor-last=Ross|editor-first=W.D.|volume=XI|location=Oxford|pages=Bk I.12 1372a4-1373a35|translator-last=Roberts|translator-first=W.R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to accuse or defend. It is this application of the elements of circumstances that was emphasised by latter rhetoricians.

==Rhetoric==
Even though the classical origin of these questions as situated in ethics had long been lost, they have been a standard way of formulating or analyzing rhetorical questions since antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;For more general discussion of the theory of circumstances, see ''e.g.'' Rita Copeland, ''Rhetoric, Hermeneutics, and Translation in the Middle Ages: Academic Traditions and Vernacular Texts'', 1995. {{ISBN|0-521-48365-4}}, p. 66''ff'', as well as Robertson&lt;/ref&gt; The rhetor [[Hermagoras of Temnos]], as quoted in [[pseudo-Augustine]]'s ''De Rhetorica'',&lt;ref&gt;Although attributed to [[Augustine of Hippo]], modern scholarship considers the authorship doubtful, and calls him pseudo-Augustine: Edwin Carawan, "What the Laws have Prejudged: Παραγραφή and Early Issue Theory" ''in'' Cecil W. Wooten, George Alexander Kennedy, eds., ''The orator in action and theory in Greece and Rome'', 2001. {{ISBN|90-04-12213-3}}, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; applied Aristotle's "elements of circumstances" (μόρια περιστάσεως)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

:(Who, what, when, where, why, in what way, by what means)

[[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]] &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; also refers to the elements as used by [[Cicero]] in De Inventione (Chap. 24 DD1, 104) as:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Quis, quid, ubi, quibus auxiliis, cur, quomodo, quando.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Similarly, [[Quintilian]] discussed ''loci argumentorum'', but did not put them in the form of questions.&lt;ref name="circ" /&gt;

[[Gaius Marius Victorinus|Victorinus]] explained [[Cicero]]'s application of the elements of circumstances by putting them into correspondence with Hermagoras's questions:&lt;ref name="circ" /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[[File:Victorinus.gif|quis=persona; quid=factum; cur=causa; ubi=locus; quando=tempus; quemadmodum = modus; quib/adminiculis=facultas]]&lt;/center&gt;

[[Julius Victor]] also lists circumstances as questions.&lt;ref name="circ"/&gt;

[[Boethius]] "made the seven circumstances fundamental to the arts of prosecution and defense":
:''Quis, quid, cur, quomodo, ubi, quando, quibus auxiliis''.&lt;ref name="circ"/&gt;
:(Who, what, why, how, where, when, with what)

The question form was taken up again in the 12th century by [[Thierry de Chartres]] and [[John of Salisbury]].&lt;ref name="circ"/&gt;

To administer suitable [[penance]] to [[sin]]ners, the 21st canon of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1215) enjoined confessors to investigate both sins and the circumstances of the sins. The question form was popular for guiding confessors, and it appeared in several different forms:&lt;ref&gt;Citations below taken from Robertson and not independently checked.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Quis, quid, ubi, per quos, quoties, cur, quomodo, quando.''&lt;ref&gt;Mansi, ''Concilium Trevirense Provinciale'' (1227), Mansi, ''Concilia'', XXIII, c. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Quis, quid, ubi, quibus auxiliis, cur, quomodo, quando.''&lt;ref&gt;Constitutions of [[Alexander de Stavenby]] (1237) Wilkins, I:645; also quoted in [[Thomas Aquinas]] [[Summa Theologica]] I-II, 7, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Quis, quid, ubi, cum quo, quotiens, cur, quomodo, quando.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert de Sorbon]], ''De Confessione'', ''MBP'' XXV:[https://books.google.com/books?id=3eoscxXAd5oC&amp;pg=PA354 354]&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Quid, quis, ubi, quibus auxiliis, cur, quomodo, quando.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Quinel]], ''Summula'', Wilkins, II:165&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Quid, ubi, quare, quantum, conditio, quomodo, quando: adiuncto quoties.''&lt;ref&gt;[[S. Petrus Coelestinus]], ''Opuscula'', ''MBP'' XXV:828&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of questions was also used for the systematic [[exegesis]] of a text.&lt;ref&gt;Richard N. Soulen, R. Kendall Soulen, ''Handbook of Biblical Criticism'', (Louisville, 2001, {{ISBN|0-664-22314-1}}) ''s.v.'' Locus, p. 107; Hartmut Schröder, ''Subject-Oriented Texts'', p. 176ff&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, [[Thomas Wilson (rhetorician)|Thomas Wilson]] wrote in English verse:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Who, what, and where, by what helpe, and by whose:&lt;br&gt;
Why, how, and when, doe&lt;!--spelling in the original--&gt; many things disclose.&lt;ref name="Thomas Wilson"&gt;Thomas Wilson, ''The Arte of Rhetorique'' Book I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[United States]] in the [[19th century]], Prof. [[William Cleaver Wilkinson]] popularized the "Three Ws" – What? Why? What of it? – as a method of Bible study in the 1880s, although he did not claim originality. This would also became the "Five Ws", but the application was rather different from that in journalism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"What? Why? What of it?" is a plan of study of alliterative methods
for the teacher emphasized by Professor W.C. Wilkinson not as original
with himself but as of venerable authority. "It is, in fact," he says,
"an almost immemorial orator's analysis. First the facts, next the
proof of the facts, then the consequences of the facts. This analysis
has often been expanded into one known as "The Five Ws:" "When? Where? Who?
What? Why?" Hereby attention is called, in the study of any lesson: to the
date of its incidents; to their place or locality; to the person
speaking or spoken to, or to the persons introduced, in the narrative; to
the incidents or statements of the text; and, finally, to the
applications and uses of the lesson teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Clay Trumbull,
''Teaching and Teachers'', Philadelphia, 1888, p. 120 [https://books.google.com/books?id=VAYCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA120#PPA120,M1 text at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Wikisource|The Elephant's Child}}
The "Five Ws" (and one H) were memorialized by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in his "[[Just So Stories]]" ([[1902 in literature|1902]]), in which a poem, accompanying the tale of "The Elephant's Child",&lt;ref&gt;The poem compares Kipling's own day-to-day situation as a writer/journalist, with that of [[Queen Victoria]] ("a person small") who "keeps ten million serving men", and, unlike Kipling, "gets no rest at all".&lt;/ref&gt; opens with:
:{|
''I keep six honest serving-men''&lt;br&gt;
''(They taught me all I knew);''&lt;br&gt;
''Their names are What and Why and When''&lt;br&gt;
''And How and Where and Who.&lt;br&gt;''
|}

By 1917, the "Five Ws" were being taught in high-school journalism classes,&lt;ref&gt;Leon Nelson Flint, ''Newspaper Writing in High Schools, Containing an Outline for the Use of Teachers'', University of Kansas, 1917, p. 47 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=86tDAAAAIAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA3#PPA47,M1 at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1940, the tendency of journalists to address all of the "Five Ws" within the [[lead paragraph]] of an article was being characterized as old-fashioned and fallacious:

{{quote|The old-fashioned lead of the five Ws and the H, crystallized largely by Pulitzer's "new journalism" and sanctified by the schools, is widely giving way to the much more supple and interesting feature lead, even on straight news stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

All of you know about — and I hope all of you admit the fallacy of — the doctrine of the five Ws in the first sentence of the newspaper story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Starting in the 2000s, the Five W's were sometimes misattributed to Kipling, especially in the management and quality literature,&lt;ref&gt;Simon Burtonshaw-Gunn, ''The Essential Management Toolbox'', 2009, {{ISBN|0470687436}}, pp. 55, 68, 198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'' in E. Kim and S. Helal, "Revisiting Human Activity Networks", in ''Sensor Systems and Software: Second International ICST Conference'', Miami 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lf2qCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA223 p. 223]&lt;/ref&gt; and contrasted with the [[5 Whys]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Smith, ''et al.'', ''The Effective Change Manager's Handbook, 2014, p. 419&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{See also|Indo-European vocabulary#Pronouns, particles}}

In each of English and Latin, most of the interrogative words begin with the same sound, ''wh'' in English, "qu" in Latin. This is not a coincidence, as they both come from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''[[Proto-Indo-European pronouns#Interrogative/indefinite pronoun|k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;o-]]'', reflected in [[Proto-Germanic]] as ''χ&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;a-'' or ''kh&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;a-'' and in [[Latin language|Latin]] as ''qu-''.

'''Flood geology''' (also '''creation geology''' or '''diluvial geology''') is the attempt to interpret and reconcile [[geology|geological features]] of the Earth in accordance with a literal belief in the [[Genesis flood narrative|global flood]] described in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] [[s:Bible (Wikisource)/Genesis#Chapter 6|6–8]]. In the early 19th century, [[Diluvium|diluvial]] geologists hypothesized that specific surface features were evidence of a worldwide flood which had followed earlier [[Era (geology)|geological eras]]; after further investigation they agreed that these features resulted from local floods or [[glacier]]s. In the 20th century, [[young Earth creationism|young Earth creationists]] revived flood geology as an overarching concept in their opposition to [[evolution]], assuming a recent six-day Creation and cataclysmic geological changes during the Biblical Deluge, and incorporating creationist explanations of the [[Stratigraphy|sequence of rock strata]].

In the early stages of [[History of geology|development of the science of geology]], fossils were interpreted as evidence of past flooding. The "theories of the Earth" of the 17th century proposed mechanisms based on natural laws, within a timescale set by the [[Ussher chronology|biblical chronology]]. As modern [[geology]] developed, geologists found evidence of [[Geologic time scale|an ancient Earth]], and evidence inconsistent with the notion that the Earth had developed in a series of cataclysms, the most recent of which could be attributed to the Genesis flood. In early 19th-century Britain, "Diluvialism" attributed [[landform]]s and surface features such as beds of gravel and [[Glacial erratic|erratic boulders]] to the destructive effects of this supposed global Deluge, but by 1830 geologists increasingly found that the evidence only showed relatively local floods. Attempts were made by so-called [[scriptural geologist]]s to give primacy to literal Biblical explanations, but they lacked background in geology and were marginalised by the scientific community, as well as having little influence on the church.

Flood geology was revived as a field of study within [[creation science]], which is a part of [[young Earth creationism]].{{sfn|Parkinson|2004|pp=24–27}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|2009}} They were first known as flood geologists.

Proponents hold to a literal reading of [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Genesis#6|Genesis 6–9]] and view its passages to be [[Historicity (Bible Studies)|historically accurate]], using the Bible's internal chronology to place the Flood and the story of [[Noah's Ark]] within the last five thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Carol A.

==The great flood in the history of geology==
[[File:Noahs Ark.jpg|thumb|Animals boarding Noah's ark (Edward Hicks) 1846 painting]] 
{{main|History of geology}}

In pre-Christian times, [[fossil]]s found on land were thought by Greek philosophers, including [[Xenophanes]], [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]] and [[Aristotle]], to be evidence that the sea had in past ages covered the land. Their concept of vast time periods in an eternal cosmos was rejected by early Christian writers as incompatible with their belief in Creation by God. Among the church fathers, [[Tertullian]] spoke of fossils demonstrating that mountains had been overrun by water without explicitly saying when. [[Chrysostom]] and [[Augustine]] believed that fossils were the remains of animals that were killed and buried during the brief duration of the Biblical [[Genesis flood narrative|Genesis Flood]], and later [[Martin Luther]] viewed fossils as having resulted from the Flood.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|pp=28–30, 63}}{{sfn|Berry|2003|p=5}}

Other scholars, including [[Avicenna]], thought fossils were produced in the rock by "petrifying virtue" acting on "seeds" of plants and animals. In 1580 [[Bernard Palissy]] speculated that fossils had formed in lakes, and [[natural history|natural historians]] subsequently disputed the alternatives. [[Robert Hooke]] made empirical investigations, and doubted that the numbers of fossil shells or depth of shell beds could have formed in the one year of Noah's Flood. In 1616 [[Nicolas Steno]] showed how chemical processes changed organic remains into stone fossils. His fundamental principles of [[stratigraphy]] published in 1669 established that rock strata formed horizontally and were later broken and tilted, though he assumed these processes would occur within 6,000 years including a worldwide Flood.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|pp=48–56}}

===Theories of the Earth===
In his influential ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' of 1644, [[René Descartes]] applied his mechanical [[physical law]]s to envisage swirling particles forming the Earth as a layered sphere. This [[natural philosophy]] was recast in Biblical terms by the theologian [[Thomas Burnet]], whose ''Sacred Theory of the Earth'' published in the 1680s proposed complex explanations based on natural laws, and explicitly rejected the simpler approach of invoking [[miracle]]s as incompatible with the methodology of [[natural philosophy]] (the precursor to science). Burnet maintained that less than 6,000 years ago the Earth had emerged from chaos as a perfect sphere, with paradise on land over a watery abyss. This crust had dried out and cracked, and its collapse caused the Biblical Deluge, forming mountains as well as underground caverns where the water retreated. He made no mention of fossils, but inspired other diluvial theories that did.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|pp=62–65}}{{sfn|Gould|1982}}

In 1695, [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]]'s ''An Essay Toward a Natural History of the Earth'' viewed the Genesis Flood as dissolving rocks and earth into a thick slurry which caught up all living things, and when the waters settled formed strata according to the [[specific gravity]] of these materials, including fossils of the organisms. When it was pointed out that lower layers were often less dense and forces that shattered rock would destroy organic remains, he resorted to the explanation that a divine miracle had temporarily suspended gravity. [[William Whiston]]'s ''New Theory of the Earth'' of 1696 combined scripture with [[classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]] to propose that the original chaos was the atmosphere of a [[comet]] with the days of Creation each taking a year, and the Genesis Flood had resulted from a second comet. His explanation of how the Flood caused mountains and the fossil sequence was similar to Woodward's. [[Johann Jakob Scheuchzer]] wrote in support of Woodward's ideas in 1708, describing some fossil vertebrae as bones of sinners who had perished in the Flood. A skeleton found in a quarry was described by him in 1726 as ''[[Andrias scheuchzeri|Homo diluvii testis]]'', a giant human testifying to the Flood. This was accepted for some time, but in 1812 it was shown to be a prehistoric salamander.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|pp=65–68}}

===Beginnings of modern geology===
The modern science of [[geology]] developed in the 18th century, the term "geology" itself was popularised by the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of 1751.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Steno's categorisation of strata was expanded by several geologists, including [[Johann Gottlob Lehmann (scientist)|Johann Gottlob Lehmann]] who believed that the oldest mountains had formed early in the Creation, and categorised as ''Flötz-Gebürge'' stratified mountains with few ore deposits but with thin layers containing fossils, overlain by a third category of superficial deposits. In his 1756 publication he identified 30 different layers in this category which he attributed to the action of the Genesis Deluge, possibly including debris from the older mountains. Others including [[Giovanni Arduino (geologist)|Giovanni Arduino]] attributed secondary strata to natural causes: [[Georg Christian Füchsel]] said that geologists had to take as standard the processes in which nature currently produces solids, "we know no other way", and only the most recent deposits could be attributed to a great Flood.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|pp=71–74}}

Lehman's classification was developed by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] who thought that rock strata had been deposited from a primeval global ocean rather than by Noah's Flood, a doctrine called [[Neptunism]]. The idea of a young Earth was further undermined in 1774 by [[Nicolas Desmarest]], whose studies of a succession of extinct volcanoes in Europe showed layers which would have taken long ages to build up. The fact that these layers were still intact indicated that any later Flood had been local rather than universal. Against Neptunism, [[James Hutton]] proposed an indefinitely old cycle of eroded rocks being deposited in the sea, consolidated and heaved up by volcanic forces into mountains which in turn eroded, all in natural processes which continue to operate.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|pp=74–89}}

===Catastrophism and diluvialism===
The first professional geological society, the [[Geological Society of London|Geological Society]] of London, was founded in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/gsl/society/bicentenary|title=The Geological  Society|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, geologists were convinced that an immense time had been needed to build up the huge thickness of rock [[stratum|strata]] visible in quarries and cliffs, implying extensive pre-human periods. Most accepted a basic [[Geologic time scale#History and nomenclature of the time scale|time scale]] classifying rocks as primitive, transition, [[Mesozoic|secondary]], or [[Tertiary era|tertiary]]. Several researchers independently found that strata could be identified by characteristic [[fossil]]s: secondary strata in southern England were mapped by [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]] from 1799 to 1815.{{sfn|Young|1995}}

====Cuvier and Jameson====
[[Georges Cuvier]], working with [[Alexandre Brongniart]], examined tertiary strata in the region around Paris. Cuvier found that fossils identified rock formations as alternating between marine and  terrestrial deposits, indicating "repeated irruptions and retreats of the sea" which he identified with a long series of sudden catastrophes which had caused [[extinction]]s.{{sfn|Young|1995}} In his 1812 ''Discours préliminaire'' to his ''Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles de quadrupeds'' put forward a synthesis of this research into the long prehistoric period, and a historical approach to the most recent catastrophe. His historical approach tested empirical claims in the Biblical text of Genesis against other ancient writings to pick out the "real facts" from "interested fictions". In his assessment, [[Moses]] had written the account around 3,300 years ago, long after the events described. Cuvier only discussed the Genesis Flood in general terms, as the most recent example of "an event of an universal catastrophe, occasioned by an irruption of the waters" not set "much further back than five or six thousand years ago". The historical texts could be loosely related to evidence such as overturned strata and "heaps of ''debris'' and rounded pebbles". An English translation was published in 1813 with a preface and notes by [[Robert Jameson]], [[Regius Professor]] of [[Natural history|Natural History]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He began the preface with a sentence which ignored Cuvier's historical approach and instead deferred to [[revelation]]:{{sfn|Herbert|2005|pp=181–183}} 
{{quote|"Although the Mosaic account of the creation of the world is an inspired writing, and consequently rests on evidence wholly independent of human observation and experience, still it is interesting, and in many respects important, to know that it coincides with the various phenomena observable in the mineral kingdom."{{sfn|Herbert|2005|p=183}}{{sfn|Haldane|1816|pp=168–169}}}}
This sentence was removed after the second edition, and Jameson's position changed as shown by his notes in successive editions, but it influenced British views of Cuvier's concept.{{sfn|Herbert|2005|p=183}} In 1819 [[George Bellas Greenough]], first president of [[Geological Society of London|The Geological Society]], issued ''A Critical Examination of the First Principles of Geology'' stating that unless [[Glacial erratic|erratic boulders]] deposited hundreds of miles from their original sources had been moved by seas, rivers, or collapsing lakes, "the only remaining cause, to which these effects can be ascribed, is a Debacle or Deluge."{{sfn|Young|1995}}

====Buckland and the English school of geologists====
Conservative geologists in Britain welcomed Cuvier's theory to replace [[Abraham Gottlob Werner|Werner]]'s [[Neptunism]], and the [[Church of England]] clergyman [[William Buckland]] became the foremost proponent of Flood geology as he sought to get the new science of geology accepted on the curriculum of the [[University of Oxford]]. In 1818 he was visited by Cuvier, and in his inaugural speech in 1819 as the first professor of geology at the university he defended the subject against allegations that it undermined religion.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=116}} His speech, published as ''Vindiciae Geologicae; or, The Connexion of Geology with Religion Explained'', equated the last of a long series of catastrophes with the Genesis Flood, and said that "the grand fact of an universal deluge at no very remote period is proved on grounds so decisive and incontrovertible, that, had we never heard of such an event from Scripture, or any other, authority, Geology of itself must have called in the assistance of some such catastrophe, to explain the phenomena of diluvian action which are universally presented to us, and which are unintelligible without recourse to a deluge exerting its ravages at a period not more ancient than that announced in the Book of Genesis." The evidence he proposed included erratic boulders, extensive areas of [[gravel]], and [[landforms]] which appeared to have been scoured by water.{{sfn|Young|1995}}{{sfn|Buckland|1820|pp=23–24}}

This inaugural address influenced the geologists [[William Conybeare (geologist)|William Conybeare]] and [[William Phillips (geologist)|William Phillips]]. In their 1822 book on ''Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales'' Conybeare referred to the same features in an introduction about the relationship between geology and religion, describing how a deluge causing "the last great geological change to which the surface of our planet appears to have been exposed" left behind the debris (which he named in [[Latin]] ''[[Diluvium]]'') as evidence for "that great and universal catastrophe to which it seems most properly assignable". In 1823 Buckland published his detailed account of "Relics of the Flood", ''Reliquiae Diluvianae;'' or, ''Observations on the Organic Remains Contained in Caves, Fissures, and Diluvial Gravel and on Other Geological Phenomena Attesting the Action of an Universal Deluge'', incorporating his research suggesting that animal fossils had been dragged into the [[Kirkdale Cave]] by [[hyena]]s then covered by a layer of red mud washed in by the Deluge.{{sfn|Young|1995}}

Buckland's views were supported by other Church of England clergymen naturalists: his Oxford colleague [[Charles Daubeny]] proposed in 1820 that the volcanoes of the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] showed a sequence of lava flows from before and after the Flood had cut valleys through the region.{{sfn|Young|1995}} In an 1823 article "On the deluge", [[John Stevens Henslow]], professor of mineralogy at the [[University of Cambridge]], affirmed the concept and proposed that the Flood had originated from a comet, but this was his only comment on the topic. [[Adam Sedgwick]], [[Woodwardian Professor of Geology]] at Cambridge,  presented two supportive papers in 1825, "On the origin of alluvial and diluvial deposits", and "On diluvial formations". At this time, most of what Sedgwick called "The English school of geologists" distinguished superficial deposits which were "diluvial", showing "great irregular masses of sand, loam, and coarse gravel, containing through its mass rounded blocks sometimes of enormous magnitude" and supposedly caused by "some great irregular inundation", from "alluvial" deposits of "comminuted gravel, silt, loam, and other materials" attributed to lesser events, the "propelling force" of rivers, or "successive partial inundations".{{sfn|Henslow|1823|p=344–348}}{{sfn|Herbert|1991|pp=171–172}}

In America, [[Benjamin Silliman]] at [[Yale University|Yale College]] spread the concept, and in an 1833 essay dismissed the earlier idea that most stratified rocks had been formed in the Flood, while arguing that surface features showed "wreck and ruin" attributable to "mighty floods and rushing torrents of water". He said that "we must charge to moving waters the undulating appearance of stratified sand and gravel, often observed in many places, and very conspicuously in the plain of New Haven, and in other regions of Connecticut and New England", while both "bowlder stones" and sandy deserts across the world could be attributed to "diluvial agency".{{sfn|Young|1995}}

====Criticisms and retractions: the downfall of Diluvialism====
Other naturalists were critical of Diluvialism: the [[Church of Scotland]] pastor [[John Fleming (naturalist)|John Fleming]] published opposing arguments in a series of articles from 1823 onwards. He was critical of the assumption that fossils resembling modern tropical species had been swept north "by some violent means", which he regarded as absurd considering the "unbroken state" of fossil remains. For example, fossil [[mammoth]]s demonstrated adaptation to the same northern climates now prevalent where they were found. He criticized Buckland's identification of red mud in the Kirkdale cave as diluvial, when near identical mud in other caves had been described as fluvial.{{sfn|Young|1995}} While Cuvier had reconciled geology with a loose reading of the Biblical text, Fleming argued that such a union was "indiscreet" and turned to a more literal view of Genesis:{{sfn|Herbert|2005|p=186}}
{{quote|But if the supposed impetuous torrent excavated valleys, and transported masses of rocks to a distance from their original repositories, then must the soil have been swept from off the earth to the destruction of the vegetable tribes. Moses does not record such an occurrence. On the contrary, in his history of the dove and the olive-leaf plucked off, he furnishes a proof that the flood was not so violent in its motions as to disturb the soil, nor to overturn the trees which it supported.{{sfn|Herbert|2005|p=186}}}}

When Sedgwick visited Paris at the end of 1826 he found hostility to Diluvialism: [[Alexander von Humboldt]] ridiculed it "beyond measure", and [[Constant Prévost|Louis-Constant Prévost]] "lectured against it". In the summer of 1827 Sedgwick and [[Roderick Murchison]] travelled to investigate the geology of the [[Scottish Highlands]], where they found "so many indications of ''local diluvial'' operations" that Sedgwick began to change his mind about it being worldwide. When [[George Poulett Scrope]] published his investigations into the Auvergne in 1827, he did not use the term "diluvium". He was followed by Murchison and [[Charles Lyell]] whose account appeared in 1829. All three agreed that the valleys could well have been formed by rivers acting over a long time, and a deluge was not needed. Lyell, formerly a pupil of Buckland, put strong arguments against diluvialism in the first volume of his ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' published in 1830, though suggesting the possibility of a deluge affecting a region such as the low-lying area around the [[Caspian Sea]]. Sedgwick responded to this book in his presidential address to the Geological Society in February 1830, agreeing that diluvial deposits had formed at differing times. At the society a year later, when retiring from the presidency, Sedgwick described his former belief that "vast masses of diluvial gravel" had been scattered worldwide in "one violent and transitory period" as "a most unwarranted conclusion", and therefore thought "it right, as one of my last acts before I quit this Chair, thus publicly to read my recantation." However, he remained convinced that a flood as described in Genesis was not excluded by geology.{{sfn|Young|1995}}{{sfn|Herbert|1991|pp=171–174}}{{sfn|Herbert|2005|pp=186–188}}

One student had seen the gradual abandonment of diluvialism: [[Charles Darwin]] had attended Jameson's geology lectures in 1826, and at Cambridge became a close friend of Henslow before learning geology from Sedgwick in 1831.  At the outset of the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' voyage]] Darwin was given a copy of Lyell's ''Principles of Geology'', and at the first landfall began his career as a geologist with investigations which supported Lyell's concept of slow uplift while also describing loose rocks and gravel as "part of the long disputed Diluvium". Debates continued over the part played by repeated exceptional catastrophes in geology, and in 1832 [[William Whewell]] dubbed this view [[catastrophism]], while naming Lyell's insistence on explanations based on current processes [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]].{{sfn|Herbert|2005|pp=70, 152–156, 185}}

Buckland, too, gradually modified his views on the Deluge. In 1832 a student noted Buckland's view on cause of diluvial gravel, "whether is Mosaic inundation or not, will not say". In a footnote to his ''[[Bridgewater Treatise]]'' of 1836, Buckland backed down from his former claim that the "violent inundation" identified in his ''Reliquiae Diluvianae'' was the Genesis flood:{{sfn|Herbert|2005|pp=185, 408}}  
{{quote|it seems more probable, that the event in question, was the last of the many geological revolutions that have been produced by violent irruptions of water, rather than the comparatively tranquil inundation described in the Inspired Narrative. It has been justly argued, against the attempt to identity these two great historical and natural phenomena, that, as the rise and fall of the waters of the Mosaic deluge are described to have been gradual and of short duration, they would have produced comparatively little change on the surface of the country they overflowed.{{sfn|Buckland|1836|pp=94–95}}}}

For a while, Buckland had continued to insist that ''some'' geological layers were related to the Great Flood, but grew to accept the idea that they represented multiple inundations which occurred well before humans existed. In 1840 he made a field trip to Scotland with the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] geologist [[Louis Agassiz]], and became convinced that the "diluvial" features which he had attributed to the Deluge had, in fact, been produced by ancient [[ice age]]s. Buckland became one of the foremost champions of Agassiz's theory of glaciations, and diluvialism went out of use in geology. Active geologists no longer posited sudden ancient catastrophes with unknown causes, and instead increasingly explained phenomena by observable processes causing slow changes over great periods.{{sfn|Imbrie|Imbrie|1986|p=40}}{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|p=99}}

===Scriptural geologists, and later commentary ===
[[Scriptural geologist]]s were a heterogeneous group of writers in the early nineteenth century, who claimed "the primacy of [[Biblical literalism|literalistic]] biblical [[exegesis]]" and a short [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth]] time-scale. Their views were marginalised and ignored by the [[scientific community]] of their time.{{sfn|Rudwick|1988|pp=42–44}}{{sfn|Rudwick|2008|p=84, "But since [[William Henry Fitton]] and other geologists regarded [scriptural geology] as scientifically worthless…"}}{{sfn|Wood|2004|p=168}} They generally lacked any background in geology, and had little influence even in church circles.{{sfn|Piccardi|2007|p=46}}{{sfn|Livingstone|Hart|Noll|1999|pp=186–187}}

Many quoted out of date geological writings. Among the most prominent, [[Granville Penn]] argued in 1822 that "mineral geology" rejected revelation, while true "Mosaical geology" showed that God had created primitive rock formations directly, in correspondence with the laws which God then made to produce subsequent effects. A first revolution on the third day of creation deepened the oceans so water rushed in, and in the Deluge 1,656 years afterwards a second revolution sank land areas and raised the sea bed to cause a swirling flood which moved soil and fossil remains into stratified layers, after which God created new vegetation. As Genesis appeared to show that the rivers of Eden had survived this catastrophe, he argued that the verses concerned were an added "parenthesis" which should be disregarded. In 1837 [[George Fairholme]] expressed disappointment about disappearing belief in the deluge, and about Sedgwick and Buckland recanting diluvialism, while putting forward his own ''New and Conclusive Physical Demonstrations'' which ignored geological findings to claim that strata had been deposited in a quick continuous process while still moist.{{sfn|Young|1995}}

Geology was popularized by several authors. [[John Pye Smith]]'s lectures published in 1840 reconciled an extended time frame with Genesis by the increasingly common [[Gap creationism|gap theology]] or [[Day-age creationism|day-age theology]], and said it was likely that the gravel and boulder formations were not "diluvium", but had taken long ages predating the creation of humans. He reaffirmed that the Flood was historical as a local event, something which the 17th century theologians [[Edward Stillingfleet]] and [[Matthew Poole]] had already suggested on a purely Biblical basis. Smith also denounced the "fanciful" writings of the scriptural geologists. [[Edward Hitchcock]] sought to ensure that geological findings could be corroborated by scripture, and dismissed the scriptural geology of Penn and Fairholme as misrepresenting both scripture and the facts of geology. He noted the difficulty of equating a violent deluge with the more tranquil Genesis account. [[Hugh Miller]] supported similar points with considerable detail.{{sfn|Young|1995}}

Little attention was paid to Flood geology over the rest of the 19th century, its few supporters included the author [[Eleazar Lord]] in the 1850s and the Lutheran scholar [[Carl Friedrich Keil]] in 1860 and 1878. The visions of [[Ellen G. White]] published in 1864 formed [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] views, and influenced 20th century creationism.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|p=119}}

==Creationist flood geology==
The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], led by [[Ellen G. White]], took a six-day creation literally, and put her prolific [[Inspiration of Ellen G. White|"inspired" writings]] on a level with the Bible. Her visions of the flood and its aftermath, published in 1864, described a catastrophic deluge which reshaped the entire surface of the Earth, followed by a powerful wind which piled up new high mountains, burying the bodies of men and beasts. Buried forests became coal and oil, and where God later caused these to burn, they reacted with limestone and water to cause "earthquakes, volcanoes and fiery issues".{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=73–74}}{{sfn|White|1864|pp=[http://www.gilead.net/egw/books/spiritual-gifts/Spiritual_Gifts._Volume_3/index.htm?http&amp;url=www.gilead.net/egw/books/spiritual-gifts/Spiritual_Gifts._Volume_3/11_After_the_Flood.htm 64–89]}}

===George McCready Price===
[[Ellen G. White]]'s visions prompted several books by one of her followers, [[George McCready Price]], leading to the 20th-century revival of flood geology.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|p=119}} After years selling White's books door-to-door, Price took a one-year teacher-training course and taught in several schools. When shown books on evolution and the [[Biostratigraphy|fossil sequence]] which contradicted his beliefs, he found the answer in White's "revealing word pictures" which suggested how the fossils had been buried. He studied textbooks on geology and "almost tons of geological documents", finding "how the actual facts of the rocks and fossils, ''stripped of mere theories'', splendidly refute this evolutionary theory of the invariable order of the fossils, ''which is the very backbone of the evolution doctrine''". In 1902 he produced a manuscript for a book proposing geology based on Genesis, in which the sequence of fossils resulted from the different responses of animals to the encroaching flood. He agreed with White on the origins of coal and oil, and conjectured that mountain ranges (including the [[Alps]] and [[Himalaya]]) formed from layers deposited by the flood which had then been "folded and elevated to their present height by the great lateral pressure that accompanied its subsidence". He then found a report describing [[Unconformity#Paraconformity| paraconformities]] and a paper on [[thrust fault]]s. He concluded from these "providential discoveries" that it was impossible to prove the age or overall sequence of fossils, and included these points in his self-published paperback of 1906, ''Illogical Geology: The Weakest Point in the Evolution Theory''. His arguments continued this focus on disproving the sequence of strata, and he ultimately sold more than 15,000 copies of his 1923 college textbook ''The New Geology''.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp= 73–78}}{{sfn|Price|1926}}

Price increasingly gained attention outside [[Adventism|Adventist]] groups, and in the [[creation–evolution controversy]] other leading [[Christian fundamentalism |Christian fundamentalists]] praised his opposition to evolution - though none of them followed his young Earth arguments, retaining their belief in the [[Gap creationism |gap]] or in the [[Day-age creationism |day-age interpretation of Genesis]]. Price corresponded with [[William Jennings Bryan]] and was invited to be a witness in the [[Scopes Trial]] of 1925, but declined as he was teaching in England and opposed to teaching Genesis in public schools as "it would be an infringement on the cardinal American principle of [[Separation of church and state in the United States| separation of church and state]]". Price returned from England in 1929 to rising popularity among fundamentalists as a scientific author.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp= 97–100}} In the same year his former student [[Harold W. Clark]] self-published the short book ''Back to Creationism'', which recommended Price's flood geology as the new "science of creationism", introducing the label "[[creationism]]" as a replacement for "anti-evolution" of "Christian Fundamentals".&lt;ref name="Antievolutionists and Creationists"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.counterbalance.net/history/anticreat-body.html | title= History Topic: Antievolutionists and Creationists | first= Ron| last= Numbers | publisher= counterbalance | accessdate= 2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 Price and [[Dudley Joseph Whitney]] (a rancher who had co-founded the Lindcove Community Bible Church, and now followed Price) founded the ''Religion and Science Association'' (RSA). They aimed to resolve disagreements among fundamentalists with "a harmonious solution" which would convert them all to flood geology. Most of the organising group were Adventists, others included conservative Lutherans with similarly literalist beliefs. [[Bryon C. Nelson]] of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church (United States)| Norwegian Lutheran Church of America]] had included Price's geological views in a 1927 book, and in 1931 published ''The Deluge Story in Stone: A History of the Flood Theory of Geology'', which described Price as the "one very outstanding advocate of the Flood" of the century. The first public RSA conference in March 1936 invited various fundamentalist views, but opened up differences between the organisers on the antiquity of creation and on life before [[Adam]]. The RSA went defunct in 1937, and a dispute continued between Price and Nelson, who now viewed Creation as occurring over 100,000 years previously.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=102–}}

In 1938 Price, with a group of Adventists in Los Angeles, founded what became the ''Deluge Geology Society'' (DGS), with membership restricted to those believing that the [[creation week]] comprised "six literal days, and that the Deluge should be studied as the cause of the major geological changes since creation". Not all DGS-adherents were Adventists; early members included the [[Independent Baptist]] [[Henry M. Morris]] and the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod|Missouri Lutheran]] [[Walter E. Lammerts]]. The DGS undertook field-work: in June 1941 their first ''Bulletin'' hailed the news that the [[Paluxy River]] [[dinosaur]] trackways in Texas appeared to include human footprints. Though Nelson had advised Price in 1939 that this was "absurd" and that the difficulty of human footprints forming during the turmoil of the deluge would "knock the Flood theory all to pieces", in 1943 the DGS began raising funds for "actual excavation" by a Footprint Research Committee of members including the consulting geologist [[Clifford L. Burdick]]. Initially they tried to keep their research secret from "unfriendly scientists". Then in 1945, to encourage backing, they announced giant human footprints, allegedly defeating "at a single stroke" the theory of evolution. The revelation that locals had carved the footprints, and an unsuccessful field trip that year, failed to dampen their hopes. However, by then doctrinal arguments had riven the DGS. The most extreme dispute began in late 1938 after Harold W. Clark observed deep drilling in oil fields and had discussions with practical geologists which dispelled the belief that the fossil sequence was random, convincing him that the evidence of thrust faults was "almost incontrovertible". He wrote to Price, telling his teacher that the "rocks do lie in a much more definite sequence than we have ever allowed", and proposing that the fossil sequence was explained by ecological zones before the flood. Price reacted with fury, and despite Clark emphasising their shared belief in literal recent Creation, the dispute continued. In 1946 Clark set out his views in a book, ''The New Diluvialism'', which Price denounced as ''Theories of Satanic Origin''.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp= 102–135}}

In 1941 [[F. Alton Everest]] co-founded the [[American Scientific Affiliation]] (ASA) as a less confrontational forum for [[Evangelicalism |evangelical]] scientists. Some deluge geologists, including Lammerts and Price, urged close cooperation with the DGS, but Everest began to see their views as presenting an "insurmountable problem" for the ASA. In 1948 he requested [[J. Laurence Kulp]], a geologist in fellowship with the [[Plymouth Brethren]], to explore the issue. At the convention that year, Kulp examined [[Hominidae |hominid]] antiquity demonstrated by [[radiocarbon dating]].{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp= 158–165}}{{sfn|Yang|1993}} At the 1949 convention a paper by Kulp was presented, giving a detailed critique of ''Deluge Geology'', which he said had "grown and infiltrated the greater portion of fundamental Christianity in America primarily due to the absence of trained Christian geologists". Kulp demonstrated that "major propositions of the theory are contraindicated by established physical and chemical laws". He focused on "four basic errors" commonly made by flood geologists:

* saying that geology was the same as evolution
* assuming "that life has been on the earth only for a few thousand years, [and] therefore the flood ''must'' account for geological strata"
* misunderstanding "the physical and chemical conditions under which rocks are formed"
* ignoring recent discoveries such as radiometric dating that undermined their assumptions

Kulp accused Price of ignorance and deception, and concluded that "this unscientific theory of flood geology has done and will do considerable harm to the strong propagation of the gospel among educated people". Price said nothing during the presentation and discussion. When invited to speak, he "said something very brief which missed what everyone was waiting for". Further publications made the ASA's opposition to flood geology clear.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp= 165–169}}{{sfn|Kulp|1950|pp= 1–15}}

===Morris and Whitcomb===
In 1942, [[Henry M. Morris]] was persuaded by Irwin A. Moon's ''Sermons from Science'' of the importance of harmonising science and the Bible, and was introduced to the concepts of a vapor canopy causing the Flood, and its geological effects. About a year later he found [[George McCready Price]]'s ''New Geology'' a "life-changing experience", and joined the  ''Deluge Geology Society''. His book ''That You Might Believe'' for college students included Price's flood geology, and was published in 1946.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=192–197}}

Morris had joined the [[American Scientific Affiliation]] (ASA) in 1949, and in the summer of 1953 he made a presentation on ''The Biblical Evidence for a Recent Creation and Universal Deluge'' at their annual conference, held at the [[Grace Theological Seminary]]'s campus. He impressed a graduate student there, [[John C. Whitcomb, Jr.]] who was teaching Old Testament and Hebrew. To Whitcomb's distress, Morris was "politely denounced" by the ASA members at the presentation.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=187, 197}}

In 1955 the ASA held a joint meeting with the [[Evangelical Theological Society]] (ETS) at the same campus, and there was considerable discussion about ''The Christian View of Science and Scripture'' (1954) by theologian [[Bernard Ramm]]. This book dismissed flood geology as typifying the "ignoble tradition" of fundamentalism, and said that Price could not be taken seriously, as he lacked the necessary competence, training and integrity. Instead, Ramm proposed what he called [[progressive creationism]] in which the Genesis days were pictorial images revealing a process that had taken place over millions of years. Ramm's views were praised by ASA scientists, but the ETS theologians were unwilling to follow Ramm.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=184–189}}

This encouraged Whitcomb to make his doctoral dissertation a response to Ramm and a defence of Price's position. He systematically asked evangelical professors of apologetics, archaeology and the Old Testament about creation and the flood, and in October told Morris that Ramm's book had been sufficient incentive for him to devote his dissertation to the topic. In 1957 Whitcomb's 450 page dissertation, "The Genesis Flood", was completed, and he promptly began summarising it for a book. [[Moody Publishers]] responded positively and agreed with him that chapters on scientific aspects should be carefully checked or written by someone with a PhD in science, but Whitcomb's attempts to find someone with a doctorate in geology were unsuccessful. Morris gave helpful advice, expressing concern that sections were too closely based on Price and [[Immanuel Velikovsky|Velikovsky]] who were "both considered by scientists generally as crackpots". Morris produced an outline of his planned three chapters, and in December 1957 agreed to co-author the book.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=188–192}}

Morris completed his draft in early 1959. His intended 100 pages grew to almost 350, around twice the length of Whitcomb's eventual contribution. Whitcomb raised concerns that "For many people, our position would be somewhat discredited" by prominent references to "Price and Seventh-Day Adventism", and these were deleted. By early 1960 they were impatient at delays when [[Moody Publishers]] had misgivings about the length and literal views of the book, and they went along with [[Rousas Rushdoony]]'s recommendation of a small Philadelphia publishers.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=191–192, 197–199}}

====''The Genesis Flood''====
''[[The Genesis Flood]]'' by Whitcomb and Morris was published by the Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company of Philadelphia in February 1961. Their premise was that the Bible is infallible, "the basic argument of this volume is that the Scriptures are true." For Whitcomb, Genesis described a worldwide Flood which covered all the high mountains, Noah's ark with capacity equivalent to eight freight trains, flood waters from a canopy and the deeps, and subsequent dispersal of animals from Ararat to all the continents via land bridges. He disputed the views published by [[Arthur Custance]] and [[Bernard Ramm]]. Morris then confronted readers with the dilemma of whether to believe Scripture or accept the interpretations of trained geologists, and instead of the latter proposed "a new scheme of historical geology" true both to Scripture and to God's work revealed in nature. This was essentially Price's ''The New Geology'' updated for the 1960s, though with few direct references to Price.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=200–201}}

Like Price before him, Morris argued that most fossil bearing [[stratum|strata]] had been formed during the global Deluge, disputing [[uniformitarianism]], multiple [[ice age]]s, and the [[Geologic record|geologic column]]. He explained the apparent [[Biostratigraphy|fossil sequence]] as the outcome of marine organisms dying in the slurry of sediments in early stages of the Flood, moving currents sorting object by size and shape, and the mobility of vertebrates allowing them to initially escape the floodwaters. He cited [[Walter E. Lammerts|Lammerts]] in support of Price's views about the [[thrust fault]] at [[Chief Mountain]] disproving the sequence. 
The book went beyond Price in some areas. Morris extended the six day creation from the Earth to the entire universe, and said that death and decay had only begun with the [[Fall of Man]], which had therefore introduced [[entropy]] and the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. He proposed that a vapor canopy, before providing water for the Flood, created a mild even climate and shielded the Earth from [[cosmic rays]] so [[radiocarbon dating]] would not work. He cited [[Clifford L. Burdick]]'s testimony that some of the [[Paluxy River]] dinosaur trackways overlapped human footprints, but Burdick failed to confirm this and the section was removed from the third edition.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=202–204}}

===Creation Research Society===
In a 1957 discussion with Whitcomb, [[Walter E. Lammerts]] suggested an "informal association" to exchange ideas, and possibly research, on flood geology. Morris was unavailable to get things started, then around 1961 [[Wiliam J. Tinkle]] got in touch, and they set about recruiting others. They had difficulty in finding supporters with scientific qualifications. The Creation Research Committee of ten they put together on 9 February 1962 had varying views on the age of the Earth, but all opposed evolution. They then succeeded in recruiting others into what became the [[Creation Research Society]] (CRS) in June 1963, and grew rapidly. Getting an agreed statement of belief was problematic, they affirmed that the Bible was "historically and scientifically true in the original autographs" so that "the account of origins in Genesis is a factual presentation of simple historical truths" and "The great flood described in Genesis, commonly referred to as the Noachian Flood, was an historic event worldwide in its extent and effect", but to Morris's disappointment they did not make flood geology mandatory. They lacked a qualified geologist, and Morris persuaded the group to appoint [[Clifford L. Burdick]] as their only [[Earth science|Earth scientist]], overcoming initial concerns raised by Lammerts. The CRS grew rapidly, with an increasing proportion of the membership adhering to strict young Earth flood geology.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=214–215, 222–233}}

The resources of the CRS for its first decade went into publication of the CRS ''Quarterly'', and a project to publish a creationist school book. Since the 1920s most U.S. schools had not taught pupils about evolution, but [[Sputnik]] exposed apparent weaknesses of U.S. science education and the [[Biological Sciences Curriculum Study]] produced textbooks in 1963 which included the topic. When the [[Texas Education Agency]] held a hearing in October 1964 about adopting these textbooks, creationist objectors were unable to name suitable creationist alternatives. Lammerts organised a CRS textbook committee which lined up a group of authors, with John N. Moore as senior editor bringing their contributions together into a suitable textbook.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=238–240}}

=== Creation science ===
{{main|Creation science}}
The teaching of evolution, reintroduced in 1963 by the [[Biological Sciences Curriculum Study]] textbooks, was prohibited by laws in some states. These bans were contested; the ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' case which began late in 1965 was decided in 1968 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruling that such laws violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=238–239, 241}}

Some creationists thought a legal [[Abington School District v. Schempp|decision requiring religious neutrality in schools]] should shield their children from teachings hostile to their religion; Nell. J. Segraves and Jean E. Sumrall (a friend of Lammerts who was also associated with the [[Creation Research Society]] and the Bible-Science Association) petitioned the [[California State Board of Education]] to require that school biology texts designate evolution a theory. In 1966 [[Max Rafferty]] as [[California State Superintendent of Public Instruction]] suggested that they demand equal time for creation, as the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] allowed teachers to mention religion as long as they did not promote specific doctrines. Their first attempt failed, but in 1969 controversy arose over a proposed ''Science Framework for California Schools''. Anticipating success, they and others in the Bible-Science Association formed ''Creation Science, Inc.'', to produce textbooks. A compromise acceptable to Segraves, Sumrall and the Board was suggested by [[Vernon L. Grose]], and the revised 1970 ''Framework'' included "While the Bible and other philosophical treatises also mention creation, science has independently postulated the various theories of creation. Therefore, creation in scientific terms is not a religious or philosophical belief." The result kept school texts free of creationism, but downgraded evolution to mere speculative theory.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=243–244}}

Creationists reacted to the California developments with a new confidence that they could introduce their ideas into schools by minimizing biblical references. [[Henry M. Morris]] declared that "Creationism is on the way back, this time not primarily as a religious belief, but as an alternative scientific explanation of the world in which we live." In 1970 ''Creation Science, Inc.'', combined with a planned studies center at [[San Diego Christian College|Christian Heritage College]] as the Creation-Science Research Center. Morris moved to [[San Diego]] to become director of the center and academic vice-president of the college. In the fall he presented a course at the college on "Scientific Creationism", the first time he is known to have used the term in public. (Two years later, the Creation-Science Research Center split with part becoming the [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) led by Morris.){{sfn|Numbers|1993|p=244}}

The Creation Research Society (CRS) had found schoolbook publishers reluctant to take on their textbook, and eventually the Christian publishing company [[Zondervan]] brought out ''Biology: A Search for Order in Complexity'' in 1970. The ten thousand copies printed sold out within a year, and they produced 25,000 as the second impression, but hardly any public schools adopted the book. A preface by Morris claimed that there were two philosophies of creation, "the doctrine of evolution and the doctrine of special creation", attempting to give both equal validity.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=238–241}} The book mostly covered uncontroversial details of biology, but asserted that these were correctly seen as "God's creation" or "divine creation", and presented biblical creation as the correct scientific view. A chapter on "Weaknesses of Geologic Evidence" disputed evolutionary theories while asserting a "fact that most fossil material was laid down by the flood in Noah's time". Another chapter disputed evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name="TOA Hendren"&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hendren/hendren_v_campbell.html ''Hendren v. Campbell'': Decision Against a Creationist Textbook], [[Nick Matzke]], [[TalkOrigins Archive]], 20 August 2006.  Accessed 27 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Creation Research Society Quarterly'' for September 1971 Morris introduced the "[[false dilemma|two-model approach]]" asserting that evolution and creation were both equally scientific and equally religious, and soon afterwards he said they were "competing scientific hypotheses". For the third printing of ''Biology: A Search for Order in Complexity'' in 1974, the editor John N. Moore added a preface setting out this approach as "the two basic viewpoints of origins", the "evolution model" and the "creation model". When an [[Indiana]] school decided to use the book as their biology text, the ''[[Hendren v. Campbell]]'' district court case banned its use in public schools as infringing the Establishment Clause. Judge Michael T. Dugan, II, described it as "a text obviously designed to present ''only'' the view of Biblical Creationism in a favorable light", contravening the constitution by promotion of a specific sectarian religious view.&lt;ref name="TOA Hendren" /&gt;{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=239–245}}

As a tactic to gain the same scientific status as evolution, flood geology proponents had effectively relabeled the Bible-based flood geology of [[George McCready Price]] as "creation science" or "scientific creationism" by the mid 1970s. At the CRS board meeting in the Spring of 1972, members were told to start using "scientific creationism", a phrase used interchangeably with "creation science"; Morris explained that preferences differed, though neither was ideal as "one simple term" could not "identify such a complex and comprehensive subject."  In the 1974 ICR handbook for high-school teachers titled ''Scientific Creationism'', Morris used the two-model approach to support his argument that creationism could "be taught without reference to the book of Genesis or to other religious literature or to religious doctrines", and in public schools only the "basic scientific creation model" should be taught, rather than biblical creationism which "would open the door to wide interpretations of Genesis" or to non-Christian [[Cosmogony|cosmogonies]]. He did not deny having been influenced by the Bible. In his preface to the book dated July 1974, Morris as editor outlined how the "Public School Edition" of the book evaluated evidence from a "strictly scientific point of view" without "reference to the Bible or other religious literature", while the "General Edition" was "essentially identical" except for an additional chapter on "Creation according to Scripture" that "places the scientific evidence in its proper biblical and theological context."{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=242–246}}{{sfn|Morris|1974|p=}}

The main ideas in creation science are: the belief in "creation ''[[ex nihilo]]''" (Latin: out of nothing); the conviction that the Earth was created within the last 6,000 years; the belief that mankind and other life on Earth were created as distinct fixed "baraminological" ''kinds''; and the idea that fossils found in geological strata were deposited during a cataclysmic [[Deluge (mythology)|flood]] which completely covered the entire Earth.&lt;ref name=ag&gt;{{cite court | litigants = Edwards v.

==Creationist arguments for a global flood ==

=== Fossils ===
The [[geologic timescale|geologic column]] and the [[fossil]] record are used as major pieces of evidence in the modern scientific explanation of the development and [[evolution]] of life on Earth as well as a means to establish the [[age of the Earth]]. [[Young Earth Creationists]] such as Morris and Whitcomb in their 1961 book, ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'', say that the age of the fossils depends on the amount of time credited to the geologic column, which they ascribe to be about one year. Some flood geologists dispute geology's assembled global geologic column since index fossils are used to link geographically isolated strata to other strata across the map.  Fossils are often dated by their proximity to strata containing index fossils whose age has been determined by its location on the geologic column. Oard{{sfn|Oard|Reed|2006|p=99}} and others say that the identification of fossils as index fossils has been too error-prone for index fossils to be used reliably to make those correlations, or to date local strata using the assembled geologic scale.

Other creationists accept the existence of the geological column and believe that it indicates a sequence of events that might have occurred during the global flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://answersingenesis.org/geology/geologic-time-scale/geologic-column/|title=Geologic Column|website=Answers in Genesis|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Institute for Creation Research]] creationists such as Andrew Snelling, Steven A. Austin and [[Kurt Wise]] take this approach, as does Creation Ministries International. They cite the [[Cambrian explosion]] — the appearance of abundant fossils in the upper [[Ediacaran]] (Vendian) Period and lower [[Cambrian Period]]  — as the pre-Flood/Flood boundary,{{sfn|Hunter|2000|pp=60–74}} the presence in such sediments of fossils that do not occur later in the geological record as part of a pre–flood biota that perished{{sfn|Wise|1995|pp=216–222}} and the absence of fossilized organisms that appear later (such as [[angiosperm]]s and [[mammal]]s) as due to erosion of sediments deposited by the flood as waters receded off the land.{{sfn|Austin|Baumgardner|Humphreys|Snelling|1994}} Creationists say that [[Fossilization#Rarity of fossils|fossilization]] can only take place when the organism is buried quickly to protect the remains from destruction by scavengers or decomposition.{{sfn|Whitcomb|Morris|1961|pp=128–129}} They say that the fossil record provides evidence of a single cataclysmic flood and not of a series of slow changes accumulating over millions of years.{{sfn|Brown|2008|p=}}

Flood geologists have proposed numerous hypotheses to reconcile the sequence of fossils evident in the fossil column with the literal account of Noah's flood in the Bible. Whitcomb and Morris proposed three possible factors:

# hydrological, whereby the relative buoyancies of the remains (based on the organisms' shapes and densities) determined the sequence in which their remains settled to the bottom of the flood-waters
# ecological, suggesting organisms living at the ocean bottom succumbed first in the flood and those living at the highest altitudes last
# anatomical/behavioral, the ordered sequence in the fossil column resulting from the very different responses to the rising waters between different kinds of organisms due to their diverse mobilities and original habitats.{{sfn|Gould|1984|p=132}}  In a scenario put forth by Morris, the remains of marine life settled to the bottom first, followed by the slower-moving lowland reptiles, and culminating with humans, whose superior intelligence and ability to flee enabled them to reach higher elevations before the flood waters overcame them.{{sfn|Schadewald|1982|pp=12–17}}

Some creationists believe that [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[coal]] deposits formed rapidly in sedimentary layers as volcanoes or flood waters flattened forests and buried the debris.  They believe the vegetation decomposed rapidly into oil or coal due to the heat of the subterranean waters as they were unleashed from the Earth during the flood or by the high temperatures created as the remains were compressed by water and sediment.{{sfn|Snelling|2006}}

[[creationism|Creationists]] continue to search for evidence in the natural world that they consider consistent with the above description, such as evidence of rapid formation. For example, there have been claims of raindrop marks and water ripples at layer boundaries, sometimes associated with the claimed fossilized footprints of men and dinosaurs walking together. Such footprint evidence has been debunked{{sfn|Schadewald|1986|pp=1–9}} and some have been shown to be fakes.{{sfn|Kuban|1996}}

=== Widespread flood stories ===
:see [[List of flood myths]]
Proponents of Flood Geology state that "native global flood stories are documented as history or legend in almost every region on earth". "These flood tales are frequently linked by common elements that parallel the biblical account including the warning of the coming flood, the construction of a boat in advance, the storage of animals, the inclusion of family, and the release of birds to determine if the water level had subsided." They suggest that "the overwhelming consistency among flood legends found in distant parts of the globe indicates they were derived from the same origin, but oral transcription has changed the details through time".{{sfn|Northwest Creation Network}}

Anthropologist Patrick Nunn rejects this view and highlights the fact that much of the human population lives near water sources such as rivers and coasts, where unusually severe floods can be expected to occur occasionally and will be recorded in tribal mythology.{{sfn|Nunn|2001|pp125-138}}

== Proposed mechanisms of flood geology ==
[[George McCready Price]] attempted to fit a great deal of earth's geological history into a model based on a few accounts from the Bible. Price's simple model was used by Whitcomb and Morris initially but they did not build on the model in the 60s and 70s.{{sfn|Heaton|2008|p=1342}} However, a rough sketch of a creationist model could be constructed from creationist publications and debate material.{{sfn|Awbrey|1980|p=1}} Recent creationist efforts attempt to build complex models that incorporate as much scientific evidence as possible into the Biblical narrative. Some scientific evidence used for these models was formerly rejected by creationists. These models attempt to explain continental movements in a short time frame, the order of the fossil record, and the [[Pleistocene]] ice age.{{sfn|Heaton|2008|p=1341}}

=== Runaway subduction ===
In the 60s and 70s a simple creationist model proposed that, "The Flood split the land mass into the present continents."{{sfn|Awbrey|1980|p=1}} Steve Austin and other creationists proposed a preliminary model of catastrophic plate tectonics (CPT) in 1994.{{sfn|Austin|Baumgardner|Humphreys|Snelling|Vardiman|Wise|1994}} Their work built on earlier papers by [[John Baumgardner]] and [[Russell Humphreys]] in 1986.{{sfn|Baumgardner|1986}}{{sfn|Humphreys|1986}} Baumgardner proposed a model of mantle convection that allows for runaway subduction and Humphrey associated mantle convection with rapid magnetic reversals in earth history. Baumgardner's proposal holds that the rapid plunge of former oceanic plates into the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] (caused by an unknown trigger-mechanism) increased local mantle pressures to the point that its viscosity dropped several magnitudes according to known properties of mantle silicates.  Once initiated, sinking plates caused the spread of low viscosity throughout the mantle resulting in runaway mantle-convection and catastrophic [[tectonic]] motion which dragged continents across the surface of the earth. Once the former ocean plates, which are thought to be denser than the mantle, reached the bottom of the mantle an equilibrium resulted.  Pressures dropped, viscosity increased, runaway mantle-convection stopped, leaving the surface of the earth rearranged.  Proponents point to subducted slabs in the mantle which are still relatively cool, which they regard as evidence that they have not been there for millions of years which would result in temperature equilibration.{{sfn|Baumgardner|2003}}

Given that conventional [[plate tectonics]] accounts for much of the geomorphic features of continents and oceans, it is natural that creationists would seek to develop a high speed version of the same process. CPT explains many geological features, provides mechanisms for the Biblical flood, and minimizes appeals to miracles.{{sfn|Heaton|2008|p=1348}}

Some prominent creationists (Froede, Oard, Read) oppose CPT for various technical reasons. One main objection is that the model assumes the super continent [[Pangaea]] was intact at the initiation of the year-long flood. The CPT process then tore Pangaea apart creating the current configuration of the continents. But the breakup of Pangaea started early in the [[Mesozoic]], meaning that CPT only accounts for part of the entire [[Phanerozoic]] geological record. CPT in this form only explains part of the geological column that flood geology normally explains. Modifying the CPT model to account for the entire Phanerozoic including multiple [[Wilson Cycle]]s would complicate the model considerably.{{sfn|Heaton|2008|pp=1348–1349}}

Other objections of CPT include the amount of heat produced for the rapid plate movements, and the fact that the cooling of hot oceanic plates and the raising of continental plates would take a great deal of time and require multiple small scale catastrophes after the flood ended. The original CPT proposal of Austin and others in 1994 was admittedly preliminary but the major issues have not been solved.{{sfn|Heaton|2008|pp=1349–1350}}

The vast majority of geologists regard the hypothesis of catastrophic plate tectonics as pseudoscience; they reject it in favor of the conventional geological theory of plate tectonics. It has been argued that the tremendous release of energy necessitated by such an event would boil off the Earth's oceans, making a global flood impossible.{{sfn|Wise|1998|pp=160–173}} Not only does catastrophic plate tectonics lack any plausible [[Geophysics|geophysical]] mechanism by which its changes might occur, it also is contradicted by considerable geological evidence (which is in turn consistent with conventional plate tectonics), including:{{sfn|Isaak|2007|p=173 [http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD750.html Creationist claim CD750]}}

* The fact that a number of volcanic [[island#Oceanic islands|oceanic island]] chains, such as the [[Hawaiian islands]], yield evidence of the ocean floor having moved over volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hot-spots]]. These islands have widely ranging ages (determined via both [[radiometric dating]] and relative [[erosion]]) that contradict the catastrophic tectonic hypothesis of rapid development and thus a similar age.
* Radiometric dating and [[sedimentation]] rates on the [[ocean floor]] likewise contradict the hypothesis that it all came into existence nearly contemporaneously.
* Catastrophic tectonics does not allow sufficient time for [[guyot]]s to have their peak eroded away (leaving these [[seamount]]s' characteristic flat tops).
* Runaway subduction does not explain the kind of [[continental collision]] illustrated by that of the [[Indian Plate|Indian]] and [[Eurasian Plate]]s. (For further information see [[Orogeny]].)

Conventional plate tectonics accounts for the geological evidence already, including innumerable details that catastrophic plate tectonics cannot, such as why there is gold in California, silver in Nevada, salt flats in Utah, and coal in Pennsylvania, without requiring any extraordinary mechanisms to do so.{{sfn|Isaak|2007|p=173 [http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD750.html Creationist claim CD750]}}{{sfn|McPhee|1998}}

=== Vapor/water canopy ===
Isaac Vail (1840–1912), a [[Quaker]] schoolteacher, in his 1912 work ''The Earth's Annular System'', extrapolated from the [[nebular hypothesis]] what he called the annular system of earth history, with the earth being originally surrounded by rings resembling [[Saturn's rings|those of Saturn]], or "canopies" of [[water vapor]]. Vail hypothesised that, one by one, these canopies collapsed on the Earth, resulting in fossils being buried in a "succession of stupendous cataclysms, separated by unknown periods of time". The Genesis flood was thought to have been caused by "the last remnant" of this vapor. Although this final flood was geologically significant, it was not held to account for as much of the fossil record as [[George McCready Price]] had asserted.{{sfn|Numbers|2006|pp=347–348}} 

Vail's ideas about geology appeared in [[Charles Taze Russell]]'s ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]'' and subsequently in [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]]'s ''Creation'' of 1927 and later publications.{{sfn|Numbers|2006|pp=347–348}}&lt;ref name="Penton1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=M. James Penton|title=Apocalypse Delayed: The Story of Jehovah's Witnesses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=38SYXalMLeQC|year=1997|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-7973-2|pages=196–197, 429–430}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] physicist Robert W. Woods also proposed a vapor canopy,{{sfn|Numbers|2006|p=501. (footnote 47)}} before ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'' gave it prominent and repeated mention in 1961.{{sfn|Numbers|2006|p=229}}

Though the vapor-canopy theory has fallen into disfavour among most creationists, Dillow in 1981 and Vardiman in 2003 attempted to defend the idea.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://answersingenesis.org/home/area/tools/flood-waters.asp Noah’s Flood – Where did the water come from?"] ''Answers in Genesis, 2014.'' Retrieved 4 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dillow|1981}}{{sfn|Vardiman|2003}} Among its more vocal adherents, controversial Young Earth Creationist [[Kent Hovind]] uses it as the basis for his eponymous [[Kent Hovind#The "Hovind Theory"|"Hovind Theory"]]. Jehovah's Witnesses propose as the water source of the deluge a "heavenly ocean" that was over the earth from the second creative day until the Flood.&lt;ref&gt;Insight into the Scriptures Volume 1 (1988) pg 609–612: http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200001150&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern geology and flood geology ==
[[File:Hutton Unconformity , Jedburgh.jpg|thumb|upright|right|In the 18th century, finds such as [[Hutton's Unconformity]] showing layers tilted, eroded, and overlaid, demonstrated the "abyss of time" in the [[geologic time scale]].]]
Modern geology, its sub-disciplines and other scientific disciplines utilize the [[scientific method]] to analyze the geology of the earth. The key tenets of flood geology are refuted by scientific analysis and do not have any standing in the [[scientific community]].{{sfn|Young|1995}}{{sfn|Isaak|2006}}{{sfn|Morton|2001}}{{sfn|Isaak|2007|p=173}}{{sfn|Stewart|2010|p=123}} Modern [[geology]] relies on a number of established principles, one of the most important of which is [[Charles Lyell]]'s principle of [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]]. In relation to geological forces it states that the shaping of the Earth has occurred by means of mostly slow-acting forces that can be seen in operation today. By applying these principles, geologists have determined that the Earth is approximately [[Age of the Earth|4.54 billion years old]]. They study the [[lithosphere]] of the Earth to gain information on the history of the planet. Geologists divide [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] into [[Eon (geology)|eons]], [[Era (geology)|eras]], [[Period (geology)|periods]], [[Epoch (geology)|epochs]], and [[faunal stages]] characterized by well-defined breaks in the [[fossil record]] (see [[Geologic time scale]]).{{sfn|Lutgens|Tarbuck|Tasa|2005}}{{sfn|Tarbuck|Lutgens|2006}}  In general, there is a lack of any evidence for any of the above effects proposed by flood geologists and their claims of fossil layering are not taken seriously by scientists.{{sfn|Isaak|1998}}

===Erosion===
[[File:Siccar point SE cliff.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Unconformity|angular unconformity]] found by [[James Hutton]] in 1788 at [[Siccar Point]] demonstrated the time taken for erosion of tilted rock and deposition of overlying layers.]]
The global flood cannot explain geological formations such as [[Unconformity|angular unconformities]], where [[sedimentary rock]]s have been tilted and eroded then more sedimentary layers deposited on top, needing long periods of time for these processes. There is also the time needed for the erosion of valleys in sedimentary rock mountains. In another example, the flood, had it occurred, should also have produced large-scale effects spread throughout the entire world. Erosion should be evenly distributed, yet the levels of erosion in, for example, the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]] differ significantly.{{sfn|Isaak|1998}}

===Geochronology===
[[File:CarmelHdgd.jpg|thumb|right|This [[Jurassic]] carbonate hardground shows generations of [[oysters]] and extensive [[bioerosion]], features incompatible with the conditions and timing postulated for the Flood.{{sfn|Morton|2001}}]]
[[File:CalciteAragonite.jpg|thumb|right|The alternation of calcite and aragonite seas through [[geologic time]].{{sfn|Sandberg|1983|pp=19–22}}]]
[[Geochronology]] is the science of determining the [[absolute dating|absolute]] age of rocks, fossils, and sediments by a variety of techniques. These methods indicate that the Earth as a whole is about 4.54 billion years old, and that the strata that, according to flood geology, were laid down during the Flood some 6,000 years ago, were actually deposited gradually over many millions of years.

===Paleontology===
If the flood were responsible for fossilization, then all the animals now fossilized must have been living together on the Earth just before the flood. Based on estimates of the number of remains buried in the [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo fossil formation]] in [[Africa]], this would correspond to an abnormally high density of vertebrates worldwide, close to 2100 per acre.{{sfn|Schadewald|1982|pp=12–17}}
Creationists argue that evidence for the [[Geologic time scale|geological column]] is fragmentary, and all the complex layers of chalk occurred in the approach to the 150th day of Noah's flood.{{sfn|Wilson|2001}}{{sfn|Mathews|2009}} However, the entire geologic column is found in several places, and shows multiple features, including evidence of erosion and burrowing through older layers, which are inexplicable on a short timescale. Carbonate hardgrounds and the fossils associated with them show that the so-called flood sediments include evidence of long hiatuses in deposition that are not consistent with flood dynamics or timing.{{sfn|Morton|2001}}

===Geochemistry===
Proponents of Flood Geology are also unable to account for the alternation between [[calcite sea]]s and [[aragonite sea]]s through the Phanerozoic.  The cyclical pattern of [[carbonate hardgrounds]], calcitic and aragonitic ooids, and calcite-shelled fauna has apparently been controlled by [[seafloor spreading]] rates and the flushing of seawater through [[hydrothermal vent]]s which changes its Mg/Ca ratio.{{sfn|Stanley|Hardie|1999|pp1-7}}

===Sedimentary rock features ===
Phil Senter's 2011 article, "The Defeat of Flood Geology by Flood Geology", in the journal ''[[National Center for Science Education|Reports of the National Center for Science Education]]'', discusses "sedimentologic and other geologic features that Flood geologists have identified as evidence that particular strata cannot have been deposited during a time when the entire planet was under water ... and distribution of strata that predate the existence of the Ararat mountain chain." These include continental basalts, terrestrial tracks of animals, and marine communities preserving multiple in-situ generations included in the rocks of most or all Phanerozoic periods, and the basalt even in the younger Precambrian rocks. Others, occurring in rocks of several geologic periods, include lake deposits and eolian (wind) deposits. Using their own words, Flood geologists find evidence in every Paleozoic and Mesozoic period, and in every epoch of the Cenozoic period, indicating that a global flood could not have occurred during that interval.&lt;ref name="Defeat of Flood Geology by Flood Geology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reports.ncse.com/index.php/rncse/article/view/44/36 |title=The Defeat of Flood Geology by Flood Geology  |author=Phil Senter |authorlink= |date=2011 |format= |work= Vol 31, No 3 |publisher=  Reports of the National Center for Science Education|pages=   |quote= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MMR vaccine and autism ==
In 1998 [[Andrew Wakefield]] published a fraudulent article in a ''The Lancet'', a prominent British medical journal, claiming that the MMR [[vaccines caused autism]].&lt;ref name="3."/&gt; Although the article was later retracted, the idea that vaccines cause autism became a major news story.&lt;ref name=Goldacre-2008&gt;{{cite news |title= The MMR hoax |author= Goldacre B |work=The Guardian |date=30 August 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-30 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/30/mmr.health.media|archiveurl=http://www.badscience.net/2008/08/the-medias-mmr-hoax/|archivedate=30 August 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time that scientists had shown the narrative to be false, it had become part of the folk epidemiology of autism.&lt;ref name="1."/&gt;&lt;ref name="3."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=B.|title=Vaccines and the changing epidemiology of autism|journal=Child: Care, Health and Development|volume=32|issue=5|year=2006|pages=511–519|issn=0305-1862|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00655.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative was easy to understand and apparently consistent with anecdotal evidence of children receiving autism diagnoses shortly after having been vaccinated. Doctors were highly critical of the media coverage for triggering a decline in vaccination rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/5118166.stm|title= Doctors issue plea over MMR jab|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-02-04 | date=26 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The false belief has persisted despite a public information campaign aimed at making parents aware that by refusing vaccinations they are putting their children at risk of contracting infectious diseases that are frequently fatal.&lt;ref name=MMRthefacts/&gt;

===Mass media===
Observers have criticized the involvement of mass media in the controversy alleging that the media provided Wakefield's study with more credibility than it deserved.&lt;ref name=EMBOreports&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moore Andrew | year = 2006 | title = Bad science in the headlines: Who takes responsibility when science is distorted in the mass media? | url = http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v7/n12/full/7400862.html | journal = [[EMBO Reports]] | volume = 7 | issue = 12| pages = 1193–1196 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400862 | pmc = 1794697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endorsements by [[celebrity|celebrities]] such as [[Jenny McCarthy]] and [[Robert F.

[https://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience/all/1]&lt;/ref&gt; Later commentary faulted the coverage for giving a misleading impression of the degree to which the evidence supported a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.&lt;ref name=hilton&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hilton S, Petticrew M, Hunt K | year = 2007 | title = Parents' champions vs. vested interests: Who do parents believe about MMR?

===Consequences===
The scientific consensus is that the MMR vaccine has no link to the development of autism, and that the vaccine's benefits greatly outweigh its risks.&lt;ref name=MMRthefacts/&gt; The false belief that the [[MMR vaccine]] causes autism led to a sharp drop in rates of vaccination in the UK and Ireland after 1998, creating a major public health risk. Lower vaccination rates were followed by increases in the incidence of measles and mumps, and the resulting cases of permanent disability and death.&lt;ref name=McIntyre/&gt;

Public fears about vaccination have consumed resources that might otherwise have advanced research into the real causes of autism.&lt;ref name="5."/&gt; There have been thirteen studies that properly followed the [[scientific method]] and contained large numbers of participants that failed to connect autism to the [[MMR vaccine]].&lt;ref name="4."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerber|first1=Jeffrey S.|last2=Offit|first2=Paul A.|title=Vaccines and Autism: A Tale of Shifting Hypotheses|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=48|issue=4|year=2009|pages=456–461|issn=1058-4838|doi=10.1086/596476|pmc=2908388}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been seven well-constructed studies that have attempted to link autism to [[thiomersal]] in vaccines and were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="4."/&gt; Special interest groups continue to push for more research on the link between vaccines and autism.&lt;ref name="4."/&gt;&lt;ref name="5."/&gt; Further research motivated by the folk epidemiology of autism would represent a lost opportunity to investigate autism's true causes.&lt;ref name="5."/&gt;

'''Futures studies''' (also called '''futurology''') is the study of postulating possible, probable, and preferable [[future]]s and the worldviews and myths that underlie them. In general, it can be considered as a branch of the [[social science]]s and parallel to the field of [[history]]. Futures studies (colloquially called "'''futures'''" by many of the field's practitioners) seeks to understand what is likely to continue and what could plausibly change.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Wisdom and foresight in Chinese thought: sensing the immediate future. Journal of Futures Studies. 22(3), pp. 35-50. https://doi.org/10.6531/JFS.2018.22(3).00A35&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the discipline thus seeks a systemic and pattern-based understanding of past and present, and to determine the likelihood of future events and trends.&lt;ref name=Wordnet&gt;{{cite web|title=Futurology|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=futurology&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o8=1&amp;o1=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o9=&amp;o6=&amp;o3=&amp;o4=&amp;h=|work=Wordnet Search 3.1|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the physical sciences where a narrower, more specified system is studied, futures studies concerns a much bigger and more complex world system.&lt;ref&gt;Hammershøj, L.G., 2017. Diagnosis of the Times. Handbook of Anticipation: Theoretical and Applied Aspects of the Use of Future in Decision Making, Springer Publishers, pp.1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology and knowledge are much less proven as compared to [[natural science]] or even [[social science]] like [[sociology]] and [[economics]]. There is a debate as to whether this discipline is an art or science and sometimes described by scientists as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095839389|work=The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy|location=futurology|year=2008|quote=Mainly a pseudo-science, given the complexities of social, political, economic, technological, and natural factors.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=William|first=F.

== Overview ==
Futures studies is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary field]], studying past and present changes, and aggregating and analyzing both lay and professional strategies and opinions with respect to future. It includes analyzing the sources, patterns, and causes of change and stability in an attempt to develop foresight and to map possible futures.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Iterative lagged asymmetric responses in strategic management and long-range planning. Time &amp; Society, OnlineFirst, https://doi.org/10.1177/0961463X17752652 .&lt;/ref&gt; Around the world the field is variously referred to as '''futures studies''', '''[[strategic foresight]]''', '''futuristics''', '''futures thinking''', '''futuring''', and '''futurology'''. Futures studies and strategic foresight are the academic field's most commonly used terms in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world.

'''Foresight''' was the original term and was first used in this sense by [[H.G. Wells]] in 1932.&lt;ref name="Wells, H.G. 1932 p. 89-91"&gt;Wells, H.G. (1932) 1987. Wanted: Professors of Foresight! ''Futures Research Quarterly'' V3N1 (Spring): p. 89-91.&lt;/ref&gt; "Futurology" is a term common in encyclopedias, though it is used almost exclusively by nonpractitioners today, at least in the English-speaking world. "Futurology" is defined as the "study of the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nandankanan.tripod.com/scienceterms.htm|title=SCIENCE GLOSSARY|work=tripod.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[German people|German]] professor [[Ossip K. Flechtheim]] in the mid-1940s, who proposed it as a new branch of knowledge that would include a new science of [[probability]]. This term may have fallen from favor in recent decades because modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and probability, versus the creation of possible and preferable futures.&lt;ref&gt;Hammershøj, L.G., 2017. Diagnosis of the Times. Handbook of Anticipation: Theoretical and Applied Aspects of the Use of Future in Decision Making, pp.1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three factors usually distinguish futures studies from the research conducted by other disciplines (although all of these disciplines overlap, to differing degrees).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Schultz, W.L., 2015. A brief history of futures. World Future Review, 7(4), pp.324-331.&lt;/ref&gt; First, futures studies often examines not only possible but also probable, preferable, and "wild card" futures. Second, futures studies typically attempts to gain a [[Holism|holistic]] or [[systemics|systemic]] view based on insights from a range of different disciplines, generally focusing on the STEEP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is STEEP Analysis?|url=http://pestleanalysis.com/what-is-steep-analysis/|website=PESTLE Analysis|accessdate=6 March 2017|date=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; categories of Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental and Political. Third, futures studies challenges and unpacks the assumptions behind dominant and contending views of the future. The future thus is not empty but fraught with hidden assumptions. For example, many people expect the collapse of the Earth's ecosystem in the near future, while others believe the current ecosystem will survive indefinitely. A foresight approach would seek to analyze and highlight the assumptions underpinning such views.

As a field, futures studies expands on the research component, by emphasizing the communication of a strategy and the actionable steps needed to implement the plan or plans leading to the preferable future.  It is in this regard, that futures studies evolves from an academic exercise to a more traditional business-like practice, looking to better prepare organizations for the future.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Futures studies does not generally focus on short term predictions such as [[interest rate]]s over the next [[business cycle]], or of managers or investors with short-term time horizons. Most strategic planning, which develops operational plans for preferred futures with time horizons of one to three years, is also not considered futures. Plans and strategies with longer time horizons that specifically attempt to anticipate possible future events are definitely part of the field.  As a rule, futures studies is generally concerned with changes of transformative impact, rather than those of an incremental or narrow scope.

The futures field also excludes those who make future predictions through professed [[supernatural]] means.

==History==

=== Origins ===
[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger - Sir Thomas More - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|215x215px|[[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]], originator of the 'Utopian' ideal.]]
[[Johan Galtung]] and [[Sohail Inayatullah]]&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan and Inayatullah, Sohail (1997). ''Macrohistory and Macrohistorians''. Westport, Ct: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; argue in ''Macrohistory and Macrohistorians'' that the search for grand patterns of social change goes all the way back to [[Sima Qian|Ssu-Ma Chien]] (145-90BC) and his theory of the cycles of virtue, although the work of [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406) such as ''The Muqaddimah''&lt;ref&gt;Khaldun, Ibn (1967), ''The Muqaddimah'', Trans. Franz Rosenthal, ed. N.J. Dawood. Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; would be an example that is perhaps more intelligible to modern sociology. Early western examples include [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]]’s “[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]],” published in 1516, and based upon Plato’s “Republic,” in which a future society has overcome poverty and misery to create a perfect model for living. This work was so powerful that utopias have come to represent positive and fulfilling futures in which everyone’s needs are met.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elon.edu/docs/e-web/predictions/futures%20studies%20timeline.pdf|title=Futures Studies Timeline|last=Anderson|first=Janna|date=|website=www.elon.edu|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some intellectual foundations of futures studies appeared in the mid-19th century. Isadore [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], considered the father of scientific philosophy, was heavily influenced by the work of utopian socialist [[Henri de Saint-Simon|Henri Saint-Simon]], and his discussion of the metapatterns of [[social change]] presages futures studies as a scholarly [[dialogue]].&lt;ref name="Bell 1997"&gt;{{cite book| last=Bell| first=Wendell| year=1997| title=Foundations of Futures Studies: Human Science for a New Era| publisher=Transaction Publishers| location=New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA | isbn=978-1-56000-271-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first works that attempt to make systematic predictions for the future were written in the 18th century. ''[[Memoirs of the Twentieth Century]]'' written by [[Samuel Madden]] in 1733, takes the form of a series of diplomatic letters written in 1997 and 1998 from British representatives in the foreign cities of [[Constantinople]], [[Rome]], [[Paris]], and [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;"Samuel Madden's ''Memoirs of the Twentieth Century''" Paul Alkon. ''Science Fiction Studies'' Vol. 12, No. 2 (Jul., 1985), pp. 184-201 Published by: SF-TH Inc&lt;/ref&gt; However, the technology of the 20th century is identical to that of Madden's own era - the focus is instead on the political and religious state of the world in the future. Madden went on to write ''The Reign of George VI, 1900 to 1925'', where (in the context of the [[History of the British canal system|boom in canal construction at the time]]) he envisioned a large network of waterways that would radically transform patterns of living - "Villages grew into towns and towns became cities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/nov/06/features11.g21|title=And now for the forecast|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2000-11-06|last1=Margolis|first1=Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845, [[Scientific American]], the oldest continuously published magazine in the U.S., began publishing articles about scientific and technological research, with a focus upon the future implications of such research. It would be followed in 1872 by the magazine [[Popular Science]], which was aimed at a more general readership.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The genre of [[science fiction]] became established towards the end of the 19th century, with notable writers, including [[Jules Verne]] and [[H. G. Wells]], setting their stories in an imagined future world.

===Early 20th Century===
[[File:H G Wells pre 1922.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[H. G. Wells]] first advocated for 'future studies' in a lecture delivered in 1902.]]
According to [[W. Warren Wagar]], the founder of future studies was [[H. G. Wells]]. His ''[[Anticipations|Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress Upon Human Life and Thought: An Experiment in Prophecy]]'', was first serially published in ''[[The Fortnightly Review]]'' in 1901.&lt;ref name="Wagar"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnrf.org/cms/hgwells.shtml|title=H.G. Wells and the Genesis of Future Studies|author=W. Warren Wagar|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating what the world would be like in the year 2000, the book is interesting both for its hits (trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of population from cities to suburbs; moral restrictions declining as men and women seek greater sexual freedom; the defeat of German [[militarism]], the existence of a European Union, and a world order maintained by "English-speaking peoples" based on the urban core between Chicago and New York&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anticipations]]'', p 100-101, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;) and its misses (he did not expect successful [[aircraft]] before 1950, and averred that "my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanityplus.org/learn/about-us/wells |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520001844/http://humanityplus.org/learn/about-us/wells |archivedate=20 May 2009 |title=Annual HG Wells Award for Outstanding Contributions to Transhumanism |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Frank Miller|title=Contesting Cultural Authority: Essays in Victorian Intellectual Life|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37257-2|pages=219–20|chapter=Public Science in Britain 1880–1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moving from narrow technological predictions, Wells envisioned the eventual collapse of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] world system after a series of destructive [[total war]]s. From this havoc would ultimately emerge a world of peace and plenty, controlled by competent [[technocrat]]s.&lt;ref name="Wagar"/&gt;

The work was a [[bestseller]], and Wells was invited to deliver a lecture at the [[Royal Institution]] in 1902, entitled ''[[The Discovery of the Future]]''. The lecture was well-received and was soon republished in book form. He advocated for the establishment of a new academic study of the future that would be grounded in scientific methodology rather than just speculation. He argued that a scientifically ordered vision of the future "will be just as certain, just as strictly science, and perhaps just as detailed as the picture that has been built up within the last hundred years to make the geological past." Although conscious of the difficulty in arriving at entirely accurate predictions, he thought that it would still be possible to arrive at a "working knowledge of things in the future".&lt;ref name="Wagar"/&gt;

In his fictional works, Wells predicted the invention and use of the [[atomic bomb]] in ''[[The World Set Free]]'' (1914).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Richard Rhodes]] | year = 1986 | title = The Making of the Atomic Bomb | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York | page = 24 | isbn = 978-0-684-81378-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' (1933) the impending [[World War II|World War]] and cities destroyed by aerial bombardment was depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Cowley, Malcolm. "Outline of Wells's History." ''[[The New Republic]]'' Vol. 81 Issue 1041, 14 November 1934 (p. 22–23).&lt;/ref&gt; However, he didn't stop advocating for the establishment of a futures science. In a 1933 [[BBC]] broadcast he called for the establishment of "Departments and Professors of Foresight", foreshadowing the development of modern academic futures studies by approximately 40 years.&lt;ref name="Wells, H.G. 1932 p. 89-91"/&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century future works were often shaped by political forces and turmoil. The [[World War I|WWI]] era led to adoption of futures thinking in institutions throughout Europe. The [[Russian Revolution]] led to the 1921 establishment of the Soviet Union’s [[Gosplan]], or State Planning Committee, which was active until the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]]. Gosplan was responsible for economic planning and created plans in five year increments to govern the economy. One of the first Soviet dissidents, [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], published the first [[dystopia]]n novel, ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', in 1921. The science fiction and political satire featured a future police state and was the first work censored by the Soviet censorship board, leading to Zamyatin’s political exile.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the United States, President [[Presidency of Herbert Hoover|Hoover]] created the Research Committee on Social Trends, which produced a report in 1933. The head of the committee, [[William Fielding Ogburn|William F. Ogburn]], analyzed the past to chart trends and project those trends into the future, with a focus on technology. Similar technique was used during [[Great Depression|The Great Depression]], with the addition of alternative futures and a set of likely outcomes that resulted in the creation of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and the Tennessee Valley development project.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[World War II|WWII]] era emphasized the growing need for foresight. The [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] used strategic plans to unify and mobilize their society with a focus on creating a fascist utopia. This planning and the subsequent war forced global leaders to create their own strategic plans in response. The post-war era saw the creation of numerous nation states with complex political alliances and was further complicated by the introduction of nuclear power.

[[RAND Corporation|Project RAND]] was created in 1946 as joint project between the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]], and later incorporated as the non-profit [[RAND Corporation|RAND corporation]]. Their objective was the future of weapons, and long-range planning to meet future threats. Their work has formed the basis of US strategy and policy in regard to nuclear weapons, the [[Cold War]], and the          space race.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Mid-Century Emergence===
Futures studies truly emerged as an academic discipline in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wfs.org/five-decades-of-futuring/|title=World Future Society|author=|date=|website=World Future Society|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; First-generation futurists included [[Herman Kahn]], an American [[Cold War]] strategist for the [[RAND Corporation]] who wrote ''[[On Thermonuclear War]]'' (1960), ''Thinking about the unthinkable'' (1962) and ''The Year 2000: a framework for speculation on the next thirty-three years'' (1967); [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]], a French economist who founded [[Futuribles International]] in 1960; and [[Dennis Gabor]], a Hungarian-British scientist who wrote ''Inventing the Future'' (1963) and ''The Mature Society. A View of the Future'' (1972).&lt;ref name="Bell 1997" /&gt;

Future studies had a parallel origin with the birth of [[systems science]] in [[academia]], and with the idea of national economic and political [[planning]], most notably in [[France]] and the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Bell 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masini 1993"&gt;{{cite book| last=Masini| first= Eleonora| year=1993| title=Why Futures Studies?| publisher=Grey Seal Books| location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, the people of France were continuing to reconstruct their war-torn country. In the process, French scholars, philosophers, writers, and artists searched for what could constitute a more positive future for humanity. The [[Soviet Union]] similarly participated in postwar rebuilding, but did so in the context of an established [[Planned economy|national economic planning process]], which also required a long-term, systemic statement of social goals. Future studies was therefore primarily engaged in national planning, and the construction of national symbols.
[[File:Rachel Carson w (cropped).jpg|thumb|216x216px|[[Rachel Carson]], author of [[Silent Spring|''The Silent Spring'']], which helped launch the environmental movement and a new direction for futures research.]]
By contrast, in the [[United States]], futures studies as a discipline emerged from the successful application of the tools and perspectives of [[systems analysis]], especially with regard to quartermastering the war-effort. The [[International Society for the Systems Sciences|Society for General Systems Research]], founded in 1955, sought to understand [[cybernetics]] and the practical application of systems sciences, greatly influencing the U.S. foresight community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These differing origins account for an initial schism between futures studies in America and futures studies in Europe: U.S. practitioners focused on applied projects, quantitative tools and systems analysis, whereas [[Europe]]ans preferred to investigate the long-range future of humanity and the [[Earth]], what might constitute that future, what symbols and [[semantics]] might express it, and who might articulate these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Slaughter| first= Richard A.| year=1995| title=The Foresight Principle: Cultural Recovery in the 21st Century| publisher=Adamantine Press, Ltd.| location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sardar 1999"&gt;[[Ziauddin Sardar|Sardar, Ziauddin]], ed. (1999). ''Rescuing All Our Futures.'' Praeger Studies on the 21st Century, Westport, Connecticut, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, academics, philosophers, writers and artists across the globe had begun to explore enough future scenarios so as to fashion a common dialogue. Several of the most notable writers to emerge during this era include: sociologist [[Fred Polak|Fred L. Polak]], whose work ''Images of the Future'' (1961) discusses the importance of images to society’s creation of the future; [[Marshall McLuhan]], whose ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' (1962) and ''[[Understanding Media|Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'' (1964) put forth his theories on how technologies change our cognitive understanding; and [[Rachel Carson]]’s ''[[Silent Spring|The Silent Spring]]'' (1962) which was hugely influential not only to future studies but also the creation of the environmental movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Inventors such as [[Buckminster Fuller]] also began highlighting the effect technology might have on global trends as time progressed.

By the 1970s there was an obvious shift in the use and development of futures studies; it’s focus was no longer exclusive to governments and militaries. Instead, it embraced a wide array of technologies, social issues, and concerns. This discussion on the intersection of population growth, resource availability and use, economic growth, quality of life, and environmental sustainability&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; referred to as the "global problematique"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; came to wide public attention with the publication of ''[[Limits to Growth]]'', a study sponsored by the [[Club of Rome]] which detailed the results of a computer simulation of the future based on economic and population growth.[[Futures studies#cite note-Meadows 1972-22|&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Public investment in the future was further enhanced by the publication of [[Alvin Toffler]]’s bestseller ''[[Future Shock]]'' (1970), and its exploration of how great amounts of change can overwhelm people and create a social paralysis due to “information overload.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Further development===
International dialogue became institutionalized in the form of the [[World Futures Studies Federation]] (WFSF), founded in 1967, with the noted sociologist, [[Johan Galtung]], serving as its first president. In the United States, the publisher [[Edward Cornish]], concerned with these issues, started the [[World Future Society]], an organization focused more on interested laypeople.

The first doctoral program on the Study of the Future, was founded in 1969 at the University Of Massachusetts by Christoper Dede and Billy Rojas.The next graduate program (Master's degree) was also founded by Christopher Dede in 1975 at the [[University of Houston–Clear Lake]],.&lt;ref name="Markley 1998"&gt;Markley, Oliver (1998)"Visionary Futures: Guided Imagery in Teaching and Learning about the Future", in ''American Behavioral Scientist''. Sage Publications, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver Markley of SRI (now [[SRI International]]) was hired in 1978 to move the program into a more applied and professional direction. The program moved to the [[University of Houston]] in 2007 and renamed the degree to Foresight.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bishop &amp; Andy Hines, Teaching about the Future, Houndsmill, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, p.xv.&lt;/ref&gt; The program has remained focused on preparing professional futurists and providing high-quality foresight training for individuals and organizations in business, government, education, and non-profits.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Hines, "A training ground for professional futurists," The Futurist, Vol. 43, September/October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the M.A. Program in Public Policy in Alternative Futures at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] was established.&lt;ref name="Jones 1992"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Jones| first= Christopher|date=Winter 1992| title=The Manoa School of Futures Studies| journal=Futures Research Quarterly| pages=19–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hawaii program locates futures studies within a pedagogical space defined by [[neo-Marxism]], critical political [[economic theory]], and [[literary criticism]]. In the years following the foundation of these two programs, single courses in Futures Studies at all levels of education have proliferated, but complete programs occur only rarely. In 2012, the Finland Futures Research Centre started a master's degree Programme in Futures Studies at [[Turku School of Economics]], a business school which is part of the [[University of Turku]] in [[Turku]], Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utu.fi/en/units/ffrc/Pages/home.aspx Finland Futures Research Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a transdisciplinary field, futures studies attracts generalists. This transdisciplinary nature can also cause problems, owing to it sometimes falling between the cracks of disciplinary boundaries; it also has caused some difficulty in achieving recognition within the traditional curricula of the sciences and the humanities. In contrast to "Futures Studies" at the undergraduate level, some graduate programs in strategic [[leadership]] or [[management]] offer masters or doctorate programs in "[[strategic foresight]]" for mid-career professionals, some even online. Nevertheless, comparatively few new PhDs graduate in Futures Studies each year.

The field currently faces the great challenge of creating a coherent conceptual framework, codified into a well-documented curriculum (or curricula) featuring widely accepted and consistent concepts and theoretical paradigms linked to quantitative and qualitative methods, exemplars of those research methods, and guidelines for their ethical and appropriate application within society. As an indication that previously disparate intellectual dialogues have in fact started converging into a recognizable discipline,&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Thomas (1975, c1970). ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; at least six solidly-researched and well-accepted first attempts to synthesize a coherent framework for the field have appeared: {{ill|Eleonora Masini|sk}}'s ''Why Futures Studies?'',&lt;ref&gt;Masini, Eleonora (1993).

==Probability and predictability==

Some aspects of the future, such as [[celestial mechanics]], are highly predictable, and may even be described by relatively simple mathematical models. At present however, science has yielded only a special minority of such "easy to predict" physical processes. Theories such as [[chaos theory]], [[nonlinear]] science and standard [[evolutionary theory]] have allowed us to understand many complex systems as [[contingent]] (sensitively dependent on complex environmental conditions) and [[stochastic]] (random within constraints), making the vast majority of future events unpredictable, ''in any specific case''.

Not surprisingly, the tension between [[predictability]] and [[unpredictability]] is a source of controversy and conflict among futures studies scholars and practitioners. Some argue that the future is essentially unpredictable, and that "the best way to predict the future is to create it." Others believe, as Flechtheim, that advances in science, probability, modeling and statistics will allow us to continue to improve our understanding of probable futures, while this area presently remains less well developed than methods for exploring possible and preferable futures.

As an example, consider the process of electing the president of the United States. At one level we observe that any U.S. citizen over 35 may run for president, so this process may appear too unconstrained for useful prediction. Yet further investigation demonstrates that only certain public individuals (current and former presidents and vice presidents, senators, state governors, popular military commanders, mayors of very large cities, etc.) receive the appropriate "social credentials" that are historical prerequisites for election. Thus with a minimum of effort at formulating the problem for statistical prediction, a much reduced pool of candidates can be described, improving our probabilistic foresight. Applying further statistical intelligence to this problem, we can observe that in certain election [[prediction market]]s such as the [[Iowa Electronic Markets]], reliable forecasts have been generated over long spans of time and conditions, with results superior to individual experts or polls. Such markets, which may be operated publicly or as an [[internal market]], are just one of several promising frontiers in predictive futures research.

Such improvements in the predictability of individual events do not though, from a [[Complex systems|complexity theory]] viewpoint, address the unpredictability inherent in dealing with entire systems, which emerge from the interaction between multiple individual events.

Futurology is sometimes described by scientists as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

In terms of methodology, futures practitioners employ a wide range of approaches, models and methods, in both theory and practice, many of which are derived from or informed by other academic or professional disciplines [https://books.google.com/books?id=ILJ_pfMgLqsC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;lpg=PA242&amp;dq=futurists+borrow+from+other+disciplines&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ycoWOEgcIS&amp;sig=J-Nv6SzqAv-DLsGc7608ZuPyV5I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi31u3GgMHSAhXpj1QKHUxBCOAQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=futurists%20borrow%2 &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;], including social sciences such as economics, psychology, sociology, religious studies, cultural studies, history, geography, and political science; physical and life sciences such as physics, chemistry, astronomy, biology; mathematics, including statistics, game theory and econometrics; applied disciplines such as engineering, computer sciences, and business management (particularly strategy).

The largest internationally peer-reviewed collection of futures research methods (1,300 pages) is [http://www.millennium-project.org/publications-2/futures-research-methodology-version-3-0/ Futures Research Methodology 3.0]. Each of the 37 methods or groups of methods contains: an executive overview of each method’s history, description of the method,
primary and alternative usages, strengths and weaknesses, uses in combination with other methods, and speculation about future evolution of the method. Some also contain appendixes with applications, links to software, and sources for further information.

Given its unique objectives and material, the practice of futures studies only rarely features employment of the [[scientific method]] in the sense of controlled, repeatable and verifiable experiments with highly standardized methodologies. However, many futurists are informed by scientific techniques or work primarily within scientific domains. Borrowing from history, the futurist might project patterns observed in past civilizations upon present-day society to model what might happen in the future, or borrowing from technology, the futurist may model possible social and cultural responses to an emerging technology based on established principles of the diffusion of innovation. In short, the futures practitioner enjoys the synergies of an interdisciplinary laboratory.

As the plural term “futures” suggests, one of the fundamental assumptions in futures studies is that the future is plural not singular.[http://www.futures.hawaii.edu/publications/futures-studies/DatorFuturesStudies.pdf &lt;nowiki&gt;[2]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] That is, the future consists not of one inevitable future that is to be “predicted,” but rather of multiple alternative futures of varying likelihood which may be derived and described, and about which it is impossible to say with certainty which one will occur. The primary effort in futures studies, then, is to identify and describe alternative futures in order to better understand the driving forces of the present or the structural dynamics of a particular subject or subjects. The exercise of identifying alternative futures includes collecting quantitative and qualitative data about the possibility, probability, and desirability of change. The plural term "futures" in futures studies denotes both the rich variety of alternative futures, including the subset of preferable futures (normative futures), that can be studied, as well as the tenet that the future is many.

At present, the general futures studies model has been summarized as being concerned with "three Ps and a W", or possible, probable, and preferable futures, plus [[Wild card (Foresight research)|wildcards]], which are low probability but high impact events (positive or negative). Many futurists, however, do not use the wild card approach. Rather, they use a methodology called [[Emerging Issues Analysis]]. It searches for the drivers of change, issues that are likely to move from unknown to the known, from low impact to high impact.

In terms of technique, futures practitioners originally concentrated on [[Extrapolation|extrapolating]] present [[technological]], [[economic]] or [[social]] [[Fads and trends|trends]], or on attempting to [[Prediction|predict]] future trends. Over time, the discipline has come to put more and more focus on the examination of social [[system]]s and [[Uncertainty|uncertainties]], to the end of articulating [[Scenario planning|scenarios]]. The practice of scenario development facilitates the examination of worldviews and assumptions through the [[causal layered analysis]] method (and others), the creation of preferred visions of the future, and the use of exercises such as backcasting to connect the present with alternative futures. Apart from extrapolation and scenarios, many dozens of methods and techniques are used in futures research (see below).

The general practice of futures studies also sometimes includes the articulation of normative or preferred futures, and a major thread of practice involves connecting both extrapolated (exploratory) and normative research to assist individuals and organizations to model preferred futures amid shifting social changes. Practitioners use varying proportions of collaboration, creativity and research to derive and define alternative futures, and to the degree that a “preferred” future might be sought, especially in an organizational context, techniques may also be deployed to develop plans or strategies for directed future shaping or implementation of a preferred future.

While some futurists are not concerned with assigning probability to future scenarios, other futurists find probabilities useful in certain situations, such as when probabilities stimulate thinking about scenarios within organizations [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2870/f9cef0b618c480312802fbb78e49bd69fa83.pdf &lt;nowiki&gt;[3]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]. When dealing with the three Ps and a W model, estimates of probability are involved with two of the four central concerns (discerning and classifying both probable and wildcard events), while considering the range of possible futures, recognizing the plurality of existing alternative futures, characterizing and attempting to resolve normative disagreements on the future, and envisioning and creating preferred futures are other major areas of scholarship. Most estimates of probability in futures studies are normative and qualitative, though significant progress on statistical and quantitative methods (technology and information growth curves, cliometrics, predictive psychology, [[prediction market]]s, crowdvoting forecasts,&lt;sup&gt;[31][''[[Wikipedia:NOTRS|better source needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; etc.) has been made in recent decades.

=== Futures techniques ===
{{Main|Futures techniques}}

Futures techniques or methodologies may be viewed as “frameworks for making sense of data generated by structured processes to think about the future”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/768c/525942ae89e6364569875090b87b449abeb2.pdf|title=An Overview of Foresight Methodologies|last=Conway|first=Maree|date=|website=|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no single set of methods that are appropriate for all futures research. Different futures researchers intentionally or unintentionally promote use of favored techniques over a more structured approach. Selection of methods for use on futures research projects has so far been dominated by the intuition and insight of practitioners; but can better identify a balanced selection of techniques via acknowledgement of foresight as a process together with familiarity with the fundamental attributes of most commonly used methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popper|first=Rafael|date=2008|title=How are foresight methods selected?|url=|journal=Foresight|volume=10|issue=6|pages=62–89|via=Emerald Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Futurists use a diverse range of forecasting methods including:

* Framework Foresight
* [[Causal layered analysis]] (CLA)
* [[Environmental scanning]]
* [[Scenario planning|Scenario method]]
* [[Education and Learning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wfs.org/building-new-narratives/|title=World Future Society|author=|date=|website=World Future Society|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shaping alternative futures===
Futurists use scenarios&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; alternative possible futures&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; as an important tool. To some extent, people can determine what they consider probable or desirable using qualitative and quantitative methods. By looking at a variety of possibilities one comes closer to shaping the future, rather than merely predicting it. Shaping alternative futures starts by establishing a number of scenarios. Setting up scenarios takes place as a process with many stages. One of those stages involves the study of trends. A trend persists long-term and long-range; it affects many societal groups, grows slowly and appears to have a profound basis. In contrast, a fad operates in the short term, shows the vagaries of [[fashion]], affects particular societal groups, and spreads quickly but superficially.

Sample predicted futures range from predicted [[ecological catastrophe]]s, through a [[utopia]]n future where the poorest human being lives in what present-day observers would regard as wealth and comfort, through the transformation of humanity into a [[posthumanism|posthuman]] life-form, to the destruction of all life on Earth in, say, a [[nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] [[Grey Goo|disaster]].

Futurists have a decidedly mixed reputation and a patchy track record at successful prediction. For reasons of convenience, they often extrapolate present technical and societal trends and assume they will develop at the same rate into the future; but technical progress and social upheavals, in reality, take place in fits and starts and in different areas at different rates.

Many 1950s futurists predicted commonplace [[space tourism]] by the year 2000, but ignored the possibilities of ubiquitous, cheap [[computer]]s. On the other hand, many forecasts have portrayed the future with some degree of accuracy. Current futurists often present multiple [[scenario]]s that help their audience envision what "may" occur instead of merely "predicting the future". They claim that understanding potential scenarios helps individuals and organizations prepare with flexibility.

Many corporations use futurists as part of their [[risk management]] strategy, for [[horizon scanning]] and emerging issues analysis, and to identify [[Wild card (Foresight research)|wild card]]s &amp;ndash; low probability, potentially high-impact risks.&lt;ref&gt;A [http://www.globalchange.com/ppt4/risk/ sample presentation on risk management]&lt;/ref&gt; Every successful and unsuccessful [[business]] engages in futuring to some degree &amp;ndash; for example in research and development, innovation and market research, anticipating competitor behavior and so on.&lt;ref name="rohrbeck-2010"&gt;Rohrbeck, Rene (2010) ''Corporate Foresight: Towards a Maturity Model for the Future Orientation of a Firm'', Springer Series: Contributions to Management Science, Heidelberg and New York, {{ISBN|978-3-7908-2625-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rohrbeck-gemuenden-2010"&gt;Rohrbeck, R. H.G. Gemuenden (2010) [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1618523 Corporate Foresight: Its Three Roles in Enhancing the Innovation Capacity of a Firm"] ''Technological Forecasting and Social Change'', forthcoming&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weak signals, the future sign and wild cards===
In futures research "weak signals" may be understood as advanced, noisy and socially situated indicators of change in trends and systems that constitute raw informational material for enabling anticipatory action. There is some confusion about the definition of weak signal by various researchers and consultants. Sometimes it is referred as future oriented information, sometimes more like emerging issues. The confusion has been partly clarified with the concept 'the future sign', by separating signal, issue and interpretation of the future sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V65-4PJM9RS-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=09%2F01%2F2007&amp;_rdoc=29&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235805%239999%23999999999%2399999%23FLA%23display%23Articles)&amp;_cdi=5805&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_ct=46&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=96d64e0a3f418f2a3fafc73da9c8f774|title=article about the Future sign|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A weak signal can be an early indicator of coming change, and an example might also help clarify the confusion.  On May 27, 2012, hundreds of people gathered for a “Take the Flour Back” demonstration at Rothamsted Research in Harpenden, UK, to oppose a publicly funded trial of genetically modified wheat.  This was a weak signal for a broader shift in consumer sentiment against genetically modified foods.  When Whole Foods mandated the labeling of GMOs in 2013, this non-GMO idea had already become a trend and was about to be a topic of mainstream awareness.

"Wild cards" refer to low-probability and high-impact events, such as [[existential risks]]. This concept may be embedded in standard foresight projects and introduced into anticipatory decision-making activity in order to increase the ability of social groups adapt to surprises arising in turbulent business environments. Such sudden and unique incidents might constitute turning points in the evolution of a certain trend or system. Wild cards may or may not be announced by weak signals, which are incomplete and fragmented data from which relevant foresight information might be inferred.
Sometimes, mistakenly, wild cards and weak signals are considered as synonyms, which they are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfs.tku.edu.tw/11-2/4wildcard-hiltunen.pdf|title=differences of weak signals and wild cards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most often cited examples of a wild card event in recent history is 9/11.  Nothing had happened in the past that could point to such a possibility and yet it had a huge impact on everyday life in the United States, from simple tasks like how to travel via airplane to deeper cultural values.  Wild card events might also be natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, which can force the relocation of huge populations and wipe out entire crops to completely disrupt the supply chain of many businesses.  Although wild card events can’t be predicted, after they occur it is often easy to reflect back and convincingly explain why they happened.

===Near-term predictions===
A long-running tradition in various [[culture]]s, and especially in the [[Mass media|media]], involves various spokespersons making predictions for the upcoming year at the beginning of the year. These [[prediction]]s sometimes base themselves on current trends in culture (music, movies, fashion, politics); sometimes they make hopeful guesses as to what major events might take place over the course of the next year.

Some of these predictions come true as the year unfolds, though many fail. When predicted events fail to take place, the authors of the [[prediction]]s often state that misinterpretation of the "[[sign (semiotics)|signs]]" and [[Portent (divination)|portent]]s may explain the failure of the prediction.

[[Marketing|Marketer]]s have increasingly started to embrace futures studies, in an effort to benefit from an increasingly competitive marketplace with fast production cycles, using such techniques as [[trend analysis|trendspotting]] as popularized by [[Faith Popcorn]].{{Dubious|date=December 2011}}

=== Trend analysis and forecasting ===

==== Mega-trends ====
Trends come in different sizes. A mega-trend extends over many generations, and in cases of climate, mega-trends can cover periods prior to human existence. They describe complex interactions between many factors. The increase in population from the [[palaeolithic]] period to the present provides an example.

==== Potential trends ====
Possible new trends grow from innovations, projects, beliefs or actions that have the potential to grow and eventually go mainstream in the future.

==== Branching trends ====
Very often, trends relate to one another the same way as a tree-trunk relates to branches and twigs. For example, a well-documented movement toward equality between men and women might represent a branch trend. The trend toward reducing differences in the salaries of men and women in the [[Western world]] could form a twig on that branch.

==== Life-cycle of a trend ====
When a potential trend gets enough confirmation in the various media, surveys or questionnaires to show that it has an increasingly accepted value, behavior or [[technology]], it becomes accepted as a bona fide trend. Trends can also gain confirmation by the existence of other trends perceived as springing from the same branch. Some commentators claim that when 15% to 25% of a given population integrates an innovation, project, belief or action into their daily life then a trend becomes mainstream.
[[File:Hype-Cycle-General.png|thumb|[[Hype cycle|General Hype Cycle]] used to visualize [[Technology adoption life cycle|technological life stages]] of maturity, adoption, and social application.]]

==== Life cycle of technologies ====
Because new advances in technology have the potential to reshape our society, one of the jobs of a futurist is to follow these developments and consider their implications. However, the latest innovations take time to make an impact. Every new technology goes through its own life cycle of maturity, adoption, and social application that must be taken into consideration before a probable vision of the future can be created.

[[Gartner]] created their [[Hype cycle|Hype Cycle]] to illustrate the phases a technology moves through as it grows from research and development to mainstream adoption. The unrealistic expectations and subsequent disillusionment that virtual reality experienced in the 1990s and early 2000s is an example of the middle phases encountered before a technology can begin to be integrated into society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.ict.usc.edu/mxr/blog/keynote-remixed-what-happened-to-virtual-reality/|title=Keynote Remixed: What Happened to Virtual Reality|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Education in the field of futures studies has taken place for some time. Beginning in the [[United States of America]] in the 1960s, it has since developed in many different countries. Futures education encourages the use of concepts, tools and processes that allow students to think long-term, consequentially, and imaginatively. It generally helps students to:
# conceptualize more just and sustainable human and planetary futures.
# develop knowledge and skills of methods and tools used to help people understand, map, and influence the future by exploring probable and preferred futures.
# understand the dynamics and influence that human, social and ecological systems have on alternative futures.
# conscientize [[Social responsibility|responsibility]] and action on the part of students toward creating better futures.
Thorough documentation of the history of futures education exists, for example in the work of [[Richard A. Slaughter]] (2004),&lt;ref name="Slaughter 2004"&gt;{{cite book| last=Slaughter| first= Richard A.| year=2004| title=Futures Beyond Dystopia: Creating Social Foresight| publisher=RoutledgeFalmer| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Hicks, Ivana Milojević&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metafuture.org/articlesbyivana.htm |title=Articles by Ivana Milojevic; Futures Studies at Metafuture.org |work=metafuture.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114063552/http://www.metafuture.org/articlesbyivana.htm |archivedate=2009-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to name a few.

While futures studies remains a relatively new academic tradition, numerous tertiary institutions around the world teach it. These vary from small programs, or universities with just one or two classes, to programs that offer certificates and incorporate futures studies into other degrees, (for example in [[planning]], business, environmental studies, [[economics]], development studies, [[science]] and technology studies). Various formal Masters-level programs exist on six continents. Finally, doctoral dissertations around the world have incorporated futures studies. A recent survey documented approximately 50 cases of futures studies at the tertiary level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfsf.org|title=HOME|author=Super User|work=wfsf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest Futures Studies program in the world is at [[Tamkang University]], Taiwan.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Futures Studies is a required course at the undergraduate level, with between three and five thousand students taking classes on an annual basis. Housed in the Graduate Institute of Futures Studies is an MA Program. Only ten students are accepted annually in the program. Associated with the program is the ''Journal of Futures Studies''.&lt;ref name=JFS&gt;{{cite web|title=Journal of Future Studies|url=http://www.jfs.tku.edu.tw/|publisher=Graduate Institute of Futures Studies, Tamkang University|location=Tamsui, Taipei, Taiwan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest running Future Studies program in North America was established in 1975 at the [[University of Houston–Clear Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;Teaching about the Future, by Peter C. Bishop and Andy Hines, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It moved to the [[University of Houston]] in 2007 and renamed the degree to Foresight. The program was established on the belief that if history is studied and taught in an academic setting, then so should the future. Its mission is to prepare professional futurists. The curriculum incorporates a blend of the essential theory, a framework and methods for doing the work, and a focus on application for clients in business, government, nonprofits, and society in general.&lt;ref&gt;Hines. A. (2014, September/October). A training ground for professional futurists. The Futurist, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2003, over 40 tertiary education establishments around the world were delivering one or more courses in futures studies. The [[World Futures Studies Federation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfsf.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=108 WFSF Directory of Tertiary Futures Education&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025171058/http://www.wfsf.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=108 |date=2009-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has a comprehensive survey of global futures programs and courses. The Acceleration Studies Foundation maintains an annotated list of primary and secondary graduate futures studies programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerating.org/gradprograms.html |title=Foresight and Futures Studies &amp;ndash; Global Academic Programs |publisher=Accelerating.org |date=2005-11-04 |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations such as [http://www.teachthefuture.org/ Teach The Future] also aim to promote future studies in the secondary school curriculum in order to develop structured approaches to thinking about the future in public school students. The rationale is that a sophisticated approach to thinking about, anticipating, and planning for the future is a core skill requirement that every student should have, similar to literacy and math skills.

== Applications of foresight and specific fields ==

===General applicability and use of foresight products===

Several corporations and government agencies utilize foresight products to both better understand potential risks and prepare for potential opportunities. Several government agencies publish material for internal stakeholders as well as make that material available to broader public. Examples of this include the US Congressional Budget Office long term budget projections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45308|title=Long-Term Budget Projections|work=Congressional Budget Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Intelligence Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/about/organization/national-intelligence-council-global-trends|title=National Intelligence Council|author=Super User|work=dni.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301030845/http://www.dni.gov/index.php/about/organization/national-intelligence-council-global-trends|archivedate=2015-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom Government Office for Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/foresight-projects|title=Foresight projects|work=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of this material is used by policy makers to inform policy decisions and government agencies to develop long term plan. Several corporations, particularly those with long product development lifecycles, utilize foresight and future studies products and practitioners in the development of their business strategies. The Shell Corporation is one such entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/scenarios.html |title=Shell Scenarios |work=shell.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307044027/http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/scenarios.html |archivedate=2015-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foresight professionals and their tools are increasingly being utilized in both the private and public areas to help leaders deal with an increasingly complex and interconnected world.

===Design===
Design and futures studies have many synergies as interdisciplinary fields with a natural orientation towards the future. Both incorporate studies of human behavior, global trends,  strategic insights, and anticipatory solutions.

Designers have adopted futures methodologies including scenarios, trend forecasting, and futures research. Design thinking and specific techniques including ethnography, rapid prototyping, and critical design have been incorporated into in futures as well. In addition to borrowing techniques from one another, futurists and designers have joined to form agencies marrying both competencies to positive effect. The continued interrelation of the two fields is an encouraging trend that has spawned much interesting work.

The Association for Professional Futurists has also held meetings discussing the ways in which Design Thinking and Futures Thinking intersect and benefit one another.

===Imperial cycles and world order===

Imperial cycles represent an "expanding pulsation" of "mathematically describable" macro-historic trend.&lt;ref&gt;Hornell Hart, "The Logistic Growth of Political Areas," ''Social Forces'', 26, (1948): 396-7; [[Raoul Naroll]], "Imperial Cycles and World Order," ''Peace Research Society'', 7, (1967): 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of largest empires]] contains imperial record progression in terms of territory or percentage of world population under single imperial rule.

Chinese philosopher [[K'ang Yu-wei]] and French demographer [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] in the late 19th century were the first to stress that the trend cannot proceed indefinitely on the definite surface of the globe. The trend is bound to culminate in a world empire. K'ang Yu-wei estimated that the matter will be decided in the contest between Washington and Berlin; Vacher de Lapouge foresaw this contest between the United States and Russia and estimated the chance of the United States higher.&lt;ref&gt;[[K'ang Yu-wei]], ''The One World Philosophy'', (tr. Thompson, Lawrence G., London, 1958), pp 79-80, 85; George [[Vacher de Lapouge]], ''L'Aryen: Son Rôle Social'', (Nantes: 1899), chapter " L`Avenir des Aryens."&lt;/ref&gt; Both published their futures studies before [[H. G. Wells]] introduced the science of future in his ''[[Anticipations]]'' (1901).

Four later anthropologists—Hornell Hart, [[Raoul Naroll]], Louis Morano, and [[Robert Carneiro]]—researched the expanding imperial cycles. They reached the same conclusion that a world empire is not only pre-determined but close at hand and attempted to estimate the time of its appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Hornell, Hart, "The Logistic Growth of Political Areas," ''Social Forces'', 26, (1948): 396-408;

===Education===
As foresight has expanded to include a broader range of social concerns all levels and types of education have been addressed, including formal and informal education. Many countries are beginning to implement Foresight in their Education policy. A few programs are listed below:
* Finland's FinnSight 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aka.fi/Tiedostot/Tiedostot/Julkaisut/Finnsight_2015_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105090726/http://www.aka.fi/Tiedostot/Tiedostot/Julkaisut/Finnsight_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; - Implementation began in 2006 and though at the time was not referred to as "Foresight" they tend to display the characteristics of a foresight program.

*The World Future Society, founded in 1966, is the largest and longest-running community of futurists in the world. WFS established and built futurism from the ground up—through publications, global summits, and advisory roles to world leaders in business and government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By the early 2000s, educators began to independently institute futures studies (sometimes referred to as futures thinking) lessons in K-12 classroom environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strong|first1=Kay|last2=Bishop|first2=Peter|title=Case Study: Futurizing the K-12 Teaching Practice|url=http://jfsdigital.org/articles-and-essays/2011-2/vol-15-no-4-june/symposium/case-study-futurizing-the-k-12-teaching-practice|website=Journal of Futures Studies|publisher=Tamkang University, Tamsui Campus|accessdate=23 February 2018|date=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; To meet the need, non-profit futures organizations designed curriculum plans to supply educators with materials on the topic. Many of the curriculum plans were developed to meet [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|common core standards]]. Futures studies education methods for youth typically include age-appropriate collaborative activities, games, systems thinking and scenario building exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mack|first1=Timothy C.|title=Good Roads and Potholes: Teaching Foresight to Younger Children|url=http://jfsdigital.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/154-S05.pdf|publisher=Journal of Futures Studies|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science fiction===
Wendell Bell and Ed Cornish acknowledge science fiction as a catalyst to future studies, conjuring up visions of tomorrow.&lt;ref name="Morgan, Matthew J 2003"&gt;Morgan, Matthew J. "On the Fringes: Future Opportunities for Futures Studies." Futures Research Quarterly 19.3 (2003): 5-20. Web. 4 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction’s potential to provide an “imaginative social vision” is its contribution to futures studies and public perspective. Productive sci-fi presents plausible, normative scenarios.&lt;ref name="Morgan, Matthew J 2003"/&gt;   Jim Dator attributes the foundational concepts of “images of the future” to Wendell Bell, for clarifying Fred Polak’s concept in Images of the Future, as it applies to futures studies.&lt;ref&gt;Dator, Jim. "Wendell Bell: The Futurist Who Would Put My Grandmother in Prison.” Futures 43.6 (2011): 578-82. Web. 4 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polak, Fred 1973"&gt;Polak, Fred, and Boulding, Elise. The Image of the Future. (1973). Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to futures studies’ scenarios thinking, empirically supported visions of the future are a window into what the future could be. Pamela Sargent states, “Science fiction reflects attitudes typical of this century.” She gives a brief history of impactful sci-fi publications, like [[The Foundation Trilogy]], by [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Starship Troopers]], by [[Robert A. Heinlein]].&lt;ref name="Sargent Pamela 1975 pp. 433-441"&gt;Women in science fiction. Sargent Pamela. (1975) Futures, 7 (5), pp. 433-441.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternate perspectives validate sci-fi as part of the fuzzy “images of the future.”&lt;ref name="Polak, Fred 1973"/&gt; However, the challenge is the lack of consistent futures research based literature frameworks.&lt;ref name="Sargent Pamela 1975 pp. 433-441"/&gt; Ian Miles reviews The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction,” identifying ways Science Fiction and Futures Studies “cross-fertilize, as well as the ways in which they differ distinctly.” Science Fiction cannot be simply considered fictionalized Futures Studies. It may have aims other than “prediction, and be no more concerned with shaping the future than any other genre of literature.” &lt;ref&gt;Fiction and forecasting. Ian Miles. (1990) Futures,  22  (1), pp. 83-91&lt;/ref&gt; It is not to be understood as an explicit pillar of futures studies, due to its inconsistency of integrated futures research. Additionally, Dennis Livingston, a literature and Futures journal critic says, “The depiction of truly alternative societies has not been one of science fiction’s strong points, especially” preferred, normative envisages.&lt;ref&gt;Science Fiction Survey. Dennis Livingston. Futures, Volume 4, Issue 1, March 1972, Pages 97-98&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government agencies ===
Several governments have formalized strategic foresight agencies to encourage long range strategic societal planning, with most notable are the governments of Singapore, Finland, and the United Arab Emirates. Other governments with strategic foresight agencies include Canada's [http://www.horizons.gc.ca/en Policy Horizons Canada] and the [[Malaysian Industry-Government Group for High Technology#myForesight® (Malaysian Foresight Institute)|Malaysia's Malaysian Foresight Institute]].

The Singapore government's [[Centre for Strategic Futures]] (CSF) is part of the Strategy Group within the Prime Minister's Office. Their mission is to position the Singapore government to navigate emerging strategic challenges and harness potential opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csf.gov.sg/about-us/vision-mission|title=Singapore Centre for Strategic Futures Mission|last=|first=|date=3 July 2015|website=Centre for Strategic Futures, Singapore|access-date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore’s early formal efforts in strategic foresight began in 1991 with the establishment of the Risk Detection and Scenario Planning Office in the Ministry of Defence.&lt;ref name=Kuosa2011&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuosa|first1=Tuoma|title=Practising Strategic Foresight in Government: The Case of Finland, Singapore, and the European Union|publisher=S.

Since the 1990s, Finland has integrated strategic foresight within the parliament and Prime Minister’s Office.&lt;ref name=Boston2017&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boston|first1=Jonathan|title=Governing for the Future: Designing Democratic Institutions for a Better Tomorrow|date=2017|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|location=Bradford, UK|isbn=978-1-78635-056-5|pages=403–420|edition=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government is required to present a “Report of the Future” each parliamentary term for review by the parliamentary Committee for the Future. Led by the Prime Minister’s Office, the Government Foresight Group coordinates the government’s foresight efforts.&lt;ref name=Boston2011 /&gt; Futures research is supported by the Finnish Society for Futures Studies (established in 1980), the Finland Futures Research Centre (established in 1992), and the Finland Futures Academy (established in 1998) in coordination with foresight units in various government agencies.&lt;ref name=Boston2011 /&gt;

In the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Vice President and Ruler of Dubai,  announced in September 2016 that all government ministries were to appoint Directors of Future Planning. Sheikh Mohammed described the UAE Strategy for the Future as an "integrated strategy to forecast our nation’s future, aiming to anticipate challenges and seize opportunities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/sheikh-mohammed-bin-rashid-announces-uae-strategy-for-the-future|title=Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid announces UAE Strategy for the Future {{!}} The National|access-date=2017-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://www.mocaf.gov.ae/en/area-of-focus/future-foresight Ministry of Cabinet Affairs and Future](MOCAF) is mandated with crafting the UAE Strategy for the Future and is responsible for the portfolio of the future of UAE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mocaf.gov.ae/docs/default-source/default-document-library/pr-infographic-visual-approved-en.pdf?status=Temp&amp;sfvrsn=0.03206219086943629|title=UAE Future Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=United Arab Emirates Ministry of Cabinet Affairs &amp; The Future|archive-url=https://www.mocaf.gov.ae/en/area-of-focus/future-foresight|archive-date=24 February 2017|dead-url=|access-date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Futurists ==
{{Main|Futurist}}

Several authors have become recognized as futurists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wfs.org/famous-members/|title=World Future Society|author=|date=|website=World Future Society|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They research trends, particularly in technology, and write their observations, conclusions, and predictions. In earlier eras, many futurists were at academic institutions. [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], author of ''The Future of the Future'', published a 'Futures Directory', and directed a [[think tank]] called ''The Centre For Integrative Studies'' at a university. Futurists have started [[consultant|consulting]] groups or earn money as speakers, with examples including [[Alvin Toffler]], [[John Naisbitt]] and [[Patrick Dixon]]. [[Frank Feather]] is a business speaker that presents himself as a pragmatic futurist. Some futurists have commonalities with [[science fiction]], and some science-fiction writers, such as [[Arthur C. Clarke]], are known as futurists.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} In the introduction to ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] distinguished futurists from novelists, writing of the study as the business of prophets, clairvoyants, and futurists. In her words, "a novelist's business is lying".

A survey of 108 futurists found that they share a variety of assumptions, including in their description of the present as a critical moment in an historical transformation, in their recognition and belief in complexity, and in their being motivated by change and having a desire for an active role bringing change (versus simply being involved in forecasting).&lt;ref&gt;Sohail Inayatullah, ed., The Views of Futurists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3408">'''GPoT Center''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Küresel Siyasal Eğilimler Merkezi'') officially the '''Global Political Trends Center''' is a [[research]] unit, which was established by [[Mensur Akgun]] and [[Sylvia Tiryaki]] at the [[Istanbul Kültür University]] in [[Turkey]] in 2008. The mission of the Center is to conduct research, projects, to produce innovative [[publication]]s analyzing the latest issues in the international relations, to formulate viable political recommendations and to boost the dialogue between [[civil society]], [[academia]] and [[Mass media|media]].

== Activities ==

GPoT Center, as one of the leading Turkish [[think tank]]s, runs [[project]]s in various areas and has organized numerous [[Meeting|conferences]], workshops and round-table meetings focused on: the EU - Turkey relations, the [[Cyprus question]], the Turkey - [[Armenia]] relations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-207740-us-meetings-reinvigorate-turkish-armenian-reconciliation.html US meetings reinvigorate Turkish-Armenian reconciliation]&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish - [[Arab]] dialogue, [[NATO]], second track [[diplomacy]] between [[Syria]] and [[Israel]], Arab-Israeli conflict and other issues related to the international agenda in general and the agenda of Turkish [[foreign policy]] in particular.

The projects implemented by GPoT Center often involve participation of [[high-level]] politicians and [[opinion]] makers, however the Center is also active in organization of second-track diplomacy meetings aiming at effective conflict solution. For the purposes of second-track diplomacy, GPoT Center brings together representatives of conflicting parties, i.e. [[civil society]] activists, opinion leaders, as well as academics to discuss issues pertaining to solution of the relevant problem. The meetings are usually conducted in friendly atmosphere and under Chatam House rules.

== Publications ==

The Center publishes various types of publications available in the electronic as well as printed form. It has published a number of [[policy]] briefs analyzing issues in [[international relations]] and shorter essays, i.e. GPoT Briefs focusing on one topic from the current global issues.

'''Geoprofessions''' is a term coined by the Geoprofessional Business Association to connote various technical disciplines that involve engineering, earth and environmental services applied to below-ground (“subsurface”), ground-surface, and ground-surface-connected conditions, structures, or formations. The principal disciplines include, as major categories:
* [[geomatics engineering]]
* [[#Geotechnical-engineering specialties|geotechnical engineering]];
* [[#Engineering geology and other geology specialties|geology and engineering geology]];
* [[#Geological engineering|geological engineering]];
* [[#Geophysics|geophysics]];
* [[#Geophysical engineering|geophysical engineering]];
* [[#Environmental-science and environmental-engineering specialties|environmental science and environmental engineering]];
* [[#Construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET)|construction-materials engineering and testing]]; and
* [[#Other geoprofessional services|other geoprofessional services]].

Each discipline involves specialties, many of which are recognized through professional designations that governments and societies or associations confer based upon a person’s education, training, experience, and educational accomplishments. In the United States, engineers must be licensed in the state or territory where they practice engineering. Most states license geologists and several license environmental “site professionals.” Several states license engineering geologists and recognize geotechnical engineering through a geotechnical-engineering titling act.

==Geotechnical-engineering specialties==
{{main|Geotechnical engineering}}
Although geotechnical engineering is applied for a variety of purposes, it is essential to foundation design. As such, geotechnical engineering is applicable to every existing or new structure on the planet; every building and every highway, bridge, tunnel, harbor, airport, water line, reservoir, or other public work. Commonly, the geotechnical-engineering service comprises a study of subsurface conditions using various sampling, in-situ testing, and/or other site-characterization techniques. The instrument of professional service in those cases typically is a report through which geotechnical engineers relate the information they have been retained to provide, typically: their findings; their opinions about subsurface materials and conditions; their judgment about how the subsurface materials and conditions assumed to exist probably will behave when subjected to loads or used as building material; and their preliminary recommendations for materials usage or appropriate foundation systems, the latter based on their knowledge of a structure’s size, shape, weight, etc., and the subsurface/structure interactions likely to occur. [[Civil engineers]], [[structural engineers]], and [[architects]], feasibly among other members of the project team, apply the geotechnical findings and preliminary recommendations to take the structure’s design forward. They realize these preliminary recommendations are subject to change, however, because – as a matter of practical necessity related to the [[Observational method (geotechnics)|observational method]] inherent to geotechnical engineering – geotechnical engineers base their recommendations on the composition of samples taken from a tiny portion of a site whose actual subsurface conditions are unknowable before excavation, because they are hidden by earth and/or rock and/or water. For this reason, as a key component of a complete geotechnical engineering service, geotechnical engineers employ construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET) to observe subsurface materials as they are exposed through excavation. To help achieve economies on their clients’ behalf, geotechnical engineers assign their field representatives – specially educated and trained paraprofessionals – to observe the excavated materials and the excavations themselves in light of conditions the geotechnical engineers opined to exist. When differences are discovered, the geotechnical engineers evaluate the new findings and, when necessary, modify their design and construction recommendations. Because such changes could require other members of the design and construction team to modify their designs, specifications, and proposed methods, many owners have their geotechnical engineers serve as active members of the project team from project inception to conclusion, working with others to help ensure appropriate application of geotechnical information and judgments.

In other cases, geotechnical engineering goes beyond a study and construction recommendations to include design of soil and rock structures. The most common of these are the [[Road surface|pavements]] that make up our streets and highways, airport runways, and bridge and tunnel decks, among other paved improvements. Geotechnical engineers design the pavements in terms of the subgrade, subbase, and base layers of materials to be used, and the thickness and composition of each. Geotechnical engineers also design the earth-retention walls associated with structures such as levees, earthen dams, reservoirs, and landfills. In other cases, the design is applied to contain earth, via structures such as excavation-support systems and retaining walls. Sometimes referred to as geostructural engineering or geostructural design, these services are also intrinsic to [[hydraulic engineering]], [[Hydrogeological|hydrogeologic engineering]], [[coastal engineering]], geologic engineering and [[Civil engineering#Water resources engineering|water-resources engineering]]. Geotechnical-engineering design is also applied for structures such as tunnels, bridges, dams, and other structures beneath, on, or connected to the surface of the earth. Geotechnical engineering, like geology, engineering geology, and geologic engineering, also involves the specialties of [[rock mechanics]] and [[soil mechanics]], and often requires knowledge of [[geotextiles]] and [[geosynthetics]], as well as an array of instrumentation and monitoring equipment, to help ensure specified conditions are achieved and maintained.

[[Earthquake engineering]] and landslide detection, remediation, and prevention are geoprofessional services associated with specialized types of geotechnical engineering (as well as [[#Geophysics|geophysics]]; see below), as is forensic geotechnical engineering, a geoprofessional service applied to determine why a certain applicable type of event – usually a failure of some sort – occurred. (Virtually all geoprofessional services can be performed for forensic purposes, commonly as litigation-support/[[expert witness]] services.) [[Railway systems engineering|Railway-systems engineering]] is another type of specialized geotechnical engineering, as are the design of [[piers]] and [[Bulkhead (barrier)|bulkheads]], [[drydocks]], on-shore and off-shore [[Wind turbine|wind-turbine]] systems, and systems that stabilize [[oil platforms]] and other marine structures to the sea floor.

Geotechnical engineers have long been involved in [[sustainability]] initiatives, including  (among many others) the use of excavated materials; the safe application of contaminated subsurface materials; the recycling of asphalt, concrete, and building rubble and debris; and the design of [[permeable paving|permeable pavements]].

All [[Civil engineering|civil-engineering]] specialties and projects – roads and highways, bridges, rail systems, ports and other waterfront structures, airport terminals, etc. – require the involvement of geotechnical engineers and engineering, meaning that many civil-engineering pursuits are geoprofessional pursuits to a greater or lesser degree. However, geotechnical engineering has for centuries also been associated with [[military engineering]]; [[sappers]] (in general) and [[miners]] (whose tunneling design services (known as [[Mining (military)|landmining]] and [[Mining (military)|undermining]]) were used in military-siege operations).

==Engineering geology and other geology specialties==
{{main|Geology|Engineering geology}}
Engineering geologist.
(a) Elements of the engineering geologist specialty. 
The practice of engineering geology involves the interpretation, evaluation, analysis, and application of geological information and data to civil works. Geotechnical soil and rock units are designated, characterized, and classified, using standard engineering soil and rock classification systems. Relationships are interpreted between landform development, current and past geologic processes, ground and surface water, and the strength characteristics of soil and rock. Processes evaluated include both surficial processes (for example, slope, fluvial, and coastal processes), and deep-seated processes (for example, volcanic activity and seismicity). Geotechnical zones or domains are designated based on soil and rocked geological strength characteristics, common landforms, related geologic processes, or other pertinent factors. Proposed developmental modifications are evaluated and, where appropriate, analyzed to predict potential or likely changes in types and rates of surficial geologic processes. Proposed modifications may include such things as vegetation removal, using various types of earth materials in construction, applying loads to shallow or deep foundations, constructing cut or fill slopes and other grading, and modifying ground and surface water flow. The effects of surficial and deep-seated geologic processes are evaluated and analyzed to predict their potential effect on public health, public safety, land use, or proposed development.
(b) Typical engineering geologic applications and types of projects. Engineering geology is applied during all project phases, from conception through planning, design, construction, maintenance, and, in some cases, reclamation and closure. Planning-level engineering geologic work is commonly conducted in response to forest practice regulations, critical areas ordinances, and the State Environmental Policy Act. Typical planning-level engineering geologic applications include timber harvest planning, proposed location of residential and commercial developments and other buildings and facilities, and alternative route selection for roads, rail lines, trails, and utilities. Site-specific engineering geologic applications include cuts, fills, and tunnels for roads, trails, railroads, and utility lines; foundations for bridges and other drainage structures, retaining walls and shoring, dams, buildings, water towers, slope, channel and shoreline stabilization facilities, fish ladders and hatcheries, ski lifts and other structures; landings for logging and other work platforms; airport landing strips; rock bolt systems; blasting; and other major earthwork projects such as for aggregate sources and landfills.

While engineering geology is applicable principally to planning, design and construction activities, other specialties of geology are applied in a variety of geoprofessional specialty fields, such as [[mining geology]], [[petroleum geology]], and [[environmental geology]]. Note that mining geology and [[mining engineering]] are different geoprofessional fields.

==Geological engineering==
{{distinguish|Climate engineering}}
'''Geological engineering''' is a hybrid discipline that comprises elements of [[civil engineering]], [[mining engineering]], [[petroleum engineering]], and [[earth sciences]]. Geological engineers often become licensed as both engineers and geologists. There are thirteen geological-engineering (or '''geoengineering''') programs in the United States that are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET: (1) Colorado School of Mines, (2) Michigan Technological University, (3) Missouri University of Science and Technology, (4) Montana Tech of the University of Montana, (5) South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, (6) University of Alaska-Fairbanks, (7) [[University of Minnesota]] Twin Cities, (8) [[University of Mississippi]], (9) [[University of Nevada, Reno]] (10) University of North Dakota, (11) University of Texas at Austin, (12) University of Utah, and (13) University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Other schools offer programs or classes in geological engineering, including the [[University of Arizona]].

'''Geoengineering''' or '''geological engineering''', [[engineering geology]], and [[geotechnical engineering]] deal with the discovery, development, and production and use of subsurface earth resources, as well as the design and construction of [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]. Geoengineering is the application of [[geosciences]], where mechanics, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and geology are used to understand and shape our interaction with the earth.

Geoengineers work in areas of
# [[mining]], including surface and subsurface [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]]s, and [[rock burst]] mitigation
# energy, including [[hydraulic fracturing]] and [[Boring (earth)|drilling]] for exploration and production of water, oil, or gas
# infrastructure, including [[Rapid transit|underground transportation]] systems and isolation of [[nuclear waste|nuclear]] and [[hazardous waste]]s; and
# environment, including [[groundwater flow]], contaminant transport and remediation, and hydraulic structures.

Professional [[List of geoscience organizations|geoscience organizations]] such as the [[American Rock Mechanics Association]] or the [[Geo-Institute]] and academic degrees such as the bachelor of geoengineering accredited by [[ABET]] acknowledge the broad scope of work practiced by geoengineers and stress fundamentals of science and engineering methods for the solution of complex problems. Geoengineers study the mechanics of rock, [[soil mechanics|soil]], and fluids to improve the sustainable use of earth’s finite resources, where problems appear with competing interests, for example, groundwater and waste isolation, [[Offshore drilling|offshore]] [[oil drilling]] and risk of spills, natural gas production and [[induced seismicity]].

==Geophysics==
{{main|Geophysics|Exploration geophysics}}
Geophysics is the study of the physical properties of the earth using quantitative physical methods to determine what lies beneath the earth's surface.  The physical properties of concern include the propagation of elastic waves (seismic), magnetism, gravity, electrical resistivity/conductivity, and electromagnetism.  Geophysics has historically been most commonly used in oil exploration and mining, but its popularity in non-destructive investigative work has flourished since the early 1990s.  It is also used in groundwater exploration and protection, geo-hazard studies (e.g., faults and landslides), alignment studies (e.g., proposed roadway, underground utilities, and pipelines), foundation studies, contamination characterization and remediation, landfill investigations, unexploded-ordnance investigations, vibration monitoring, dam-safety evaluation, location of underground storage tanks, identification of subsurface voids, and assisting in archeological investigations. (definition from Association of Environmental &amp; Engineering Geologists)

==Geophysical engineering==
'''Geophysical engineering''' is the application of geophysics to the engineering design of facilities including roads, tunnels, and mines.

==Environmental-science and environmental-engineering specialties==
{{main|Environmental science|Environmental engineering}}
Environmental science and environmental engineering are the geoprofessions commonly associated with the identification, remediation, and prevention of environmental contamination. These services range from phase-one and phase-two [[Environmental Site Assessment|environmental site-assessments]] – research designed to assess the likelihood that a property is contaminated and subsurface exploration conducted to identify the nature and extent of contamination, respectively – up through the design of processes and systems to remediate contaminated sites for the protection of human health and the environment.

[[Environmental geology]] is one of the principal geoprofessions engaged in assessing and remediating contaminated sites. Environmental geologists help identify the subsurface [[stratigraphy]] in which contaminants are located and through which they migrate. [[Environmental chemistry]] is the geoprofession that encompasses the study of chemical compounds in the soil.  These compounds are categorized as pollutants or contaminants when introduced into the environment by human factors (e.g., waste, mining processes, radioactive release) and are not of natural origin. Environmental chemistry assesses interactions or these compounds with soil, rock, and water to determine their fate and transport, the techniques to measure the levels of contaminants in the environment, and technologies to destroy or reduce the toxicity of contaminants in wastes or compounds that have been released to the environment. [[Environmental engineering]] is often applied to assess contaminated sites, but more often is used in the design of systems to remediate contaminated soil and groundwater.

[[Hydrogeology]] is the geoprofession involved when environmental studies involve subsurface water. Hydrogeology applications range from securing safe, plentiful underground drinking-water sources to identifying the nature of groundwater contamination in order to facilitate remediation. [[Environmental toxicology]] is a geoprofession when used to identify the source, fate, transformation, effects, and risks of pollutants on the environment, including soil, water, and air. [[Society of Wetland Scientists|Wetlands science]] is a geoprofessional pursuit that incorporates several scientific disciplines, such as [[botany]], [[biology]], and [[limnology]]. It involves, among other activities, the delineation, conservation, restoration, and preservation of wetlands. These services are sometimes conducted by geoprofessional specialists called [[Society of Wetland Scientists|wetlands scientists]]. [[Ecology]] is a closely related environmental geoprofession involving studies into the distribution of organisms and biodiversity within an environmental context.
 
Numerous geoprofessional disciplines contribute to the redevelopment of [[brownfields]], sites (typically urban) that are underused or abandoned because they are or are assumed to be contaminated by hazardous materials. Geoprofessionals are engaged to evaluate the degree to which such sites are contaminated and the steps that can be taken to achieve the sites’ safe reuse. Environmental engineers and scientists work with developers to identify and design remediation strategies and exposure-barrier designs that protect future site users from unacceptable exposure to environmental contamination resulting from previous uses of the site. Because these previous uses often resulted in degraded soil conditions and the presence of abandoned, underground structures, geotechnical engineers often are needed to design special foundations for the new structures.

==Construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET)==
Construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET) comprises an array of licensed-engineer-directed professional services applied principally for purposes of construction quality assurance and quality control. CoMET services commonly are provided as a separate discipline by firms that also practice geotechnical engineering, possibly among other geoprofessional disciplines. The geoprofessional-service industry has evolved in this manner because geotechnical engineering employs the observational method. [[Karl von Terzaghi]] and [[Ralph B. Peck]] – the creators of modern geotechnical engineering – used the [[Observational method (geotechnics)|observational method]] and multiple working hypotheses to expedite and economize the subsurface-exploration process, by using sampling and testing to form a judgment about subsurface conditions, and then observing excavated conditions and materials to confirm or modify those judgments and related recommendations, and then finalize them. To economize still further, geoprofessionals educated and trained paraprofessionals to represent them on site (hence the term “field representative”), especially to apply their judgment (much as a geotechnical engineer would) in comparing observed conditions with those the geotechnical engineer believed would exist. Over time, geotechnical engineers expanded their CoMET services by providing the additional education and training their field representatives needed to evaluate constructors’ attainment of conditions commonly specified by geoprofessionals; e.g., subsurface preparation for foundations of buildings, roadways, and other structures; materials used for subgrade, subbase, and base purposes; site grading; construction of earthen structures (earth dams, levees, reservoirs, landfills, et al.) and earth-retaining structures (e.g., retaining walls); and so on. Because many of the materials involved, such as concrete, are used in other elements of construction projects and structures, geoprofessional firms expanded their field representatives’ skill sets still more, to encompass observation and testing of numerous additional materials (e.g., reinforced concrete, structural steel, masonry, wood, and fireproofing), processes (e.g., cutting and filling and rebar placement), and outcomes (e.g., the effectiveness of welds). Laboratory services are a common element of many CoMET operations. Also operating under the direction of a licensed engineer, they are applied in geotechnical engineering to evaluate subsurface-material samples. In overall CoMET operations, laboratories operate with the equipment and personnel required to evaluate a variety of construction materials.

CoMET services applied to evaluate the actual composition of a site’s subsurface are part of a complete geotechnical engineering service. For purposes of short-term economy, however, some owners select a firm not associated with the geotechnical engineer of record to provide these and all other CoMET services. This approach precludes the geotechnical engineer of record from providing a complete service. It also aggravates risk, because the individuals engaged to evaluate actual subsurface conditions are not “briefed” by the geotechnical engineer of record before they go to the project site and seldom communicate with the geotechnical engineer of record when they discern differences, in large part because the firm associated with the geotechnical engineer of record is regarded as a competitor of the firm employing the field representatives. In some cases, the field representatives in question lack the specific project background information and/or the education and training required to discern those differences.

CoMET services applied to evaluate constructor’s attainment of specified conditions take the form of quality-assurance (QA) or quality-control (QC) services. QA services are performed directly or indirectly for the owner. The owner specifies the nature and extent of QA services that the owner believes is appropriate. Some owners specify none at all or only those that may be required by law. Those required by law are imposed via a jurisdiction’s [[building code]]. Almost all U.S. jurisdictions base their building codes on “model codes” developed by associations of building officials. The [[International Code Council|International Code Council (ICC)]] is the most prominent of these groups and its [[International Building Code (IBC)]] is the most commonly used model. As a result, many jurisdictions now require IBC “Special Inspection,” a term defined by the IBC as “the required examination of the materials, installation, fabrication, erection, or placement of components and connections requiring special expertise to ensure compliance with approved construction documents and referenced standards.” Special Inspection requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction based on the provisions adopted by the local building official. While some of the services involved may be similar to or the same as conventional CoMET services, Special Inspection is handled differently. Most commonly, the owner or the owner’s agent is required to retain a building-official-approved Special Inspection-services provider. Special Inspection is often required to obtain a certificate of occupancy.

QC services are those applied by or on behalf of a constructor to ensure the constructor has attained conditions the constructor has contractually agreed to attain. Most CoMET consultants are engaged far more to provide QA services than QC services.

Many CoMET procedures are specified in standards developed by [[Standards organization#Standard-developing organizations .28SDOs.29|standards-developing organizations (SDOs)]] such as the [[American Society of Civil Engineers|American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)]], [[ASTM International]], and [[American Concrete Institute|American Concrete Institute (ACI)]], using standards-development protocols approved by the [[American National Standards Institute|American National Standards Institute (ANSI)]] and/or the [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]]. All such standards identify what is minimally required to conform. Likewise, several organizations have developed programs to accredit CoMET field and laboratory services to perform certain types of testing and inspection. Some of these programs are more comprehensive than others; e.g., requiring regular calibration of equipment, participation in proficiency testing programs, and implementation and documentation of a (quality) management system to demonstrate technical competence. As with all such programs, of course, accreditation identifies what is least acceptable. Many CoMET laboratories go far beyond minimum requirements in an effort to attain higher levels of quality.

A variety of organizations – including local building departments – have developed personnel-certification protocols and requirements. In many jurisdictions, only appropriately certified individuals are permitted to perform certain evaluations. Individuals typically are required to meet certain prerequisites for certification and must pass examinations, in some cases involving performance observation in the field. The prerequisite for higher degrees of certification often include a requirement that the individual has met requirements for a lower degree of certification (e.g., Soils Technician I is in some cases a prerequisite for Soils Technician II). It should be noted that field representatives are sometimes referred to as “soil testers,” “technicians,” “technicians/technologists,” or “engineering technicians.” The Geoprofessional Business Association developed the term “field representative” to encompass all the many types of paraprofessionals involved (e.g., those involved with specific types of materials, such as reinforced concrete, soil, or steel; those who observe or inspect processes or conditions, such as welding inspectors, caisson inspectors, and foundation inspectors), and especially to underscore their significant, mutual responsibility, that purpose titles such as “technician” fail to signify. In fact, the engineers who direct CoMET operations are personally and professionally responsible and liable for their field representatives’ acts and statements while representing the engineer on site.

Especially because CoMET consultants have more hands-on experience with construction activities than many other design-team members, many owners involve them (among other geoprofessionals) from the outset of a project, during the design phase, to help the owner and/or design team members develop technical specifications and establish testing and inspection requirements, instrumentation requirements and procedures, and observation programs. Geotechnical engineers employ CoMET services during the earliest stages of a project, to oversee subsurface sampling procedures, such as drilling.

Many of the CoMET services performed for construction projects are performed for environmental projects as well, but requirements tend to be less rigid because they involve fewer licensing and related requirements. For example, individuals may perform federally mandated all-appropriate inquiries – typically a phase-one environmental site assessment – without a license of any kind.

==Other geoprofessional services==
To the extent that [[archeology]] and [[paleontology]] require systematic subsurface excavation to recover artifacts, they, too, are considered geoprofessions. Many geoprofessional-services firms offer these services to those of their clients that need to satisfy federal and/or state regulations that require paleontological and/or archeological inquiry before site development or redevelopment activities can proceed.

'''''House of Numbers: Anatomy of an Epidemic''''' is a 2009 documentary film directed, produced, and hosted by Brent Leung and described by him as an objective examination of the idea that HIV causes AIDS.&lt;ref name=Baywindows /&gt; The film argues that [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) is harmless and does not cause [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS), a position known as [[HIV/AIDS denialism|AIDS denialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Specter|first1=Michael|authorlink=Michael Specter|title=Denialism: How Irrational Thinking Harms the Planet and Threatens Our Lives|date=Oct 29, 2009|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780715639436|url=https://books.google.com/?id=J-VMNrt3JyIC&amp;pg=PT111&amp;dq=%22house+of+numbers%22+AIDS+denialism#v=onepage&amp;q=%22house%20of%20numbers%22%20AIDS%20denialism&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baywindows&gt;{{cite news | url = http://baywindows.com/crazy-house-90259 | work = [[Bay Windows]] | first = Ethan | last = Jacobs | date = April 22, 2009 | accessdate= September 8, 2009 | title = Crazy 'House'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pernicious/&gt; The film's claims of impartiality have been widely rejected by scientists, and the film's claims about HIV/AIDS have been dismissed as pseudoscience and [[conspiracy theory]] masquerading as even-handed examination.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lancet"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Lancet Infect Dis | title = House of Numbers | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | year = 2009 | pages = 735 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70316-0 | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2809%2970316-0/fulltext | author = Burki T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aaronovitch"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Conspiracy-Theory Theory.

A group of scientists interviewed for the film later complained that their comments had been misrepresented and taken out of context, and that the film promotes [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lancet"/&gt; The film also interviews [[Christine Maggiore]], a prominent AIDS denialist who later died after suffering from AIDS-related conditions.&lt;ref name="LACertificate"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aidstruth.org/news/2009/christine-maggiore-died-aids | title = Christine Maggiore died of AIDS | accessdate = 2011-02-01 | date = 2009-03-09 | publisher = AIDStruth.org | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110821045350/http://www.aidstruth.org/news/2009/christine-maggiore-died-aids | archivedate = 2011-08-21 | df =  }} [http://www.aidstruth.org/new/sites/default/files/maggiore-death-certificate.pdf Death certificate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103172503/http://www.aidstruth.org/new/sites/default/files/maggiore-death-certificate.pdf |date=2012-01-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and content ==
Leung has declined to discuss funding for the film except to state that funders came from "all over the world".&lt;ref name=Baywindows /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nville_Scene"&gt;{{cite news | first = Jim | last = Ridley | title = Controversy lingers after premiere of Nashville director's AIDS documentary | date = 2009-05-07 | url = http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/controversy-lingers-after-premiere-of-nashville-directors-aids-documentary/Content?oid=1200956 | work = [[Nashville Scene]] | accessdate = 2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Leung interviews a range of scientists and AIDS denialists, most notably [[Christine Maggiore]]. At the time of filming, Maggiore was HIV-positive and appeared healthy, despite her refusal to take [[anti-retroviral]] medication, which mainstream medicine uses to slow down the rate at which HIV destroys [[CD4+ T cells|CD4+ T-cells]]. As she said in the film, she refused to take the medication, and had not had her daughter, [[Eliza Jane Scovill]], tested, or provided her with medication, because she believed HIV did not cause AIDS. Rather, she believed that the medication itself caused AIDS. Maggiore's relative health, despite years of infection, is used by the film to support the idea that anti-retrovirals are unnecessary to combat, and may themselves cause, AIDS.

==Release and aftermath==
The film was screened at the multiple small film festivals, including the London Raindance film festival&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/oct/24/hiv-aids-link-denialist-spectator-events&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.houseofnumbers.com/site2/screenings.html&lt;/ref&gt; A panel discussion of the film at a [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] film festival was disrupted by Leung and other AIDS denialists in the audience, who attempted to shout down members of the panel with whom they disagreed.&lt;ref name="Baywindows"/&gt;

Both Maggiore and her daughter died of AIDS-related complications before the film's release, although their deaths are mentioned only in small print during the closing credits along with a claim that Maggiore's death was "unrelated to HIV."&lt;ref name="lancet"/&gt; Maggiore's daughter died in September 2005 of AIDS-related infections, although Maggiore rejected the cause of death and argued that the coroner's report was politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ornstein|first1=Charles|last2=Costello|first2=Daniel|title=A Mother's Denial, a Daughter's Death|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/24/local/me-eliza24|accessdate=April 17, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Did HIV-Positive Mom's Beliefs Put Her Children at Risk?|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/print?id=1386737|accessdate=April 17, 2015|work=ABC News|date=December 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maggiore herself died in December 2008 from [[AIDS-defining clinical condition|AIDS-related opportunistic infections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christine Maggiore died of AIDS|url=http://www.aidstruth.org/news/2009/christine-maggiore-died-aids|accessdate=April 17, 2015|work=AIDStruth.org|date=March 9, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821045350/http://www.aidstruth.org/news/2009/christine-maggiore-died-aids|archivedate=August 21, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteen scientists interviewed in the film stated that their answers to Leung's questions were selectively [[Video editing|edited]] to convey a false sense that the scientific community disagrees on basic facts about HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="lancet"/&gt; Two interviewees, Neil Constantine and [[Robin Weiss]], cite examples supporting the allegation that Leung misrepresented their words in a "surely intentional" manner.&lt;ref name="WeissConstantine"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Aidstruth.org | title = Constantine and Weiss pinpoint misrepresentations | date = November 26, 2009 | accessdate = November 27, 2009 | url = http://www.aidstruth.org/features/2009/constantine-and-weiss}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brent Leung denied taking quotes out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-rivera/filmmaker-brent-leung-res_b_271521.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Jeff | last=Rivera | title=Filmmaker, Brent Leung Responds to Huffpo Blogger, Thomas DeLorenzo | date=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The film's promotion of AIDS denialism, a pseudoscientific movement implicated in thousands of deaths,&lt;ref name="guardian-mbeki"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[The Guardian]] | title = Mbeki Aids denial 'caused 300,000 deaths' | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/26/aids-south-africa | date = November 26, 2008 | first = Sarah | last = Boseley}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew criticism and anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nashvillescene.com/2009-04-30/film/for-the-nashville-film-festival-there-s-clearly-life-after-forty/ | work = [[Nashville Scene]] | first = Jim | last = Ridley | date = April 29, 2009 | accessdate = September 8, 2009 | title = For the Nashville Film Festival, there's clearly life after 40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' characterized the film as "a weaselly support pamphlet for AIDS denialists", "willfully ignorant", and "a globe-trotting pseudo-investigation that should raise the hackles of anyone with even a glancing knowledge of the basic rules of reasoning."&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeanette |last= Catsoulis |title=AIDS Seen From a Different Angle  |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/09/04/movies/04house.html |work = [[New York Times]]  |date=4 September 2009  |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' cited the film as part of "this season's fashion in conspiracy theories."&lt;ref name="Aaronovitch"/&gt; The ''[[Portland Oregonian]]'' criticized Leung for "not being entirely honest with viewers," and decried the film's reliance on "selective editing, anomalies and anecdotes, unsupported conclusions...&amp;nbsp;and suppression of inconvenient facts."&lt;ref name="oregonian"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[Portland Oregonian]] | publisher = OregonLive.com | first = Stan | last = Hall | title = 'House of Numbers' blurs facts on HIV | url = http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/index.ssf/2010/01/review_house_of_numbers_blurs.html | date = January 21, 2010 | accessdate = May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction from the [[scientific community]] was similarly negative. ''[[The Lancet|Lancet Infectious Diseases]]'' criticized the film's arguments, calling them a "toxic combination of misrepresentation and sophistry."&lt;ref name="lancet"/&gt; AIDSTruth.org, a website created by HIV researchers to address AIDS denialism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cohen J |title=HIV/AIDS.

In February 2014 several people involved with the film filed [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] notices against a [[YouTube]] science blogger named Myles Power, who had made a video series debunking claims made in the film. Power argued that the film was [[fair use]] as criticism and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palmer|first1=Ewan|title=YouTube to Terminate Account of Scientist who Debunked Aids Denialist Movie|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/youtube-terminate-account-scientist-who-debunked-aids-denialist-movie-1436802|accessdate=April 17, 2015|work=International Business Times|date=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several commentators described the notices as attempted [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geigner|first1=Timothy|title=AIDS Denial Crazies Go All DMCA On Videos Educating People Of Their Craziness|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140210/05172926163/aids-denial-crazies-go-all-dmca-videos-educating-people-their-craziness.shtml|accessdate=April 17, 2015|work=Techdirt|date=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McSherry|first1=Corynne|title=New Entrants in the Takedown Hall of Shame: AIDS Deniers and Televangelists (Updated)|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/02/new-entrants-takedown-hall-shame-aids-deniers-and-televangelists|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=April 17, 2015|date=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kobie|first1=Nicole|title=Censorship by copyright: Myles Powers and abuse of DMCA takedowns|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/blogs/2014/02/17/censorship-by-copyright-myles-powers-and-abuse-of-dmca-takedowns|accessdate=April 17, 2015|work=PC Pro|date=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The videos were restored several days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palmer|first1=Ewan|title=Scientist's YouTube Account Remains Open Following Aids Denialist Censorship Claims|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/scientists-youtube-account-remains-open-following-aids-denialist-censorship-claims-1437094|accessdate=April 17, 2015|work=International Business Times|date=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:J. Reynolds, A discourse upon prodigious abstinence... Wellcome L0022587.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1669 report that claims a woman fasted for 12 months]]
'''Inedia''' (Latin for "[[fasting]]") or '''breatharianism''' {{IPAc-en|b|r|ɛ|θ|ˈ|ɛər|i|ə|n|ɪ|z|əm}} is the belief that it is possible for a person to live without consuming [[food]]. Breatharians claim that food, and in some cases [[water]], are not necessary for survival, and that humans can be sustained solely by ''[[prana]]'', the vital life force in [[Hinduism]]. According to [[Ayurveda]], [[sunlight]] is one of the main sources of ''prana'', and some practitioners believe that it is possible for a person to survive on sunlight alone. The terms ''breatharianism'' or ''inedia'' may also refer to this philosophy when it is practiced as a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] in place of the usual [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].

Breatharianism is considered a deadly [[pseudoscience]] by scientists and medical professionals, and several adherents of these practices have died from starvation and dehydration. Though it is common knowledge that biological entities require sustenance to survive, breatharianism continues.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news

==Scientific assessment==
[[Nutrition]]al science proves that [[fasting]] for extended periods leads to [[starvation]], [[dehydration]], and eventual death. In the absence of food intake, the body normally burns its own reserves of glycogen, body fat, and muscle. Breatharians claim that their bodies do not consume these reserves while fasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/breatharian1.htm |title=Can humans survive on air alone? | publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc. |accessdate=2009-07-30 |first=Katie|last=Lambert|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226084504/http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/breatharian1.htm |archivedate=2013-02-26 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His claims were investigated by doctors at Sterling Hospital, [[Ahmedabad]], [[Gujarat]] in 2003 and 2010.&lt;ref name="Dasgupta-Hindu"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article425184.ece |title = The Hindu – DIPAS concludes observational study on ‘Mataji' |accessdate =15 June 2010 |author = Manas Dasgupta | date= 9 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231214130/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article425184.ece |archivedate=2015-12-31 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that Prahlad Jani was able to survive under observation for two weeks without either food or water, and had passed no [[urine]] or [[feces|stool]],&lt;ref name="Khanna-bbc"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3236118.stm |title = Fasting fakir flummoxes physicians |accessdate =7 June 2008 |author = Rajeev Khanna | date=25 November 2003 |work=BBC News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328154126/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3236118.stm |archivedate=2016-03-28 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no need for [[dialysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/International/man-eat-drink/story?id=10787036 |title=Scientists Baffled by Prahlad Jani, Man Who Doesn't Eat or Drink |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173223/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/International/man-eat-drink/story?id=10787036 |archivedate=2016-03-03 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews with the researchers speak of strict observation and relate that round-the-clock observation was ensured by multiple [[CCTV]] cameras.

The case has attracted criticism, both after the 2003 tests and the 2010 tests. [[Sanal Edamaruku]], president of the [[Indian Rationalist Association]], criticized the 2010 experiment for allowing Jani to move out of a certain CCTV camera's field of view, meet devotees and leave the sealed test room to sunbathe. Edamaruku stated that the regular gargling and bathing activities were not sufficiently monitored, and accused Jani of having had some "influential protectors" who denied Edamaruku permission to inspect the project during its operation.&lt;ref name="rationalistinternational1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Edamaruku |first=Sanal |url=http://www.rationalistinternational.net/article/2010/20100518/en_1.html |title=Prahlad Jani and his powerful protectors |publisher=Rationalistinternational.net |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=14 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165946/http://www.rationalistinternational.net/article/2010/20100518/en_1.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jasmuheen===
[[Jasmuheen]] (born Ellen Greve) was a prominent advocate of breatharianism in the 1990s. She said "I can go for months and months without having anything at all other than a cup of tea. My body runs on a different kind of nourishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Vegetarian Myth: Food, Justice, and Sustainability,|author=Keith, L.|isbn=9781604861822|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=\_KGWcPH41qYC|year=2009|publisher=PM Press}}{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewers found her house stocked with food; Jasmuheen claimed the food was for her husband and daughter. In 1999, she volunteered to be monitored closely by the [[Australia]]n television program ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' for one week without eating to demonstrate her methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/60/stories/1999_10_24/story_57.asp|title=Living on air: Breatharian put to the test|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051102085047/http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/60/stories/1999_10_24/story_57.asp |archivedate=2 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/jasmuheen.htm |title = Jasmuheen |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001044/http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/jasmuheen.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jasmuheen stated that she found it difficult on the third day of the test because the hotel room in which she was confined was located near a busy road, causing [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and [[pollution]] that prevented absorption of required nutrients from the air. "I asked for fresh air. Seventy percent of my nutrients come from fresh air. I couldn’t even breathe," she said. The third day the test was moved to a mountainside retreat where her condition continued to deteriorate. After Jasmuheen had fasted for four days, Berris Wink, president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association, urged her to stop the test.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 1999"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.caic.org.au/miscult/breatharians/Fresh-air%20dietician%20fails%20TV%20show%27s%20challenge.htm | title=Fresh-air dietician fails TV show's challenge | publisher=[[Yahoo News]] | date=25 October 1999 | accessdate =7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wink, Jasmuheen’s pupils were dilated, her speech was slow, and she was "quite dehydrated, probably over 10%, getting up to 11%". Towards the end of the test, she said, "Her pulse is about double what it was when she started. The risks if she goes any further are kidney failure. ''60 Minutes'' would be culpable if they encouraged her to continue. She should stop now." The test was stopped. Wink said, "Unfortunately there are a few people who may believe what she says, and I'm sure it's only a few, but I think it's quite irresponsible for somebody to be trying to encourage others to do something that is so detrimental to their health."&lt;ref name="Yahoo 1999"/&gt; Jasmuheen challenged the results of the program, saying, "Look, 6,000 people have done this around the world without any problem."&lt;ref name="Bergman2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergman|first=Gregory|title=Isms: From Autoeroticism to Zoroastrianism – an Irreverent Reference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QUVuSNM5QUQC&amp;pg=PA32|year=2006|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=1-4405-1788-6|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Harris | first = Gillian | date = 6 April 2000 | title = Starvation guru given hostile reception | work = The Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://liberatapublishers.com/mysticism.htm |title = Mysticism |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209101343/http://liberatapublishers.com/mysticism.htm |archivedate=2012-02-09 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jasmuheen was awarded the [[Bent Spoon Award]] by [[Australian Skeptics]] in 2000 ("presented to the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudoscientific piffle").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.skeptics.com.au/spoon/2000winners.htm |title = Bent Spoon 2000 – Winner (Jasmuheen) |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050616014356/http://skeptics.com.au/spoon/2000winners.htm |archivedate= 2005-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also won the 2000 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for Literature for ''Living on Light''. Jasmuheen claims that their beliefs are based on the writings and "more recent [[channelling (mediumistic)|channelled]] material" from [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/454313.stm | date = 22 September 1999 |title = All they need is the air | work = BBC News | accessdate =11 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305092336/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/454313.stm |archivedate=2016-03-05 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stated that some people's [[DNA]] has expanded from 2 to 12 strands, to "absorb more hydrogen". When offered $30,000 to prove her claim with a blood test, she said that she didn't understand the relevance as she was not referring to herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 1997 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/correx/archives/jasmuheen.htm |title = Correx Archives&amp;nbsp;– Jasmuheen | work = Corex | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate =7 June 2008  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980423153006/http://www.abc.net.au/science/correx/archives/jasmuheen.htm |archivedate=1998-04-23 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the documentary ''[[No Way to Heaven]]'' the Swiss chemist Michael Werner claims to have followed the directions appearing on Jasmuheen's books, living for several years without food. The documentary also describes two attempts at scientific verification of his claims.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} {{asof|2017}}, five deaths had been directly linked to breatharianism as a result of Jasmuheen's publications.&lt;ref name="3Deaths"&gt;{{cite news | first = Tom | last = Walker |author2=Judith O'Reilly | title = Three deaths linked to 'living on air' cult | work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] | publisher = (London) | date = 26 September 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Swiss woman starves to death on daylight diet |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/swiss-woman-starved-to-death-on-daylight-diet/story-e6frf7lf-1226339082591 |newspaper=[[Herald Sun]] |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2012}} "This was the fourth known death linked to breatharianism and Jasmuheen's books since the practice emerged in the early 90s."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="contactmuziek"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.contactmuziek.nl/lichtvoeding.html | title=Contact &amp; Muziek: Lichtvoeding | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612223030/http://www.contactmuziek.nl/lichtvoeding.html | archive-date=12 June 2017 | accessdate=13 June 2017 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/06/12/om-onderzoekt-sterfgeval-in-woongroep-die-voeding-afzweert-a1562695 | title=OM onderzoekt sterfgeval in woongroep die voeding afzweert | newspaper = NRC Handelsblad | location = Amsterdam | last = van der Veen | first = Casper | date=12 June 2017 | accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jasmuheen has denied any responsibility for the deaths.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Wiley Brooks===
Wiley Brooks is the founder of the Breatharian Institute of America. He was first introduced to the public in 1980 when he appeared on the TV show ''[[That's Incredible!]]''.&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19931005&amp;slug=1724507 | title = Living On Light, Air – 'Breatharian' Says Food Is Poison But Pops An Occasional Twinkie | publisher = Seattle Times | last = Broom | first = Jack | date = 5 October 1993 | accessdate =12 February 2009  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181311/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19931005&amp;slug=1724507 |archivedate=2016-03-03 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks stopped teaching recently{{when|date=October 2016}} to "devote 100% of his time on solving the problem as to why he needed to eat some type of food to keep his [[physical body]] alive and allow his [[Subtle body|light body]] to manifest completely."&lt;ref name="altinate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breatharian.com/WileyBrooks-altinate.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211031744/http://www.breatharian.com/WileyBrooks-altinate.htm |archivedate=11 February 2006 |title=Wiley Brooks website through Internet Archive |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=11 February 2006 |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brooks claims to have found "four major deterrents" which prevented him from living without food: "people pollution", "food pollution", "air pollution" and "electro pollution".&lt;ref name="altinate"/&gt;

In 1983 he was reportedly observed leaving a [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] [[7-Eleven]] with a [[Slurpee]], a [[hot dog]], and [[Twinkie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor=John Yewell |url = http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/01.05.00/nuzjunkies-0001.html |title = A Year of Nüz|work=MetroActive News &amp; Issues  |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001003042829/http://metroactive.com/papers/cruz/01.05.00/nuzjunkies-0001.html |archivedate=2000-10-03 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He told ''[[Colors (magazine)|Colors]]'' magazine in 2003 that he periodically breaks his fasting with a [[cheeseburger]] and a [[cola]], explaining that when he's surrounded by junk culture and [[junk food]], consuming them adds balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/02.13.03/diets-0307.html |title=sonoma papers |publisher=Metroactive.com |date= |accessdate=30 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030306103945/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/02.13.03/diets-0307.html |archivedate=2003-03-06 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiley Brooks later claimed that [[Diet Coke]] and [[McDonald's]] cheeseburgers have special "5D" properties.  The idea of separate but interconnected 5D and 3D worlds is a major part of Wiley Brooks' ideology, and Wiley Brooks encourages his followers to only eat these special 5D foods, as well as meditate on a set of magical 5D words.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140522195834/http://www.breatharian.com/5wordsqa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the documentary, he was restricted to a small villa and placed under constant video surveillance, with medical supervision that included daily blood testing. The documentary claimed Maor was in good spirits throughout the experiment, lost 17&amp;nbsp;lb after eight days, blood tests showed no change before, during or after the experiment, and [[Cardiologist]] Ilan Kitsis from [[Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center]] was "baffled."&lt;ref name="panim.nana10.co.il"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="glz.co.il"/&gt;

==Religious traditions==

===Christianity===
* ''[[Anorexia mirabilis]]''

===Hinduism===
Hindu religious texts contain account of saints and hermits practicing what would be called inedia, breatharianism or Sustenance through Light in modern terms. In Valmiki's [[Ramayana]], Book III, Canto VI, an account of anchorites and holy men is given, who flocked around [[Rama]] when he came to [[Śarabhanga]]'s hermitage. These included, among others, the "...saints who live on rays which moon and daystar give" and "those ... whose food the wave of air supplies". In Canto XI of the same book a hermit named [[Māṇḍakarṇi]] is mentioned: "For he, great votarist, intent – On strictest rule his stern life spent – ... – Ten thousand years on air he fed..."  (English quotations are from Ralph T. H. Griffith's translation).

[[Paramahansa Yogananda]]'s ''Autobiography of a Yogi'' details two alleged historical examples of breatharianism, Hari [[Giri Bala]] and [[Therese Neumann]].

There are claims that [[Devraha Baba]] lived without food.

===Taoism===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1558">In [[crystal growth]], a '''Knudsen cell''' is an  [[effusion]]  [[evaporator]] source for relatively low partial pressure elementary sources (e.g. Ga, Al, Hg, As). Because it is easy to control the temperature of the evaporating material in Knudsen cells, they are commonly used in [[molecular-beam epitaxy]].

==Development==
The Knudsen effusion cell was developed by [[Martin Knudsen]] (1871-1949). A typical Knudsen cell contains a [[crucible]] (made of [[pyrolytic]] [[boron nitride]], [[quartz]], [[tungsten]] or [[graphite]]), heating filaments (often made of metal [[tantalum]]), [[water cooling]] system, [[heat shield]]s, and an [[:wikt:orifice|orifice]] shutter.

==Vapor pressure measurement==
The Knudsen cell is used to measure the [[vapor pressure]]s of a solid with very low vapor pressure. Such a solid forms a vapor at low pressure by [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]. The vapor slowly effuses through the pinhole, and the loss of mass is proportional to the vapor pressure and can be used to determine this pressure.&lt;ref name=Atk&gt;[[Peter Atkins]] and Julio de Paula, ''Physical Chemistry'' (8th ed., W.H.Freeman 2006) p.756 {{ISBN|0-7167-8759-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[heat of sublimation]] can also be determined by measuring the vapor pressure as a function of temperature, using the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]].&lt;ref&gt;Drago, R.S. ''Physical Methods in Chemistry'' (W.B.Saunders 1977) p.563 {{ISBN|0-7216-3184-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Langa Education Assistance Program (LEAP)''', also known as '''LEAP Science and Maths Schools''', is a collection of six non-fee payment secondary education schools located in three provinces in [[South Africa]]. The first LEAP school opened in 2004 in rented premises in Observatory, [[Cape Town]] and served mainly, learners from the [[township]] of [[Langa, Cape Town|Langa]].&lt;ref name="History of LEAP"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://leapschool.org.za/history-of-leap/|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20141110010101/http://leapschool.org.za/history%2Dof%2Dleap/|title = History of LEAP|accessdate = 10 November 2014|archivedate=10 November 2014|dead-url = yes|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an independent school, LEAP is mainly founded by South African Corporates with limited subsidies from the [[South African Department of Education|Department of Basic Education]].

==History==

===Langa Education Assistance Program (or LEAP) ===

John Gilmour was a teacher at [[Pinelands High School]]&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; in Cape Town in 1987 when he decided to respond to a call from individuals within the South African business community, to contribute to the redress of the devastation of the [[Bantu Education Act]],&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; a segregation law imposed in the education sector by the [[Apartheid]] system in 1953.

“Africa Week” was then introduced by a team led by John Gilmour to bring black learners under the “Bantu Education” system to spend a week at Pinelands High School, which was then a white’s only school. The program became the precursor for the Langa Education Assistance Program (or LEAP) which aimed at providing one hundred black students from the Langa township, with support tuition from Pinelands High teachers in [[English language|English]], [[Maths]] and [[Science]], three afternoons a week.

The prohibitive transport cost of bringing learners from the township schools to Pinelands High School forced the model to be revised. In 1996, it was then decided that instead of learners being bussed in to Pinelands High, teachers will be transported to meet learners in township schools.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

Community members in Langa perceived the new model of LEAP as an attempt of white teachers to “save” black children. Teachers from the community felt that they were as able as other teachers to provide extra lessons that would address the inadequacies in the students' educational foundations.  The uneasiness within the community obliged the leadership of LEAP to change the model and include community teachers in the program.

When John Gilmour realised that despite best efforts of LEAP and similar programs in the country there was no increase in the proportion of black learners entering university, especially science-based disciplines, he sought for an alternative model. LEAP Science and Maths school was the alternative model.

===LEAP Science and Maths School===

LEAP Science and Maths school was a deliberate decision of John Gilmour seeking to increase the number of black learners who take science and maths-based modules at high school in order to increase the chance of being accepted at University, particular in disciplines where these modules are a prerequisite.&lt;ref name="A Leap in the dark"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Terblanche|first1=Barry|title=A leap in the dark|publisher=Mail and Guardian|date=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John resigned as Headmaster of Abbot’s College in 2004, where he has been since he left Pinelands in 1997, to focus on LEAP Science and Maths School.  In January 2004, the first LEAP Science and Maths School opened its doors in the suburb of Observatory, Cape Town, with seventy-two learners, seven teachers and one administrative staff member.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

===Expansion of the LEAP model===

====LEAP 1====

The LEAP Science and Maths school, which started in Observatory later moved to Pinelands and become known as LEAP 1. It serves learners from community of Langa Township. It is the first and oldest of the LEAP Science and Maths schools.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; The school is headed by its Operation Leader Oscar Dlodlo.

====LEAP 2====

LEAP 2 opened in 2007 also in Pinelands. It serves learners from the townships of Gugulethu and Crossroads. In 2013, the school opened satellite classes to serve grade 9 and 10 learners from the township of Delft. Learners of the school are taught in English and [[isiXhosa]]. The head of the school is Mr. Babele Emedi, who also assumes the role of Operations Leader.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

====LEAP 3====

The school opened its doors in 2008 to serve learners from the township of Alexandra in [[Johannesburg]].  Learners are taught in [[English language|English]], [[isiZulu]], [[Sepedi]] and [[Sesotho]] under the leadership of the Operations leader, Mr. Mark Fletcher.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

====LEAP 4====

This school is situated in the township of [[Diepsloot]] just outside Johannesburg. The school opened in 2011 through a partnership with the South Africa corporate Aveng Group.&lt;ref name="Aveng Group Projects"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aveng Group Projects|url=http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|website=http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|publisher=Aveng Group|accessdate=10 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003105051/http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|archivedate=3 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; LEAP 4 teaches learners in isiZulu and [[Sepedi]] as home languages, along with English.  Paul Mumba, is the Operations Leader and head of LEAP 4.

====LEAP 5====

In 2012, LEAP 5 opened its doors in Jane Furse, [[Sekhukhune District Municipality|Sekhukhune]] in [[Limpopo]] province. The school is under the leadership of its Operation Leader, Raphael Mukachi.

====LEAP 6====

LEAP 6 is situated in [[Ga-Rankuwa]] near [[Pretoria]]. The school opened in 2012 to respond to the request of the Anglican Diocese of Pretoria, concerned with the community’s poor educational results and high unemployment rate, particularly among young people. The school is led by its Operation Leader, Lawrence Manyesa.

==Vision==

“We strive for the positive transformation of communities through the meaningful education of children from those communities”&lt;ref name="About LEAP"&gt;{{cite web|title=About LEAP|url=http://leapschool.org.za/aboutleap/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/aboutleap/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

“LEAP schools provide student-centered, math’s and science-focused education to economically disadvantaged students from grades 8 to 12. We focus on enabling the self-awareness necessary for each student’s growth to healthy adulthood, and to ensuring optimal academic results which will allow for choices for lifelong learning and a fulfilling future.”&lt;ref name= "About LEAP" /&gt;

== Values and focus==

Although LEAP schools focus on Maths and Sciences; it puts a lot of emphasis on the emotional [[child development|development]] of learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dugger|first1=Celia W|title=New Schools in South Africa Serve the Underserved|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/world/africa/09safrica.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=3&amp;|accessdate=10 November 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=8 September 2010|ref=New Schools in South Africa Serve the Underserved}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Gilmour acknowledged the importance of the emotional development in a country where “eight million children come from single-parent households and a further 4.3 million reside with neither biological parent”.  In his article “A tale of two systems”, he speaks of LEAP’s response to this problem “has been to recognise that social transformation starts with personal transformation:  one person at a time, one room at a time, one school at a time and one community at a time.”&lt;ref name="A tale of two systems"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilmour|first1=John|title=A tale of two systems|url=http://leapschool.org.za/2012/02/12/a-tail-of-two-systems/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school cherishes the following values:
*Being kind, honest and healthy
*Being punctual and looking good
*Working hard and never giving up
*Admitting and learning from mistakes
*Confronting issues and being open to change
*Working together and sharing

== Success stories==

===Statistics===

In a report that analyses the performance of the school between 2005 and 2013, LEAP reported that:

*Its grade 12 learners have achieved a 93% pass rate within the reporting period.
*600 learners passed the National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations commonly known as “matric”
*77% qualified for study at academic and technical universities with a bachelor or diploma pass.&lt;ref name=Success&gt;{{cite web|title=Success|url=http://leapschool.org.za/success/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/success/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school claims to outperform national statistics when it compares itself with national averages of learners who write maths and science in 2013. All LEAP learners wrote these modules compared to only 43% who took maths and 33% who took physical science nationally.&lt;ref name="LEAP Annual Report 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=LEAP Annual Report 2013|url=http://leapschool.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LEAP_AnnualReport2013.pdf|website=http://leapschool.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LEAP_AnnualReport2013.pdf|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduates===

Bonisanani Mtshekisa&lt;ref name="Never Give Up"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mtshekisa|first1=Bonisanani|title=Never Give Up|url=http://leapschool.org.za/2011/08/08/never-give-up/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/2011/08/08/never-give-up/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is LEAP’s first university graduate. He graduated with a bachelor in [[Bachelor of Commerce]] in Finance from the [[University of the Western Cape]]. In its 2012 annual report, the school reported to have over 30 university graduates ranging from physiotherapist, engineer to accountants.

===Celebratory adverts===

In 2014, LEAP launched a series of celebratory adverts to showcase its work and celebrate the achievements of its past students. Qondisa Nxganga, a Master’s graduate from the prestigious [[African Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] (AIMS), is featured in these adverts alongside a number of other LEAP alumni.&lt;ref name="Celebrating LEAP Alumni"&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating LEAP Alumni|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPYGiXxlQCo|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=LEAP Science &amp; Maths School|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===

LEAP’s model is based on strong engagement with the broader community and building beneficial partnerships and collaboration with other organizations, particular schools. It is a three-way collaboration approach where each LEAP school partners with a more privileged school as well as a less privileged school (a township school) in the community where it operates to promote a culture of shared resources and cultural exchange&lt;ref name=Schools&gt;{{cite web|title=Schools|url=http://leapschool.org.za/schools/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/schools/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LEAP has also been successful in building strong partnerships with both commercial and non-profit organizations. Most of its funding comes from South African corporates, trusts and Foundations.

LEAP, is Teach with Africa’s partner on the continent and together they have established the Teacher Institute which seeks to develop teachers and supports individuals wanting to enter the teaching profession&lt;ref name="Teach for Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Teach for Africa|url=http://www.teachwithafrica.org/what-we-do/our-in-country-partners/|website=http://www.teachwithafrica.org/what-we-do/our-in-country-partners/|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Lariat chain''' is a loop of chain that hangs off, and is spun by a wheel. It is often used as a science exhibit or a toy. 

The original [http://normantuck.com/catalogPages/lariat.html '''Lariat Chain'''] was created in 1986 by [http://www.normantuck.com Norman Tuck], as an Artist-in-Residence project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/xref/exhibits/lariat_chain.html |title=Exhibit Cross Reference - Lariat Chain |publisher=Exploratorium.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Exploratorium]] in San Francisco. 

'''Lariat Chain''' was developed from an earlier Tuck piece entitled '''Chain Reaction''' (1984). '''Chain Reaction''' was hand cranked, and utilized a heavy chain attached by magnets onto an iron flywheel. As in '''Lariat Chain''', '''Chain Reaction''' used a brush to disrupt the motion of the traveling chain.  

The speed of the chain is arranged to equal the [[group velocity|wave speed]] of [[transverse wave]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Transverse and Longitudinal Waves|url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/tralon.html|website = hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that waves moving against the motion of the chain appear to be standing still.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exploratorium.edu/cmp/exnet/exhibits/group2/lariat/index.html Exploratorium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005233508/http://www.exploratorium.edu/cmp/exnet/exhibits/group2/lariat/index.html |date=2008-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normantuck.com/catalogPages/lariat.html normantuck.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Substances, mixtures and exposure circumstances in this list have been classified by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) as '''''Group 3''': The agent (mixture or exposure circumstance) is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans.'' This category is used most commonly for agents, mixtures and exposure circumstances for which the evidence of carcinogenicity is inadequate in humans and inadequate or limited in experimental animals. Exceptionally, agents (mixtures) for which the evidence of carcinogenicity is inadequate in humans but sufficient in experimental animals may be placed in this category when there is strong evidence that the mechanism of carcinogenicity in experimental animals does not operate in humans. Agents, mixtures and exposure circumstances that do not fall into any other group are also placed in this category.

Further details can be found in the [http://monographs.iarc.fr/indexfr.php/ IARC Monographs]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11615">The '''soil composition of vineyards''' is one of the most important [[viticulture|viticultural]] considerations when planting grape vines. The [[soil]] supports the [[root]] structure of the vine and influences the drainage levels and amount of [[mineral]]s and nutrients that the vine is exposed to. The ideal soil condition for a vine is a layer of thin [[topsoil]] and [[subsoil]] that sufficiently retains water but also has good drainage so that the roots do not become overly saturated. The ability of the soil to retain heat and/or reflect it back up to the vine is also an important consideration that affects the ripening of the grapes.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 16"&gt;T. Stevenson ''"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia"'' pg 16 Dorling Kindersley 2005 {{ISBN|0-7566-1324-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several minerals that are vital to the health of vines that all good vineyard soils have. These include [[calcium]] which helps to neutralize the [[Soil pH]] levels, [[iron]] which is essential for [[photosynthesis]], [[magnesium]] which is an important component of [[chlorophyll]], [[nitrogen]] which is assimilated in the form of [[nitrates]], [[phosphates]] which encourages root development, and [[potassium]] which improves the vine metabolisms and increases its health for next year's crop.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 16"/&gt;

==List of soil terms==
''Unless otherwise noted the primary reference for this list is Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia 2005''

===A-C===
*Albariza - Formed by [[diatomaceous]] deposits. Found in southern [[Spain]]
*[[Alluvium]] - Highly fertile soil that has been transported by a river. Often contains [[gravel]], [[sand]] and [[silt]].
*[[Basalt]] - [[Volcanic rock]] that is high in calcium, iron, and magnesium. Variable potassium and little or no quartz.
*Boulbènes - Fine [[siliceous]] soil that is easily compressed and common in the [[Entre-Deux-Mers]] region of [[Bordeaux]].
*[[Brickearth]] - ''See under'' [[Loess]].
*[[Calcareous|Calcareous soil]] - [[Alkaline soil]] with high levels of [[Calcium carbonate|calcium]] and [[Magnesium carbonate]]. Typically cool in temperature soil that provides good water retention and drainage. '''Calcareous clay''' soils have high [[limestone]] content that neutralizes natural acidity of the soil. However the cool temperatures of the soil normally delay ripening in the grape which tends to produce more acidic wines.
*Carbonaceous soil - Soil produced through the [[anaerobic decomposition]] of rotting vegetation. This type of soil includes [[anthracite]], [[coal]], [[lignite]] and [[peat]].
*[[Chalk]] - Very [[porous]] soft limestone soil that vine roots can easily penetrate. It provides good drainage and works best for grapes with high acidity levels.
*[[Clay]] - [[Sedimentary rock]] based soil that has good water retention ability but poor drainage. The soil is often very cool and high in acidity. The Right Bank of [[Bordeaux]] is dominated by clay based soils.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;E. S. Brown ''"[http://winegeeks.com/articles/139 The World's Top 10 Wine Soils] Wine Geeks 7/5/2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===D-H===
*[[Dolomite]] - Calcium-magnesium carbonate soil.
*[[Flint]] - Siliceous stone that reflects and retains heat well. The [[Pouilly-Fumé]] wine of the [[Loire Valley]] is generally produced from flint-based soil and is said to have "gun-flint" smell in the wine.
*Galestro - [[Schist]] based soil found in the [[Tuscany]] region of [[Italy]].
*[[Granite]] - Composed of 40-60% quartz, 30-40% [[Orthoclase]] and various amounts of [[hornblende]], [[mica]], and other minerals. This soil warms quickly and retains heat well. The soil's high level of acidity works to minimize the acid levels in the grapes which works well with acidic grapes like [[Gamay]]. It is the main soil type of the Brand region of [[Alsace]].&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Gravel]] - Loose siliceous pebble soil that has good drainage but poor fertility. Vines planted in this type of soil must penetrate deeply to try to and find nutrients in the subsoil. Wine made from vines produces on clay gravel beds have less acidity than those planted on limestone gravel beds. The [[Graves (wine region)|Graves]] and [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]] regions of Bordeaux consist predominantly of gravel-based soil.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Greywacke]] - Sedimentary soil formed by rivers depositing quartz, [[mudstone]] and [[feldspar]]. It is found in vineyards of [[Germany]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]].
*[[Gypsum]] - [[Calcium sulfate]] based soil that is formed through the [[evaporation]] of [[seawater]]. It is a high absorbent soil that has average drainage ability.
*[[Hardpan]] - A dense layer of clay or other material that is impermeable to water. In some areas of [[Bordeaux]], a [[sand]]y iron-rich layer is located deep enough below the surface to act as a [[water table]] for the vine.

===I-Q===
*[[Keuper]] - Soil type consisting of [[marl]] and [[limestone]] common in [[Alsace]], dating to the [[Upper Triassic]] period.
*Kimmeridgian soil - A gray colored limestone based soil originally identified in [[Kimmeridge, England]]. '''Kimmeridgian clay''' is calcareous clay containing Kimmeridgian limestone. This is the principal soil type of the [[Loire Valley]], [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] regions.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Lignite]] - Soil type used as fertilizer in [[Germany]] and [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne]]. It is a brown colored carbonaceous soil that is intermediate between [[peat]] and [[coal]].
*[[Limestone]] - Sedimentary based soil consisting of [[carbonates]]. The most common colored limestone found in wine producing area is buff-gray in color (with the exception of white [[chalk]]). The water retention abilities vary from composition but limestone is consistently [[alkaline]] and is generally planted with grapes of high acidity levels. This is the main soil type in the [[Zinnkoepflé]] region of Alsace.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*Llicorella - A soil type found in the [[Priorat (DOQ)|Priorat]] appellation of Spain. The soil is a mix of slate and quartz that dates to the [[Paleozoic]] era. The soil is very porous and drains well. [[Syrah]], [[Grenache]] and [[Carignan]] have done well in this soil type.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Loam]] - Warm, soft, fertile soil composed of roughly equal amounts of [[silt]], [[sand]] and [[clay]]. It is typically too fertile for high quality wines that need to limit yields in order to concentrate flavors.
*[[Loess]] - A very fine, predominantly silty soil composed of [[wind-borne sand|wind-borne sediment]] that is typically angular and decalcified. Commonly known as [[brickearth]] in the UK, the soil is very fertile and has good water retention and warming properties, but drains poorly.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;Bell, F. G. &amp; Culshaw, M. G. (2001). 'Problem soils - a review from a British perspective', in Jefferson, I., Murray, E. J., Faragher, E. and Fleming, P. R. (eds). ''Problematic soils'', 11-17, Thomas Telford. {{ISBN|0-7277-3043-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Marl]] - Calcareous clay-based soil that adds acidity to the wine. Vines planted in this type of soil normally ripen later than in other soil types. Marl soil is typically deep and lacking in stone fragments; it is the main soil type in the [[Piedmont wine]] region of Italy. '''Marlstone''' is the indurated (well-cemented) metamorphic form of Marl.
*[[Mica]] - [[Silicate]] based soil composed of fine, decomposed rock formations.
*[[Muschelkalk]] -Soil type consisting of various compositions of [[sandstone]], marl, [[dolomite]], and [[slate|shingle]] common in Alsace dating back from the [[Middle Triassic]] period.
*[[Perlite]] - A [[volcanic]] soil type that is light, powdery and lustrous with properties similar to [[diatomaceous earth]].
*[[Quartz]] - Common material found in most vineyard soils - especially sand and silt based soils. The high [[Soil pH]] of quartz can reduce the acidity of the resulting wines but its heat retaining property that stores and reflects heat can increase ripening of the grape which can result in wine of higher alcohol content.

===S-Z===
*[[Sand]] - Warm, airy soil that is composed of tiny particles of weathered rocks. One of the few soils that the [[phylloxera]] louse does not thrive in, the soil drains well but does not have good water retention. '''Sandstone''' is a [[sedimentary soil]] composed of sand particles that has been pressured bound by various [[iron]] based minerals. This is the main soil type of [[Kitterlé]] in Alsace.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Schist]] - Laminated, [[crystalline]] rock based soil that retains heat well and is rich in [[magnesium]] and [[potassium]] but is poor in organic nutrients and [[nitrogens]].
*[[Shale]] - Fine grain sedimentary based soil that can turn into [[slate]] when under pressure. The soil is moderately fertile and retains heat well.
*Siliceous soil - Soil composed of [[acid]] rock that are crystalline in nature. The soil has good heat retention but needs the added composition of [[silt]], [[clay]] and other sedimentary soils to have any kind of water retention. The range of this soil can include organic materials like [[Kieselguhr]] and [[flint]] or inorganic materials like [[quartz]]. This soil type covers half of the [[Bordeaux wine regions|wine regions]] of [[Bordeaux]].
*[[Silt]] - Soil type consisting of fine grain deposits that offer good water retention but poor drainage. It is more fertile than sand.
*[[Silex]] - A flint and sand based soil type found primarily in the [[Loire Valley]] that is a formed from a mixture of clay, limestone and [[silica]].&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Slate]] - Soil type that is the most common found in the [[Mosel wine|Mosel]] region. Slate is a metamorphic, plate-like rock formed when shale, clay, or [[siltstone]] is subjected to pressure deep within the earth. The soil retains heat well and warms up relatively quickly.
*Steige - A schist based soil found in the [[Andlau]] region of [[Alsace]]. In the [[Alsace Grand Cru AOC]] of Kastelberg, the soil has [[metamorphosed]] with [[granite]] sand to form a hard, dark slate like stone.
*[[Terra Rossa]] - A sedimentary soil, known as "Red Earth", that is formed after [[carbonates]] have been leached out of limestone. The breakdown leaves behind iron deposits which [[oxidizes]] and turns the soil a rustic red color. This soil type is found in some areas along the [[Mediterranean]] and in [[Coonawarra wine region|Coonawarra]]. The soil drains well and is relatively high in nutrients. Australian winemakers have found some success with [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] plantings.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Tufa]] - A highly-friable calcareous bedrock that breaks down into a fine crumb structure.
*[[Ultisol]] - a highly weathered, largely infertile, clay-based soil - usually brilliant red in color - found in the [[American South]].
*[[Volcanic soil]] - Soil that is derived from one of two volcanic activities. 1.) ''Vent-based soil'' is formed from rock material (including [[pumice]] and [[tuff]]) that has been ejected into the air and cooled before settling to the earth. 2.) ''Lava-based soil'' is the product of [[lava]] flows from the volcano. Ninety percent of lava-based soil is composed of [[basalt]] with the other ten percent composed of [[andesite]], [[pitchstone]], [[rhyolite]], and [[trachyte]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17259">'''Living educational theory''' ('''LET''') is a research method in educational research.

==Overview==
The idea of [[action research]] as a living practice entered the mainstream of action research from the book, "Action Research as a Living Practice" by Terrance Carson and Dennis Sumara in 1997. Carson and Sumara transformed the concept of traditional action research with the idea that, ..." participation in action research practices are particular ways of living and understanding that require more of the researcher than the "application" of research methods. Rather, action research is a lived practice that requires that the researcher not only investigate the subject at hand but, as well, provide some account of the way in which the investigation both shapes and is shaped by the investigator {{harv|Carson|Sumara|1997| p=xii}}. This requires what [[Martin Buber]] called an "[[I and Thou|I-Thou]]" approach toward other and this approach applied to action research as well. To make Buber's language more modern and accessible, LET translated Buber's "I-Thou" approach toward another human being to an "I/you/we" approach to action research. This differs greatly from an approach to living theory action research imagined by Jack Whitehead (2002){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} where he imagines living theory action research as forming an "I-theory" of knowledge. Director of the [[Philosophy for Children]] Project at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] William Barry proposes LET focuses on the connections between the researcher and the other person or subject where the lives of action researchers are inextricable linked in a profound manner with the individuals and communities involved in the subject of study. LET from a Barryian perspective is a [[critical theory]] and [[emancipation|emancipatory]] action research approach which seeks the dialectic, not debate and battles of [discourse].

A major difference of William Barry's version of living educational theory, which was the focus of his successful completion of a Ph.D. thesis at [[Nottingham Trent University]], UK, is the essential question behind the living educational theory approach to action research ([[#{{harvid|Barry|2012b}}|2012b]]). The question is not "How can I generate a living legacy for myself through an I-It theory approach toward knowledge and other forms of life?" Rather the essential question is, "How does one conduct a life that includes the practice of educational action research?"{{harv|Carson|Sumara|1997| p=xvii}} The theory/practice problem disappears when honesty about one's biases regarding spiritual, existential, and emotional intelligence are made clear in the action research process.

The phraseology "educational theory" originated with the work of [[Jack Whitehead]], a former lecturer at the [[University of Bath]], and it was further developed and greatly improved methodologically by [[Jean McNiff]] in 2009 because of her willingness to be transparent about her values and intentions. Whitehead's main emphasis for conducting research is to promote the individual under the guise of collaboration and research outcomes must be captured on video for authentic validation. Whitehead's view of action research promotes that living educational theory (he uses living theory and living educational theory interchangeably so it is difficult for a reader to know what he is writing about) should be aimed at the bringing of energy-flowing values as explanatory principles and standards of judgments into the Academy for the legitimation of living educational theories (Whitehead 2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. In the eyes of Whitehead [[radical constructivism]] is at the core of living educational theory research. In 2013, Whitehead and McNiff separated as collaborators as McNiff saw spiritual, emotional intelligence as key to action research while Whitehead disagreed and believed that media accounts (primarily video tapping people) of action research could provide clues to virtues which held the future of humanity though energy flowing examples of collaboration. McNiff stated in a May 2013 conference she San Francisco, California (ARNA Conference){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} that she would never appear or work with Whitehead again. She repeated this message again months later at a UK conference in York. American  William Barry believed the concept of LET was too important and found a dialectic between McNiff and Whitehead and he created a new understanding of LET which was presented at a three-day international conference in 2013 at [[Liverpool Hope University]] titled, "Researching Our Own Practice" {{harv|Barry|2013}}.

== Definition ==

Living educational theory was first clearly defined and developed by California Professor of Philosophy [[William Barry (educator)|William Barry]] (2012b) in [[Liz Atkins]] and [[Susan Wallace (educator)|Susan Wallace]]'s book {{harv|Atkins|Wallace|2012}}, ''Qualitative Research in Education'', co-published by [[Sage Publications|Sage]] and the [[British Educational Research Association]] (BERA). This book was one of four in a series sponsored by the BERA regarding best practice progressive research methods in educational research. The originality and uniqueness of Barry's development of living educational theory (LET) action research is the importance of gaining ''ontological weight'' through the action research process. Ontological weight empowers the researcher's ability, and the ability of other people involved in the action research project, to have the research experience and focus of the research be transformational and add, or at least reinforce, a sense of meaning in learning and life. Barry was influenced to use the concept "ontological weight" by the existentialist Catholic philosopher [[Gabriel Marcel]] (1963).{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The idea of action research as a living practice entered the mainstream of action research from the book, "Action Research as a Living Practice" by Terrance Carson and Dennis Sumara in 1997. The term "educational theory" originated with the work of [[Jack Whitehead]], a former lecturer at the [[University of Bath]], and it was further developed and greatly improved methodologically by [[Jean McNiff]] in 2009.{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} Whitehead's main emphasis for conducting research is to promote the individual under the guise of collaboration and research outcomes must be captured on video for authentic validation. Whitehead's view of action research promotes that living educational theory (he uses living theory and living educational theory interchangeably so it is difficult for a reader to know what he is writing about) should be aimed at the bringing of energy-flowing values as explanatory principles and standards of judgments into the Academy for the legitimation of living educational theories (Whitehead 2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. In the eyes of Whitehead, [[radical constructivism]] is at the core of living educational theory research.

Barry was asked by the BERA sponsored authors to reflect on the nature of living educational theory (LET) because there existed no clear definition of LET in the literature. Barry was asked because he had successfully used LET in an innovative fashion, and was the first to clearly define LET as based in [[critical theory]] {{harv|Wink|2011}} which embraced [[transpersonal psychology]] through his earned 2012 PhD thesis at [[Nottingham Trent University]] Nottingham, UK. He proposed LET as a way of challenging the oppressive use of power using critical theory {{harv|Gorlewski|Gorlewski|Portfilio|2012}} in a need fulfilling way (Glasser 1998){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. Barry proposed the following definition and approach to action research he calls living educational theory and his approach has been used as an action research method in undergraduate and graduate courses and research at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] in Silicon Valley, California as well as by other researchers around the world.

Barry explained that living educational theory "[is] a critical and transformational approach to action research. It confronts the researcher to challenge the status quo of their educational practice and to answer the question, 'How can I improve that I'm doing?' Researchers who use this approach must be willing to recognize and assume responsibility for being a 'living contradiction' in their professional practice – thinking one way and acting in another. The mission of the LET action researcher is to overcome workplace norms and self – behavior which contradict the researcher's values and beliefs. The vision of the LET researcher is to make an original contribution to knowledge through generating an educational theory proven to improve the learning of people within a social learning space. The standard of judgment for theory validity is evidence of workplace reform, transformational growth of the researcher, and improved learning by the people researcher claimed to have influenced..." {{harv|Atkins|Wallace|2012| p=131}}.

Barry's LET approach to action research was heavily influenced by action researchers focused on emancipatory social change, collaboration, and liberation theology ([[#{{harvid|Barry|2012a}}|2012a]]). Prominent developers of LET, without whose work LET would most likely never had been developed by Barry, are notable action researchers, educators, and philosophers such as [[Martin Buber]]'s ([[#{{harvid|Buber|1970}}|1970]]) conception of 'I and Thou' and [[Krishnamurti]]'s (1953){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} liberation pedagogy emphasizing education as significant to leading a quality filled life; [[Paulo Freire]] (1998{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[#{{harvid|Freire|1970}}|1970]]) and his concept of participatory action research and the need to be politically aware; the work of Carr and Kremmis (1986){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[Habermas]] (1992) and their concept and building critical educational knowledge; Professor Manheimer of UNC (1999){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and his challenge to his readers to enfold the past into the living present in order to become historical to oneself and then strive to linking life times with each other; Apple (1982){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[Michel Foucault]] (1990){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and the role of power and politics in education and Joe Kincheloe (2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}, [[Henry Giroux]] (1997){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}, and [[Peter McLaren]] (1989){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and their promotion of critical pedagogy.

Prof. Barry was the first Ph.D. researcher to successfully use living educational theory in conjunction with [[neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP), [[spiral dynamics]] and [[autoethnography]] (based on a [[multiple intelligences]] model which includes [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[emotional intelligence]] and embraces [[transpersonal]] knowing)  as valid methods of research working under the methodological umbrella of phenomenology and hermeneutics. His LET approach to Ph.D.level action research led to the unique use of fictional storytelling as a vehicle by which to replace the traditional literature review chapter in Ph.D. research but in a more rigorous and creative fashion. The process of [[storytelling]] allows the researcher to exercise their emotional intelligence in a superior manner than the traditional research literature review allows.

==Six cycles==

Living educational theory as defined and created by Barry is part of the curriculum of multiple courses at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] located in Silicon Valley, California in their credentialing program for teacher education. Barry's Living Educational Theory Action Research Method is based on a six step process&lt;ref&gt;(https://web.archive.org/web/20140310094005/http://www.ntu.edu/faculty-staff)&lt;/ref&gt; based on research questions that normally start from the format, " How can I influence the transformation of....?" or "How can I contribute to the improvement of...?" The research is dialectical in nature:

# I experience a crises in my sense of meaning when my values and beliefs as an educator/educational leader and/or learner are oppressed by my passive acceptance of the status quo and the use of oppressive power to change my identity. In essence, I experience narrative wreckage in my educational life (Thesis).
# I describe my contribution in promoting the [[status quo]] and my role in using oppressive power against others from both a [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[hermeneutical]] perspective to illuminate my living contradictions (Anti-thesis)
# I develop a solution to transform and improve myself, influence the transformation and improvement of the fellow human beings with whom I interact and the social and work places I share with people.
# I enact [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in the direction of the solution I developed from a [[critical theory]] perspective.
# I evaluate the pragmatic outcomes of the solution based on the Hallmarks of Learning {{harv|Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur|2005}} and the implications from a holistic psychological perspective including [[transpersonal psychology]].
# I modify my use of power, pedagogy, valid and reliable [[Educational assessment|assessment]], and leadership to maximize social justice, ethical processes and results, and improve performance and knowledge as a result of my emerging living educational theory (LET) (Synthesis). As an iterative process, I start the cycle again within reasonable time constraints.

'''Lysenkoism''' ({{lang-rus|Лысе́нковщина|Lysenkovshchina}}) was a political campaign conducted by [[Trofim Lysenko]], his followers and Soviet authorities against [[genetics]] and science-based [[agriculture]]. Lysenko served as the director of the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[VASKhNIL|Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences]]. Lysenkoism began in the late 1920s and formally ended in 1964.

The [[pseudo science|pseudo-scientific]] ideas of Lysenkoism assumed the [[Inheritance of acquired characteristics|heritability of acquired characteristics (Lamarckism)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lysenkoism|title= Lysenkoism|work= merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lysenko's theory rejected [[Mendelian inheritance]] and the concept of the "[[gene]]"; it departed from [[Darwinian evolution]]ary theory by rejecting [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Perversion of Knowledge" /&gt; Proponents falsely claimed to have discovered, among many other things, that [[rye]] could transform into wheat and wheat into barley, that weeds could spontaneously transmute into food grains, and that "natural cooperation" was observed in nature as opposed to "natural selection".&lt;ref name="Perversion of Knowledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Birstein|first1= Vadim J.|title= The Perversion of Knowledge: The True Story of Soviet Science.|date= 2004|publisher= Westview Press|isbn= 0813342805}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lysenkoism promised extraordinary advances in [[sexual reproduction|breeding]] and in agriculture that never came about.

[[Joseph Stalin]] supported the campaign. More than 3,000 mainstream [[biologist]]s were fired or even sent to prison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Birstein| first1 = Vadim J.| title = The Perversion Of Knowledge: The True Story Of Soviet Science| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2XqEAAAAQBAJ| publisher = Perseus Books Group| publication-date = 2013| page = | isbn = 9780786751860| access-date = 2016-06-30| quote = Academician Schmalhausen, Professors Formozov and Sabinin, and 3,000 other biologists, victims of the August 1948 Session, lost their professional jobs because of their integrity and moral principles [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous scientists were executed as part of a campaign instigated by Lysenko to [[Suppressed research in the Soviet Union|suppress his scientific opponents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wade|first1=Nicholas|title=The Scourge of Soviet Science|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-scourge-of-soviet-science-1466192179|website=Wall Street Journal|date=June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swedin|first1=Eric G.|title=Science in the Contemporary World : An Encyclopedia|date=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1851095241|pages=168, 280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soyfer Nature"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soyfer |first1=Valery N. |title=The Consequences of Political Dictatorship for Russian Science|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=1 September 2001 |volume=2 |issue=9|pages=723–729|doi=10.1038/35088598}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=deJong-Lambert|first1=William|title=The Lysenko Controversy as a Global Phenomenon, Volume 1: Genetics and Agriculture in the Soviet Union and Beyond|date=2017|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=3319391755 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the Agriculture Academy, [[Nikolai Vavilov]], was sent to prison and died there, while scientific research in the field of genetics was effectively destroyed until the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Stalin]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="Perversion of Knowledge" /&gt; Research and teaching in the fields of [[neurophysiology]], [[cell biology]], and many other biological disciplines was also negatively affected or banned.&lt;ref name="Soyfer Tagedy"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Soyfer|first1= Valery N.| authorlink =Valery Soyfer|title= Lysenko and The Tragedy of Soviet Science|date= 1994|publisher= Rutgers Univ.

In modern usage, the term lysenkoism has become distinct from normal pseudoscience. Where pseudoscience pretends to be science, lysenkoism aims at attacking the legitimacy of science itself, usually for political reasons.  It is the rejection of the universality of scientific truth, and the purposeful defamation of the scientific method to the level of politics. 

==In agriculture==
In 1928, Trofim Lysenko, a previously unknown [[Agronomy|agronomist]], claimed to have developed an agricultural technique, termed [[vernalization]], which tripled or quadrupled [[crop yield]] by exposing [[wheat]] seed to high humidity and low temperature. While cold and moisture exposure are a normal part of the life cycle of autumn-seeded winter cereals, the vernalization technique claimed to increase yields by increasing the intensity of exposure, in some cases planting soaked seeds directly into the snow cover of frozen fields. In reality, the technique was neither new (it had been known since 1854, and was extensively studied during the previous twenty years), nor did it produce the yields he promised, although some increase in production did occur.

When Lysenko began his fieldwork in the Soviet Union of the 1930s, the [[Agriculture in the Soviet Union|agriculture of the Soviet Union]] was in a massive crisis due to the forced [[collective farms|collectivisation of farms]], and the extermination of the [[kulak]]s.  The resulting [[Soviet famine of 1932–33|famine]] provoked the people and the government alike to search for any possible solution to the critical lack of food.  Lysenko's vernalization practices yielded marginally greater food production on the farms, and he was quickly accepted as the hero of Soviet agriculture.

Many [[agronomist]]s were educated before the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolution]], and even many of those educated afterwards did not agree with the forced collectivization policies. Furthermore, among biologists of the day, the most popular topic was not agriculture at all, but the new genetics that was emerging out of studies of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', commonly known as fruit flies.  [[Drosophilidae|Drosophilid]] flies made experimental verification of genetics theories, such as [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian ratio]]s and [[heritability]], much easier.

[[Isaak Izrailevich Prezent]], a main Lysenko theorist, presented Lysenko in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[mass-media]] as a [[genius]] who had developed a new, revolutionary agricultural technique. In this period, [[Soviet propaganda]] often focused on inspirational stories of [[peasant]]s who, through their own canny ability and intelligence, came up with solutions to practical problems. Lysenko's widespread popularity provided him a platform to denounce theoretical genetics and to promote his own agricultural practices. He was, in turn, supported by the Soviet propaganda machine, which overstated his successes and omitted mention of his failures. This was accompanied by fake experimental data supporting Lysenkoism from scientists seeking favor and the destruction of counter-evidence to Lysenko's theories.  Instead of performing controlled experiments, Lysenko claimed that vernalization increased wheat yields by 15%, solely based upon questionnaires taken of farmers.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Rise==  
Lysenko's political success was mostly due to his appeal to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] and [[Soviet ideology]]. Following the disastrous [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization efforts of the late 1920s]], Lysenko's "new" methods were seen by Soviet officials as paving the way to an "agricultural revolution." Lysenko himself was from a peasant family, and was an enthusiastic advocate of [[Leninism]]. During a period which saw a series of man-made agricultural disasters, he was also extremely fast in responding to problems, although not with real solutions. Whenever the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party]] announced plans to plant a new crop or [[Tillage|cultivate]] a new area, Lysenko had immediate practical suggestions on how to proceed.

So quickly did he develop his prescriptions—from the cold treatment of grain, to the plucking of leaves from cotton plants, to the cluster planting of trees, to unusual fertilizer mixes—that academic biologists did not have time to demonstrate that one technique was valueless or harmful before a new one was adopted. The Party-controlled newspapers  applauded Lysenko's "practical" efforts and questioned the motives of his critics. Lysenko's "revolution in agriculture" had a powerful propaganda advantage over the academics, who urged the patience and observation required for science.

Lysenko was admitted into the hierarchy of the Communist Party, and was put in charge of agricultural affairs. He used his position to denounce biologists as "fly-lovers and people haters",&lt;ref&gt;''Epistemology and the Social'', Evandro Agazzi, Javier Echeverría, Amparo Gómez Rodríguez, Rodopi, Jan 1, 2008 - Philosophy - 231 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xBvbQgWtgjsC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=fly-lovers+and+%22people+haters%22+%22Lysenko%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-nMvVcfbMNKyogTn24CICA&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA Google books scanned reference], p 149&lt;/ref&gt; and to decry the "[[wrecking (Soviet crime)|wreckers]]" in biology, who he claimed were trying to purposely disable the Soviet economy and cause it to fail. Furthermore, he denied the distinction between theoretical and applied biology.

Lysenko presented himself as a follower of [[Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin]], a well-known and well-liked Soviet [[horticulture|horticulturist]]. However, unlike Michurin, he advocated a form of [[Lamarckism]], insisting on using only [[Heterosis|hybridization]] and [[grafting]], as  non-genetic techniques. With this came, most importantly, the implication that ''acquired'' characteristics of an organism—for example, the state of being leafless as a result of having been plucked—could be inherited by that organism's descendants.  This is why Lysenko claimed [[vernalization]] would give greater productivity than it did; he believed the ability of his vernalized seeds to flower faster and produce more wheat would be passed on to the next generation of wheat seeds, thus causing vernalization to further amplify the process.

Support from [[Joseph Stalin]] gave Lysenko even more momentum and popularity.  In 1935, Lysenko compared his opponents in biology to the peasants who still resisted the Soviet government's collectivization strategy, saying that by opposing his theories the traditional geneticists were setting themselves against Marxism.  Stalin was in the audience when this speech was made, and he was the first one to stand and applaud, calling out "Bravo, Comrade Lysenko. Bravo."{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}  This event emboldened Lysenko and gave him and his ally Prezent free rein to slander the geneticists who still spoke out against him.  Many of Lysenkoism's opponents, such as his former mentor [[Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov]], were imprisoned or even executed because of Lysenko's and Prezent's denunciations.

On August 7, 1948, the  V.I. Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences announced that from that point on Lysenkoism would be taught as "the only correct theory". Soviet scientists were forced to denounce any work that contradicted Lysenko.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela N. Wrinch. "[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2008893 Science and Politics in the U.S.S.R.: The Genetics Debate]". ''[[World Politics]]'', Vol. 3, No. 4 (Jul., 1951), pp. 486-519&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of Lysenko was denounced as "bourgeois" or "fascist", and analogous "non-bourgeois" theories also flourished in other fields in the Soviet academy at this time (see [[Japhetic theory]]; [[socialist realism]]). Perhaps the only opponents of Lysenkoism during Stalin's lifetime to escape liquidation were from the small community of Soviet [[Nuclear physics|nuclear physicists]]: as [[Tony Judt]] has observed, "It is significant that Stalin left his nuclear physicists alone and never presumed to second guess ''their'' calculations. Stalin may well have been mad but he was not stupid."&lt;ref name="Judt"&gt;Judt, Tony. ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'', (New York: Penguin Books, 2006), p. 174n.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other countries==

Many other countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]] accepted Lysenkoism as the official "new biology" as well; however the acceptance of Lysenkoism was not uniform in communist countries. In Poland, all geneticists except for [[Wacław Gajewski]]&lt;ref name="gaj"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|year=1990|volume=65|issue=4|author=Gajewski W.|title=Lysenkoism in Poland|doi=10.1086/416949|pages=423–34|pmid=2082404}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed Lysenkoism. Even though Gajewski was not allowed contact with students, he was allowed to continue his scientific work at the Warsaw botanical garden. Lysenkoism was then rapidly rejected starting from 1956&lt;ref name="gaj"/&gt; and modern genetics research departments were formed, including the first department of genetics headed by Wacław Gajewski, which was started at the [[Warsaw University]] in 1958.

[[Czechoslovakia]] adopted Lysenkoism in 1949. [[Jaroslav Kříženecký]] (1896–1964) was one of the prominent Czechoslovak geneticists opposing Lysenkoism, and when he criticized Lysenkoism in his lectures, he was dismissed from the Agricultural University in 1949 for "serving the established capitalistic system, considering himself superior to the working class, and being hostile to the democratic order of the people", and imprisoned in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|last=Orel|first=Vitezslav|title=Jaroslav Kříženecký (1896-1964), Tragic Victim of Lysenkoism in Czechoslovakia|volume=67|issue=4|pages=487–494|year=1992|jstor=2832019|doi=10.1086/417797}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, he was appointed head of the newly established [[Gregor Mendel]] department in the [[Moravian Museum]] in [[Brno]], the city in which Gregor Mendel pursued his early experiments on inheritance and formulated the laws of [[Mendelian inheritance]].

In the [[German Democratic Republic]], although Lysenkoism was taught at some of the universities, it had very little impact on science due to the actions of a few scientists (for example, the geneticist and fierce critic of Lysenkoism, [[Hans Stubbe]]) and an open border to [[West Berlin]] research institutions. Nonetheless, Lysenkoist theories were found in schoolbooks until the dismissal of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(02)02677-X|title=How did East German genetics avoid Lysenkoism?|first=Rudolf|last=Hagemann|journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=18|issue=6|year=2002|pages=320–324|pmid=12044362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lysenkoism dominated [[Science in the People's Republic of China|Chinese science]] from 1949 until 1956, particularly during the [[Great Leap Forward]], when, during a genetics symposium opponents of Lysenkoism were permitted to freely criticize it and argue for Mendelian genetics.&lt;ref name="china"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lysenkoism in China|last=Li|first=CC|journal=Journal of Heredity|volume=78|issue=5|page=339|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the proceedings from the symposium, [[Tan Jiazhen]] is quoted as saying "Since [the] USSR started to criticize Lysenko, we have dared to criticize him too".&lt;ref name="china"/&gt; For a while, both schools were permitted to coexist, although the influence of the Lysenkoists remained large for several years.&lt;ref name="china"/&gt;

==Repercussions==

From 1934 to 1940, under Lysenko's admonitions and with Stalin's approval, many geneticists were executed (including [[Isaak Agol]], [[Solomon Levit]], [[Grigorii Levitskii]], [[Georgii Karpechenko]] and [[Georgii Nadson]]) or sent to [[labor camp]]s. The famous Soviet geneticist and president of the Agriculture Academy, [[Nikolai Vavilov]], was arrested in 1940 and died in prison in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Barry Mandel. "Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov: the explorer and plant collector". ''Economic Botany'', ''45'' (1991): 38–46.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Joseph Muller]] (and his teachings about genetics) was criticized as a bourgeois, capitalist, imperialist, and promoting fascism so he left the USSR, to return to the US via Republican Spain. In 1948, genetics was officially declared "a [[bourgeois pseudoscience]]";&lt;ref name=gar57&gt;{{cite book | last = Gardner | first = Martin | year = 1957 | title=Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science | publisher=Dover Books | location = New York | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwP3SGAUsnkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=gardner%20fads%20and%20fallacies&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | isbn = 9780486131627}}&lt;/ref&gt; all geneticists were fired from their jobs (some were also arrested), and all genetic research was discontinued.

Over 3,000 biologists were imprisoned, fired, or executed for attempting to oppose Lysenkoism at one time and overall, scientific research in genetics was effectively destroyed  until the death of Stalin in 1953.&lt;ref name="Perversion of Knowledge" /&gt; Due to Lysenkoism, crop yields in the USSR actually declined as well.&lt;ref name="Perversion of Knowledge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Soyfer Tagedy" /&gt;

At the end of 1952, the situation started changing, possibly due to Stalin taking offense to Lysenko's growing influence. Articles criticizing Lysenkoism were published in newspapers. However, the process of return to regular genetics slowed down in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s times, due to Lysenko showing him the supposed successes of an experimental agricultural complex. It once again became forbidden to criticize Lysenkoism, though it was now possible to express different views, and all geneticists were released or [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated posthumously]]. The ban was only waived in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="aleksandrovvya"&gt;''Александров, В. Я.'' [http://vivovoco.astronet.ru/VV/BOOKS/ALEXANDROV/CONTENT.HTM Трудные годы советской биологии: Записки современника].&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost alone among Western scientists, [[John Desmond Bernal]], Professor of [[Physics]] at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College, University of London]], and a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]], made an aggressive public defense of Lysenko and some years later gave an obituary of "Stalin as a Scientist". However, despite Bernal's endorsement, other members of Britain's scientific community retreated from open support of the Soviet Union.

== Neo-Lysenkoism ==
The word "Neo-Lysenkoism" has occasionally been used by [[Hereditarianism|hereditarian]] researchers, such as [[Roger Pearson (anthropologist)|Roger Pearson]] and [[Bernard Davis (biologist)|Bernard Davis]], as a pejorative term in the [[race and intelligence controversy|debates over race and intelligence]] and [[sociobiology]] to describe scientists supposedly minimizing the role of genes in shaping human behavior, such as [[Leon Kamin]], [[Richard Lewontin]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Barry Mehler]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Roger. "Activist Lysenkoism: The Case of Barry Mehler." In ''Race, Intelligence and Bias in Academe'' (Washington: Scott-Townsend Publishers, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Davis|first= Bernard|last2= |first2= |year= 1983|title= Neo-Lysenkoism, IQ, and the press|url= https://www.nationalaffairs.com/public_interest/detail/neo-lysenkoism-iq-and-the-press |journal= [[The Public Interest]]|publisher= [[National Affairs]]|volume= |issue= 73|pages= 41–59|doi= |accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The use of the term "neo-Lysenkoism" to describe [[criticism of evolutionary psychology]] have drawn criticism for misapplying the term "Lysenkoism" to things unrelated to actual Lysenkoism. For instance, Lysenko's views on inheritance of acquired characteristics presumed that individuals were born with characteristics acquired by their parents, not [[tabula rasa]]. This was integrated into Stalin's purges by presuming that simply having biological parents who were [[kulak|capitalists]] constituted a risk factor for becoming a dissident due to inheritance of acquired capitalist interest even if the children had not been postnatally raised capitalist. This is argued to show that the definition of [[nature versus nurture|"nature"]] as "anything before birth" that is used by [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] when they classify ideas of hormones before birth on [[prenatal hormones and sexual orientation|sexuality]] and [[empathizing-systemizing theory#Fetal testosterone|empathy]] as "biological" would also classify Lysenkoism as "biological" due to all three being prenatalist but not Mendelian genetic, remarking that accusations of social engineering in "nurture" models can simply transform into accusations of prenatal environment engineering in "womb environment" models. The usage of the term "neo-Lysenkoism" for models of evolution that contradict the Darwinian model of gradual and maximized reproductive success is criticized for missing the point that while it is uncertain whether or not Darwin read about Mendel's genetic discoveries, it is clear that Darwin did not integrate Mendelian genetics into his model of evolution and that Mendel read The Origin of Species and accepted evolution but did not consider his discoveries a solution to any problems with Darwinian evolution, that Mendelian genetics was the primary subject of suppression of modern biology under Lysenkoism, and that Mendelian genetics is actually a source of modern criticism of the maximization of reproductive success model of evolution as Mendelian models show that short term maximized reproductive success of specific genes deplete genetic variation and increase the long term risk of extinction (explaining higher extinction risks in more  [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] species as a functional similarity between  [[Bateman's principle]] and asexual reproduction) during environmental change which could not be predicted by premodern models of genetics such as those of Darwin and Lysenko alike. Contrary to the allegation of [[anti-psychiatry]] being neo-Lysenkoist, it is remarked that [[psychiatric medication]] was not suppressed in the Soviet Union under Lysenkoism, but the use of psychiatric drugs in the Soviet Union actually increased and was approved by the regime during the Lysenko era. It is cited that Communists considered [[biological psychiatry|chemical imbalance models of "mental illnesses"]] including but not limited to [[false consciousness|anti-communism in "working class" people in Communist countries]] more materialistic and in accordance with Marxist [[dialectical materialism]] than the idea of other cultural factors than class interest influencíng behavior that was considered idealist, and that this was used as an argument by officials in the Soviet Union for approving increased psychiatric medication.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Stanchevici (2017).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26323">'''Mechanical explanations of gravitation''' (or '''kinetic theories of gravitation''') are attempts to explain the action of [[gravity]] by aid of basic [[classical mechanics|mechanical]] processes, such as [[pressure]] forces caused by [[Impulse (physics)|pushes]], without the use of any [[Action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]]. These theories were developed from the 16th until the 19th century in connection with the [[aether theories|aether]]. However, such models are no longer regarded as viable theories within the mainstream scientific community and [[general relativity]] is now the standard model to describe gravitation without the use of actions at a distance. Modern "[[quantum gravity]]" hypotheses also attempt to describe gravity by more fundamental processes such as particle fields, but they are not based on classical mechanics.

== Screening ==
{{main|Le Sage's theory of gravitation}}

This theory is probably&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1876), Peck (1903), secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt; the best-known mechanical explanation, and was developed for the first time by [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]] in 1690, and re-invented, among others, by [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]] (1748), [[Lord Kelvin]] (1872), and [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1900), and criticized by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1875), and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908).

The theory posits that the [[force]] of gravity is the result of tiny [[Subatomic particle|particle]]s or [[wave]]s moving at high speed in all directions, throughout the [[universe]]. The intensity of the flux of particles is assumed to be the same in all directions, so an isolated object A is struck equally from all sides, resulting in only an inward-directed [[pressure]] but no net directional force. With a second object B present, however, a fraction of the particles that would otherwise have struck A from the direction of B is intercepted, so B works as a shield, so-to-speak—that is, from the direction of B, A will be struck by fewer particles than from the opposite direction. Likewise, B will be struck by fewer particles from the direction of A than from the opposite direction. One can say that A and B are "shadowing" each other, and the two bodies are pushed toward each other by the resulting imbalance of forces.
[[Image:Pushing5.png|center|frame|&lt;div class="center"&gt;P5: Permeability, attenuation and mass proportionality&lt;/div&gt;]]

This shadow obeys the inverse square law, because the imbalance of momentum flow over an entire spherical surface enclosing the object is independent of the size of the enclosing sphere, whereas the surface area of the sphere increases in proportion to the square of the radius. To satisfy the need for mass proportionality, the theory posits that a) the basic elements of matter are very small so that gross matter consists mostly of empty space, and b) that the particles are so small, that only a small fraction of them would be intercepted by gross matter. The result is, that the "shadow" of each body is proportional to the surface of every single element of matter.

''Criticism'': This theory was declined primarily for [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] reasons because a shadow only appears in this model if the particles or waves are at least partly absorbed, which should lead to an enormous heating of the bodies. Also drag, ''i.e.'' the resistance of the particle streams in the direction of motion, is a great problem too. This problem can be solved by assuming superluminal speeds, but this solution largely increases the thermal problems and contradicts [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré (1908), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell (1875, Atom), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vortex ==
[[Image:Descartes Aetherwirbel.jpg|thumb|250px|Aether vortices around celestial bodies]]
Because of his philosophical beliefs, [[René Descartes]] proposed in 1644 that no empty [[space]] can exist and that space must consequently be filled with [[matter]]. The parts of this matter tend to move in straight paths, but because they lie close together, they can not move freely, which according to Descartes implies that every motion is circular, so the aether is filled with [[vortex|vortices]]. Descartes also distinguishes between different forms and sizes of matter in which rough matter resists the circular movement more strongly than fine matter. Due to [[centrifugal force]], matter tends towards the outer edges of the vortex, which causes a condensation of this matter there. The rough matter cannot follow this movement due to its greater [[inertia]]—so due to the pressure of the condensed outer matter those parts will be pushed into the center of the vortex. According to Descartes, this inward pressure is nothing else than gravity. He compared this mechanism with the fact that if a rotating, liquid filled vessel is stopped, the liquid goes on to rotate. Now, if one drops small pieces of light matter (e.g. wood) into the vessel, the pieces move to the middle of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Descartes, R.  | author-link =René Descartes| date= 1824–1826 | title=Les principes de la philosophie (1644)  | url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/document?O=N094260 | editor=Cousin, V. | journal= Oeuvres de Descartes | volume =3  | place = Paris | publisher=F.-G. Levrault}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=zehe&gt;Zehe (1980), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the basic premises of Descartes, [[Christiaan Huygens]] between 1669 and 1690 designed a much more exact vortex model. This model was the first theory of gravitation which was worked out mathematically. He assumed that the aether particles are moving in every direction, but were thrown back at the outer borders of the vortex and this causes (as in the case of Descartes) a greater concentration of fine matter at the outer borders. So also in his model the fine matter presses the rough matter into the center of the vortex. Huygens also found out that the centrifugal force is equal to the force, which acts in the direction of the center of the vortex ([[centripetal force]]). He also posited that bodies must consist mostly of empty space so that the aether can penetrate the bodies easily, which is necessary for mass proportionality. He further concluded that the aether moves much faster than the falling bodies. At this time, Newton developed his theory of gravitation which is based on attraction, and although Huygens agreed with the mathematical formalism, he said the model was insufficient due to the lack of a mechanical explanation of the force law. Newton's discovery that gravity obeys the [[inverse square law]] surprised Huygens and he tried to take this into account by assuming that the speed of the aether is smaller in greater distance.&lt;ref name=zehe /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Huygens, C.  | author-link =Christiaan Huygens| date= 1944 | title=Discours de la Cause de la Pesanteur (1690)  | url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k77870g/f451.table |editors=Société Hollaise des Sciences | journal=Oeuvres complètes de Christiaan Huygens | volume =21  | place = Den Haag | pages =443–488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lunteren&gt;Van Lunteren (2002), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'': Newton objected to the theory because [[drag (physics)|drag]] must lead to noticeable deviations of the orbits which were not observed.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;{{Citation  | author=Newton, I.  | author-link =Isaac Newton | date= 1846 | title=Newton's Principia : the mathematical principles of natural philosophy (1687) | url=https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich | publisher=Daniel Adee| place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem was that [[moon]]s often move in different directions, against the direction of the vortex motion. Also, Huygens' explanation of the inverse square law is [[Begging the question|circular]], because this means that the aether obeys  [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's third law]]. But a theory of gravitation has to explain those laws and must not presuppose them.&lt;ref name=zehe /&gt;&lt;ref name=newton /&gt;

== Streams ==
In a 1675 letter to [[Henry Oldenburg]], and later to [[Robert Boyle]], Newton wrote the following: [Gravity is the result of] “a condensation causing a flow of ether with a corresponding thinning of the ether density associated with the increased velocity of flow.” He also asserted that such a process was consistent with all his other work and Kepler's Laws of Motion.&lt;ref&gt;I. Newton, letters quoted in detail in The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science by Edwin Arthur Burtt, Double day Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Newtons' idea of a pressure drop associated with increased velocity of flow was mathematically formalised as [[Bernoulli's principle]] published in Daniel Bernoulli's book ''Hydrodynamica'' in 1738.

However, although he later proposed a second explanation (see section below), Newton's comments to that question remained ambiguous. In the third letter to Bentley in 1692 he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/THEM00258 Newton, 1692, 4th letter to Bentley&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the mediation of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation in the sense of Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe 'innate gravity' to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, Newton is also well known for the phrase [[Hypotheses non fingo]], written in 1713:&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Newton]] (1726). ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', General Scholium. Third edition, page 943 of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] and Anne Whitman's 1999 translation, [[University of California Press]]  {{ISBN|0-520-08817-4}}, 974 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have not as yet been able to discover the reason for these properties of gravity from phenomena, and I do not feign hypotheses. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, or based on occult qualities, or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And according to the testimony of some of his friends, such as [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]] or [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]], Newton thought that gravitation is based directly on divine influence.&lt;ref name=lunteren /&gt;

Similar to Newton, but mathematically in greater detail, [[Bernhard Riemann]] assumed in 1853 that the gravitational aether is an [[Incompressible flow|incompressible fluid]] and normal matter represents sinks in this aether. So if the aether is destroyed or absorbed proportionally to the masses within the bodies, a stream arises and carries all surrounding bodies into the direction of the central mass. Riemann speculated that the absorbed aether is transferred into another world or dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Riemann, B. | author-link =Bernhard Riemann| date= 1876 | title=Neue mathematische Prinzipien der Naturphilosophie | editor=Dedekind, R. |editor2=Weber, W. | journal= Bernhard Riemanns Werke und gesammelter Nachlass | place = Leipzig | pages =528–538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another attempt to solve the energy problem was made by [[Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky]] in 1888. Based on his aether stream model, which was similar to that of Riemann, he argued that the absorbed aether might be converted into new matter, leading to a mass increase of the celestial bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Yarkovsky, I. O.| author-link =Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky  | title = Hypothese cinetique de la Gravitation universelle et connexion avec la formation des elements chimiques | place= Moscow | date =1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'': As in the case of Le Sage's theory, the disappearance of energy without explanation violates the [[energy conservation law]]. Also some drag must arise, and no process which leads to a creation of matter is known.

== Static pressure ==

Newton updated the second edition of ''Optics'' (1717) with another mechanical-ether theory of gravity. Unlike his first explanation (1675 - see Streams), he proposed a stationary aether which gets thinner and thinner nearby the celestial bodies. On the analogy of the [[lift (force)|lift]], a force arises, which pushes all bodies to the central mass. He minimized drag by stating an extremely low density of the gravitational aether.

Like Newton, [[Leonhard Euler]] presupposed in 1760 that the gravitational aether loses density in accordance with the inverse square law. Similarly to others, Euler also assumed that to maintain mass proportionality, matter consists mostly of empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Euler, L.  | author-link =Leonhard Euler| date= 1776 | title=Briefe an eine deutsche Prinzessin, Nr. 50, 30. August 1760  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaMAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#PPA173,M1 | pages=173–176 | place=Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'': Both Newton and Euler gave no reason why the density of that static aether should change. Furthermore, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] pointed out that in this "hydrostatic" model "''the state of stress... which we must suppose to exist in the invisible medium, is 3000 times greater than that which the strongest steel could support''".&lt;ref name=maxwell&gt;Maxwell (1875, Attraction), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waves ==

[[Robert Hooke]] speculated in 1671 that gravitation is the result of all bodies emitting waves in all directions through the aether. Other bodies, which interact with these waves, move in the direction of the source of the waves. Hooke saw an analogy to the fact that small objects on a disturbed surface of water move to the center of the disturbance.&lt;ref name=taylor&gt;Taylor (1876), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar theory was worked out mathematically by [[James Challis]] from 1859 to 1876. He calculated that the case of attraction occurs if the wavelength is large in comparison with the distance between the gravitating bodies. If the wavelength is small, the bodies repel each other. By a combination of these effects, he also tried to explain all other forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Challis, J. | author-link =James Challis| date= 1869 | title=Notes of the Principles of Pure and Applied Calculation  | url=https://archive.org/details/notesonprinciple00chalrich | place = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'': Maxwell objected that this theory requires a steady production of waves, which must be accompanied by an infinite consumption of energy.&lt;ref name="maxwell 2"&gt;Maxwell (1875), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;
Challis himself admitted, that he hadn't reached a definite result due to the complexity of the processes.&lt;ref name=taylor /&gt;

== Pulsation ==

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] (1871) and [[Carl Anton Bjerknes]] (1871) assumed that all bodies pulsate in the aether. This was in analogy to the fact that, if the pulsation of two spheres in a fluid is in phase, they will attract each other; and if the pulsation of two spheres is ''not'' in phase, they will repel each other. This mechanism was also used for explaining the nature of [[electric charge]]s. Among others, this hypothesis has also been examined by [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Gabriel Stokes]] and [[Woldemar Voigt]].&lt;ref name=zenneck&gt;Zenneck (1903), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'' : To explain universal gravitation, one is forced to assume that all pulsations in the universe are in phase—which appears very implausible. In addition, the aether should be incompressible to ensure that attraction also arises at greater distances.&lt;ref name=zenneck /&gt; And Maxwell argued that this process must be accompanied by a permanent new production and destruction of aether.&lt;ref name=maxwell /&gt;

== Other historical speculations ==

In 1690, [[Pierre Varignon]] assumed that all bodies are exposed to pushes by aether particles from all directions, and that there is some sort of limitation at a certain distance from the Earth's surface which cannot be passed by the particles. He assumed that if a body is closer to the Earth than to the limitation boundary, then the body would experience a greater push from above than from below, causing it to fall toward the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Varignon, P. | author-link =Pierre Varignon| date= 1690 | title=Nouvelles conjectures sur la Pesanteur  | url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k74179x | place = Paris }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1748, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] assumed that the effect of the aether is proportional to the complete surface of the elementary components of which matter consists (similar to Huygens and Fatio before him). He also assumed an enormous penetrability of the bodies. However, no clear description was given by him as to how exactly the aether interacts with matter so that the law of gravitation arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Lomonosow, M. | author-link =Mikhail Lomonosov| date= 1970 | title=On the Relation of the Amount of Material and Weight (1758)  | url=https://archive.org/details/mikhailvasilevic017733mbp | editor= Henry M. Leicester | journal= Mikhail Vasil'evich Lomonosov on the Corpuscular Theory | place = Cambridge | publisher=Harvard University Press | pages =224–233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1821, [[John Herapath]] tried to apply his co-developed model of the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases on gravitation. He assumed that the aether is heated by the bodies and loses density so that other bodies are pushed to these regions of lower density.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Herapath, J. | author-link =John Herapath| date= 1821 | title=On the Causes, Laws and Phenomena of Heat, Gases, Gravitation  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCsAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA273 | journal= [[Annals of Philosophy]]  | volume =9  | place = Paris | pages =273–293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it was shown by Taylor that the decreased density due to [[thermal expansion]] is compensated for by the increased speed of the heated particles; therefore, no attraction arises.&lt;ref name=taylor /&gt;

==Recent theorizing==
These mechanical explanations for gravity never gained widespread acceptance, although such ideas continued to be studied occasionally by physicists until the beginning of the twentieth century, by which time it was generally considered to be conclusively discredited. However, some researchers outside the scientific mainstream still try to work out some consequences of those theories.

[[#Screening|Le Sage's theory]] was studied by Radzievskii and Kagalnikova (1960),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Radzievskii, V.V. | author2=Kagalnikova, I.I. | lastauthoramp=yes | title =The nature of gravitation  | journal =Vsesoyuz.

'''Mien Shiang''' is a 3,000-year-old [[Taoist]] practice that means literally face (mien) reading (shiang). In just moments, one can supposedly determine anyone’s ''"[[Wu Xing]]"'' — Five Element personality type — their character, behavior, and health potential — by analyzing their face. The Taoist Five Elements, [[Tree (Wu Xing)|Wood]], [[Fire (Wu Xing)|Fire]], [[Earth (Wu Xing)|Earth]], [[Metal (Wu Xing)|Metal]] and [[Water (Wu Xing)|Water]], are metaphors devised by the ancient Taoist philosophers to explain the relationship, interaction, and ongoing change of everything in the Universe.&lt;ref name="mien" /&gt; In recent times the art of Face Reading is becoming more and more popular. Schools that teach Mien Shiang are becoming more wide spread.&lt;ref name="classes" /&gt;

[[File:Table of Natural History, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Tables of natural history, from [[Ephraim Chambers]]'s 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'']]
'''Natural history''' is a domain of inquiry involving [[organism]]s including [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[plant]]s in their environment; leaning more towards [[observation]]al than [[experiment]]al methods of study. A person who studies natural history is called a '''naturalist''' or '''natural historian'''.

Natural history encompasses [[Scientific method|scientific research]] but is not limited to it.&lt;ref&gt;With ''natural history'' articles more often published today in [[List of science magazines|science magazines]] than in [[scientific journal|academic journals]].([http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history Natural History ''WordNet Search, princeton.edu''].&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the systematic study of any category of [[nature|natural]] objects or organisms.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{Citation |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; So while it dates from studies in the ancient [[Greco-Roman world]] and the [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution|mediaeval Arabic world]], through to European [[Renaissance]] naturalists working in near isolation, today's natural history is a [[cross discipline]] umbrella of many specialty sciences; e.g., [[geobiology]] has a strong multi-disciplinary nature.

==Definitions==
===Before 1900===
The meaning of the English term "natural history" (a [[calque]] of the [[Latin]] ''historia naturalis'') has narrowed progressively with time; while, by contrast, the meaning of the related term "nature" has widened (see also [[#History|History]] below).

In [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], "natural history" covered essentially anything connected with [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]], or which used materials drawn from nature, such as [[Pliny the Elder]]'s [[Natural History (Pliny)|encyclopedia of this title]], published [[circa]] 77 to 79 AD, which covers [[astronomy]], [[geography]], humans and their [[technology]], [[medicine]], and [[superstition]], as well as animals and plants.

Medieval European academics considered knowledge to have two main divisions: the [[humanities]] (primarily what is now known as [[classics]]) and [[divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]], with science studied largely through texts rather than observation or experiment. The study of nature revived in the [[Renaissance]], and quickly became a third branch of academic knowledge, itself divided into descriptive natural history and  [[natural philosophy]], the analytical study of nature. In modern terms, natural philosophy roughly corresponded to modern [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], while natural history included the [[biology|biological]] and [[geology|geological]] sciences. The two were strongly associated. During the heyday of the [[gentleman scientist]]s, many people contributed to both fields, and early papers in both were commonly read at professional [[Academy of Sciences|science society]] meetings such as the [[Royal Society]] and the [[French Academy of Sciences]] – both founded during the seventeenth century.

Natural history had been encouraged by practical motives, such as Linnaeus' aspiration to improve the economic condition of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koerner |first=Lisbet |authorlink=Lisbet Rausing |title=Linnaeus: Nature and Nation |year=1999 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Harvard |isbn=978-0-674-09745-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Industrial Revolution]] prompted the development of geology to help find useful [[mineral]] deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Barnes and Steven Shapin, "Natural order: historical studies of scientific culture", Sage, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1900===
Modern definitions of natural history come from a variety of fields and sources, and many of the modern definitions emphasize a particular aspect of the field, creating a plurality of definitions with a number of common themes among them. For example, while natural history is most often defined as a type of observation and a subject of study, it can also be defined as a body of knowledge, and as a craft or a practice, in which the emphasis is placed more on the observer than on the observed.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lowe Fleischner, ''The Way of Natural History'', Trinity University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lycee Michelet Vanves bibliotheque collection histoire naturelle.jpg|thumb|left|A natural history collection in a French public secondary school]]
Definitions from biologists often focus on the scientific study of individual organisms in their environment, as seen in this definition by Marston Bates: "Natural history is the study of animals and Plants – of organisms. ... I like to think, then, of natural history as the study of life at the level of the individual – of what plants and animals do, how they react to each other and their environment, how they are organized into larger groupings like populations and communities"&lt;ref&gt;Marston Bates, ''The nature of natural history'', Scribners, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; and this more recent definition by D.S. Wilcove and T. Eisner: "The close observation of organisms—their origins, their evolution, their behavior, and their relationships with other species".&lt;ref&gt;D. S Wilcove and T. Eisner, "The impending extinction of natural history," Chronicle of Higher Education 15 (2000): B24&lt;/ref&gt;

This focus on organisms in their environment is also echoed by H.W. Greene and J.B. Losos: "Natural history focuses on where organisms are and what they do in their environment, including interactions with other organisms. It encompasses changes in internal states insofar as they pertain to what organisms do".&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Greene and J. B. Losos, "Systematics, Natural-History, and Conservation – Field Biologists Must Fight a Public-Image Problem," Bioscience 38 (1988): 458–462&lt;/ref&gt;

Some definitions go further, focusing on direct observation of organisms in their environment, both past and present, such as this one by G.A. Bartholomew: "A student of natural history, or a naturalist, studies the world by observing plants and animals directly. Because organisms are functionally inseparable from the environment in which they live and because their structure and function cannot be adequately interpreted without knowing some of their evolutionary history, the study of natural history embraces the study of fossils as well as physiographic and other aspects of the physical environment".&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Bartholomew, "The Role of Natural History in Contemporary Biology", Bioscience 36 (1986): 324–329&lt;/ref&gt;

A common thread in many definitions of natural history is the inclusion of a descriptive component, as seen in a recent definition by H.W. Greene: "Descriptive ecology and ethology".&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Greene, "Organisms in nature as a central focus for biology", Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 20 (2005):23–27&lt;/ref&gt; Several authors have argued for a more expansive view of natural history, including S. Herman, who defines the field as "the scientific study of plants and animals in their natural environments. It is concerned with levels of organization from the individual organism to the ecosystem, and stresses identification, life history, distribution, abundance, and inter-relationships.

It often and appropriately includes an esthetic component",&lt;ref&gt;S. G Herman, "Wildlife biology and natural history: time for a reunion", The Journal of wildlife management 66, no. 4 (2002): 933–946&lt;/ref&gt; and T. Fleischner, who defines the field even more broadly, as "A practice of intentional, focused attentiveness and receptivity to the more-than-human world, guided by honesty and accuracy".&lt;ref&gt;T. L. Fleischner, "Natural history and the spiral of offering", Wild Earth 11, no. 3/4 (2002): 10–13&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions explicitly include the arts in the field of natural history, and are aligned with the broad definition outlined by B. Lopez, who defines the field as the "Patient interrogation of a landscape" while referring to the natural history knowledge of the Eskimo ([[Inuit]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barry Lopez, ''Arctic Dreams'', Vintage, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

A slightly different framework for natural history, covering a similar range of themes, is also implied in the scope of work encompassed by many leading [[natural history museum]]s, which often include elements of anthropology, geology, paleontology and astronomy along with botany and zoology,&lt;ref&gt;American Museum of Natural History, [http://www.amnh.org/about/ Mission Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604145807/http://www.amnh.org/about/ |date=2011-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Field Museum, [http://fieldmuseum.org/about/mission Mission Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103185243/http://fieldmuseum.org/about/mission |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or include both cultural and natural components of the world.&lt;ref&gt;The Natural History Museum, [http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/index.html Mission Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

The plurality of definitions for this field has been recognized as both a weakness and a strength, and a range of definitions have recently been offered by practitioners in a recent collection of views on natural history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://declinetorebirth.org/conversations/an-accepted-way-of-viewing-art An Accepted Way of Viewing Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient times===
[[File:ViennaDioscoridesPlant.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Blackberry]] from the 6th century ''[[Vienna Dioscurides]]'' manuscript]]
Natural history begins with [[Aristotle]] and other ancient philosophers who analyzed the diversity of the natural world. Natural history was understood by [[Pliny the Elder]] to cover anything that could be found in the world, including living things, geology, astronomy, technology, art and humanity.&lt;ref name=Pliny&gt;{{cite book | title=Natural History: A Selection | publisher=Penguin Classics | author=Pliny the Elder | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-14-044413-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'' was written between 50 and 70 AD by [[Pedanius Dioscorides]], a Roman physician of Greek origin. It was widely read for more than 1,500 years until supplanted in the [[Renaissance]], making it one of the longest-lasting of all natural history books.

From the [[ancient Greeks]] until the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]] and other 18th century naturalists, a major concept of natural history was the ''scala naturae'' or [[Great Chain of Being]], an arrangement of minerals, vegetables, more primitive forms of animals, and more complex life forms on a linear scale of supposedly increasing perfection, culminating in our species.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964&gt;{{citation |date=1964 | origyear=1936 |author=Arthur O. Lovejoy |authorlink=Arthur Oncken Lovejoy |title=The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5u3HZjTpkTgC |place=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-36153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
Natural history was basically static through the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe – although in the [[Arabic]] and [[Oriental]] world it proceeded at a much brisker pace. From the thirteenth century, the work of Aristotle was adapted rather rigidly into [[Christian philosophy]], particularly by [[Thomas Aquinas]], forming the basis for [[natural theology]]. During the Renaissance, scholars (herbalists and humanists, particularly) returned to direct observation of plants and animals for natural history, and many began to accumulate large collections of exotic specimens and unusual [[monster]]s. [[Leonhart Fuchs]] was one of the three founding fathers of botany, along with [[Otto Brunfels]] and [[Hieronymus Bock]]. Other important contributors to the field were [[Valerius Cordus]], [[Konrad Gesner]] (''[[Historiae animalium (Gesner)|Historiae animalium]]''), [[Frederik Ruysch]], or [[Gaspard Bauhin]].&lt;ref name="natural"&gt;"[http://www.historyofscience.com/G2I/timeline/index.php?category=Natural+History Natural History Timeline]". HistoryofScience.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid increase in the number of known organisms prompted many attempts at classifying and organizing species into [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic groups]], culminating in the system of the Swedish naturalist [[Carl Linnaeus]].&lt;ref name="natural"/&gt;

===Birth of scientific biology===&lt;!--off topic? Biology isn't NH--&gt;
[[File:Buffon 1707-1788.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Georges Buffon]] is best remembered for his ''[[Histoire naturelle]]'', a 44 volume encyclopedia describing quadrupeds, birds, minerals and some science and technology. Reptiles and fish were covered in supplements by [[Bernard Germain de Lacépède]].]]&lt;!--not discussed in text, no refs!--&gt;
A significant contribution to English natural history was made by [[parson-naturalist]]s such as [[Gilbert White]], [[William Kirby (entomologist)|William Kirby]], [[John George Wood]], and [[John Ray]], who wrote about plants, animals, and other aspects of nature. Many of these men wrote about nature to make the [[natural theology]] argument for the existence or goodness of God.&lt;ref name="Armstrong2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Armstrong|title=The English Parson-naturalist: A Companionship Between Science and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hB0hEc4CN3wC|accessdate=31 March 2013|year=2000|publisher=Gracewing Publishing|isbn=978-0-85244-516-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Europe]], professional disciplines such as botany, geology, [[mycology]], [[palaeontology]], [[physiology]] and [[zoology]] were formed. ''Natural history'', formerly the main subject taught by college science professors, was increasingly scorned by scientists of a more specialized manner and relegated to an "amateur" activity, rather than a part of science proper. In Victorian Scotland it was believed that the study of natural history contributed to good mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences |title='An aid to mental health': natural history, alienists and therapeutics in Victorian Scotland| author=Finnegan, Diarmid A. |year=2008 |volume=39 |pages=326–337 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2008.06.006| pmid=18761284| issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in Britain and the United States, this grew into specialist hobbies such as the [[Ornithology|study of birds]], butterflies, seashells ([[malacology]]/[[conchology]]), beetles and wildflowers; meanwhile, scientists tried to define a unified discipline of biology (though with only partial success, at least until the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]). Still, the traditions of natural history continue to play a part in the study of biology, especially ecology (the study of natural systems involving living organisms and the inorganic components of the Earth's biosphere that support them), [[ethology]] (the scientific study of animal behavior), and [[evolutionary biology]] (the study of the relationships between life-forms over very long periods of time), and re-emerges today as integrative organismal biology.

Amateur collectors and natural history entrepreneurs played an important role in building the world's large natural history collections, such as the [[Natural History Museum, London]], and the [[National Museum of Natural History]] in Washington D.C.

Three of the greatest English naturalists of the nineteenth century, [[Henry Walter Bates]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]—who all knew each other—each made natural history travels that took years, collected thousands of specimens, many of them new to science, and by their writings both advanced knowledge of "remote" parts of the world—the [[Amazon basin]], the [[Galápagos Islands]], and the [[Malay archipelago]], among others—and in so doing helped to transform biology from a descriptive to a theory based science.

The understanding of "Nature" as "an organism and not as a mechanism" can be traced to the writings of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (Prussia, 1769–1859). Humboldt's copious writings and research were seminal influences for Charles Darwin, [[Simón Bolívar]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Ernst Haeckel]], and [[John Muir]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Wulf]] (2015),''[[The Invention of Nature]]'', Knopf {{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museums==
{{further|List of natural history museums}}
Natural history [[museum]]s, which evolved from [[cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]], played an important role in the emergence of professional biological disciplines and research programs. Particularly in the 19th century, scientists began to use their natural history collections as teaching tools for advanced students and the basis for their own [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] research.

==Societies==
[[File:Szczecin pomnik Jana Czekanowskiego.jpg|thumb|The monument of [[Jan Czekanowski]], a president of [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]] (1923–1924), in [[Szczecin]], [[Poland]]]]
The term "natural history" alone, or sometimes together with archaeology, forms the name of many national, regional and local natural history societies that maintain records for [[animal]]s (including [[birds]] (ornithology), [[insect]]s ([[entomology]]) and [[mammal]]s (mammalogy)), [[fungi]] ([[mycology]]), plants (botany) and other organisms. They may also have [[geological]] and [[microscope|microscopical]] sections.

Examples of these societies in Britain include the [[Natural History Society of Northumbria]] founded in 1829, [[London]] Natural History Society (1858), [[Birmingham Natural History Society]] (1859), [[British Entomological and Natural History Society]] founded in 1872, [[Glasgow]] Natural History Society, [[Manchester]] Microscopical and Natural History Society established in 1880, Whitby Naturalists' Club founded in 1913,&lt;ref name="whitbynaturalistsclub"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitbynaturalists.co.uk |title=Whitby Naturalists' Club |publisher=whitbynaturalists.co.uk |accessdate=January 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarborough Field Naturalists' Society and the Sorby Natural History Society, [[Sheffield]], founded in 1918.&lt;ref name="WMBC-Oldest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/club/older|title=Older Organisations|last=Mabbett|first=Andy|date=20 November 2010|publisher=[[West Midland Bird Club]]|accessdate=11 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523040849/http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/club/older |archivedate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of natural history societies was also spurred due to the growth of British colonies in tropical regions with numerous new species to be discovered. Many [[civil servants]] took an interest in their new surroundings, sending specimens back to museums in [[UK|Britain]]. (See also: [[Indian natural history]])

Societies in other countries include the [[American Society of Naturalists]] and [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]].

[[File:Lennuliiklust uurimas.jpg|thumbnail|An observer is someone who gathers information about a phenomenon, but does not intervene. (Observing the air traffic in [[Rõuge]], [[Estonia]])]]

'''Observation''' is the active acquisition of [[information]] from a [[primary source]]. In living beings, observation employs the [[sense]]s. In science, observation can also involve the recording of [[data (information)|data]] via the use of [[scientific instrument]]s. The term may also refer to any data collected during the scientific activity. Observations can be [[qualitative property|qualitative]], that is, only the absence or presence of a property is noted, or [[quantitative data|quantitative]] if a numerical value is attached to the observed [[phenomenon]] by [[counting]] or [[measurement|measuring]].

Observations play a role in the second and fifth steps of the scientific method. However, the need for [[reproducibility]] requires that observations by different observers can be comparable. Human [[sense]] impressions are [[subjectivity|subjective]] and [[qualitative data|qualitative]], making them difficult to record or compare. The use of [[measurement]] developed to allow recording and comparison of observations made at different times and places, by different people. Measurement consists of using observation to compare the phenomenon being observed to a [[Standard (metrology)|standard unit]]. The standard unit can be an artifact, process, or definition which can be duplicated or shared by all observers.  In measurement the number of standard units which is equal to the observation is counted.  Measurement reduces an observation to a number which can be recorded, and two observations which result in the same number are equal within the [[measurement|resolution]] of the process.

Human senses are limited and subject to errors in perception, such as [[optical illusion]]s. [[Scientific instrument]]s were developed to aid human abilities of observation, such as [[weighing scale]]s, [[clock]]s, [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, [[thermometer]]s, [[camera]]s, and [[tape recorder]]s, and also translate into perceptible form events that are unobservable by the senses, such as [[pH indicator|indicator dyes]], [[voltmeter]]s, [[spectrometer]]s, [[infrared camera]]s, [[oscilloscope]]s, [[interferometer]]s, [[geiger counter]]s, and [[radio receiver]]s.

One problem encountered throughout scientific fields is that the observation may affect the process being observed, resulting in a different outcome than if the process was unobserved. This is called the ''[[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]]''. For example, it is not normally possible to check the air pressure in an automobile tire without letting out some of the air, thereby changing the pressure. However, in most fields of science it is possible to reduce the effects of observation to insignificance by using better instruments.

Considered as a physical process itself, all forms of observation (human or instrumental) involve [[amplifier|amplification]] and are thus thermodynamically [[irreversibility|irreversible processes]], increasing [[entropy]].

==Observational paradoxes==
In some specific fields of science the results of observation differ depending on factors which are not important in everyday observation.  These are usually illustrated with "[[paradox]]es" in which an event appears different when observed from two different points of view, seeming to violate "common sense".
* '''Relativity:''' In [[relativistic physics]] which deals with velocities close to the [[speed of light]], it is found that different observers may observe different values for the length, time rates, mass, and many other properties of an object, depending on the observer's velocity relative to the object.   For example, in the [[twin paradox]] one twin goes on a trip near the speed of light and comes home younger than the twin who stayed at home.  This is not a paradox: time passes at a slower rate when measured from a frame moving with respect to the object.  In relativistic physics, an observation must always be qualified by specifying the state of motion of the observer, its [[Frame of reference|reference frame]].
* '''Quantum mechanics:''' In [[quantum mechanics]], which deals with the behavior of very small objects, it is not possible to [[observer (quantum physics)|observe a system]] without changing the system, and the "observer" must be considered part of the [[system]] being observed. In isolation, quantum objects are represented by a [[wave function]] which often exists in a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] or mixture of different [[quantum state|states]]. However, when an observation is made to determine the actual location or state of the object, it always finds the object in a single state, not a "mixture". The interaction of the observation process appears to "[[wave function collapse|collapse]]" the wave function into a single state. So any interaction between an isolated wave function and the external world that results in this wave function collapse is called an ''observation'' or ''measurement'', whether or not it is part of a deliberate observation process.

==Biases==
The human senses do not function like a video [[camcorder]], impartially recording all observations.&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human perception occurs by a complex, unconscious process of [[abstraction]], in which certain details of the incoming sense data are noticed and remembered, and the rest forgotten.    What is kept and what is thrown away depends on an internal model or representation of the world, called by psychologists a ''[[schema (psychology)|schema]]'', that is built up over our entire lives.  The data is fitted into this schema.  Later when events are remembered, memory gaps may even be filled by "plausible" data the mind makes up to fit the model; this is called ''[[reconstructive memory]]''. How much attention the various perceived data are given depends on an internal value system, which judges how important it is to the individual. Thus two people can view the same event and come away with entirely different perceptions of it, even disagreeing about simple facts.  This is why [[eyewitness testimony]] is notoriously unreliable.

Several of the more important ways observations can be affected by human psychology are given below.

===Confirmation bias===
{{main|confirmation bias}}
Human observations are biased toward confirming the observer's conscious and unconscious expectations and view of the world; we "''see what we expect to see''".&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{cite book

It can also result in erroneous scientific support for widely held cultural myths, on the other hand, as in the [[scientific racism]] that supported ideas of racial superiority in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Correct scientific technique emphasizes careful recording of observations, separating experimental observations from the conclusions drawn from them, and techniques such as [[blind experiment|blind]] or [[double blind experiment]]s, to minimize observational bias.

==="Cargo cult" science===
{{main|Cargo cult science}}
Another bias, which has become more prevalent with the advent of "[[big science]]" and the large rewards of new discoveries, is bias in favor of the researcher's desired hypothesis or outcome; we "''see what we want to see''". Called [[pathological science]] and [[cargo cult science]], this is different from deliberate falsification of results, and can happen to good-faith researchers.  Researchers with a great incentive or desire for a given outcome can misinterpret or misjudge results, or even persuade themselves they have seen something they haven't.  Possible examples of mistaken discoveries caused by this bias are [[Mars#Martian 'canals'|Martian "canals"]], [[N rays]], [[polywater]], [[cold fusion]], and [[perpetual motion]] machines. Recent decades have seen scientific scandals caused by researchers playing "fast and loose" with observational methods in order to get their pet theories published. This type of bias is rampant in [[pseudoscience]], where correct scientific techniques are not followed. The main defense against this bias, besides correct research techniques, is [[peer review]] and repetition of the experiment, or the observation, by other researchers with no incentive to bias. For example, an emerging practice in the competitive field of [[biotechnology]] is to require the physical results of experiments, such as serums and [[tissue culture]]s, be made available to competing laboratories for independent testing.

===Processing bias===
Modern scientific instruments can extensively process "observations" before they are presented to the human senses, and particularly with computerized instruments, there is sometimes a question as to where in the data processing chain "observing" ends and "drawing conclusions" begins. This has recently become an issue with [[digital image processing|digitally enhanced]] images published as experimental data in [[scientific paper|papers]] in [[scientific journal]]s. The images are enhanced to bring out features that the researcher wants to emphasize, but this also has the effect of supporting the researcher's conclusions. This is a form of bias that is difficult to quantify. Some [[scientific journal]]s have begun to set detailed standards for what types of [[image processing]] are allowed in research results. Computerized instruments often keep a copy of the "raw data" from sensors before processing, which is the ultimate defense against processing bias, and similarly scientific standards require preservation of the original unenhanced "raw" versions of images used as research data.

===Observational bias===
An observational bias occurs when researchers only look where they think they will find positive results, or where it is easy to record observations. This is called the "[[streetlight effect]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David H. Freedman |title=The Streetlight Effect |url= |quote= |work=[[Discover magazine]] |date=August 1, 2010 &lt;!--|accessdate=2010-08-24 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations in philosophy==
{{quote|"Observe always that everything is the result of a change, and get used to thinking that there is nothing [[Nature]] loves so well as to change existing forms and to make new ones like them."|Meditations. iv. 36. – [[Marcus Aurelius]]}}

Observation in [[philosophical]] terms is the process of filtering [[sense|sensory]] [[information]] through the thought process. Input is received via [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[visual perception|sight]], [[olfaction|smell]], [[taste]], or [[Haptic perception|touch]] and then analyzed through either rational or irrational thought.


For example, let us suppose that an observer ''sees'' a parent beat their child; and consequently ''observes'' that such an action is either good or bad.{{Citation needed|reason=What is the source of the distinction "seeing" versus "observing"?|date=May 2009}} Deductions about what behaviors are good or bad may be based on preferences about building relationships, or study of the consequences resulting from the observed behavior. With the passage of time, impressions stored in the consciousness about many, together with the resulting relationships and consequences, permit the individual to build a construct about the moral implications of behavior.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7943">A '''physician-scientist'''  is a holder of a [[medical degree|degree in medicine and science]] who invests significant time and professional effort in [[scientific research]] and spends correspondingly less time in direct [[clinical practice]] compared to other [[physician]]s. Physician-scientists are often employed by academic or research institutions and may focus their clinical practices on very specialized [[patient]] populations, such as those with rare [[genetic disease]]s or rare [[cancer]]s. Although they are a minority of both practicing physicians and active research scientists, physician-scientists are often cited as playing a critical role in [[translational medicine]] and [[clinical research]], connecting [[biomedical research]] findings to health care applications.&lt;ref name=daye&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daye|first1=D|last2=Patel|first2=CB|last3=Ahn|first3=J|last4=Nguyen|first4=FT|title=Challenges and opportunities for reinvigorating the physician-scientist pipeline.|journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation|date=2 March 2015|volume=125|issue=3|pages=883–7|doi=10.1172/JCI80933|pmid=25689260|pmc=4362227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ley&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ley|first1=TJ|last2=Rosenberg|first2=LE|title=The physician-scientist career pipeline in 2005: build it, and they will come.|journal=JAMA|date=21 September 2005|volume=294|issue=11|pages=1343–51|pmid=16174692|doi=10.1001/jama.294.11.1343}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States [[National Institutes of Health]] includes holders of other clinical degrees - such as [[nurse]]s, [[dentist]]s, and [[veterinarian]]s - in its studies of the physician-scientist workforce (PSW).&lt;ref name=nih&gt;{{cite web|title=Physician-Scientist Workforce (PSW) Report 2014|url=http://report.nih.gov/workforce/psw/index.aspx|website=NIH RePORT|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Physician-scientists by definition hold degrees in medicine; they may also hold additional graduate degrees such as a [[Ph.D.]] In the United States and Canada, some universities run specialized dual degree [[MD-PhD]] programs, and a small number of [[D.O.]]-granting institutions also offer dual degree options as D.O.-Ph.D.&lt;ref name=dophd&gt;{{cite web|title=Do/PhD Programs|url=http://www.physicianscientists.org/?page=DOPhDProgramsList|website=American Physician Scientists Association|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States the NIH supports competitive university programs called [[Medical Scientist Training Program]]s that aim to train physician-scientists, originally established in 1964 and present at 45 institutions as of 2015.&lt;ref name=nih-mstp&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Scientist Training Program|url=http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/InstPredoc/Pages/PredocOverview-MSTP.aspx|website=National Institute of General Medical Sciences|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar programs were established in the United Kingdom in the 1980s, although with relatively less funding support.&lt;ref name=lemoine&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lemoine|first1=NR|title=The clinician-scientist: a rare breed under threat in a hostile environment.|journal=Disease models &amp; mechanisms|date=NaN|volume=1|issue=1|pages=12–4|pmid=19048043|doi=10.1242/dmm.000752|pmc=2561982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this dual-degree pathway is not necessary to establish a physician-scientist career, most do receive some form of explicit research training in addition to their clinical education.&lt;ref name=eisenberg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eisenberg|first1=Mark J.|title=The physician scientist's career guide|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9781603279079|chapter=Is a Physician-Scientist Career Right for You?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and workforce==
Most physician-scientists are employed by universities and medical schools, or by research institutions such as the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref name=daye /&gt;&lt;ref name=payne&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Payne|first1=Aimee S.|last2=Brass|first2=Skip|title=Finding Nirvana: Paths to Becoming a Physician-Scientist|journal=Science|date=16 October 2013|doi=10.1126/science.caredit.a1300227}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the NIH counted around 9,000 NIH-funded physician-scientists; this count does not include those whose work is funded by sources other than the NIH - typically meaning those who work in industry, such as at [[pharmaceutical companies]] or [[medical device]] companies.&lt;ref name=nih /&gt;

At many medical schools, physician-scientist faculty are expected to obtain significant fractions of their nominal salary in the form of competitive [[research grant]]s, which are also requirements for the award of [[tenure]].

'''Plant collecting''' is the acquisition of plant specimens for the purposes of research, cultivation, or as a hobby. Plant specimens may be kept alive, but are more commonly dried and pressed to preserve the quality of the specimen. Plant collecting is an ancient practice with records of a Chinese botanist collecting roses over 5000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Plant Hunters|last=Whittle|first=T|publisher=Heinemann|year=1970|isbn=|location=London|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbaria]] are collections of preserved plants samples and their associated data for scientific purposes. The largest herbarium in the world exist at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle]], in Paris, France. Plant samples in herbaria typically include a reference sheet with information about the plant and details of collection. This detailed and organized system of filing provides horticulturist and other researchers alike with a way to find information about a certain plant, and a way to add new information to an existing plant sample file.

The collection of live plant specimens from the wild, sometimes referred to as '''plant hunting''',  is an activity that has occurred for centuries. The earliest recorded evidence of plant hunting was in 1495 BC when botanists were sent to [[Somalia]] to collect incense trees for [[Queen Hatshepsut]]. The [[Victorian era]] saw a surge in plant hunting activity as botanical adventurers explored the world to find exotic plants to bring home, often at considerable personal risk. These plants usually ended up in [[botanical garden]]s or the private gardens of wealthy collectors. Prolific plant hunters in this period included [[William Lobb]] and his brother [[Thomas Lobb]], [[George Forrest (botanist)|George Forrest]], [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]], [[Charles Maries]] and [[Robert Fortune]].

== Plant pressing ==
Proper pressing and mounting techniques are critical to the longevity of a collected plant sample. Properly preserved plant samples can last for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/explore/curriculum-collections/biodiversity-counts/plant-identification/collecting-plants|title=Collecting Plants|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York Botanical Garden]] itself holds plant samples that date back to the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804–1806.

=== Sample gathering ===
The first step of plant pressing begins with the collection of the sample. When collecting a sample it is important to first make sure that land you are collecting on allows for the removal of natural specimens. The next step after finding a suitable plant for collection is to assign it with a number for record keeping purposes. This number system is up to the individual collector, but usually involves the date of collection or the sequential number of that collection. Along with an assigned number, observations about the plant's location and live appearance should be noted in detail. These field notes will accompany the finished sample to provide supplementary information about the plant.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-12.pdf|title=Preparing And Storing Herbarium Specimens|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://store.msuextension.org/publications/AgandNaturalResources/MT198359AG.pdf|title=How to Collect, Press and Mount Plants|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Compression ====
After cleaning the sample of any mud or dirt, the next step is to press the sample. Some samples may press better if they have been left to wilt for a few days. However plants should never be allowed to spoil or decompose before pressing, as this will impact the quality of the dried product. Plant presses are most commonly constructed with two flat smooth pieces of wood, and some type of compression mechanism. Compression may be accomplished with tightened nuts and bolts on the corners of the press, with tightened straps around the press, or by placing weights on top of the press. When placing in the press, plant samples should be sandwiched between a few layers of absorbent [[Blotting paper|blotter]]. Newspaper and cardboard are two common choices for blotter material. When arranging the plant in the press it is important to remember that the dried plant product will be fragile and inflexible, so position the plant exactly as you wish the final product to appear. Tighten the press and wait approximately a day to check up on the plant. The blotter should be taken out and replaced with dry blotter roughly every 24 hours. Complete drying time will vary depending on the type of plant, but is generally 7–10 days. Fleshier plants such as succulents will take longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/explore/curriculum-collections/biodiversity-counts/plant-identification/how-to-press-and-preserve-plants/|title=How to Press and Preserve Plants|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Mounting ====
After the plant sample has been sufficiently dried and pressed, it must be mounted. The quality of mounting not only impacts the appearance of the plant sample, but also determines the rate of deterioration the sample will experience. Herbarium quality mounts use specialized paper for the best protection against deterioration.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdnhm.org/science/botany/resources/general-information/how-to-make-a-plant-collection/|title=Making a Plant Collection|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper can either be 100% alpha cellulose paper or cotton “rag” paper. These types of paper are ideal for preserving plant samples because they are acid free and pH neutral. Samples can be strapped to the paper with linen tape, or glued onto the sheet. If glue is needed, it is recommended that Grade A [[methyl cellulose]] mixed with water be used for optimal deterioration resistance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Storage ====
In order for plant specimens to be kept in good condition for future reference, adequate storage conditions are needed. The storage space should be kept in a low light, low [[humidity]] environment. The temperature of the storage space should be kept cool, between 50 – 65 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brit.org/herbarium/plantcollecting/storage|title=BRIT Herbarium|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to keep the storage space free of harmful pest. It is recommended to protect the specimens by sheathing the sheets in sealed plastic bags. Various [[pesticide]]s may also be used to protect the storage space from pest infestation. If pest infestation has already occurred, the samples should be frozen for three to four days. Freezing new additions of plant samples is a suggested preventative measure against the introduction of pest to the storage space.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Collection of herbarium specimens ==
[[Herbarium]] specimens of plants are collected for a number of different uses. They can assist in  accurate identification and provide a species record for a time and place that can be used in distribution maps. They can also provide biological material for researchers, a reference point to document scientific names and vouchers for research and seed collections.&lt;ref name=qh&gt;{{cite paper|editor=Bean, A.R.|title=Collecting and preserving plant specimens, A Manual|url=http://www.qld.gov.au/environment/assets/documents/plants-animals/herbarium/collecting-manual.pdf|publisher=
Queensland Herbarium, Environmental Protection Agency Biodiversity Sciences unit, Brisbane
|date=2006|isbn=1-920928-06-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA barcoding, a new method of identification of plant vouchers, is being used in herbaria across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://botany.si.edu/projects/dnabarcode/index.htm|title=Plant DNA Barcode Project|website=botany.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]] creates their barcodes from a short sequence of plant DNA, which can be easily identified from all healthy specimens of the species. This barcode is then printed and placed onto the plant mount. By creating these DNA barcodes, the process of organizing and loaning plant specimens becomes more streamlined and can be mechanized.

===Voucher specimens===
 
Voucher specimens are select herbarium specimens. What distinguishes these specimens from others is that a voucher specimen is a "representative sample of an expertly identified organism." These specimens are usually associated with a professional research article and are considered to be more official references than a typical herbarium specimen. Voucher specimens can be useful in many ways such as use for comparison when scientists think they have found a new species or when dichotomous keys have narrowed the possible species down to a few that have minute differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why vouchers matter in botanical research1|first=Theresa M.|last=Culley|date=29 October 2013|publisher=|journal=Applications in Plant Sciences|volume=1|issue=11|doi=10.3732/apps.1300076|pmid=25202501|pmc=4103463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plant collecting as a hobby ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}

Plant collecting may also refer to a hobby, in which the hobbyist takes identifiable samples of [[plant]] species found in nature, dries them, and stores them in a paper sheet album, a simple [[herbarium]], along with the information of the finding location, finding date, etc. necessary scientific information. As in many [[collecting]] hobbies, rarer specimens have been valued. However, when collecting living organisms, the [[Conservation ethic|conservation aspects]] must precede the collector's ambitions. This has led in some cases to a collector voluntarily taking part, helping scientists, in some research areas, provided he can store the "[[collectible]]". In fact, historically, many [[species]] have initially been found within a collection of a collector.

Usually, a plant can be identified in nature, since they are stationary.
The advent of [[digital camera]]s has led many plant collectors to switch totally to [[photography]]. Some have switched to collecting live specimens of various plant species in their gardens, building a sort of "private [[botanical garden]]". Some have specialized in a specific group, the [[orchid]]s and the [[rose]]s and their [[cultivar]]s are among the most collected.
&lt;ref name="brit.org"&gt;http://www.brit.org/sites/default/files/public/Herbarium/Plant_Collection_and_Preservation_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poaching ==
{{expand section|date=March 2016}}
Illegal collection of plants is known as plant poaching. A report on the risk of rare plant [[poaching]] has provided data showing possible connections between geography and the rate of poaching in the [[Shenandoah National Park]], Virginia, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=John A.|last2=Manen|first2=Frank T. van|last3=Thatcher|first3=Cindy A.|date=2011-09-01|title=Geographic Profiling to Assess the Risk of Rare Plant Poaching in Natural Areas|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-011-9687-3|journal=Environmental Management|language=en|volume=48|issue=3|pages=577–587|doi=10.1007/s00267-011-9687-3|issn=0364-152X|bibcode=2011EnMan..48..577Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The openings for poaching were found to be increased in locations with easy accessibility, such as roads, trails, and developed areas. The condition of the environment can determine the levels of poaching, with regions of higher quality receiving more attention from poachers.

=== Ethics ===

The hobby and practice of plant collecting is known to have been the cause of declines in certain plant populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norton|first=David A.|last2=Lord|first2=Janice M.|last3=Given|first3=David R.|last4=Lange|first4=Peter J. De|date=1994-01-01|title=Over-Collecting: An Overlooked Factor in the Decline of Plant Taxa|jstor=1222876|journal=Taxon|volume=43|issue=2|pages=181–185|doi=10.2307/1222876}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be the result of hobbyists being oblivious to the status of a particular species, collectors of valuable species for profit, or researchers over collecting to fill slots in herbaria. This issue can be solved with proper research on the status of species before a plant is collected and taking the smallest sample possible.

== Safety and precautions ==
While plant collecting may seem like a very safe and harmless practice, there is a few things collectors should keep in mind to protect themselves. First collectors should always be aware of the land where they are collecting. As in [[hiking]] there will be certain limitations to whether or not public access is granted on a plot of land and if collection from that land is allowed. For example, in a [[National park]] of the [[United States]], plant collection is not allowed unless given special permission. Collecting internationally will involve some logistics, such as official permits which will most likely be required to bring plants both from the country of collection and to the destination country. The major herbaria can be useful to the average hobbyist in aiding them in acquiring these permits.&lt;ref name="brit.org"/&gt;

If traveling to a remote location to access samples, it is safe practice to inform someone of your whereabouts and planned time of return. If traveling in hot weather, collectors should bring adequate water to avoid dehydration. Forms of sun protection such as sunscreen and wide brimmed hats may be essential depending on location. Travel to remote locations will most likely involve walking measurable distances in wild terrain, so precautions synonymous with those related to [[hiking]] should be taken.&lt;ref name="brit.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/assets/documents/plants-animals/herbarium/collecting-manual.pdf|title=Collecting and preserving plant specimens, a manual|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
Plant "discovery" means the first time that a new plant was recorded for science, often in the form of dried and pressed plants (a [[herbarium]] specimen) being sent to a botanical establishment such as [[Kew Gardens]] in London, where it would be examined, classified and named.&lt;ref name="Musgrave"&gt;{{cite book | author= Toby Musgrave | author2= Chris Gardner | author3= Will Musgrave | last-author-amp= yes | title=The Plant Hunters| publisher=[[Orion Publishing Group|Seven Dials]] | date=1999|pages= 10–11| isbn=1-84188-001-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant "introduction" means the first time that living matter – seed, cuttings or a whole plant – was brought back to Europe. Thus, the [[Handkerchief tree]] (''[[Davidia involucrata]]'') was discovered by [[Père David]] in 1869 but introduced to Britain by [[Ernest Henry Wilson|Ernest Wilson]] in 1901.&lt;ref name="Musgrave" /&gt;

[[File:Flamingo Flower Orchid.JPG|thumb|Flamingo Flower]]

Often, the two happened simultaneously: thus Sir [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] discovered and introduced his Himalayan [[rhododendron]]s between 1849 and 1851.&lt;ref name="Musgrave" /&gt;

'''Project NEXUS''' is a [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) grant funded project based at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] and headed by [[Principal investigator|Principal Investigator]] Dr. J. Randy McGinnis. Its purpose is to investigate an innovative model of teacher preparation.

Originally a collaboration among [[University of Maryland, College Park]] (UM), (a large, primarily majority population university); [[Bowie State University]] (BSU), Maryland (a smaller, [[Historically Black Colleges and Universities|historically black university]]); and [[Hands On Science Outreach, Inc.]] (a national organization developing and administering informal science education classes for children), it has evolved into a collaborative with [[Coppin State University]] (CSU), (Maryland) and available informal science education internships. The award was made in 2005 and ran until 2012.

The key assumption was that science educational practices require systemic reform within the undergraduate science subject matter and education classes, prospective teachers’ field-based experiences, and professional development during new teachers induction years (NSF, 1993;&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation, "Proceedings of the National Science Foundation workshop on the role of faculty from  the scientific disciplines in the undergraduate education of future science and mathematics teachers." (Author, Washington, DC 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; NRC, 1997;&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council, "Improving teacher preparation and credentialling consistent with the National Science Education Standards." (National Academy Press, Washington, DC 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Sunal, Wright, &amp; Day, 2004.)&lt;ref&gt;D. Sunal, E. Wright, and J. Day, Eds., "Reform in undergraduate science teaching for the 21st century" (Information Age Publishing, Greenwich, CT 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Project NEXUS was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0455752.&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0455752"&gt;{{cite web

{{Main article|List of psychological research methods}}

Psychologists use many research methods, and categorical distinctions of these methods have emerged. Methods can be categorized by the kind of data they produce: [[Qualitative psychological research|qualitative]] or [[Quantitative psychological research|quantitative]]—and both these are used for [[Pure research|pure]] or [[applied research]].

[[Psychology]] tends to be [[eclecticism|eclectic]], applying knowledge from other fields. Some of its methods are used within other areas of research, especially in the [[social sciences|social]] and [[behavioural sciences]].

=== Experimental methods ===
{{main article|Experiment|Experimental psychology}}

The field of psychology commonly uses experimental methods in what is known as [[experimental psychology]]. Researchers design experiments to test specific [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] (the [[deductive reasoning|deductive approach]]), or to evaluate functional relationships (the [[inductive reasoning|inductive approach]]).

The method of experimentation involves an experimenter changing some influence—the ''[[independent variable]](IV)''— on the research subjects, and studying the effects it produces on an expected aspect—the ''[[dependent variable]] (DV)''— of the subjects behaviour or experience.&lt;ref name="randomHouse"&gt;''Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.'' Random House, Inc. 2001. Page 534, 971. {{ISBN|0-375-42566-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other variables researchers consider in experimentation are known as the ''[[extraneous variables]]'', and are either ''[[Control variable|controllable]]'' or ''[[confounding]]'' (more than one variable at play).

Confounding variables are external variables that are not taken into account when conducting an experiment. Because they are not controlled for, they can skew experiments results and provide a false or unreliable conclusion. For example, the psychologist Seymour Feshbach conducted an experiment to see how [[violence]] on [[television]] (the independent variable), affected [[aggression]] in [[adolescent]] [[boy]]s (the dependent variable). He published his results in a paper called ''Television and Aggression'' in 1971. The paper showed that, in some cases, the lack of violence on television made the boys ''more'' aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED062791&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED062791|title=Television and Aggression.|first1=Seymour|last1=Feshbach|first2=Robert D.|last2=Singer|publisher=|via=eric.ed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to a confounding variable, which in this case was [[frustration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.amsciepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.1986.58.1.111|title=AGGRESSIVE RESPONSES OF ADOLESCENTS TO AN HYPOTHETICAL FRUSTRATIVE SITUATION|journal=Psychological Reports|first1=YOSHIHARU|last1=TACHIBANA|first2=ETSUSHI|last2=HASEGAWA|publisher=|volume=58|issue=1|pages=111–118|doi=10.2466/pr0.1986.58.1.111|pmid=3961055|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that extraneous variables are important to consider when [[Design of experiments|designing experiments]], and many methods have emerged to [[Scientific control|scientifically control them]]. For this reason, many experiments in [[psychology]] are conducted in [[laboratory]] conditions where they can be more strictly regulated.

Alternatively, some experiments are less controlled. [[Quasi-experiment]]'s are those that a researcher sets up in a controlled environment, but does not control the independent variable. For example, Michael R. Cunningham used a quasi-experiment to "...measure the physical in physical attractiveness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1986-21934-001|title=PsycNET - Option to Buy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in [[field experiment]]s the experimenter controls an independent variable (making it the control variable), but does not control the environment where the experiment takes place. Experimenters sometimes apply fewer controls, as a way to lessen potential biases. In a ''[[true experiment]]'', participants are randomly chosen to remove the chance of [[experimenter's bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/research/design/experiment_types.htm|title=Types of experiment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/SommerB/sommerdemo/experiment/types.htm|title=Experiments: Types|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Observational methods ===
{{Main article|Observational study}}

''Observational research,'' (a type of non-experimental, [[Correlational research|correlational]] research), involves the researcher observing the ongoing behaviour of their subjects. &lt;ref name="psych.csufresno.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psych.csufresno.edu/psy144/Content/Design/Nonexperimental/observation.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121214185456/http://psych.csufresno.edu/psy144/Content/Design/Nonexperimental/observation.html |archivedate=2012-12-14 |df= }}

&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple methods of observational research such as ''participant observations'', ''non-participant observations'' and ''naturalistic observations''.&lt;ref name="psych.csufresno.edu" /&gt;



Participant observations are methods that involve a researcher joining the particular social group they are studying. For example, the [[Social psychology|social psychologist]], [[Leon Festinger]] and his associates, joined a group called ''The Seekers'' in order to observe them. The Seekers believed they were in touch with aliens, and that the aliens had told them the world was about to end.&lt;ref name="Leon Festinger 1956" /&gt; When the foretasted event didn't happen, Festinger and his associates observed how the attitudes of the group members changed. They published their results in a 1956 book called ''[[When Prophecy Fails]]''. [[David Rosenhan]] in 1973 published a journal that involved research by participant observations.&lt;ref name="psych.csufresno.edu" /&gt;'' see: [[:Rosenhan experiment|on being sane in insane places]]''.

The other method of observational research is non-participant observation. In particular  [[Naturalistic observation|naturalistic methods]] are methods that simply study behaviours that occur naturally in natural environments—with no manipulation by the observer.&lt;ref name=KCherry&gt;{{cite web |last=Cherry |first=Kendra |title=What Is Naturalistic Observation? |url=http://psychology.about.com/od/nindex/g/naturalistic.htm |publisher=About.com |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Psychology 202Q Lab: Naturalistic Observation |url=http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~ps202vc/PDF/NaturalisticObservation.pdf |publisher=University of Connecticut |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events studied ''must'' be natural and not staged. This fact gives naturalistic observational research a high [[ecological validity]].&lt;ref name="psych.csufresno.edu" /&gt; During naturalistic observations, researchers can avoid interfering with the behavior they are observing by using [[Unobtrusive research|unobtrusive]] methods,&lt;ref name=NatObs&gt;{{cite web |title=Naturalistic Observation |publisher=radford.edu |url=http://www.radford.edu/~tpierce/201%20files/201%20handouts/Naturalistic%20Observationl%20ecture%20notes.pdf |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; if needed.

Both types of observational methods are designed to be as [[wikt:reliability|reliable]] as possible. Reliability can be estimated using ''inter-observer reliability'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/reltypes.php|title=Types of Reliability|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, by comparing observations conducted by different researchers. ''Intra-observer reliability'' means estimating the reliability of an observation using a comparison of observations conducted by the same researcher. The reliability of conducted studies is important in any field of [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item2711519/?site_locale=en_GB|title=Reliability in Scientific Research|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''For a [[statistics|statistical]] perspective of reliability, see also'' [[Reliability (statistics)]].

=== Descriptive methods ===
{{Main article|Descriptive research}}

All [[Science|scientific]] processes begin with a description based on observation. Theories may develop later to explain these observations&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study_guide/Descriptive-Correlational-Research.topicArticleId-25438,articleId-25309.html&lt;/ref&gt; or classify associated phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Babbie, Earl.1989. The Practice of Social Research. 5th edition. Belmont CA: Wadsworth&lt;/ref&gt; In [[scientific methodology]], the conceptualizing of descriptive research precedes the [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] of "explanatory research".&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia and HassanTajalli. 2006. Intermediate Theory: The Missing Link in Successful Student Scholarship. Journal of Public Affairs Education. Vol. 12, No. 3. Pp. 313-334. http://ecommons.txstate.edu/polsfacp/39/&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a descriptive device used in psychological research is the ''[[diary]]'', which is used to record observations. There is a history of use of diaries within [[clinical psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.302/abstract|title=Diaries in clinical psychology and psychotherapy: a selective review|first1=Claudia|last1=Thiele|first2=Anton-Rupert|last2=Laireiter|first3=Urs|last3=Baumann|date=1 January 2002|publisher=|journal=Clin. Psychol. Psychother.|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–37|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/cpp.302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of psychologists that used them include [[B.F. Skinner]] (1904–1990) and [[Virginia Axline]] (1911–1988). A special case of a diary in this context, that has particular importance in [[Developmental psychology|development psychology]], is known as the ''baby biography'',&lt;ref&gt;Springer 1995, The Role of Emotions in Social and Personality Development: History, Theory, and Research
Volume 1 of Emotions, Personality, and Psychotherapy&lt;/ref&gt; and was used by psychologists such as [[Jean Piaget]].

Other recording methods can include video or audio. For example, [[Forensic psychology|forensic psychologists]] record custodial interrogations to aid law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:0eHdREE3gzwJ:web.me.com/gregdeclue/Site/Volume_1__2009_files/2009-excerpt-Lassiter.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiOhJrHmEKPcD4h6aEo6zKLgzNXzhzE0tqZxd2JiXITdH_sb1ja0HJ7U0HK0LRHe8mHJYaAt0xZBJ3UJoOzC0_pzfWdyrgSrheazYmyOAyGaJUnwHT_-bMMlBpisle6_YLdEefq&amp;sig=AHIEtbQnwQmhrPIDjv9H9wd2_4LUqHj-Qw&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Case studies ===
{{Main article|Case study in psychology}}

A ''case study''—or ''case report''—is an intensive analysis of a person, group, or event that stresses developmental factors related to the context. Case studies may be descriptive or explanatory. Explanatory case studies explore causation to identify underlying principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Shepard| first = Jon| authorlink = Jon M. Shepard| author2 = Robert W.

Yin]]. ''Case Study Research: Design and Methods''. Fourth Edition. SAGE Publications. California, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-6099-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a debate to whether case studies count as a [[Scientific method|scientific]] research method. [[Clinical psychology|Clinical psychologists]] use case studies most often, especially to describe [[Abnormal psychology|abnormal]] events and conditions, which are particularly important in [[clinical research]].&lt;ref name="Christensen"&gt;Christensen, L. B. (1994).“Experimental methodology"( 6th ed)., Simon &amp; Schuster: Needham Heights, MA. {{ISBN|978-0-205-15506-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] made extensive use of case studies to formulate his theory of [[psychoanalysis]].

Famous case studies include: [[Anna O.]] and [[Rat Man]] of Freud's [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]], who is one of the most severe cases of [[social isolation]] ever recorded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Concise Encyclopedia of Special Education | editor1=Reynolds, Cecil R. |editor2=Fletcher-Janzen, Elaine | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-471-65251-9 | page=428 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V6CG5RzC2nkC&amp;pg=PA428}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]], a [[chimpanzee]] who was the first non-human that had learned to communicate using [[American Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Livingston, John A.|chapter=other selves|editor1=Vitek, William |editor2=Jackson, Wes|title=Rooted in the land: essays on community and place|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-300-06961-7|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZ3UfrZkSDsC&amp;pg=PA133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surveys ===
{{Main article|Statistical survey}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Interviews and questionnaires intrude as a foreign element into the
social setting they would describe, they create as well as measure atti-
tudes, they elicit atypical role and response, they are limited to those
who are accessible and who will cooperate, and the responses obtained
are produced in part by dimensions of individual differences irrelevant
to the topic at hand.&lt;small&gt; Webb ''et al''—Unobtrusive methods: Nonreactive research in the social science (1966).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bradburn et al. (1979) found a tendency for survey respondents to over-
report socially desirable behaviours when interviewed using less anonymous methods.&lt;ref&gt;Norman M Bradburn et al ''Improving interview method and questionnaire design''. The University of California: Jossey-Bass, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychometric methods ===
Psychometrics is a field of study concerned with the theory and technique of psychological measurement. One part of the field is concerned with the objective measurement of skills and knowledge, abilities, attitudes, personality traits, and educational achievement.

=== Archival methods ===
Archival research can be defined as the study of existing data. The existing data is collected to answer research questions. Existing data sources may include statistical records, survey archives, and written records.

=== Cross-sectional methods ===
Cross-sectional research is a research method often used in developmental psychology, but also utilized in many other areas including social science and education. This type of study utilizes different groups of people who differ in the variable of interest, but share other characteristics such as socioeconomic status, educational background, and ethnicity.

For example, researchers studying developmental psychology might select groups of people who are remarkably similar in most areas, but differ only in age.

=== Longitudinal methods ===
Longitudinal research is a type of research method used to discover relationships between variables that are not related to various background variables. This observational research technique involves studying the same group of individuals over an extended period of time.

Data is first collected at the outset of the study, and may then be gathered repeatedly throughout the length of the study. In some cases, longitudinal studies can last several decades.

=== Cross-cultural methods ===
Cross-cultural psychology is a branch of psychology that looks at how cultural factors influence human behavior.

=== Cohort methods ===
Essentially, cohort refers to people who are approximately the same age. When researchers conduct different types of studies (for example, developmental/cross sectional studies), they use cohorts to see how people of different ages compare on some topic at one point in time. For example, a researcher may compare the effects of a new study aid in three different cohorts: 10th graders, 11th graders, and 12th graders. In this way, you can examine the study aid across three different grade levels.

=== Computational methods ===
A discipline lying on the border between artificial intelligence and psychology. It is concerned with building computer models of human cognitive processes and is based on an analogy between the human mind and computer programs. The brain and computer are viewed as general-purpose symbol-manipulation systems, capable of supporting software processes, but no analogy is drawn at a hardware level.

=== Unobtrusive methods ===
{{Main article|Unobtrusive research}}

The term ''unobtrusive measures'' was first coined by Eugene Webb, Campbell, Schwartz, and Sechrest in a 1966 book, ''Unobtrusive methods: Nonreactive research in the social science'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Webb, Eugene J. et al. ''Unobtrusive Measures: nonreactive research in the social sciences''. Chicago: Rand McNally, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; in which they described methods that don't involve direct induction of data from research subjects. For example, the evidence people leave behind as they traverse their physical environment is unobtrusive. Unobtrusive methods get around biases, such as the [[selection bias]] and the [[experimenter's bias#Social sciences|experimenter's bias]], that result from the researcher and his intrusion. Consequently, however, these methods reduce the researcher's control over the type of data collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/unobtrus.php|title=Unobtrusive Measures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Web and others regard these methods as an additional tools to use with the more common ''reactive'' and ''intrusive methods''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

A general view is that Science 2.0 is gaining traction&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; with websites beginning to proliferate,&lt;ref name=tws2E41/&gt; yet at the same time there is considerable resistance within the scientific community about aspects of the transition as well as discussion about what, exactly, the term means.

The term has many meanings and continues to evolve in scientific parlance. It not only describes what is currently happening in science, but describes a direction in which proponents believe science should move towards, as well as a growing number of websites which promote free scientific collaboration.

[[File:Ben Shneiderman at UNCC.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ben Shneiderman]]]]
The term ''Science 2.0'' suggests a contrast between traditional ways of doing science, often denoted ''Science 1.0'', with more collaborative approaches, and suggests that the new forms of science will work with [[Web 2.0]] technologies.&lt;ref name=tws2E1112/&gt; One description from ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' is that Science 2.0 uses the "networking power of the internet to tackle problems with multiple interacting variables - the problems, in other words, of everyday life."&lt;ref name=tws2E34/&gt; A different and somewhat controversial view is that of [[Ben Shneiderman]], who suggested that Science 2.0 combines hypothesis-based inquiries with social science methods, partially for the purpose of improving those new networks.&lt;ref name=tws2E43/&gt;

While the term describes websites for sharing scientific knowledge, it also includes efforts by existing science publishers to embrace new digital tools, such as offering areas for discussions following published online articles.&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; Sometimes it denotes [[open access]] which, according to one view, means that the author continues to hold the copyright but that others can read it and use it for reasonable purposes, provided that the attribution is maintained.&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; Most online scientific literature is behind [[paywall]]s, meaning that a person can find the title of an article on Google but they can not read the actual article.&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; People who can access these articles are generally affiliated with a university&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; or secondary school or library or other educational institution, or who pay on a per-article or subscription basis.

{{Quote|Traditional scientific journals are part of this social evolution too, innovating ways to engage scientists online and enable global collaboration and conversation.

One view is that ''Science 2.0'' should include an effort by scientists to offer papers in non-technical language, as a way of reaching out to non-scientists.&lt;ref name=tws2E28&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For others, it includes building vast databases of case histories.&lt;ref name=tws2E34/&gt; There is a sense in which ''Science 2.0'' indicates a general direction for scientific collaboration, although there is little clarity about how exactly this might happen. One aim is to "make scientific collaboration as easy as sharing videos of trips home from the dentist," according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2E23/&gt;

==History and background==
The rise of the [[Internet]] has transformed many activities such as [[retailing]] and information searching.&lt;ref name=tws2E41/&gt; In [[journalism]], Internet technologies such as [[blogging]], tagging and [[social networking]] have caused many existing media sources such as newspapers to "adopt whole new ways of thinking and operating," according to a report in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref name=tws2E41&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that while the Internet has transformed many aspects of life, it has not changed scientific research as much as it could. While firms such as eBay, Amazon and Netflix have changed consumer retailing, and online patient-centered medical data has enabled better health care, Science 2.0 advocate Ben Shneiderman said:

According to one view, a similar web-inspired transformation that has happened to other areas is now happening to science.&lt;ref name=tws2E41/&gt; The general view is that science has been slower than other areas to embrace the web technology, but that it is beginning to catch up.&lt;ref name=tws2E42&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research was done in private. Next, it was submitted to scientific publications and reviewed by editors and gatekeepers and other scientists. Last, it was published.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; This has been the traditional pathway of scientific advancement, sometimes dubbed ''Science 1.0''.

Established journals provided a "critical service", according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; Publications such as ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' have large editorial staffs to manage the peer-review process as well as have hired fact-checkers and screeners to look over submissions. These publications get revenue from subscriptions, including online ones, as well as advertising revenue and fees paid by authors.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; According to advocates of Science 2.0, however, this process of paper-submission and review was rather long.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; Detractors complained that the system is "hidebound, expensive and elitist", sometimes "reductionist",&lt;ref name=tws2E1112/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws2E43/&gt; as well as being slow and "prohibitively costly".&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; Only a select group of gatekeepers—those in charge of the traditional publications—limited the flow of information.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; Proponents of [[open science]] claimed that scientists could learn more and learn faster if there is a "friction-free collaboration over the Internet."&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt;

Yet there is considerable resistance within the scientific community to a change of approach. The act of publishing a new finding in a major journal has been at the "heart of the career of scientists," according to one view, which elaborated that many scientists would be reluctant to sacrifice the "emotional reward" of having their discoveries published in the usual, traditional way.&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; Established scientists are often loath to switch to an open-source model, according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt;

Timo Hannay explained that the traditional publish-a-paper model, sometimes described as "Science 1.0",&lt;ref name=tws2E43/&gt; was a workable one but there need to be other ways for scientists to make contributions and get credit for their work:

{{Quote|The unit of contribution to the scientific knowledge base has become the paper. Journals grew up as a means for scientists to be able to share their discoveries and ideas. The incentive for doing so was that by publishing in journals their contributions would be recognized by citation and other means. So you have this pact: be open with your ideas and share them through journals and you will get credit... There are all kinds of ways in which scientists can contribute to the global endeavor. ... The incentive structure has not caught up with what we really want scientists to do.|Timo Hannay, 2012&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt;}}

There are reports that established journals are moving towards greater openness. Some help readers network online; others enable commenters to post links to websites; others make papers accessible after a certain period of time has elapsed.&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; But it remains a "hotly debated question", according to one view, whether the business of scientific research can move away from the model of "peer-vetted, high-quality content without requiring payment for access."&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; The topic has been discussed in a lecture series at the [[California Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=tws2E1113&gt;{{cite news

{{Quote|Open science is not this maverick idea; it’s becoming reality. About 35 percent of scientists are using things like blogs to consume and produce content. There is an explosion of online tools and platforms available to scientists, ranging from Web 2.0 tools modified or created for the scientific world to Web sites that are doing amazing things with video, lab notebooks, and social networking. There are thousands of scientific software programs freely available online and tens of millions of science, technology, and math journal articles online.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14261">'''Science by press conference''' (or '''science by press release''') is the practice by which scientists put an unusual focus on publicizing results of research in the [[Mass media|media]].&lt;ref name="techreview1989"&gt;Jerome F (1989). Science by press conference. ''[[Technology Review]]'' July 1989, No. 92, pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is usually used disparagingly.&lt;ref name="hall2004"&gt;Hall, Stephen S. (2004). ''Merchants of Immortality: Chasing the Dream of Human Life Extension.'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, {{ISBN|978-0-618-49221-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to associate the target with people promoting scientific "findings" of questionable scientific merit who turn to the media for attention when they are unlikely to win the approval of the professional scientific community.

Premature publicity violates a cultural value of most of the scientific community, which is that findings should be subjected to [[independent review]] with a "thorough examination by the scientific community" before they are widely publicized.&lt;ref name=EMBOreports/&gt; The standard practice is to publish a paper in a [[peer-review]]ed scientific journal. This idea has many merits, including that the scientific community has a responsibility to conduct itself in a deliberative, non-[[attention seeking]] way; and that its members should be oriented more towards the pursuit of insight than fame. Science by press conference in its most egregious forms can be undertaken on behalf of an individual researcher seeking fame, a corporation seeking to sway public opinion or investor perception, or a political or ideological movement.

== History of the term ==

The phrase was coined by Spyros Andreopoulos, a public affairs officer at [[Stanford University Medical School]], in a 1980 letter which appeared in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''.&lt;ref name="Andreopoulos1980"&gt;Andreopoulos Spyros  (March 27, 1980). Gene Cloning by Press Conference. ''[[N Engl J Med]]'' 1980; 302:743–746&lt;/ref&gt; Andreopoulos was commenting specifically on the publicity practices of [[biotechnology]] startups, including [[Biogen]] and [[Genentech]].&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite book |author=Hall, Stephen K. |title=Merchants of immortality: chasing the dream of human life extension |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-618-49221-6 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal in which it appeared had implemented a long-standing policy under editor [[Franz J. Ingelfinger]] which prohibited seeking publicity for research prior to its submission or publication, informally called the Ingelfinger Rule.&lt;ref name="angell1991"&gt;Angell, Marcia and Kassirer, Jerome P.

=== Notable examples of science by press conference ===

* In 1989, chemists [[Stanley Pons]] and [[Martin Fleischmann]] held a press conference to claim they had successfully achieved [[cold fusion]].&lt;ref name=EMBOreports/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilford1989"&gt;Wilford, John Noble (April 24, 1989).

These cases became notorious examples of "science by press conference" precisely because they were widely reported in the press, but were later either rebuffed, debunked, or found to be outright fraud.

== Motivations ==
[[File:201609 KDGS nr28.jpg|thumb|Martina Franzen on a German congress of sociology, 2016]]
Competition for publicity, between scientific institutions or just individual researchers, is considered a driving force behind premature press conferences.&lt;ref name=Winsten&gt;{{cite journal |author=J A Winsten |title=Science and the media: the boundaries of truth |journal=[[Health Affairs]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=5–23 |year=1985 |month= |pmid= |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.4.1.5 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/4/1/5.citation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure to announce research findings quickly enough to "avoid losing credit" for any scientific advances may be enhanced by limited or highly competitive funding.&lt;ref name=Winsten/&gt;

Science by press conference does not have to involve a groundbreaking announcement. A manufacturer may desire to publicize results of research that suggest their product is safe. Science by press conference does not necessarily have to be directed at the general public. In some cases, it may be directed at a target market like opinion leaders, a specific industry, potential investors, or a specific group of consumers. [[Biotechnology]] companies, for example, have financial incentives to utilize premature press conferences to gain favorable media coverage.&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;&lt;ref name="angell1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Winsten/&gt;

In recent years, sociologists of science have recast discussion about "science by press conference". They point to the increasing presence of media conversation across all aspects of culture, and argue that science is subject to many of the same social forces as other aspects of culture. They have described the increased "medialization" of science, and suggest that both science and society are changed by this process.&lt;ref name="Rödder"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Simone |editor1-last=Rödder |editor2-first=Martina |editor2-last=Franzen |editor3-first=Peter |editor3-last=Weingart |title=The sciences' media connection : public communication and its repercussions |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht/New York |isbn=9789400720848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibility ==

While the phrase tends to criticize scientists involved in creating the publicity, it has also been used to assert that the media bear responsibility in many instances.&lt;ref name=EMBOreports&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moore Andrew | year = 2006 | title = Bad science in the headlines: Who takes responsibility when science is distorted in the mass media? | url = http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v7/n12/full/7400862.html | journal = [[EMBO Reports]] | volume = 7 | issue = 12| pages = 1193–1196 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400862 | pmc = 1794697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even well-intentioned scientists can sometimes unintentionally create truth-distorting media firestorms because of journalists' difficulty in remaining critical and balanced, the media's interest in controversy, and the general tendency of science reporting to focus on apparent "groundbreaking findings" rather than on the larger context of a research field. Further, when results are released with great fanfare and limited peer review, basic journalism skills require skepticism and further investigation; the fact that they often do not can be seen as a problem with the media as much as with scientists who seek to exploit their power.

A common example of science by press conference occurs when the media report that a certain product or activity affects health or safety. For instance, the media frequently report findings that a certain food causes or prevents a disease. These reports sometimes contradict earlier reports. In some cases, it is later learned that a group interested in influencing opinion had a hand in publicizing a specific report.

The phrase also condemns different behavior in different fields. For instance, scientists working in fields that put an emphasis on the value of fast dissemination of research, like [[HIV]] treatment research, often first and most visibly disseminate research results via conferences or talks rather than through printed publication. In these areas of science, printed publication occurs later in the process of dissemination of results than in some other fields. In the case of HIV, this is partly the result of [[AIDS]] [[activism]] in which people with AIDS and their allies criticized the slow pace of research. In particular, they characterized researchers who kept quiet before publication as being more interested in their careers than in the well-being of people with AIDS. On the other hand, over-hyped early findings can inspire activists' ire and even their direct and critical use of the phrase "science by press conference". [[AIDS denialist]] groups have claimed that press conferences announcing findings in HIV and [[AIDS]] research, particularly [[Robert Gallo]]'s April 23, 1984, announcement of the discovery of the probable AIDS virus, inhibited research into non-HIV etiologies of AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kalichman, Seth C. |title=Denying AIDS: Conspiracy Theories, Pseudoscience, and Human Tragedy |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-387-79475-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mtDBCDwxugC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=%22Science+by+press+conference%22+-wikipedia#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Science%20by%20press%20conference%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false |doi= |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, clinical trials and other kinds of important medical research may release preliminary results to the media before a journal article is printed. In this case, the justification can be that clinicians and patients will benefit from the information even knowing that the data are preliminary and require further review. For instance, researchers did not wait to publish journal articles about the [[SARS]] outbreak before notifying the media about many of their findings, for obvious reasons.

Another example might be the termination of a clinical trial because it has yielded early benefit. Publicizing this kind of result has obvious value; a delay of a few months might have terrible consequences when the results concern life-threatening conditions. On the other hand, the latter practice is especially vulnerable to abuse for self-serving ends and thus has drawn criticism similar to that implied by the phrase "science by press conference".&lt;ref name="pmid18165635"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilcox RA, Djulbegovic B, Moffitt HL, Guyatt GH, Montori VM |title=Randomized trials in oncology stopped early for benefit |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=18–9 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18165635 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2007.13.6259 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These examples illustrate that the derision in the term "science by press conference" does not necessarily reflect an absolute rule to publish before publicizing. Rather, it illustrates the value that publicity should be a byproduct of science rather than its objective.

[[File:Science Communication – schematic overview.png|thumb|Schematic overview of the field and the actors of science communication according to Carsten Könneker]]
'''Science communication''' is the public [[communication]] of science-related topics to non-experts. This often involves professional scientists (called "[[science outreach|outreach]]" or "[[Popularization of science|popularization]]"), but has also evolved into a [[popular science|professional field]] in its own right. It includes science exhibitions, [[Science journalism|journalism]], [[Science policy|policy]] or media production. Science communication also includes communication between scientists (for instance through [[scientific journals]]), as well as between scientists and non-scientists (especially during public controversies over science and in [[citizen science]] initiatives).
 
Science communication may generate support for [[Scientific method|scientific research]] or [[Science education|study]], or to inform [[decision making]], including [[political]] and [[ethical]] thinking. There is increasing emphasis on explaining methods rather than simply findings of science. This may be especially critical in addressing scientific [[misinformation]], which spreads easily because it is not subject to the constraints of [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=GregMiller/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hilgartner/&gt;&lt;ref name=POIOlson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krulwich/&gt;
'''Science communicators'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; can use [[entertainment]] and [[persuasion]] including [[humour]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, [[storytelling]] and [[metaphors]].&lt;ref name=POIOlson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krulwich/&gt; Scientists can be trained in some of the techniques used by [[actors]] to improve their communication.&lt;ref name=Viola/&gt;

==Motivations==
Partly due to a market for professional training, science communication is also an academic discipline. Journals include ''[[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]]'' and ''Science Communication''. Researchers in this field are often linked to [[Science and Technology Studies]], but may also come from [[history of science]], mainstream [[media studies]], [[psychology]] or [[sociology]]. As a reflection of growth in this field, academic departments, such as the ''Department of Life Sciences Communication'' at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], have been established to focus on applied and theoretical communication issues. [[Agricultural communication]] is considered a subset of science communication from an academic and professional standpoint relating to agriculture-related information among agricultural and non-agricultural stakeholders. [[Health communication]] is a related discipline.
Writing in 1987, Geoffery Thomas and John Durant advocated various reasons to increase public understanding of science, or [[scientific literacy]]. If the public enjoyed science more, they suggested there would presumably be more funding, progressive regulation, and trained scientists. More trained engineers and scientists could allow a nation to be more competitive economically.&lt;ref name=GregMiller&gt;As summarised in Gregory, Jane &amp; Steve Miller (1998) Science in Public: communication, culture and credibility (New York: Plenum), 11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
Science can also benefit individuals. Science can simply have aesthetic appeal (e.g. [[popular science]] or [[science fiction]]). Living in an increasingly technological society, background scientific knowledge can help to negotiate it. The [[Positive psychology|science of happiness]] is an example of a field whose research can have direct and obvious implications for individuals.&lt;ref name=GregMiller/&gt;
Governments and societies might also benefit from more scientific literacy, since an informed electorate promotes a more [[democratic society]].&lt;ref name=GregMiller/&gt; Moreover, science can inform moral [[decision making]] (e.g. answering questions about whether [[Pain in animals|animals can feel pain]], how [[Climate change|human activity influences climate]], or even a [[science of morality]]).
[[Bernard Cohen (physicist)|Bernard Cohen]] points out potential pitfalls in improving scientific literacy. He explains first that we must avoid 'scientific idolatry'. In other words, science education must allow the public to respect science without worshiping it, or expecting infallibility. Ultimately scientists are humans, and neither perfectly altruistic, nor perfectly competent. Science communicators must also appreciate the distinction between understanding science and possessing a transferable skill of scientific thinking. Indeed, even trained scientists do not always manage to transfer the skill to other areas of their life.

Communicating science to the public is increasingly important in today's society. However according to some research, some scientists do not have the skills necessary to do so effectively. There has been some research done over why this is, and it has been found that the stereotype of scientists is the main reason they will not communicate to the public often. The "Draw a Scientist" experiment proves that from a young age, most people assume that scientists are unsocial, so scientists use that as a reason to not communicate.

Cohen is critical of what has been called "[[Scientism]]" – the claim that science is the best or only way to solve all problems. He also criticizes the teaching of 'miscellaneous information' and doubts that much of it will ever be of any use, (e.g. the distance in light years from the Earth to various stars, or the names of minerals). Much of scientific knowledge, particularly if it is not the subject of public debate and policy revision, may never really translate to practical changes for the lives of the learners.&lt;ref name=GregMiller/&gt;

Many criticisms of academic research in [[public understanding of science]] come from scholars in [[Science and Technology Studies]]. For example, Steven Hilgartner (1990)&lt;ref name=Hilgartner&gt;Hilgartner, Stephen (1990) ‘The Dominant View of Popularization: Conceptual Problems, Political Uses, Social Studies of Science, vol. 20(3): 519-539.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that what he calls 'the dominant view' of science popularization tends to imply a tight boundary around those who can articulate true, reliable knowledge. By defining a [[deficit model|deficient public]] as recipients of knowledge, the scientists get to contrast their own identity as experts. The process of popularization is a form of boundary work. Understood in this way, science communication may explicitly exist to connect scientists with the rest of society, but its very existence only acts to emphasise it: as if the scientific community only invited the public to play in order to reinforce its most powerful boundary (according to work by [[Massimiano Bucchi]] or [[Brian Wynne]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimiano Bucchi]] (1998) Science and the Media (London &amp; New York: Routledge).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, Brian (1992) ‘Misunderstood misunderstanding: Social identities and public uptake of science’, ''Public Understanding of Science'', vol. 1 (3): 281-304. See also Irwin, Alan &amp; Wynne, Brian (eds) (1996) ''Misunderstanding Science'' (Cambridge &amp; New York: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist [[Randy Olson]] adds that anti-science groups can often be so motivated, and so well funded, that the impartiality of science organizations in politics can lead to crises of public understanding of science. He cites examples of [[denialism]] (for instance of [[global warming]]) to support this worry.&lt;ref name=POIOlson&gt;(23 October 2009.) [http://www.pointofinquiry.org/randy_olson_dont_be_such_a_scientist/ "Randy Olson - Don’t Be Such a Scientist."] (Includes podcast). [http://www.pointofinquiry.org Pointofinquiry.org]. Accessed May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Robert Krulwich]] likewise argues that the stories scientists tell are invariably competing with the efforts of people like [[Adnan Oktar]]. Krulwich explains that attractive, easy to read, and cheap [[creationist]] textbooks were sold by the thousands to schools in Turkey (despite their strong secular tradition) due to the efforts of Oktar.&lt;ref name=Krulwich&gt;Miller, Lulu (29 July 2008).[http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2008/jul/29/tell-me-a-story/ "Tell Me a Story."] (Includes podcast). [http://www.radiolab.org Radiolab.org]. Accessed May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Astrobiologist [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] has spoken of repeated disruption of his work by popular anti-scientific phenomena, having been called upon to assuage public fears of an impending [[Nibiru cataclysm|cataclysm]] involving an unseen planetary object—first in 2008, and again in 2012 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Selk|first1=Avi|title=Please stop annoying this NASA scientist with your ridiculous Planet X doomsday theories|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/11/18/please-stop-annoying-this-nasa-scientist-with-your-ridiculous-planet-x-doomsday-theories/|website=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
[[File:Physicsworks.ogv|thumb|[[Walter Lewin]] demonstrates conservation of potential energy. It can be difficult to captivatingly share good scientific thinking as well as scientifically accurate information. Krulwich and Olson believe scientists must rise to that challenge using metaphor and story telling.&lt;ref name=POIOlson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krulwich/&gt;]]

Marine biologist and film-maker [[Randy Olson]] published ''Don't Be Such a Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style''. In the book he describes how there has been this unproductive negligence when it comes to teaching scientists to communicate. ''Don't be Such a Scientist'' is written to his fellow scientists, and he says they need to "lighten up". He adds that scientists are ultimately the most responsible for promoting and explaining science to the public and media. This, Olson says, should be done according to a good grasp of [[social science]]; scientists must use [[persuasive]] and effective means like [[story telling]]. Olson acknowledges that the stories told by scientists need not only be compelling but also accurate to modern science - and says this added challenge must simply be confronted. He points to figures like [[Carl Sagan]] as effective popularizers, partly because such figures actively cultivate a likeable image.&lt;ref name=POIOlson/&gt;

Science popularization figures such as Carl Sagan and [[Neil deGrasse Tyson|Neil Degrasse Tyson]] are partly responsible for the view of science or a specific science discipline within the general public. However, the degree of knowledge and experience a science popularizer has can vary greatly. Because of this, some can depend on sensationalism. As a Forbes contributor put it, "The main job of physics popularizers is the same as it is for any celebrity: get more famous."&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Neil deGrasse Tyson's Role in the Scientific Community? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/08/11/what-is-neil-degrasse-tysons-role-in-the-scientific-community/#17afaca875a5 |website=Forbes |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this variation in experience, research scientists can sometimes question the credibility of science popularizers. Another point in the controversy of popular science is the idea of how public debate can affect public opinion. A relevant and highly public example of this is [[climate change]]. A science communication study appearing in the New York Times proves that "even a fractious minority wields enough power to skew a reader’s perception of a [science news] story” and that even “firmly worded (but not uncivil) disagreements between commenters affected readers’ perception of science.”&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Lynda |title=The Double-Edged Sword of Popularization |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1075547015581928 |website=Science Communication |publisher=SAGE Journals |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes some to worry that the popularizing of science in the public, questioning whether the further popularization of science will cause pressure towards generalization or sensationalism. Unfortunately, this question will fall to time for an answer.&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Lynda |title=The Double-Edged Sword of Popularization |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1075547015581928 |website=Science Communication |publisher=SAGE Journals |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As his commencement address to [[Caltech]] students, journalist [[Robert Krulwich]] delivered a speech entitled "Tell me a story". Krulwich says that scientists are actually given many opportunities to explain something interesting about science or their work, and that they must seize such opportunities. He says scientists must resist shunning the public, as [[Sir Isaac Newton]] did in his writing, and instead embrace metaphors the way [[Galileo]] did; Krulwich suggests that metaphors only become more important as the science gets more difficult to understand. He adds that telling stories of science in practice, of scientists' success stories and struggles, helps convey that scientists are real people. Finally, Krulwich advocates for the importance of scientific values in general, and helping the public to understand that scientific views are not mere opinions, but hard-won knowledge.&lt;ref name=Krulwich/&gt;

Actor [[Alan Alda]] helps scientists and PhD students get more comfortable with communication with the help of [[drama]] coaches (they use the acting techniques of [[Viola Spolin]]).&lt;ref name=Viola&gt;Grushkin, Daniel (5 August 2010). [http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/57611/ "Try acting like a scientist"] [http://the-scientist.com/ The Scientist Magazine]. Accessed May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew Nisbet describes the use of [[Opinion leadership|opinion leaders]] as intermediaries between scientists and the public as a way to reach the public via trained individuals who are more closely engaged with their communities, such as "teachers, business leaders, attorneys, policymakers, neighborhood leaders, students, and media professionals." Examples of initiatives that take this approach include Science &amp; Engineering Ambassadors, sponsored by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], and Science Booster Clubs, coordinated by the [[National Center for Science Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=Ambassadors for Science: Harnessing the Power of Opinion-Leaders across Communities |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=30-31 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/ambassadors_for_science |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imagining science's publics===
In the preface of ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote: "Three imaginary readers looked over my shoulder while I was writing, and I now dedicate the book to them. [...] First the general reader, the layman [...] second the expert [and] third the student".

[[File:Science &amp; Technology Fair 2011 - Kolkata 2011-02-09 0921.JPG|thumb|Students explain science projects to visitors. Susanna Hornig promotes the message that anyone can meaningfully engage with science, even without going as deeply into it as the researchers themselves do.&lt;ref name=Priest/&gt;]]

Many criticisms of the [[public understanding of science]] movement have emphasized that this thing they were calling the public was somewhat of an (unhelpful) black box. Approaches to the public changed with the move away from the public understanding of science. Science communication researchers and practitioners now often showcase their desire to listen to non-scientists as well as acknowledging an awareness of the fluid and complex nature of (post/late) modern social identities.&lt;ref&gt;for example, see Irwin, Alan &amp; Michael, Mike (2003) Science, Social Theory and Public Knowledge (Maidenhead &amp; Philadelphia: Open University Press). chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; At the very least, people will use plurals: [[publics]] or audiences. As the editor of [[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]] put it in a special issue on publics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have clearly moved from the old days of the deficit frame and thinking of publics as monolithic to viewing publics as active, knowledgeable, playing multiple roles, receiving as well as shaping science. (Einsiedel, 2007: 5)&lt;ref&gt;Einsiedel, Edna (2005) ‘Editorial: Of Publics and Science’, Public Understanding of Science, vol. 16(1): 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Einsiedel goes on to suggest both views of the public are "monolithic" in their own way; they both choose to declare what something called the public is. [[Public understanding of science]] might have ridiculed publics for their ignorance, but an alternative "public engagement with science and technology" romanticizes its publics for their participatory instincts, intrinsic morality or simple collective wisdom. As Susanna Hornig Priest (2009)&lt;ref name=Priest&gt;Priest, Susanna Hornig (2009) ‘Reinterpreting the audiences for media messages about science’, in Richard Holliman et al (eds) Investigating Science Communication in the Information Age: Implications for Public Engagement and Popular Media (Oxford: Oxford University Press) 223-236.&lt;/ref&gt; concludes in her recent introduction essay on science’s contemporary audiences, the job of science communication might be to help non-scientists feel they are not excluded as opposed to always included; that they can join in if they want, rather than that there is a necessity to spend their lives engaging.

The process of quantifiably surveying public opinion of science is now largely associated with the [[public understanding of science]] movement (some would say unfairly&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bauer, Nick Allum and Steve Miller, "What can we learn from 25 years of PUS survey research? Liberating and expanding the agenda", ''[[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]]'', volume 16, 2007, pages 79-95.&lt;/ref&gt;). In the US, Jon Miller is the name most associated with such work and well known for differentiating between identifiable ‘attentive’ or ‘interested’ publics (that is to say science fans) and those who do not care much about science and technology. Miller’s work questioned whether the American public had the following four attributes of scientific literacy:
* knowledge of basic textbook scientific factual knowledge
* an understanding of scientific method
* appreciated the positive outcomes of science and technology
* rejected superstitious beliefs, such as astrology or numerology&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bauer, Nick Allum and Steve Miller, "What can we learn from 25 years of PUS survey research? Liberating and expanding the agenda", ''[[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]]'', volume 16, 2007, pages 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some respects, John Durant’s work surveying British public&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Durant, John, GA Evans &amp; GP Thomas (1989) ‘The Public Understanding of Science’, Nature 340: 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt; applied similar ideas to Miller. However, they were slightly more concerned with attitudes to science and technology, rather than just how much knowledge people had. They also looked at public confidence in their knowledge, considering issues such as the gender of those ticking "don’t know" boxes. We can see aspects of this approach, as well as a more "public engagement with science and technology" influenced one, reflected within the [[Eurobarometer]] studies of public opinion. These have been running since 1973 to monitor public opinion in the member states, with the aim of helping the preparation of policy (and evaluation of policy). They look at a host of topics, not just science and technology but also defence, the [[euro]], enlargement of the European Union, and culture. Eurobarometer’s recent study of Europeans’ Attitudes to Climate Change&lt;ref&gt;(September 2008.) [http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_300_full_en.pdf "Europeans’ attitudes towards climate change."] European Parliament and European Commission (accessed in May 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; is a good example. It focuses on respondents’ "subjective level of information"; asking "personally, do you think that you are well informed or not about…?" rather than checking what people knew.

===Frame analysis===
Science communication can be analysed through [[frame analysis]], a research method used to analyse how people understand situations and activities.

Some features of this analysis are listed below.
* '''Public accountability''': placing a blame on public actions for value, e.g. political gain in the climate change debate
* '''Runaway technology''': creating a certain view of technological advancements, e.g. photos of an exploded nuclear power plant
* '''Scientific uncertainty''': questioning the reliability of a scientific theory, e.g. arguing how bad global climate change can be if humans are still alive&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Nisbet, Matthew C. (2009). Communicating Climate Change: Why Frames Matter for Public Engagement. Environment (Online at http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/March-April%202009/Nisbet-full.html, retrieved 20 October 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heuristics ===
People make an enormous number of decisions every day, and to approach all of them in a careful, methodical manner is impractical. They therefore often use mental shortcuts known as "[[heuristic]]s" to quickly arrive at acceptable inferences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Fiske, S. T., &amp; Taylor, S. E. (1991). ''Social Cognition'' (2nd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amos Tversky|Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]] originally proposed three heuristics, listed below, although there are many others that have been discussed in later research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|date=27 September 1974|title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/185/4157/1124|journal=Science|volume=185|issue=4157|pages=1124–1131|doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17835457}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Representativeness heuristic|'''Representativeness''']]: used to make assumptions about probability based on relevancy, e.g. how likely item A is to be a member of category B (is Kim a chef?), or that event C resulted from process D (could the sequence of coin tosses H-H-T-T have occurred randomly?).
* [[Availability heuristic|'''Availability''']]: used to estimate how frequent or likely an event is based on how quickly one can conjure examples of the event. For example, if one were asked to approximate the number of people in your age group that are currently in college, your judgment would be affected by how many of your own acquaintances are in college.
* [[Anchoring|'''Anchoring and adjustment''']]: used when making judgments with uncertainties. One will start with an anchoring point, then adjust it to reach an assumption. For example, if you are asked to estimate how many people will take Dr. Smith's biology class this spring, you may recall that 38 students took the class in the fall, and adjust your estimation based on whether the class is more popular in the spring or in the fall.
The most effective science communication efforts take into account the role that heuristics play in everyday decision-making. Many outreach initiatives focus solely on increasing the public's knowledge, but studies (e.g. Brossard et al. 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brossard|first=Dominique|last2=Lewenstein|first2=Bruce|last3=Bonney|first3=Rick|date=1 January 2005|title=Scientific knowledge and attitude change: The impact of a citizen science project|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500690500069483|journal=International Journal of Science Education|volume=27|issue=9|pages=1099–1121|doi=10.1080/09500690500069483|issn=0950-0693}}&lt;/ref&gt; have found that there is little – if any – correlation between knowledge levels and attitudes towards scientific issues.&lt;ref&gt;Scheufele, D. A. (2006). Messages and heuristics: How audiences form attitudes about emerging technologies. In J. Turney (Ed.), Engaging science: Thoughts, deeds, analysis and action (pp. 20-25). London: The Wellcome Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Simulation ====
{{Main|Simulation heuristic}}

The simulation heuristic is used to judge how likely certain outcomes are based on the ease with which one can imagine a particular ending.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This heuristic can be used for many tasks, including prediction (Will the Jets win this football game?) and causality (Did Jim eat the last slice of pizza?). An application of this heuristic is to the case of near misses. Consider the following example from Kahneman &amp; Tversky:&lt;ref&gt;Kahneman, D. &amp; Tversky, A. (1981). ''The simulation heuristic''. (Report No. 5). Retrieved from http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA099504&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Crane and Mr. Tees were scheduled to leave the airport on different flights, at the same time. They traveled from town in the same limousine, were caught in a traffic jam, and arrived at the airport thirty minutes after the scheduled departure time of their flights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Crane is told his flight left on time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Tees is told that his flight was delayed, and just left five minutes ago.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Who is more upset?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Crane or Mr. Tees?&lt;/blockquote&gt;Almost everyone says, "Mr. Tees", because they cannot imagine how Mr. Crane could have caught his flight, while Mr. Tees might have made it if not for that slow pedestrian, or the exceptionally long security line. The simulation heuristic has this ability to generate "if only" conditions, which can be used to understand the negative feelings of frustration, indignation, etc. that arise from near misses such as that of Mr. Tees.

This simulation of how events ''might'' have occurred is referred to as [[counterfactual thinking]], and can be used to try to identify a unique or unusual circumstance that lead to a dramatic outcome. For example, consider a man who is shot during a robbery while shopping at a convenience store. Subjects will award more damages to a man who was shopping at a store far from his house than they will to a man who was shopping at a store near his home that he commonly visits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Regarding simulations of future events, simply imagining hypothetical events makes them seem more likely to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sparks|first=Paul|last2=Harris|first2=Peter R.|last3=Raats|first3=Monique|date=1 April 2003|title=Imagining and Explaining Hypothetical Scenarios: Mediational Effects on the Subjective Likelihood of Health-Related Outcomes1|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2003.tb01929.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|volume=33|issue=4|pages=869–887|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2003.tb01929.x|issn=1559-1816}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gregory|first=W.

== Science in popular culture and the media ==

[[File:Light_bulb_Edison_2.jpg|thumb|This diagram, designed by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1880, is intended to depict the workings of a [[Electric light|light bulb]].|alt=The diagram, designed by Thomas Edison in 1880, is intended to depict the workings of a light bulb.]]

=== Birth of public science ===
While scientific study began to emerge as a popular discourse following the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], science was not widely funded or exposed to the public until the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/who_pays|title=Who pays for science?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.berkeley.edu|publisher=Berkeley University|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most science prior to this was funded by individuals under private [[patronage]] and was studied in exclusive groups, like the [[Royal Society]]. [[Public science]] emerged due to a gradual [[Marxism|social change]], resulting from the rise of the middle class in the nineteenth century. As scientific inventions, like the [[conveyor belt]] and the [[steam locomotive]] entered and enhanced the lifestyle of people in the nineteenth century, scientific inventions began to be widely funded by [[University|universities]] and other public institutions in an effort to increase scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science.html|title=Science Technology Timeline|last=|first=|date=2002|website=www.victorianweb.org|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since scientific achievements were beneficial to society, the pursuit of scientific knowledge resulted in science as a [[profession]]. Scientific institutions, like the [[National Academy of Sciences]] or the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] are examples of leading platforms for the public discussion of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/baas.htm|title=BAAS|last=|first=|date=2002|website=www.victorianweb.org|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Brewster]], founder of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, believed in regulated publications in order to effectively communicate their discoveries, "so that scientific students may know where to begin their labours."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/history|title=British Science Association History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.britishscienceassociation.org|publisher=British Science Association|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the communication of science reached a wider audience, due to the [[professionalization]] of science and its introduction to the [[public sphere]], the interest in the subject increased.

=== Scientific media in the 19th century ===
There was a change in media production in the nineteenth century. The invention of the [[Steam engine|steam-powered]] [[printing press]] enabled more pages to be printed per hour, which resulted in cheaper texts. Book prices gradually dropped, which gave the [[working class]]es the ability to purchase them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/religion/fyfe.html#audience|title=A Review of Aileen Fyfe's Science and Salvation: Evangelical Popular Science Publishing in Victorian Britain|last=Landow|first=George P.|date=25 May 2005|website=www.victorianweb.org|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; No longer reserved for the elite, affordable and informative texts were made available to a mass audience. Historian Aileen Fyfe noted that, as the nineteenth century experienced a set of [[:Category:19th-century reform movements|social reforms]] that sought to improve the lives of those in the working classes, the availability of public knowledge was valuable for intellectual growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/sci_publishing.html|title=Science Publishing|last=Fyfe|first=Aileen|date=|website=www.victorianweb.org|publisher=National University of Ireland|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there were reform efforts to further the knowledge of the less educated. The [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]], led by [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]], attempted to organize a system for widespread literacy for all classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/theme/59807?backToResults=%2Fsearch%2Frefine%2F%3FdocStart=1%26themesTabShow=true|title=Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (act. 1826–1846)|last=Ashton|first=Rosemary|date=|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, weekly [[Periodical literature|periodicals]], like the ''[[Penny Magazine]]'', were aimed to educate the general public on scientific achievements in a comprehensive manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ThePennyMagazineOfTheSocietyForTheDiffusionOfUsefulKnowledge|title=The Penny Magazine of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|last=Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|first=|date=2012|website=archive.org|publisher=archive.org|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Koenig's steam press - 1814.png|left|thumb|[[Friedrich Koenig|Fredrich Koenig]]'s stream powered [[printing press]], 1814.]]
As the audience for scientific texts expanded, the interest in public science did as well. 'Extension lectures' were installed in some universities, like [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]], which encouraged members of the public to attend lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/history/nineteenth-and-twentieth-centuries|title=About the University: Nineteenth and twentieth centuries|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Cambridge|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In America, travelling lectures were a common occurrence in the nineteenth century and attracted hundreds of viewers. These [[public lecture]]s were a part of the [[lyceum movement]] and demonstrated basic [[Experiment|scientific experiments]], which advanced scientific knowledge for both the educated and uneducated viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dh.dickinson.edu/digitalmuseum/exhibit-artifact/making-the-invisible-visible/showing-scientific-lecturing-19th-century|title=Showing off: Scientific Lecturing in the 19th century|last=|first=|date=|website=The Dickinsonia History Project|publisher=Dickinson College|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did the popularization of [[public science]] enlighten the general public through [[mass media]], but it also enhanced communication within the [[scientific community]]. Although scientists had been communicating their discoveries and achievements through print for centuries, publications with a variety of subjects decreased in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/sci_publishing.html|title=Science Publishing|last=Fyfe|first=Aileen|date=|website=|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, publications in discipline-specific journals were crucial for a successful career in the sciences in the nineteenth century. As a result, [[scientific journal]]s such as [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] or [[National Geographic (magazine)|''National Geographic'']] possessed a large readership and received substantial funding by the end of the nineteenth century as the popularization of science continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making "Nature": The History of a Scientific Journal|last=Brown|first=Melinda|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0226261454|location=Chicago, USA|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communication of science in contemporary media ===
Science can be communicated to the public in many different ways. According to Karen Bultitude, a science communication lecturer at [[University College London]], these can be broadly categorised into three groups: traditional journalism, live or face-to-face events, and online interaction.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/staff/bultitude/KB_TB/Karen_Bultitude_-_Science_Communication_Why_and_How.pdf|title=The Why and How of Science Communication|last=Bultitude|first=Karen|date=2011|website=|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813110819/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/staff/bultitude/KB_TB/Karen_Bultitude_-_Science_Communication_Why_and_How.pdf|archivedate=13 August 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional [[journalism]] (for example, [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[television]] and [[radio]]) has the advantage of reaching large audiences; in the past, this is way most people regularly accessed information about science.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/sri-pas-2011-main-report.pdf|title=Public Attitudes to Science 2011|last=Ipsos-MORI|first=|date=2011|website=|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721050636/https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/sri-pas-2011-main-report.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional media is also more likely to produce information that is high quality (well written or presented), as it will have been produced by professional journalists. Traditional journalism is often also responsible for setting agendas and having an impact on government [[policy]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The traditional journalistic method of communication is one-way, so there can be no dialogue with the public, and science stories can often be reduced in scope so that there is a limited focus for a mainstream audience, who may not be able to comprehend the bigger picture from a scientific perspective.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; However, there is new research now available on the role of newspapers and television channels in constituting 'scientific public spheres' which enable participation of a wide range of actors in public deliberations.&lt;ref&gt;Shiju Sam Varughese.2017. ''Contested Knowledge: Science, Media, and Democracy in Kerala''. Oxford University Press, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another disadvantage of traditional journalism is that, once a science story is taken up by mainstream media, the scientist(s) involved no longer has any direct control over how his or her work is communicated, which may lead to misunderstanding or misinformation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCartney|first=Margaret|date=25 January 2016|title=Margaret McCartney: Who gains from the media’s misrepresentation of science?|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i355|journal=BMJ|volume=352|pages=i355|doi=10.1136/bmj.i355|issn=1756-1833|pmid=26810502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this area demonstrates how the relationship between journalists and scientists has been strained in some instances.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dudo|first=Anthony|date=1 September 2015|title=Scientists, the Media, and the Public Communication of Science|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/soc4.12298|journal=Sociology Compass|volume=9|issue=9|pages=761–775|doi=10.1111/soc4.12298|issn=1751-9020}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand scientists have reported being frustrated with things like journalists oversimplifying or dramatizing of their work, while on the other hand journalists find scientists difficult to work with and ill-equipped to communicate their work to a general audience.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/962750268|title=The Oxford handbook of the science of science communication|others=Jamieson, Kathleen Hall,, Kahan, Dan M.,, Scheufele, Dietram,|isbn=9780190497620|location=New York, NY, United States of America|oclc=962750268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Despite this potential tension, a comparison of scientists from several countries has shown that many scientists are pleased with their media interactions and engage often.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Hans Peter|last2=Brossard|first2=Dominique|last3=Cheveigné|first3=Suzanne de|last4=Dunwoody|first4=Sharon|last5=Kallfass|first5=Monika|last6=Miller|first6=Steve|last7=Tsuchida|first7=Shoji|date=11 July 2008|title=Interactions with the Mass Media|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5886/204|journal=Science|volume=321|issue=5886|pages=204–205|doi=10.1126/science.1157780|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18625578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is important to note the use of traditional media sources, like [[newspaper]]s and [[television]], has steadily declined as primary sources for science information, while the internet has rapidly increased in prominence.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsb20181/|title=S&amp;E Indicators 2018 {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, over half of Americans (55 percent) reported using the internet as their primary source to learn about science and technology, compared to 24 percent reporting TV and 4 percent reporting newspapers were their primary sources.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Additionally, traditional media outlets have dramatically decreased the number of, or in some cases eliminated, science journalists and the amount of science-related content they publish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23674|title=Communicating Science Effectively: A Research Agenda|last=Agenda|first=Committee on the Science of Science Communication: A Research|last2=Education|first2=Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and|last3=Sciences|first3=National Academies of|last4=Engineering|last5=Medicine|first5=and|date=13 December 2016|isbn=9780309451024|doi=10.17226/23674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second category is live or face-to-face events, such as public lectures (for example, [http://events.ucl.ac.uk/calendar/tab:lunch_hour_lectures/ UCL's public lunch hour lectures] – [[museum]]s, [[debate]]s, [http://www.sciencemadesimple.co.uk/shows/busking science busking], [http://www.sciartcenter.org/ sci-art], [http://www.sciencecafes.org/ science cafes] and [[science festival]]s. [[Citizen science|Citizen Science]] or crowd-sourced science (scientific research conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur or nonprofessional scientists), which can be done with a face-to-face approach, online, or as a combination of the two to engage in science communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research has shown that members of the public seek out science information that is entertaining, but also helping citizens to critically participate in risk regulation and S&amp;T governance.&lt;ref&gt;Shiju Sam Varughese. 2017. ''Contested Knowledge: Science, Media, and Democracy in Kerala''. Oxford University Press, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore it is important to bear this aspect in mind when communicating scientific information to the public (for example, through events combining science communication and comedy, such as [http://festivalofthespokennerd.com/ Festival of the Spoken Nerd] or during scientific controversies).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The advantages of this approach are that it is more personal and allows scientists to interact with the public, allowing for two-way dialogue. Scientists are also better able to control content using this method. Disadvantages of this method include the limited reach, it can also be resource-intensive and costly and also, it may be that only audiences with an existing interest in science will be attracted.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The third category is online interaction, for example, [[website]]s, [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s and [[podcast]]s can also be used for science communication, as can other [[social media]]. Online methods of communicating science have the potential to reach huge audiences, can allow direct interaction between scientists and the public,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Könneker|first=Carsten|last2=Lugger|first2=Beatrice |date=4 October 2013|title= Public Science 2.0 – Back to the Future |url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/49 |journal=Science|volume=342|issue= 6154|pages=49–50|doi= 10.1126/science.1245848|issn=0036-8075|pmid=24092719}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the content is always accessible and can be somewhat controlled by the scientist. Additionally, online communication of science can help boost scientists' reputation through increased citations, better circulation of articles, and establishing new collaborations.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Online communication also allows for both one-way and two-way communication, depending on the audience’s and the author's preferences. However, there are disadvantages in that it is difficult to control how content is picked up by others, and regular attention and updating is needed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

When considering whether or not to engage in science communication online, scientists should review what science communication research has shown to be the potential positive and negative outcomes. Online communication has given rise to movements like [[open science]], which advocates for making science more accessible. However, when engaging in communication about science online, scientists should consider not publicizing or reporting findings from their research until it has been peer-reviewed and published, as journals may not accept the work after it has been circulated under the "[[Ingelfinger rule]]".

Other considerations revolve around how scientsts will be perceived by other scientists for engaging in communication. For example, some scholars have criticized engaged, popular scholars using concepts like the [[Sagan effect]] or [[Kardashian Index]]. Despite these criticisms, many scientists are taking to communicating their work on online platforms, a sign of potentially changing norms in the field.[https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/40992/title/Science-Gone-Social/]

=== The effects of Twitter and other social media on scientific communication ===
By using [[Twitter]], researchers and academics can discuss and communicate scientific topics with many types of audiences based on various points of view.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-media-in-science_us_57c8fbcde4b07addc411f6ec|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608005909/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-media-in-science_us_57c8fbcde4b07addc411f6ec|dead-url=no|archivedate=8 June 2018|title=Social Media in Science|last=Ramasubbu|first=Suren|date=12 September 2016|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies indicate that the use of Twitter can positively impact the number of times a scientific article is cited. These studies show that articles that are highly tweeted about are eleven times more likely to be highly cited than those that who few people tweeted.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/haydnshaughnessy/2012/01/15/how-could-twitter-influence-science-and-why-scientists-are-on-board/#778c777718be.|title=How Could Twitter Influence Science (And Why Scientists Are on Board)|last=Shaughnessy|first=Haydn|date=17 January 2012|website=Forbes|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted in studies by [[Gunther Eysenbach]], research has shed light on how Twitter has a direct link to the advances in the science community.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Alison Burt, Editor in chief of Elsevier Connect and author of the article ''How to use social media for science,'' states the potential drawbacks to sharing their research on Twitter.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/connect/how-to-use-social-media-for-science|title=How to use social media for science - 3 views|last=Burt|first=Alison|date=|website=Elsevier|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kimberly Collins of [[PLOS]] explains reasons how some scientists are hesitant to join Twitter.&lt;ref name=collins&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Kimberley|last2=Shiffman|first2=David|last3=Rock|first3=Jenny|date=12 October 2016|title=How Are Scientists Using Social Media in the Workplace?|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162680|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=10|pages=e0162680|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0162680|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists are hesitant to use social media outlets such as Twitter due to lack of knowledge of the platform, and inexperience with how to make meaningful posts.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; Some scientists do not see the meaning in using Twitter as a platform to share their research or have the time to add the information into the accounts themselves.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt;

Scientists also believe that Twitter is not professional enough for them to put out information as well as receive relevant suggestions and comments back.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Scientists did give a positive to using Twitter by (28%) of the scientists who participated in the study said communicating science on Twitter can benefit because of the size and diverse audience it reaches.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; BoingBoing science editor and [[The New York Times|New York Times]] columnist [[Maggie Koerth-Baker]] commented on the importance of keeping public and private personas on social media separate in order to maintain professionalism online.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; According to these findings, posting academic research on a personal social media accounts could potentially send mixed messages to Twitter users.

There have been occasions where scientific outreach on Twitter has been met with positive results. In September 2017, an 8 year old bug lover was teased at her school for her passion for bugs.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/an-8-year-old-bullied-for-her-love-of-bugs-just-got-her-first-scientific-publication|title=An 8-Year-Old Bullied For Her Love of Bugs Just Got Her First Scientific Publication|last=Dean|first=Signe|work=ScienceAlert|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the [[Entomological Society of Canada|Entomological society of Canada]] posting a tweet defending her love for bugs called #BugsR4Girls.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The ESC’s use of twitter was able to make a statement saying, "A young girl who loves insects is being bullied &amp; needs our support. DM your email &amp; we'll connect you! #BugsR4Girls".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In 2017, a study done by the [[Pew Research Center]] of Journalism and Media found that "About a quarter of social media users follow science related pages and accounts.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalism.org/2017/09/20/science-news-and-information-today/|title=Science News and Information Today|date=2017-09-20|work=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project|accessdate=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group places both more importance and comparatively more trust on science news that comes to them through social media".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Karen Peterson, director of Scientific Career Development at [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center|Fred Hutchinson Cancer research Center]] stresses the "importance of using social networks such as [[Facebook]] and Twitter to engage in intercommunication" for establishing an online presence as well.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/features/2014/02/scientists-guide-social-media|title=A scientist's guide to social media|date=14 November 2017|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online presence is necessary for career development. No matter your personality type, career advisors recommend that postdocs use online networking tools to make connections, exchange scientific ideas, and advance a career.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

According to [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], "more than 3,000 scientists and engineers told Nature about their awareness of various giant social media networks and research-profiling sites".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Elena Milani created the SciHashtag project which is a condensed collection of Twitter hashtags regarding science communication and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sagepus.blogspot.com/2016/10/scihashtag-twitter-hashtag-science.html|title=SciHashtag: Twitter hashtags for scientists|last=Underst|first=Public|last2=Science|first2=ing of|website=Public Understanding of Science Blog|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter has become a part of researchers’ lives.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== The public understanding of science movement ==
The [[public understanding of science]], public awareness of science and public engagement with science and technology are all terms coined with a movement involving governments and societies in the late 20th century. During the late 19th century, science became a professional subject and influenced by governmental suggestions. Prior to this, public understanding of science was very low on the agenda. However, some well-known figures such as [[Michael Faraday]] ran lectures aimed at the non-expert public, his being the famous [[Christmas Lectures]] which began in 1825. The 20th century saw groups founded on the basis they could position science in a broader cultural context and allow scientists to communicate their knowledge in a way that could reach and be understood by the general public. In the UK, ''The Bodmer Report'' (or ''The Public Understanding of Science'' as it is more formally known) published in 1985 by [[The Royal Society]] changed the way scientists communicated their work to the public. The report was designed to "review the nature and extent of the public understanding of science in the United Kingdom and its adequacy for an advanced democracy.".&lt;ref name=gregory2000&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science in Public|last=Gregory|first=Jane|last2=Miller|first2=Steven|publisher=Ingram Digital|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=5–7|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaired by the geneticist Sir Walter Bodmer alongside famous scientists such as broadcaster [[Sir David Attenborough]], the report was evidenced by all of the major sectors concerned; [[scientists]], [[politicians]], [[journalists]] and [[industrialists]] but not the [[Public|general public]].&lt;ref name=gregory2000/&gt; One of the main assumptions drawn from the report was everybody should have some grasp of science and this should be introduced from a young age by teachers who are suitably qualified in the subject area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Short|first=Daniel|year=2013|title=The public understanding of science: 30 years of the Bodmer Report|journal=The School Science Review|volume=95|pages=39–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also asked for further [[media coverage]] of science including via [[newspapers]] and [[television]] which has ultimately led to the establishment of platforms such as the [[Vega Science Trust]].

In both the UK and the [[United States]] following the [[second world war]], public views of scientists swayed from great praise to resentment. Therefore, the Bodmer Report highlighted concerns from the scientific community that their withdrawal from society was causing [[scientific research]] funding to be weak.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/sri-pas-2011-main-report.pdf|title=Public Attitudes to Science 2011|last=Ipsos-MORI|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721050636/https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/sri-pas-2011-main-report.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bodmer promoted the communication of science to a wider more general public by expressing to British scientists that it was their responsibility to publicise their research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An upshot of the publication of the report was the creation of the [[Committee on the Public Understanding of Science]] (COPUS), a collaboration between the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal Institution]]. The engagement between these individual societies caused the necessity for a public understanding of science movement to be taken seriously. COPUS also awarded grants for specific outreach activities allowing the public understanding to come to the fore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodmer|first=Walter|date=20 September 2010|title=Public Understanding of Science: The BA, the Royal Society and COPUS|url=http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/64/Suppl_1/S151|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society|volume=64|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S151–S161|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2010.0035|issn=0035-9149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately leading to a cultural shift in the way scientists publicised their work to the wider non-expert community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3805.htm#n26|title=Science and Technology; Third Review|last=|first=|date=|website=parliament.uk|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although COPUS no longer exists within the UK the name has been adopted in the US by the [[Coalition on the Public Understanding of Science|Coalition for the Public Understanding of Science]]. An organisation which is funded by the [[US National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[National Science Foundation]] and focuses on popular science projects such as science cafes, festivals, magazines and [[citizen science]] schemes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20948">'''Scientific literacy''' or '''Science literacy''' encompasses [[scientific writing|written]], [[mathematics|numerical]], and [[information technology|digital]] [[literacy]]  as they pertain to understanding [[science]], its [[scientific method|methodology]], [[observation]]s, and [[scientific theory|theories]].

== Definition ==

The OECD PISA Framework (2015) defines scientific literacy as "the ability to engage with science-related issues, and with the ideas of science, as a reflective citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.oecd.org/callsfortenders/Annex%20IA_%20PISA%202015%20Science%20Framework%20.pdf |title=PISA 2015 Science Framework |date=March 2013 |publisher=OECD |accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scientifically literate person, therefore, is willing to engage in reasoned discourse about science 
and technology which requires the competencies to:
* Explain phenomena scientifically &amp;ndash; recognize, offer and evaluate explanations for a range of natural and technological phenomena.
* Evaluate and design scientific inquiry &amp;ndash; describe and appraise scientific investigations and propose ways of addressing questions scientifically.
* Interpret data and evidence scientifically &amp;ndash; analyze and evaluate data, claims and arguments in a variety of representations and draw appropriate scientific conclusions.

According to the United States National Center for Education Statistics, "scientific literacy is the knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts and processes required for personal decision making, participation in civic and cultural affairs, and economic productivity".&lt;ref name=NCES&gt;{{harvnb|NAS|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scientifically literate person is defined as one who has the capacity to:

* Understand, [[experiment]], and [[reason]] as well as interpret scientific facts and their meaning.
* Ask, find, or determine answers to questions derived from curiosity about everyday experiences.
* Describe, explain, and predict [[natural phenomena]].
* Read articles with understanding of science in the [[popular press]] and engage in social conversation about the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the conclusions.
* Identify scientific issues underlying national and local decisions and express positions that are scientifically and technologically informed.
* Evaluate the quality of scientific information on the basis of its source and the methods used to generate it.
* Pose and evaluate [[arguments]] based on evidence and to apply conclusions from such arguments appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NAS|1996|loc=page 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scientific literacy may also be defined in language similar to the definitions of [[ocean literacy]],&lt;ref name = OL&gt;{{harvnb|OLN|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Earth science literacy]]&lt;ref name=ESL&gt;{{harvnb|ESLI|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Climate Literacy]].&lt;ref name=CL&gt;{{harvnb|CLN|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus a scientifically literate person can:
* Understand the science relevant to environmental and social issues.
* Communicate clearly about the science.
* Make informed decisions about these issues.

Finally, scientific literacy may involve particular attitudes toward learning and using science. A scientifically-literate citizen is capable of researching matters of fact for him or herself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYHQcXVp4F4 Noam Chomsky on what it means to be educated]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Reforms in [[science education]] in the United States have often been driven by strategic challenges such as the launch of the [[Sputnik program|Sputnik satellite]] in 1957 and the [[Japanese economic miracle|Japanese economic boom]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rutherford|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, scientific literacy is now taken to mean that everyone should have a working knowledge of science and its role in society. Science literacy is seen as a right of every person and a requirement for [[Citizenship|responsible members of society]], one that helps average people to make better decisions and enrich their lives. The shift occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the publication of ''Science for All Americans''&lt;ref name=Rutherford1991&gt;{{harvnb|Rutherford |Ahlgren |1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Benchmarks for Science Literacy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | American Association for the Advancement of Science |1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial definitions of science literacy included elaborations of the actual content that people should understand, and this content often followed somewhat traditional lines ([[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]]). [[Earth science]] was somewhat narrowly defined as expanded geological processes. In the decade after those initial documents, ocean scientists and educators revised the notion of science literacy to include more contemporary, systems-oriented views of the natural world, leading to scientific literacy programs for the [[ocean]], [[climate]], [[earth science]], and so on. This shift has ensured that educators' views of science literacy stay in sync with the directions and advances of real science in the real world.

==Science, society, and the environment ==
The interdependence of humans and our natural environment is at the heart of scientific literacy in the Earth systems. As defined by nationwide consensus among scientists and educators, this literacy has two key parts. First, a literate person is defined, in language that echoes the above definition of scientific literacy. Second, a set of concepts are listed, organized into six to nine big ideas or essential principles. This defining process was undertaken first for [[ocean literacy]],&lt;ref name = OL&gt;{{harvnb|OLN|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; then for the [[Great Lakes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OSGCP|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estuary|estuaries]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NOAA|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[atmosphere]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UCAR|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and climate.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;{{harvnb|CLN|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Earth science literacy]]&lt;ref name=ESL&gt;{{harvnb|ESLI|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the types of literacy defined for Earth systems; the qualities of an Earth science literate person are representative of the qualities for all the Earth system literacy definitions.

According to the Earth Science Literacy Initiative, an Earth-science-literate person:
* understands the fundamental concepts of Earth’s many systems
* knows how to find and assess scientifically credible information about Earth
* communicates about Earth science in a meaningful way
* is able to make informed and responsible decisions regarding Earth and its resources&lt;ref name=ESL/&gt;

All types of literacy in Earth systems have a definition like the above. Ocean literacy is further defined as "understanding our impact on the ocean and the ocean's impact on us".&lt;ref name=OL/&gt;
Similarly, the climate literacy website includes a guiding principle for decision making; "humans can take action to reduce climate change and its impacts".&lt;ref name=CL/&gt; Each type of Earth systems literacy then defines the concepts students should understand upon graduation from high school. Current educational efforts in Earth systems literacy tend to focus more on the scientific concepts than on the decision-making aspect of literacy, but environmental action remains as a stated goal.

The theme of science in a socially-relevant context appears in many discussions of scientific literacy. Ideas that turn up in the life sciences include an allusion to [[ecological literacy]], the "well-being of earth". Robin Wright, a writer for ''Cell Biology Education'', laments "will [undergraduates'] misunderstandings or lack of knowledge about science imperil our democratic way of life and national security?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A discussion of physics literacy includes [[energy conservation]], [[ozone depletion]] and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobson|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The mission statement of the Chemistry Literacy Project &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CLP|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes environmental and social justice.
Technological literacy is defined in a three-dimensional coordinate space; on the knowledge axis, it is noted that technology can be risky, and that it "reflects the values and culture of society".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gamire|Pearson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Energy Literacy boasts several websites, including one associated with climate literacy&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;
and two advocacy organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ELA|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ELP|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes as part of scientific literacy==
Attitudes about science can have a significant effect on scientific literacy. In [[education theory]], understanding of content lies in the cognitive domain, while attitudes lie in the affective domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Engelhart|Furst|Hill|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, negative attitudes, such as fear of science, can act as an [[affective filter]] and an impediment to comprehension and future learning goals. Studies of college students' attitudes about learning physics suggest that these attitudes may be divided into categories of real world connections, personal connections, conceptual connections, student effort and problem-solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Perkins|Podolefsky|Dubson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision-making aspect of science literacy suggests further attitudes about the state of the world, one's responsibility for its well-being and one's sense of empowerment to make a difference. These attitudes may be important measures of science literacy, as described in the case of [[ocean literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cudaback|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promoting and measuring==
Proponents of scientific literacy tend to focus on what is learned by the time a student graduates from high school. Science literacy has always been an important element of the standards movement in education. All science literacy documents have been drafted with the explicit intent of influencing educational standards, as a means to drive curriculum, teaching, assessment, and ultimately, learning nationwide.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Programs to promote scientific literacy among students abound, including several programs sponsored by technology companies, as well as quiz bowls and science fairs. A partial list of such programs includes the [[Global Challenge Award]], the [[National Ocean Sciences Bowl]] and Action Bioscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|AIBS|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations have attempted to compare the scientific literacy of adults in different countries.  The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] found that scientific literacy in the United States is not measurably different from the OECD average.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NCES|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science News reports "The new U.S. rate, based on questionnaires administered in 2008, is seven percentage points behind Sweden, the only European nation to exceed the Americans.  The U.S. figure is slightly higher than that for Denmark, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands. And it’s double the 2005 rate in the United Kingdom (and the collective rate for the European Union)." &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Science News|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University educators are attempting to develop reliable instruments to measure scientific literacy, and the use of [[Concept inventory|concept inventories]] is increasing in the fields of physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klymkowsky|Underwood|Garvin-Doxas|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and earth science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikispaces|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Libarkin|Ward|Andwerson|Kortemeyer|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Ambidextrous Universe''''' is a [[popular science]] book by [[Martin Gardner]], covering aspects of [[symmetry]] and [[asymmetry]] in human culture, science and the wider [[universe]].

Originally published in 1964, it underwent revisions in 1969, 1979, 1990 and 2005 (the last two are known as the "Third, revised edition"). Originally titled '' The Ambidextrous Universe: Mirror Asymmetry and Time-Reversed Worlds'', subsequent editions are known as ''The New Ambidextrous Universe: Symmetry and Asymmetry from Mirror Reflections to Superstrings''.

==Content==
The book begins with the subject of [[mirror reflection]], and from there passes through symmetry in [[geometry]], [[poetry]], [[art]], [[music]], [[galaxy|galaxies]], [[sun]]s, [[planet]]s and [[living organisms]]. It then moves down into the [[molecule|molecular scale]] and looks at how symmetry and asymmetry have evolved from the beginning of life on [[Earth]]. There is a chapter on [[carbon]] and its versatility and on [[chirality]] in [[biochemistry]]. Chapter 18 (and subsequent chapters) deals with a conundrum called the Ozma Problem (see below). The second half of the book concerns various aspects of [[Atomic physics|atomic]] and [[subatomic]] physics and how they relate to mirror asymmetry and the related concepts of chirality, [[antimatter]], [[magnetic polarity|magnetic]] and [[electrical polarity]], [[Parity (physics)|parity]], [[Charge (physics)|charge]] and [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. [[Time invariance]] (and [[T-symmetry|reversal]]) is discussed. Implications for [[particle physics]], [[theoretical physics]] and [[cosmology]] are covered and brought up to date (in later editions of the book) with regard to [[Grand Unified Theory|GUT]]s, [[Theory of everything|TOE]]s, [[superstring theory]] and [[M-theory]].

===The Ozma Problem===
The 18th chapter, "The Ozma Problem", poses a problem that Gardner claims would arise if Earth should ever enter into communication with life on another planet through [[Project Ozma]]. This is the problem of how to communicate the meaning of left and right, where the two communicants are conditionally not allowed to view any one object in common. The problem was first implied in [[Immanuel Kant|Immanuel Kant's]] discussion of left and right, and [[William James]] mentioned it in his chapter on "The Perception of Space" in ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890). It is also mentioned by [[Charles Howard Hinton]]. Gardner follows the thread of several false leads on the road to the solution of the Ozma Problem, in each case presenting an apparent solution which, on closer examination, turns out to be a false one.

The solution to the Ozma Problem was finally embodied in the famous "[[Wu experiment]]", conducted in 1956 by Chinese-American physicist [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] (1912–1997), involving the [[beta decay]] of [[cobalt-60]]. This experiment was the first to disprove the conservation of [[parity (physics)|parity]]. At long last, according to Gardner, it is believed that one could carefully describe the Wu experiment to a distant extraterrestrial intelligence and thereby convey the exact meaning of left/right.

==Literary references==
===W.H. Auden===
[[W. H. Auden]] alludes to ''The Ambidextrous Universe'' in his poem "Josef Weinheber" (1965).

===Vladimir Nabokov===
'''''Pale Fire'''''&lt;br&gt;
In the original 1964 edition of ''The Ambidextrous Universe'', Gardner quoted two lines of poetry from [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s 1962 novel ''[[Pale Fire]]'' which are supposed to have been written by a poet, "[[John Shade]]", who is actually fictional. As a joke, Gardner credited the lines only to Shade and put Shade's name in the index as if he were a real person. In his 1969 novel ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle]]'', Nabokov returned the favor by having the character Van Veen "quote" the Gardner book along with the two lines of verse:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Space is a swarming in the eyes, and Time a singing in the ears," says John Shade, a modern poet, as quoted by an invented philosopher ("Martin Gardiner" {{sic}}) in ''The Ambidextrous Universe'', page 165 {{sic}}.&lt;ref&gt;Nabokov, Vladimir (1969), ''Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle'', [[McGraw-Hill|McGraw-Hill Book Company]], pg 577.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Look at the Harlequins!'''''&lt;br&gt;
Nabokov's 1974 novel ''[[Look at the Harlequins!]]'', about a man who can't distinguish left from right, was heavily influenced by his reading of ''The Ambidextrous Universe''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. Barton (1984), "The Ambidextrous Universe of Nabakov's ''Look at the Harlequins!''"; In: Roth, Phyllis (ed.), ''Critical Essays on Vladimir Nabokov''; G.K. Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayles, N. Katherine (1984), "Ambivalence: Symmetry, Asymmetry, and the Physics of Time Reversal in Nabokov's ''Ada''", in the same author's ''The Cosmic Web: Scientific Field Models and Literary Strategies in the Twentieth Century'', [[Cornell University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Science Network (TSN)''' is a non-profit virtual forum dedicated to science and its impact on society. Initially conceived in 2003 by [[Roger Bingham]] and [[Terry Sejnowski]] as a cable science network,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2003/12/61423?currentPage=1 Wired: Are You Ready for Some Science?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelshermer.com/2003/11/candle-in-the-dark/ Michael Shermer.com, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; TSN would soon become a global digital platform. TSN currently offers free access to over 1100 videos&lt;ref name="search" /&gt; of lectures from scientific meetings and long form one-on-one conversations with prominent scientists and communicators of science, including [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[V.S. Ramachandran]], [[Helen S. Mayberg]], and [[Barbara Landau]], on topics including education, aging, neuroscience, and stem cells.&lt;ref name="search"&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/search?q=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 TSN Search]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its mission, TSN has also sponsored and co-sponsored scientific forums, such as the landmark Symposium and Town Hall meeting, ''Stem cells: science, ethics and politics at the crossroads'', held at the Salk Institute in 2004 &lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/stem-cells-science-ethics-and-politics-at-the-crossroads Stem Cells: Science, Ethics and Politics at the Crossroads]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salk.edu/insidesalk/pdf/InsideSalkNov04.pdf Inside Salk 11 04]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Beyond Belief'' conference series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programgroup/beyond-belief ''Beyond Belief'' conference series]&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Beyond Belief'' Conference Series==

TSN's signature series ''Beyond Belief'' was conceived to bring together a community of scientists, philosophers, scholars from the humanities, and social commentators. Speakers at these meetings have included [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Harry Kroto]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], and [[Stuart Kauffman]]. So far, the following three ''Beyond Belief'' conferences were organized:

===2006: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival===
''[[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival]]'',  the first of The Science Network's annual Beyond Belief symposia, held from November 5 to November 7, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-science-religion-reason-and-survival ''Beyond Belief: Science, Reason, Religion &amp; Survival'']&lt;/ref&gt; was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'', as "a free-for-all on science and religion," which seemed at times like "the founding convention for a political party built on a single plank: in a world dangerously charged with ideology, science needs to take on an evangelical role, vying with religion as teller of the greatest story ever told." According to participant [[Melvin Konner]], however, the event came to resemble a "den of vipers” debating the issue, "Should we bash religion with a crowbar or only with a baseball bat?”&lt;ref name = "nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/21/science/21belief.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/T/Tyson,%20Neil%20DeGrasse&amp;_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all ''A Free-for-All on Science and Religion," George Johnson, New York Times, Section F, Page 1, November 21, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Scientist]] summed up the topics to be discussed as a list of three questions:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225780.142-beyond-belief-in-place-of-god.html Michael Brooks and Helen Phillips, New Scientist, November 20, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Can [[science]] help us create a new rational narrative as poetic and powerful as those that have traditionally sustained societies?
* Can we treat [[religion]] as a natural phenomenon?
* Can we be good without [[God]]? And if not God, then what?

Speakers included physicists [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Lawrence Krauss]], author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], biologist [[Joan Roughgarden]], and astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]].&lt;ref name = "nyt"/&gt;

===2007: Enlightenment 2.0===
''Beyond Belief: Enlightenment 2.0'' was the second annual symposium and was held from 31 October to 2 November 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-enlightenment-2-0 ''Beyond Belief: Enlightenment 2.0'']&lt;/ref&gt;  at the Frederic de Hoffmann Auditorium of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.

===2008: Candles in the Dark===
''Beyond Belief: Candles in the Dark'' was the third annual Beyond Belief symposium. This event was organized by The Science Network and held from 3 October to 6 October 2008 in La Jolla, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-candles-in-the-dark|title=2008 Official Website|work=The Science Network|accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While TTOs are commonplace, many studies have questioned their financial benefit to the university.

== History ==
The history of technology transfer is intimately linked with the history of the [[science policy of the United States]].  The foundation for modern American science policy laid way out in [[Vannevar Bush]]'s letter in response to President Roosevelt's query about whether the US should maintain the high level of research funding it had been pouring into the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], which had coordinated large [[private-public partnership]] research projects as part of the war effort, including the [[Manhattan Project]].  Bush's answer was ''Science - the Endless Frontier''.&lt;ref name="Ehlers_science"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehlers|first=Vernon|title=The Future of U.S. Science Policy|journal=Science|date=16 January 1998|volume=279|pages=302a–302|doi=10.1126/science.279.5349.302a|issue=5349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frontier&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=Vannevar|title=Science the Endless Frontier|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm|publisher=National Science Foundation|date=July 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that letter, Bush advocated that the US should continue to fund [[basic research]] at high levels, arguing that while the US no longer had a geographic frontier, extending the boundaries of science would allow the creation of new technologies, which in turn would spur new industries, create jobs, generate wealth, and maintain US power.&lt;ref name=Frontier/&gt;  As the US worked out its approach to funding science in the 1950s, Congress decided that the federal government should maintain ownership of patents on inventions funded by the federal government.&lt;ref name="Ehlers_science"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Federal research funding drove the growth of the research university.  Many universities in the early 20th century did not engage in patenting and licensing, since the government owned most inventions, and out of fear of interfering with their missions of supporting the growth of knowledge and objective inquiry.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sampat|first=Bhaven N.|date=2006-07-01|title=Patenting and US academic research in the 20th century: The world before and after Bayh-Dole|url=|journal=Research Policy|series=Property and the pursuit of knowledge: IPR issues affecting scientific research|volume=35|issue=6|pages=772–789|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2006.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feldman|first=Maryann|last2=Desrochers|first2=Pierre|date=2003-03-01|title=Research Universities and Local Economic Development: Lessons from the History of the Johns Hopkins University|journal=Industry and Innovation|volume=10|issue=1|pages=5–24|doi=10.1080/1366271032000068078|issn=1366-2716}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the postwar period, universities relied mostly on external patent management organizations such as the [[Research Corporation]], while few set up their own research foundations that were independent from but affiliated to the university.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   Some universities, such as [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of Wisconsin]], had active licensing programs of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mowery|first=David C|last2=Nelson|first2=Richard R|last3=Sampat|first3=Bhaven N|last4=Ziedonis|first4=Arvids A|date=2001-01-01|title=The growth of patenting and licensing by U.S. universities: an assessment of the effects of the Bayh–Dole act of 1980|url=|journal=Research Policy|volume=30|issue=1|pages=99–119|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(99)00100-6|citeseerx=10.1.1.334.3228}}&lt;/ref&gt;   There was a shift in universities' approaches to technology transfer between 1970-1980.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During this period, universities began taking commercialization efforts into their own hands and setting up TTOs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The [[Bayh–Dole Act]] of 1980 led many US universities to set up tech transfer offices.  The Act was created to try to spur the stagnant US economy of the 1970s, harking back to Vannevar Bush's vision of the role of federal research funding in the US economy.  The Act decentralized ownership of inventions funded with federal grants, allowing universities that received federal grant funding to maintain ownership of such inventions, obligating them to try to patent and license the inventions to US companies, and requiring universities to share license income with inventors.&lt;ref name=Mowery&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mowery|first=David C.|last2=Sampat|first2=Bhaven N.|date=2004-12-01|title=The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 and University–Industry Technology Transfer: A Model for Other OECD Governments?|url=|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|language=en|volume=30|issue=1–2|pages=115–127|doi=10.1007/s10961-004-4361-z|issn=0892-9912|citeseerx=10.1.1.1025.6800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shapin/files/shapin_lrbivorytrade.pdf|title=Ivory Trade|last=Shapin|first=Steven|date=11 September 2003|website=Harvard.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==
While the broad goal of TTOs is to commercialize university research, they engage in numerous activities that not only bring these developments to market but also encourage and support faculty and students in the entire technology transfer process. Such encouragement may increase the chances of faculty and students creating research developments that can be commercialized. Some of the major functions of TTOs include:

=== Industry partnerships ===
An important task of many TTOs is to create and maintain industry partnerships that may be crucial for collaboration and bringing technologies to market.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Etzkowitz|first=Henry|date=1998-12-01|title=The norms of entrepreneurial science: cognitive effects of the new university–industry linkages|url=|journal=Research Policy|volume=27|issue=8|pages=823–833|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(98)00093-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities such as MIT and Northwestern have separate offices for industry and corporate relations which typically work in conjunction with the TTO of the institution. In this case, TTOs often exploit the relationships developed by the corporate relations office, focusing more specifically on the technology transfer process itself. TTOs often employ two methods when engaging with industry partners: 1) the "pull" method, in which TTOs ''receive'' interest from industry partners in bringing specific technologies at the university to market, and 2) the "push" method, in which TTOs actively ''seek'' industry partners for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4438&amp;context=flr|title=Interface: The Push and Pull of Patents|last=Lee|first=Peter|date=2009|website=Fordham Law Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intellectual property ===
The Bayh-Dole Act obligated universities to seek [[patent]] protection, when appropriate, for inventions to which they elect title; after passage of the Bayh-Dole Act many US universities created intellectual property policies that obligated faculty to assign inventions to the university.&lt;ref name=Mowery/&gt; Universities typically [[License#Patent licensing|license]] the patent to a company that will invest money in developing the invention into a product, which it will then be able to sell at a premium, recouping its investment and making profit before the patent expires.&lt;ref name=Mowery/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegel|first=Donald S|last2=Waldman|first2=David|last3=Link|first3=Albert|date=2003-01-01|title=Assessing the impact of organizational practices on the relative productivity of university technology transfer offices: an exploratory study|url=|journal=Research Policy|volume=32|issue=1|pages=27–48|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(01)00196-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Counseling and incubation for startups ===

TTOs at many universities often provide general business and legal counseling to foster entrepreneurship among faculty and students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Shea|first=Rory P.|last2=Allen|first2=Thomas J.|last3=Chevalier|first3=Arnaud|last4=Roche|first4=Frank|date=2005-09-01|title=Entrepreneurial orientation, technology transfer and spinoff performance of U.S. universities|url=|journal=Research Policy|series=The Creation of Spin-off Firms at Public Research Institutions: Managerial and Policy Implcations|volume=34|issue=7|pages=994–1009|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2005.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By providing resources, funding, and connections to [[University spin-off|university spin-off companies]], TTOs attempt to increase the chances of [[startup company|startup]] success, which may result in financial gain if the university owns the intellectual property of the invention or has an equity stake in the company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hence, many TTOs establish [[business incubator]]s and programs for faculty and students in an attempt to enhance the entrepreneurial atmosphere among researchers at the university.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Rhonda G.|date=2002-08-01|title=Technology business incubators: how effective as technology transfer mechanisms?|url=|journal=Technology in Society|volume=24|issue=3|pages=299–316|doi=10.1016/S0160-791X(02)00010-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of such incubators and programs include the [[Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator]] as well as the [[Physical Sciences and Engineering Accelerator]] at [[Harvard University]], and [[Fab Lab MSI]], affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]]. Research has suggested that incubators at TTOs have not had a high incidence of technology transfer, despite this being one of the reasons they were established, and may even negatively impact the success of TTOs and technology transfer at the university.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolympiris|first=Christos|last2=Klein|first2=Peter G.|date=2017-06-01|title=The Effects of Academic Incubators on University Innovation|journal=Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal|language=en|volume=11|issue=2|pages=145–170|doi=10.1002/sej.1242|issn=1932-443X|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/106979/1/WRAP-effects-academic-incubators-university-innovation-Kolympiris-2017.pdf|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and organization ==
The structure and organization of TTOs can affect its overall performance and can vary among universities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brescia|first=F.|last2=Colombo|first2=G.|last3=Landoni|first3=P.|title=Organizational structures of Knowledge Transfer Offices: an analysis of the world's top-ranked universities|url=|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|volume=41|issue=1|pages=132–151|doi=10.1007/s10961-014-9384-5|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since TTOs deal with both academic research and industry, they consist of a diverse set of individuals, including scientists, lawyers, analysts, licensing experts, and business managers. By having individuals (particularly different scientists, engineers, and analysts) with varying sets of expertise in research, TTOs attempt to more effectively assess, protect, and profit from the research developments taking place in  multiple disciplines throughout the university.

TTOs can by classified into three different types:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* ''internal:'' existing as an integrated part of the university and controlled by university administration
* ''external:'' existing as an independent company that does not operate under the control of university administration
* ''mixed:'' having components of both internal and external TTOs 
As of 2012 the "internal" type was most common in the US.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Strategies ==
TTOs attempt to capitalize on the research developments made at the university by employing strategies focused on providing the university with opportunities for financial gain and increased research impact. A common strategy that TTOs engage in is licensing their inventions, either to an industry partner or back to the university inventor if the inventor started a company (i.e. a university spin-off).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macho-Stadler|first=Inés|last2=Pérez-Castrillo|first2=David|last3=Veugelers|first3=Reinhilde|date=2007-06-01|title=Licensing of university inventions: The role of a technology transfer office|url=|journal=International Journal of Industrial Organization|volume=25|issue=3|pages=483–510|doi=10.1016/j.ijindorg.2006.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this approach, TTOs can bring university technologies to market without having to engage in production and distribution themselves. TTOs can also take an equity stake in the spin-off company rather than licensing the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lockett|first=Andy|last2=Wright|first2=Mike|last3=Franklin|first3=Stephen|title=Technology Transfer and Universities' Spin-Out Strategies|url=|journal=Small Business Economics|volume=20|issue=2|pages=185–200|doi=10.1023/a:1022220216972|via=|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has suggested that equity in spin-off companies may provide higher returns than licensing,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bray|first=Michael J|last2=Lee|first2=James N|date=2000-09-01|title=University revenues from technology transfer: Licensing fees vs. equity positions|url=|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=15|issue=5|pages=385–392|doi=10.1016/S0883-9026(98)00034-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this strategy seems to be more common with TTOs that are financially independent from the parent university (i.e. external TTO structure).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While these strategies vary greatly among TTOs at different universities, a majority of them employ some combination of licensing and equity stakes, with licensing being a more standard practice.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== International diffusion &amp; TTOs outside the US ==
As many major research universities across the US began to adopt TTOs, institutions outside the US became attracted to the idea of taking control of their commercialization activities as well. Prior to the 2000s, many German-speaking and Scandinavian countries had a policy of "professor's privilege", in which faculty retain the right to control the intellectual property of their inventions. In addition, in recent years many [[OECD]] and [[European Union|EU]] nations have created legislation that emulates Bayh-Dole, in an attempt to increase the commercialization activities and impact of their respective research universities.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geuna|first=Aldo|last2=Rossi|first2=Federica|date=2011-10-01|title=Changes to university IPR regulations in Europe and the impact on academic patenting|url=http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/3753/1/3753.pdf|journal=Research Policy|series=Special Issue: 30 Years After Bayh-Dole: Reassessing Academic Entrepreneurship|volume=40|issue=8|pages=1068–1076|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2011.05.008|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/industry-and-services/benchmarking-industry-science-relationships_9789264175105-en|title=Benchmarking Industry-Science Relationships|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oecd-ilibrary.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark was among the first to abolish professor's privilege, followed by Germany, Austria, Norway and Finland between 2000-2007.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Countries such as  France and the UK, which already had policies in place that grant intellectual property rights to universities during this period, began heavily encouraging and enforcing these institutional ownership rights.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; As of 2011, most European countries grant universities the rights to the intellectual property of inventions developed by faculty researchers, yet a few countries such as Italy and Sweden still employ professor's privilege.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farnstrand Damsgaard|first=E.|last2=Thursby|first2=M. C.|date=2013-02-01|title=University entrepreneurship and professor privilege|url=https://academic.oup.com/icc/article/22/1/183/882569/University-entrepreneurship-and-professor|journal=Industrial and Corporate Change|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=183–218|doi=10.1093/icc/dts047|issn=0960-6491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, there has been a marked increase in the commercialization activities of universities and creation of TTOs in Europe.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Several Asian countries such as Japan, China, and India have also shifted towards a Bayh-Dole type legislation, although some countries such as Malaysia have a shared ownership model.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephen|first=Tina|date=2010|title=Asian Initiatives on Bayh-Dole, with Special Reference to India: How Do We Make It More "Asian?"|url=http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1085&amp;context=ckjip|journal=Chicago-Kent Journal of Intellectual Property|volume=10|pages=44–64|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mok|first=Ka Ho|title=The quest for an entrepreneurial university in East Asia: impact on academics and administrators in higher education|url=|journal=Asia Pacific Education Review|volume=14|issue=1|pages=11–22|doi=10.1007/s12564-013-9249-x|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there has been a general shift towards increased commercialization and the establishment of TTOs across higher education institutions in Asian countries. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Although universities created TTOs with hopes of financial gain, many TTOs have retained losses in their commercialization activities and have not generated significant local economic development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trune|first=Dennis R|last2=Goslin|first2=Lewis N|date=1998-03-01|title=University Technology Transfer Programs: A Profit/Loss Analysis|url=|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=57|issue=3|pages=197–204|doi=10.1016/S0040-1625(97)00165-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; It has been argued that protecting intellectual property and patenting is a costly process, and of all the patents and licenses a university issues, there may be a limited number of inventions that actually yield enough revenue to cover or surpass these costs. Research has shown that larger, more established TTOs are sufficiently profitable, whereas many smaller, more recent TTOs are not, and that an estimated half of TTOs retain losses in their commercialization activities (of those that do not have losses, a majority do no better than to cover their costs).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Even the most profitable TTOs only produce revenue that amounts to 1-3% of the total research expenditures at the university.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moreover, less than 1% of licensed technologies actually yield over $1M in revenue.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Another criticism of TTOs is its role in the research atmosphere of the university, with many scholars arguing that its presence and purpose of engaging in commercialization activities conflicts with a university's mission of furthering knowledge and objective academic inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleischut|first=Peter M.|last2=Haas|first2=Scott|date=2005|title=University Technology Transfer Offices: A Status Report|journal=Biotechnology Healthcare|volume=2|issue=2|pages=48–53|issn=1554-169X|pmc=3564362|pmid=23393451|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebecca Eisenberg and [[Michael Heller (law professor)|Michael Heller]] have argued that the Bayh-Dole Act spurred university tech transfer offices to become too aggressive in patenting, creating [[patent thicket]]s and a [[tragedy of the anticommons]] especially in the field of [[biomedical research]].&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heller |first=M.

==Introduction==
Women have made major contributions to climate change research and policy and to broader analysis of global environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sachs|first1=Carolyn|title=Women Working In The Environment: Resourceful Natures.|date=2014|publisher=Taylor and Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They include many women scientists as well as policy makers and activists. Women researchers have made significant contributions to major scientific assessments such as those of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] and are reasonably well represented on key global change committees of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) and US National Academy of Sciences.  Women have played important leadership roles in international climate policy. [[File:Mary Robinson World Economic Forum 2013 crop.jpg|thumb|Mary Robinson]] For example, [[Christiana Figueres]] leads the international climate negotiations as the Executive Secretary of the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and former Irish President [[Mary Robinson]] is the UN Special Envoy on Climate Change.[[File:Christiana Figueres in London - 2018 (39536174340) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Christiana Figueres]] Susan Solomon chaired the climate science working group 1 of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] Fourth Assessment in 2007.

The latest report from the US National Science Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=National Science Foundation|first1=National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics|title=Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 2015|date=2015|publisher=National Science Foundation|location=Arlington Virginia|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2015/nsf15311/start.cfm|accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that while women are now earning half of the undergraduate degrees in science and engineering, most of these are in the biosciences (especially pre-med) compared to physics, computer sciences and engineering (20%). In terms of doctorates, women are also only 20% of the engineering and physics PhDs. Although the proportion of women full professors in the US has doubled since 1993 women occupy less than 1/4 of senior faculty positions in science and engineering and women earn less than men at the same level.

It has been noted that women of color, indigenous women and women from the global south are even more likely to be overlooked, to be poorly represented in the academy and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ong|first1=Maria|last2=Wright|first2=C|last3=Espinosa|first3=LL|last4=Orfield|first4=G|title=Inside the double bind: A synthesis of empirical research on undergraduate and graduate women of color in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|journal=Harvard Educational Review|date=2011|volume=81|issue=2|pages=172–209|doi=10.17763/haer.81.2.t022245n7x4752v2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is associated with a legacy of discrimination, lack of educational opportunities, language barriers, and a lack of effort to identify and cite them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=National Science Foundation|first1=National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics|title=Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 2015|date=2015|publisher=National Science Foundation|location=Arlington Virginia|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2015/nsf15311/start.cfm|accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harding|first1=Sandra|title=The 'racial' economy of science; Toward a Democratic Future|date=1993|publisher=Indiana University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in climate change disciplines==
Women are underrepresented in key disciplines for the study of climate change.  For example, women are a minority in the earth sciences where surveys reveal that less than 20% of meteorologists and geoscientists are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=UCAR|title=Women in Meteorology: How long a minority?|url=https://www.ucar.edu/communications/quarterly/fall03/wmo.html|website=UCAR communications|publisher=UCAR|accessdate=Apr 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent analysis of US atmospheric science doctoral programs reveals that women were 17% of tenure track and tenured faculty, with even smaller proportions at higher rank,  and 53% of departments had two or fewer women faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacPhee|first1=David|last2=Canetto|first2=Silvia Sara|title=Women in Academic Atmospheric Sciences|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|date=2015|volume=96|pages=59–67|doi=10.1175/bams-d-12-00215.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women are slightly better represented in the ecological sciences.  One study reports that women are 55% of graduate students in ecology but only 1/3 of tenured faculty are women and that 3/4 of the articles in the flagship international journal - Ecology - are written by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Laura Jane|title=Where are the women in ecology|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|date=2012|volume=10|pages=177–178|doi=10.1890/12.wb.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women received proportionally less research funding and were less likely to be cited by their colleagues. Women members of the Ecological Society of America increased from 23% in 1992 to 37% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beck|first1=Christopher|last2=Boersma|first2=Kate|last3=Tysor|first3=C Susannah|last4=Middendorf|first4=George|title=Diversity at 100: women and underrepresented minorities in the ESA|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|date=2014|volume=12|pages=434–436|doi=10.1890/14.WB.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] publishes data on women in science worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNESCO|title=Gender and Science|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/priority-areas/gender-and-science/|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall women are better represented as a share of total scientific researchers in Latin America, Oceania and Europe (30%+) and least in Asia (19%).

==Arguments for women in science and climate change==
It is argued that when women are overlooked as scholars and decision makers the world fails to take advantage of its full human capacity, which is needed for issues as urgent as climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyer|first1=Mary|last2=Barbercheck|first2=M|last3=Cookmeyer|first3=D|last4=Ozturk|first4=H|last5=Wayne|first5=M|title=Women, science, and technology: A reader in feminist science studies.|date=2013|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women may also take more collaborative approaches, especially in negotiations, and may pay more attention to disadvantaged groups and to the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanchard|first1=Eric M|title= Gender, international relations, and the development of feminist security theory|journal=Signs|date= |doi=10.1086/368328|citeseerx=10.1.1.474.9430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Elisabeth|title=Peacebuilding: Women in international perspective|date=2007|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender has become an issue because of women's essential roles in managing resources such as water, forests and energy and as women lead fights for environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckingham-Hatfield|first1=Susan|title=Gender and Environment|date=2005|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocheleau|first1=Dianne|last2=Thomas-Slayter|first2=Barbara|last3=Wangari|first3=Esther|title=Feminist political ecology: Global issues and local experience|date=2013|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A general concern has been expressed about the need to highlight the work of women and to include more women in major committees in order to provide gender balance, social justice, and inspiration to young women to enter careers in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buck|first1=Holly|last2=Gammon|first2=Andrea R|last3=Preston|first3=Christopher J|title=Gender and Geoengineering|journal=Hypatia|date=2014|volume=29|issue=3|pages=651–669|doi=10.1111/hypa.12083}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearson|first1=Willie|last2=Frehill|first2=Lisa|last3=Didion|first3=Catherine|title=Blueprint for the Future:: Framing the Issues of Women in Science in a Global Context: Summary of a Workshop|date=2012|publisher=National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reflects more general arguments about the barriers to women's advancement and the need for women to 'Lean in' to leadership positions (e.g. [http://leanin.org/ Lean In]).  
[[File:Susan Solomon-Desk With Globe.jpg|thumb|Susan Solomon]]

==Women and international climate policy==
The outcome document of the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development - the Future we Want - recognized the need to remove barriers to the full and equal participation of women in decision making and management and the need to increase women in leadership positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=UN|title=The Future we Want - Outcome document|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/futurewewant.html|publisher=UN|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report prepared by UN Women, the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice, the Global Gender and Climate Alliance and the UNFCCC recognizes the structural inequalities that impede the representation of women in climate science, negotiations and policies and recommends greater gender balance in the UNFCCC and national delegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=UN Women and Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice|title=The Full View: Advancing the goal of gender balance in multilateral and intergovernmental processes|date=May 2013|publisher=UN Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report argues that the 'challenges of climate change cannot be solved without empowering women' and that women have been marginalized in international negotiations. It reports data that show weak representation of women in the institutions of the UNFCCC including the Adaptation Committee (25%), the GEF Council (19%) and the Expert Group (15%) and that overall women constitute less than 20% of delegation heads and less than 30% of delegation members at UNFCCC conferences.

== The Manthropocene ==

A call for international science to pay greater attention to the inclusion of women scholars was made by [[Kate Raworth]] [http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/never-mind-the-anthropocene-beware-the-manthropocene/ on Twitter] and then in her article "Must the Anthropocene be the Manthropocene?"&lt;ref name="raworth-2014"&gt;{{cite news| issn = 0261-3077| first = Kate| last = Raworth| title = Must the Anthropocene be a Manthropocene?| work = The Guardian| location = London, UK| access-date = 2016-10-08| date = 20 October 2014| url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/20/anthropocene-working-group-science-gender-bias}}&lt;/ref&gt; She pointed out that the working group of 36 scientists and scholars who convened in Berlin in 2014 to begin assessing evidence humanity was entering a new epoch, the [[Anthropocene]], was composed almost entirely of men.  She stated: "Leading scientists may have the intellect to recognize that our planetary era is dominated by human activity, but they still seem oblivious to the fact that their own intellectual deliberations are bizarrely dominated by white northern male voices".

==Women working in climate change==
There are a variety of ways to identify women who have made major contributions to climate change.  The first is the list of authors of the high level international assessments for the UN and other organizations such as the [http://www.ippc.ch Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change], and the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). The second is to examine women who have been invited to join the editorial boards of climate change refereed journals. A third is to look at the membership of the global change committees of the [http://www.icsu.org/ International Council for Science (ICSU)]. And a fourth is to recognize women that are members of their National Academy of Sciences who work on climate change. Many of them are IPCC or other report authors, and also members of ICSU committees, members of their National Academy and other marks of accomplishment.
