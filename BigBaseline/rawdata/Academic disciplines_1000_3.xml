      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6629">The '''American Musicological Society''' is a membership-based [[musicology|musicological]] organization founded in 1934 to advance scholarly research in the various fields of music as a branch of learning and scholarship. It grew out of a small contingent of the [[Music Teachers National Association]] and, more directly, the New York Musicological Society (1930–1934). Its founders were George S. Dickinson, [[Carl Engel]], [[Gustave Reese]], [[Helen Heffron Roberts]], [[Joseph Schillinger]], [[Charles Seeger]], [[Harold Spivacke]], [[Oliver Strunk]], and [[Joseph Yasser]]. Its first president was [[Otto Kinkeldey]], the first American to receive an appointment as professor of musicology ([[Cornell University]], 1930).

== Overview ==
The society consists of individual members divided among fifteen regional chapters across the United States, Canada, and elsewhere, as well as subscribing institutions. It was admitted to the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] in 1951, and participates in the [[Répertoire International des Sources Musicales]] and the [[Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale]].

The society's annual meetings consist of presentations, [[symposium|symposia]], and concerts, as well as more-or-less informal meetings of numerous related musical societies. Many of the society's awards, prizes and fellowships are announced at these meetings.

== Publications ==
Most of the society's resources are dedicated to musicological publications: the triannual ''[[Journal of the American Musicological Society]]'' (1948-present) published by the [[University of California Press]]. The journal was preceded by the annual ''Bulletin'' (1936–1947) and the annual ''Papers'' (1936–1941). Online versions of these publications are available at [[JSTOR]] and the University of California Press.

Other studies and documents published by the society include the complete works of [[William Billings]], edited by [[Karl Kroeger]] et al. (4 vols, 1977–1990), the series ''Music of the United States of America'' (1993–present),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umich.edu/%7Emusausa/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Ockeghem]]'s collected works edited by [[Dragan Plamenac]] and Richard Wexler (3 vols., 1966, 1992), [[John Dunstaple]]'s complete works edited by [[Manfred Bukofzer]], published jointly with [[Musica Britannica]] (1970), [[Joseph Kerman]]'s ''The Elizabethan Madrigal'' (1962),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams-net.org/pubs/Kerman.php&lt;/ref&gt; E. R. Reilly's ''Quantz and his Versuch'' (1971), E. H. Sparks's ''The Music of Noel Bauldeweyn'' (1972), ''Essays in Musicology: a Tribute to [[Alvin H. Johnson]]'' edited by [[Lewis Lockwood]] and Edward Roesner (1990),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams-net.org/pubs/Johnson.php |title=Essays in Musicology: a Tribute to Alvin H. Johnson |website=American Musicological Society |accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in conjunction with the [[International Musicological Society]], ''Doctoral Dissertations in Musicology'' edited by C. D. Adkins and A. Dickinson in succession to [[Helen Hewitt]] (1952, 1957, 1961, 1965, 1971, 1977, 1984 [first cumulative edition], 1990, 1996 [second series, second cumulative edition]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams-net.org/ddm/&lt;/ref&gt;(Brunswick, 2011)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5339">'''Andrei Ivanovich Bogdanov''' ({{lang-ru|Андрей Иванович Богданов}}) (1692 – September 11, 1766) was one of the first  [[Russia]]n [[bibliography|bibliographers]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographers]].

Andrei Bogdanov had studied at Academician [[gimnasium]] (a gimnasium of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]). His father was a gunpowder-maker and Andrei had assisted him in his work. In 1727 according to [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great's]] edict Bogdanov began work at the field of typographical art.
&lt;!--
'''Андре́й Ива́нович Богда́нов'''в (1692 — 11 сентября 1766, [[Санкт-Петербург]]) — один из первых русских [[Библиография|книговедов]]. Учился в гимназии при [[Петербургская Академия наук|Петербургской Академии Наук]]. Отец его был мастером порохового дела и Андрей Иванович помогал ему, пока указом [[Пётр I|Петра I]] от 1719 года не был определен «в службу к типографскому художеству». Далее работал в Санкт-Петербургской типографии, а после 1727 года — в типографии Академии Наук. С 1730 года Андрей Иванович работал в библиотеке Академии наук. 

Труд Андрея Ивановича Богданова ''«Историческое, географическое и топографическое описание Санкт-Петербурга от начала заведения его, с 1703, по 1751 год»''  —  первое дошедшее до нас произведение, в котором собраны сведения по [[География|географии]], [[Топонимика|топонимике]], административной структуре, населению Санкт-Петербурга. Это по сути энциклопедия столичной жизни первой половины XVIII века.

[[Musicology]] commonly classifies [[scale (music)|scale]]s as either '''hemitonic''' or '''anhemitonic'''. Hemitonic scales contain one or more [[semitone]]s, while anhemitonic scales do not contain semitones. For example, in [[Music of Japan#Traditional music|traditional Japanese music]], the anhemitonic [[yo scale|''yo'' scale]] is contrasted with the hemitonic [[in scale|''in'' scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Anon. (2001) "Ditonus", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]]. London: Macmillan Publishers; [[Bence Szabolcsi]] (1943), "Five-Tone Scales and Civilization", ''Acta Musicologica'' 15, Fasc. 1/4 (January–December): pp. 24–34, citation on p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest and most commonly used scale in the world is the atritonic anhemitonic [[Pentatonic scale#Hemitonic and anhemitonic|"major" pentatonic scale]]. The [[whole tone scale]] is also anhemitonic.

[[Image:Hungarian minor scale on C.png|thumb|right|Hungarian minor scale on C, a cohemitonic scale.&lt;ref name="Kahan"&gt;Kahan, Sylvia (2009). ''In Search of New Scales'', p. 39. {{ISBN|978-1-58046-305-8}}. Cites Liszt. ''Des Bohémians'', p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Hungarian minor scale on C.mid|Play}}]]

A special subclass of the hemitonic scales is the '''cohemitonic''' scales.&lt;ref&gt;Christ, William (1966). ''Materials and Structure of Music'', v.1, p. 39. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice–Hall. LOC 66-14354.&lt;/ref&gt; Cohemitonic scales contain two or more semitones (making them hemitonic) such that two or more of the semitones appear consecutively in scale order.  For example, the [[Hungarian minor scale]] in C includes F{{music|#}}, G, and A{{music|b}} in that order, with a semitone between F{{music|#}} and G, and then a semitone between G and A{{music|b}}.

[[Image:Octatonic scales on C.png|thumb|right|330px|Octatonic scales on C, hemitonic but ancohemitonic {{audio|Octatonic scales on C.mid|Play}}.]]

'''Ancohemitonic''' scales, in contrast, either contain no semitones (and thus are anhemitonic), or contain semitones (being hemitonic) where none of the semitones appear consecutively in scale order.&lt;ref&gt;Tymoczko, Dmitri (1997). "The Consecutive-Semitone Constraint on Scalar Structure: A Link between Impressionism and Jazz", ''Intégral'', v.11, (1997), p. 135-179.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2015}}&lt;!--The term is not found in the cited source.--&gt;  Some authors, however, do not include anhemitonic scales in their definition of ancohemitonic scales.  Examples of ancohemitonic scales are numerous, as ancohemitonia is favored over cohemitonia in the world's musics: [[diatonic scale]], melodic major/[[Melodic minor#Melodic minor scale|melodic minor]], [[Hungarian major scale]], [[harmonic major scale]], [[Harmonic minor#Harmonic minor scale|harmonic minor scale]], and the so-called [[octatonic scale]].

Hemitonia is also quantified by the number of semitones present. Unhemitonic scales have only one semitone; dihemitonic scales have 2 semitones; trihemitonic scales have 3 semitones, etc.  In the same way that an anhemitonic scale is less dissonant than a hemitonic scale, an unhemitonic scale is less dissonant than a dihemitonic scale.

The qualification of cohemitonia versus ancohemitonia combines with the cardinality of semitones, giving terms like: dicohemitonic, triancohemitonic, and so forth.  An ancohemitonic scale is less dissonant than a cohemitonic scale, the count of their semitones being equal.  In general, the number of semitones is more important to the perception of dissonance than the adjacency (or lack thereof) of any pair of them.  Additional adjacency between semitones (once adjacency is present) does not necessarily increase the dissonance, the count of semitones again being equal.&lt;ref name="Keith, Michael 1991. p. 45"&gt;Keith, Michael. 1991. ''From Polychords to Polya : Adventures in Musical Combinatorics'', p. 45. Princeton: Vinculum Press. {{ISBN|978-0963009708}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to these semitone classifications are '''tritonic''' and '''atritonic''' scales.  Tritonic scales contain one or more [[tritone]]s, while atritonic scales do not contain tritones.  A special monotonic relationship exists between semitones and tritones as scales are built by projection, q.v. below.

The harmonic relationship of all these categories comes from the perception that semitones and tritones are the severest of [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonances]], and that avoiding them is often desirable.  The most-used scales across the planet are anhemitonic. Of the remaining hemitonic scales, the ones most used are ancohemitonic.

== Quantification of hemitonia and its relationship to ancohemitonia ==
Most of the world's music is anhemitonic, perhaps 90%.&lt;ref name="Keith, Michael 1991. p. 43"&gt;Keith, Michael. 1991. ''From Polychords to Polya : Adventures in Musical Combinatorics'', p. 43. Princeton: Vinculum Press. {{ISBN|978-0963009708}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of that other hemitonic portion, perhaps 90% is unhemitonic, predominating in chords of only 1 semitone, all of which are ancohemitonic by definition.&lt;ref name="Keith, Michael 1991. p. 43"/&gt; Of the remaining 10%, perhaps 90% are dihemitonic, predominating in chords of no more than 2 semitones.  The same applies to chords of 3 semitones.&lt;ref&gt;Keith, Michael. 1991. ''From Polychords to Polya : Adventures in Musical Combinatorics'', p. 48-49. Princeton: Vinculum Press. {{ISBN|978-0963009708}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In both later cases, however, there is a distinct preference for ancohemitonia, as the lack of adjacency of any two semitones goes a long way towards softening the increasing dissonance.

The following table plots sonority size (downwards on the left) against semitone count (to the right) plus the quality of ancohemitonia (denoted with letter A) versus cohemitonia (denoted with letter C).  In general, ancohemitonic combinations are fewer for a given chord or scale size, but used much more frequently so that their names are well known.

Column "0" represents the most commonly used chords.,&lt;ref name="Keith, Michael 1991. p. 45"/&gt; avoiding intervals of M7 and chromatic 9ths and such combinations of 4th, chromatic 5ths, and 6th to produce semitones.  Column 1 represents chords that barely use the harmonic degrees that column "0" avoids.  Column 2, however, represents sounds far more intractable.&lt;ref name="Keith, Michael 1991. p. 45"/&gt;

Column 0, row 5 are the full but pleasant chords: 9th, 6/9, and 9alt5 with no 7.&lt;ref name="Wilmott, Brett 1994 p.210"&gt;Wilmott, Brett. (1994) ''Mel Bays Complete Book of Harmony Theory and Voicing'', p.210. Pacific, Missouri: Mel Bay. {{ISBN|978-1562229948}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Column "0", row "6", is the unique [[whole tone scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.367. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Column "2A", row "7", a local minimum, refers to the [[diatonic scale]] and melodic major/[[Melodic minor#Melodic minor scale|melodic minor]] scales.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.362-363. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ancohemitonia, inter alii, probably makes these scales popular.  Column "2C", row "7", another local minimum, refers to the [[Neapolitan major scale]], which is cohemitonic and somewhat less common but still popular enough to bear a name.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.363. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Column "3A", row "7", another local minimum, represents the [[Hungarian major scale]], and its involution, and the [[harmonic major scale]] and involution [[Harmonic minor#Harmonic minor scale|harmonic minor scale]] of the same.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.364. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Column "3A", row "6", are the hexatonic analogs to these four familiar scales,&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.369. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt; one of which being the [[Augmented scale]],&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.368. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt; and another the analog of the [[Octatonic scale]] - which itself appears, alone and solitary, at Column "&gt;=4A". row "8".&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.360. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Column "2A", row "4", another minimum, represents a few frankly dissonant, yet strangely ''resonant'' harmonic combinations: mM9 with no 5, 11{{music|flat}}9, dom13{{music|flat}}9, and M7{{music|sharp}}11.&lt;ref name="Wilmott, Brett 1994 p.210"/&gt;

As music tends towards increasing dissonance through history, perhaps someday Column 2 will be as acceptable as even Column 1 might be, and Column 3 will finally have a place in the harmony of the world.

Note, too, that in the highest cardinality row for each column before the terminal zeros begin, the sonority counts are small, except for row "7" and the "3" columns of all sorts.  This explosion of hemitonic possibility associated with note cardinality 7 (and above) possibly marks the lower bound for the entity called "scale" (in contrast to "chord").

As shown in the table, anhemitonia is a property of the domain of note sets cardinality 2 through 6, while ancohemitonia is a property of the domain of note sets cardinality 4 through 8 (3 through 8 for improper ancohemitonia including unhemitonia as well).  This places anhemitonia generally in the range of "chords" and ancohemitonia generally in the range of "scales".

== Example: hemitonia and tritonia of the perfect-fifth projection ==
The interrelationship of semitones, tritones, and increasing note count can be demonstrated by taking five consecutive pitches from the [[circle of fifths]];&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Paul. 1973. ''Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach'', p. 18. New York: Dodd, Mead. {{ISBN|0-396-06752-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; starting on C, these are C, G, D, A, and E. Transposing the pitches to fit into one [[octave]] rearranges the pitches into the [[Major pentatonic scale#Major pentatonic scale|major pentatonic scale]]: C, D, E, G, A.  This scale is anhemitonic, having no semitones; it is atritonic, having no tritones.

|}

In addition, this is the maximal number of notes taken consecutively from the circle of fifths for which is it still possible to avoid a semitone.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.29. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding another note from the circle of fifths gives the major hexatonic scale: C D E G A B.  This scale is hemitonic, having a semitone between B and C; it is atritonic, having no tritones.  In addition, this is the maximal number of notes taken consecutively from the circle of fifths for which is it still possible to avoid a tritone.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.40. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding still another note from the circle of fifths gives the major heptatonic scale: C D E F G A B (when the fifth is added from below the tonic).  This scale is strictly ancohemitonic, having 2 semitones but not consecutively; it is tritonic, having a tritone between F and B.  Past this point in the projection series, no new intervals are added to the [[Interval vector]] analysis of the scale,&lt;ref name="HansonHoward1"&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p. 33. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt; but cohemitonia results.

[[File:Ionian mode C.png|thumb|right|300px|P7 projection/major heptatonic on C {{audio|Ionian mode C.mid|Play}}.]]

Adding still another note from the circle of fifths gives the major octatonic scale: C D E F F{{music|sharp}} G A B (when the fifth is added from above the top note in the series--B in this case).  This scale is cohemitonic, having 3 semitones together at E F F{{music|sharp}} G, and tritonic as well.&lt;ref name="HansonHoward1" /&gt;

Similar behavior is seen across all scales generally, that more notes in a scale tend cumulatively to add [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant intervals]] (specifically: hemitonia and tritonia in no particular order) and cohemitonia not already present.  While also true that more notes in a scale tend to allow more and varied intervals in the [[interval vector]], there might be said to be a ''point of diminishing returns'', when qualified against the also increasing dissonance, hemitonia, tritonia and cohemitonia.  It is near these points where most popular scales lie.&lt;ref name="HansonHoward1" /&gt;

== Cohemitonic and hemitonic scales ==

Though less used than ancohemitonic scales, the cohemitonic scales have an interesting property.  The sequence of two (or more) consecutive halfsteps in a scale presents the opportunity to "split" the scale by placing the [[Tonic (music)|tonic note]] of the scale on the middle note of the halfstep span.  This allows a [[leading tone]] from below [[Resolution (music)|resolving]] upwards, as well as a descending [[Neapolitan chord|flat-supertonic]] upper [[Neighbor note#Neighbor tone|neighbor]], both converging on the tonic.  The split turns a weakness - dissonance of cohemitonia - to a strength: [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] convergence on the tonic.  It is very common that a cohemitonic (or even hemitonic) scale (e.g.: [[Hungarian minor]] { C D E{{music|flat}} F{{music|#}} G A{{music|flat}} B }) be [[Modulation (music)#Parallel key modulation|displaced preferentially]] to a mode where the halfstep span is split (e.cont.: [[Double harmonic scale]] { G A{{music|flat}} B C D E{{music|flat}} F{{music|#}} }), and by which name we more commonly know the same [[Necklace (combinatorics)|circular series]] of intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Schillinger, Joseph. (1941) ''The Schillinger System of Musical Composition'', v.1, p. 113ff. New York: Carl Fischer. {{ISBN|0306775212}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cohemitonic scales with multiple halfstep spans present the additional possibility of [[Modulation (music)|modulating]] between tonics each furnished with both upper and lower neighbors.

== Modes of heptatonic scales and the key signature system ==

[[File:A-major f-sharp-minor.svg|thumb|right|150px|Key signature [[A major]] / [[F-sharp minor|F{{music|#}} minor]], an ancohemitonic heptatonic scale.]]

Western music's system of [[key signature]] is based upon the assumption of a [[heptatonic scale]] of 7 notes, such that there are never more than 7 accidentals present in a valid key signature.  The global preference for anhemitonic scales combines with this basis to highlight the 6 ancohemitonic heptatonic scales,&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p. 362ff. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt; most of which are common in [[romantic music]], and of which most Romantic music is composed:
* [[Diatonic scale]]
* Melodic major/[[Melodic minor#Melodic minor scale|melodic minor]]
* [[Hungarian major scale]]
* involution of Hungarian major
* [[Harmonic major scale]]
* [[Harmonic minor#Harmonic minor scale|Harmonic minor scale]].

These cohemitonic scales are less common:
* [[Double harmonic major scale]]
* [[Neapolitan major scale]]
* [[Neapolitan minor scale]]
* Ionian {{music|b}}5 scale
* Persian scale
* Locrian {{music|#}}7 scale.
Adhering to the definition of heptatonic scales, these all possess 7 [[Mode (music)|modes]] each, and are suitable for use in [[Modulation (music)#Parallel key modulation|modal mutation]].&lt;ref&gt;Christ, William (1966). ''Materials and Structure of Music'', v.1, p. 45. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall. LOC 66-14354.&lt;/ref&gt;  They appear in the table above in Row "7", Columns "2A" and "3A".

===Table of key signatures===
The following lists the key signatures for all possible untransposed modes of the aforementioned heptatonic scales using the note C as the tonic.

An '''art movement''' is a tendency or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal, followed by a group of artists during a restricted period of time, (usually a few months, years or decades) or, at least, with the heyday of the movement defined within a number of years. Art movements were especially important in [[modern art]], when each consecutive movement was considered as a new [[avant-garde]].

According to theories associated with [[modernism]] and the concept of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]], art movements are especially important during the period of time corresponding to [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;''Man of his words: Pepe Karmel on Kirk Varnedoe&amp;nbsp;— Passages'' – Critical Essay [[Artforum]],  Nov, 2003  by Pepe Karmel&lt;/ref&gt; The period of time called "modern art" is posited to have changed approximately halfway through the 20th century and art made afterward is generally called [[contemporary art]]. [[Postmodern art|Postmodernism]] in visual art begins and functions as a parallel to [[late modernism]]&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths'', pp.8–171&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to that period after the "modern" period called contemporary art.&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp218-221"&gt;''The Citadel of Modernism Falls to Deconstructionists'', – 1992 critical essay, ''The Triumph of Modernism'', 2006, [[Hilton Kramer]], pp 218–221.&lt;/ref&gt; The postmodern period began during [[late modernism]] (which is a contemporary continuation of modernism), and according to some theorists postmodernism ended in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Post-Modernism: The New Classicism in Art and Architecture'' [[Charles Jencks]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="William R. Everdell 1997, p4"&gt;William R. Everdell, [[The First Moderns|''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-century Thought'']], University of Chicago Press, 1997, p4. {{ISBN|0-226-22480-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of time corresponding to "modern art" each consecutive movement was often considered a new [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Also during the period of time referred to as "modern art" each movement was seen corresponding to a somewhat grandiose rethinking of all that came before it, concerning the visual arts. Generally there was a commonality of visual style linking the works and artists included in an art movement. Verbal expression and explanation of movements has come from the artists themselves, sometimes in the form of an [[art manifesto]],&lt;ref name=introduction&gt;[http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/chapters/i8066.html "Poetry of the Revolution. Marx, Manifestos, and the Avant-Gardes" introduction, Martin Puchner] Retrieved April 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.sas.upenn.edu/05-06/mellon_postdoc.shtml "Looking at Artists' Manifestos, 1945–1965", Stephen B.

In the [[visual arts]], many artists, theorists, art critics, art collectors, art dealers and others mindful of the unbroken continuation of modernism and the continuation of modern art even into the contemporary era, ascribe to and welcome new philosophies of art as they appear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], seventh paragraph of the essay.

His final essay on modernism Retrieved October 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodern art|Postmodernist]] theorists posit that the idea of art movements are no longer as applicable, or no longer as discernible, as the notion of art movements had been before the postmodern era.&lt;ref&gt;''Ideas About Art'' by Desmond, Kathleen K. [https://books.google.com/books?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&amp;dq=ideas+about+art&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s], John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International postmodernism: theory and literary practice'', Bertens, Hans [https://books.google.com/books?id=n_Eqx2Gr1vUC&amp;dq=international+postmodernism:+theory+and+literary+practice&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s], Routledge, 1997, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; There are many theorists however who doubt as to whether or not such an era was actually a fact;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; or just a passing fad.&lt;ref name="William R. Everdell 1997, p4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophynow.org/issue58/The_Death_of_Postmodernism_And_Beyond Alan Kirby, ''The Death of Postmodernism and Beyond'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The term refers to tendencies in [[visual art]], novel ideas and [[architecture]], and sometimes [[literature]]. In [[music]] it is more common to speak about [[genre]]s and [[fashion|styles]] instead. See also [[cultural movement]], a term with a broader connotation.

As the names of many art movements use the -ism suffix (for example [[cubism]] and [[futurism (art)|futurism]]), they are sometimes referred to as ''isms''.

The '''Cass identity model''' is one of the fundamental theories of [[LGBT|gay and lesbian]] identity development, developed in 1979 by Vivienne Cass.&lt;ref&gt; Cass, V. (1979). Homosexual identity formation: A theoretical model. Journal of Homosexuality, 4 (3), 219-235.&lt;/ref&gt; This model was one of the first to treat gay people as "normal" in a [[Heterosexism|heterosexist]] society and in a climate of [[homophobia]] instead of treating homosexuality itself as a problem. Cass described a process of six stages of gay and lesbian identity development. While these stages are sequential, some people might revisit stages at different points in their lives.

== The six stages of Cass' model ==
=== Identity confusion ===

In the first stage, ''identity confusion'', the person is amazed to think of themselves as a gay person. "Could I be gay?" This stage begins with the person's first awareness of gay or lesbian thoughts, feelings, and attractions. The people typically feel confused and experience turmoil.

To the question "Who am I?", the answers can be acceptance, psychological self-[[denial]] and [[Psychological repression|repression]], or rejection.

Possible responses can be: to avoid information about lesbians and gays; inhibited behavior; self-[[denial]] of homosexuality ("experimenting", "an accident", "just drunk", "just looking"). Men often keep emotional involvement separated from sexual contact; women often have deep, strongly emotional but non-sexual relationships.

The possible needs can be: the person may explore internal positive and negative judgments. Will be allowed to be uncertain regarding sexual identity. May find support in knowing that [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] occurs along a spectrum. May receive permission and encouragement to explore sexual identity as a normal experience (like career identity and social identity).

=== Identity comparison ===

The second stage is called ''identity comparison''. In this stage, the person accepts the possibility of being gay or lesbian and examines the wider implications of that tentative commitment. "Maybe this does apply to me." The self-alienation becomes isolation.
The task is to deal with the social alienation.

Possible responses can be: the person may begin to grieve for losses and the things they give up by embracing their sexual orientation (marriage, children). They may compartmentalize their own sexuality&amp;mdash;accept lesbian/gay definition of behavior but maintain "heterosexual" identity. Tells oneself, "It's only temporary"; "I'm just in love with this particular woman/man"; etc.

The possible needs can be: will be very important that the person develops own definitions. Will need information about sexual identity, lesbian, gay community resources, encouragement to talk about loss of heterosexual life expectations. May be permitted to keep some "heterosexual" identity (as "not an all or none" issue).

=== Identity tolerance ===

In the third stage, ''identity tolerance'', the person comes to the understanding they are "not the only one".

The person acknowledges they are likely gay or lesbian and seeks out other gay and lesbian people to combat feelings of isolation. Increased commitment to being lesbian or gay.
The task is to decrease social alienation by seeking out lesbians and gays.

Possible responses can be: beginning to have language to talk and think about the issue. Recognition that being lesbian or gay does not preclude other options. Accentuate difference between self and heterosexuals. Seek out lesbian and gay culture (positive contact leads to more positive sense of self, negative contact leads to devaluation of the culture, stops growth). The person may try out variety of stereotypical roles.

The possible needs can be: to be supported in exploring own shame feelings derived from [[heterosexism]], as well as [[internalized homophobia]]. Receive support in finding positive lesbian, gay community connections. It is particularly important for the person to know community resources.

=== Identity acceptance ===

The ''identity acceptance'' stage means the person accepts themselves. "I will be okay." The person attaches a positive connotation to their gay or lesbian identity and accepts rather than tolerates it. There is continuing and increased contact with the gay and lesbian culture.
The task is to deal with inner tension of no longer subscribing to society's norm, attempt to bring congruence between private and public view of self.

Possible responses can be: accepts gay or lesbian self-identification. May compartmentalize "gay life". Maintain less and less contact with heterosexual community. Attempt to "fit in" and "not make waves" within the gay and lesbian community. Begin some selective disclosures of sexual identity. More social coming out; more comfortable being seen with groups of men or women that are identified as "gay". More realistic evaluation of situation.

The possible needs can be: continue exploring grief and loss of heterosexual life expectation, continue exploring internalized homophobia (learned shame from heterosexist society). Find support in making decisions about where, when, and to whom to disclose.

=== Identity pride ===

In the ''identity pride'' stage, sometimes the coming out of the closet arrives, and the main thinking is "I've got to let people know who I am!" The person divides the world into heterosexuals and homosexuals, and is immersed in gay and lesbian culture while minimizing contact with heterosexuals. Us-them quality to political/social viewpoint.
The task is to deal with the incongruent views of heterosexuals.

Possible responses include: splits world into "gay" (good) and "straight" (bad)&amp;mdash;experiences disclosure crises with heterosexuals as they are less willing to "blend in"&amp;mdash;identify gay culture as sole source of support, acquiring all gay friends, business connections, social connections.

The possible needs can be: to receive support for exploring anger issues, to find support for exploring issues of heterosexism, to develop skills for coping with reactions and responses to disclosure to sexual identity, and to resist being defensive.

=== Identity synthesis ===

The last stage in Cass' model is ''identity synthesis'': the person integrates their sexual identity with all other aspects of self, and sexual orientation becomes ''only one aspect'' of self rather than the entire identity.

The task is to integrate gay and lesbian identity so that instead of being the identity, it is an aspect of self.

Possible responses can be: continues to be angry at heterosexism, but with decreased intensity, or allows trust of others to increase and build. Gay and lesbian identity is integrated with all aspects of "self". The person feels "all right" to move out into the community and not simply define space according to sexual orientation.

== Criticisms of the model ==

Joanne Kaufman and Cathryn Johnson have argued that based upon more recent research, this model is less valid today than it was at its inception for several reasons:&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Joanne and Johnson, Cathryn (2004) Stigmatized Individuals and the Process of Identity, ''The Sociological Quarterly'', 45 (4), 807–33&lt;/ref&gt;

#This model does not take into account socio-cultural factors that can impact identity development.
#The nature of the [[social stigma]] and its management practices have changed since the inception of the model.
#The linear nature of the model would suggest that anyone who abandons the model or fails to go through each of the six stages would not be able to be considered as a well adjusted homosexual, which may no longer be true.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33232">'''Children’s rights education''' (or children’s human rights education) is the teaching and practice of children’s rights in schools and educational institutions, as informed by and consistent with the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. When fully implemented, a children's rights education program consists of both a curriculum to teach children their human rights, and framework to operate the school in a manner that respects children's rights. Articles [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art29 29] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art42 42] of the Convention on the Rights of the Child require children to be educated about their rights.

In addition to meeting legal obligations of the Convention to spread awareness of children’s rights to children and to adults, teaching children about their rights has the benefits of improving their awareness of rights in general, making them more respectful of other people's rights, and empowering them to take action in support of other people's rights. Early programs to teach children about their rights, in Belgium, Canada, England and New Zealand have provided evidence of this.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt;&lt;ref name=dead /&gt;&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=belgium /&gt;&lt;ref name=wallberg /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp6 /&gt; Children's rights in schools were taught and practiced as an ethos of 'liberating the child' well before the UN Convention was written, and that this practice helped to inform the values and philosophy of the Convention, the IBE and UNESCO, though sadly these practices, and this history are not really acknowledged or built-upon by the UN. This is one reasons that children's rights have not become a foundation of schools despite 100 years of struggle.&lt;ref name="newman movement"&gt;Newman, Michael (2015) Children’s Rights in our Schools – the movement to liberate the child, an introduction to the New Ideals in Education Conferences 1914-1937, [https://www.academia.edu/14081708/Regaining_the_History_of_Childrens_Rights_in_Schools_Through_the_New_Ideals_in_Education_Conferences_1914-37 www.academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning of children’s human rights education==
Children’s human rights education refers to education and educational practices in schools and educational institutions that are consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.&lt;ref name=empower&gt;Howe, R.B. and Covell, K. (2007). ''Empowering Children: Children’s Rights Education as a Pathway to Citizenship''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krappman&gt;Krappman, L. (2006). "The rights of the child as a challenge to human rights education." ''Journal of Social Science Education.'' Retrieved from: http://www.jsse.org/2006-1/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=osler&gt;Osler, A., and Starkey, H. (2006). "Education for democratic citizenship: A review of research, policy and practice 1995-2005." ''Research Papers in Education,'' 21 (4), 433-466.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of education that takes seriously the view that children are bearers of human rights, that children are citizens in their own right, that schools and educational institutions are learning communities where children learn (or fail to learn) the values and practices of human rights and citizenship, and that educating children about their own basic human rights is a legal obligation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. 

Children's rights education is education where the rights of the child, as described in the Convention, is taught and practiced in individual classrooms. But in its most developed form, children’s rights are taught and practiced in a systematic and comprehensive way across grade levels, across the school, and across school districts. With full-blown children’s rights education, children’s rights are not simply an addition to a particular subject or classroom. Rather, the rights of the child are incorporated into the school curricula, teaching practices, and teaching materials across subjects and grade levels and are the centerpiece of school mission statements, behavior codes, and school policies and practices.&lt;ref name=implement&gt;Covell, K., Howe, R.B., and McNeil, J.K. (2010). "Implementing children’s human rights education in schools." ''Improving Schools,'' 13 (2), 117-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully developed children’s rights education means that all members of the school community receive education on the rights of the child. The Convention serves as a values framework for the life and functioning of the school or educational institution and for efforts to promote a more positive school climate and school culture for learning.

A core belief in children’s rights education is that when children learn about their own basic human rights, this learning serves as an important foundation for their understanding and support of human rights more broadly.

==Education and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child==
The Convention on the Rights of the child has important implications for the education of children. Approved by the [[United Nations]] in 1989, the Convention is the most widely ratified and most quickly ratified country in world history. Only two countries – the [[United States]] and [[South Sudan]] – have yet to ratify the [[treaty]].&lt;ref name=CRIN&gt;Child Rights Information Network (2008).  [http://www.crin.org/resources/treaties/CRC.asp?catName=International+Treatie ''Convention on the Rights of the Child''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103092514/http://www.crin.org/resources/treaties/CRC.asp?catName=International+Treatie# |date=2012-11-03 }}. Retrieved 26 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amnesty&gt;Amnesty International USA (2007).  [http://www.amnestyusa.org/children/crn_faq.html ''Convention on the Rights of the Child: Frequently Asked Questions''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222202845/http://www.amnestyusa.org/children/crn_faq.html# |date=2008-12-22 }}.

(1999). ''A Commentary on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verhellen&gt;Verhellen, E. (1994). ''Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' Kessel-Lo, Belgium: Garant&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bueren&gt;Van Bueren, G. (1992). ''The international Law on the Rights of the Child.'' Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the Convention, a legally binding treaty, states parties have the obligation to make their laws, policies, and practices consistent with the provisions of the Convention, if not immediately, then over time.

In the Convention are numerous articles that deal with education and with children’s rights education. Eugeen Verhellen has divided the Convention’s provisions on education along three tracks.&lt;ref name=verhellen2&gt;Verhellen, E. (1993). "Children’s rights and education." ''School Psychology International,'' 14 (3), 199-208.&lt;/ref&gt; First is the child’s right to education on the basis equal opportunity ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art28 article 28]). This includes the right to free primary education and to accessible secondary and higher education. Second are the child’s rights in education (articles [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art2 2], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art12 12], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art13 13], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art14 14], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art15 15], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art19 19]). This includes the right to non-discrimination, participation, protection from abuse and violence, and freedom of thought, expression, and religion. Third are the child’s rights through education (article [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art29 29] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art42 42]). This refers to education where children are able to know and understand their rights and to develop respect for human rights, including their own human rights.

This third track of education spells an obligation by countries and education authorities to provide for children’s human rights education. Article 29 of the Convention requires that 'the education of the child shall be directed to the development of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.' This presumes knowledge and understanding of rights. Article 42 requires that countries 'undertake to make the principles of the Convention widely known, by appropriate and active means, to adults and children alike.'

Mindful of this duty of disseminating knowledge and recognizing its importance, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the UN body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Convention, has repeatedly urged countries to incorporate children’s rights into the school curricula and ensure that children know and understand their rights on a systematic and comprehensive basis.&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=un&gt;United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (1991). ''General Guidelines Regarding the Form and Content of Initial Reports.'' CRC/C/5. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hodgkin&gt;Hodgkin, R., and Newell, P. (1998). ''Implementation handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' New York: UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Value of children’s human rights education==
Children’s rights education in schools has value because it fulfills the obligations of countries to respect the rights of the child and implement the provisions of the Convention. But beyond the fulfillment of a legal obligation, children’s rights education has value for children. Felisa Tibbitts has suggested that child rights education can be expected to affect learners in three ways.&lt;ref name=tibbitts&gt;Tibbitts, F. (1997). ''An Annotated Primer for Selecting Democratic and Human Rights Education Teaching Materials.'' Amsterdam: Open Society Institute/Human Rights education Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  First is in the providing of basic information and knowledge on the nature of rights and the specific rights that children are to enjoy. Children can be expected to have a more accurate and deeper understanding of rights. Second is in attitudes, values, and behaviors consistent with the understanding of rights. Children can be expected to have greater respect for the rights of others as shown in their attitudes and behaviors. Third is in empowering children to take action in support of the rights of others. Tibbitts refers to this as the 'transformational model' of rights education. Children here are more likely to take a stand in preventing or redressing human rights abuses. An example would be to support a victim of [[bullying]] and stand up against a bully in the school playground.

Research by Katherine Covell and R. Brian Howe&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130405010253/http://www.cbu.ca/crc/ Katherine Covell and R. Brian Howe]&lt;/ref&gt; (see the section on evaluations of children’s human rights education) shows evidence of the above effects.&lt;ref name=impact&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (1999). "The Impact of Children’s Rights Education: A Canadian study." ''International Journal of Children’s Rights,'' 7, 171-183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moral&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (2001). "Moral Education through the 3 Rs: Rights, Respect and Responsibility." ''Journal of Moral Education,'' 30, 31-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dead&gt;Covell, K., Howe, R.B., and McNeil, J.K. (2008). "'If there’s a dead rat, don’t leave it.' Young children's understanding of their citizenship rights and responsibilities." ''Cambridge Journal of Education,'' 38 (3), 321-339.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to children who have not received children’s rights education, children who have received children's rights education are more likely to have an accurate and adult-like understanding of rights, to understand that rights and responsibilities are related, and to display socially responsible behaviors in support of the rights of others.

==Implementation of children’s human rights education==

===Early initiatives===
Including Janusz Korczak and his rights based Warsaw orphanage, Homer Lane and his Little Commonwealth (1913) of delinquent 'prisoners', A.S. Neill's Summerhill School (1921) there have been many schools and children's communities around the world that have been founded on the rights of children. Indeed, inspired by Montessori, Homer Lane and Harriet Finley Johnson, a community of teachers, educationalists, suffragists, politicians, inspectors and cultural contributors formed a community called the  New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914-37)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/New-Ideals-in-Education-Conferences-386690128169894/?ref=bookmarks New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914-37)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newman movement"/&gt; Their founding value was 'the liberation of the child' and they sought, shared and celebrated examples of practice in schools, prisons and child communities. They contributed to the 'child centred' primary school.&lt;ref&gt;Selleck, R.J.W. (1972) English Primary Education and the Progressives, 1914-1939, p156 Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul London and Boston {{ISBN|0710072082}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been an overlooked history of the culture of the rights of the child, one that needs to be shared and celebrated to help empower children and those adults who work with them. &lt;!-- (Commenting this out for now, as it's a non sequitur. If you can add some context as to why this is pertinent to the topic, please do. Thanks!) The autobiographical novel by A.S. Neill, ''[[A Dominie's Log]]'' (1915), is a diary of a headteacher trying to liberate his children as the First World War begins.--&gt;

Since the approval by the United Nations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989, various efforts have been made to provide children's rights education in schools.&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=educate&gt;Howe, R.B., and Covell, K. (2013). ''Education in the Best Interests of the Child: A Children’s Rights Perspective on Closing the Achievement Gap.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiatives have been undertaken mainly at the level of individual classrooms and schools. Among the earliest initiatives was one in a primary school in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=belgium&gt;DeCoene, J., and  De Cock, R. (1996). "The Children's Rights Project in the Primary School 'De vrijdagmarkt' in Bruges. In E. Verhellen (Ed.), ''Monitoring children’s rights.'' (pp. 627-636). The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a comprehensive child rights education project that was introduced in the early 1990s at De Vrijdagmarkt Primary School. It involved children ages 3 to 12 with the objective of educating them about the contents of the Convention, using democratic [[pedagogy]] and ensuring child participation in the learning process. Children were taught about their rights under the Convention through a variety of media including art and poetry. Art activities included newspaper collages representing examples of rights violations. Allowance was made for child-initiated and small group activities, role-play, and group discussion. Activities that were selected were ones of relevance and interest to the children. Younger children, for example, learned about the right to food by creating a very large doll with illustrations of food. Older children engaged in discussions and role-play regarding rights to [[adoption]], education, and family.

Further examples of early initiatives were in classrooms in [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]], [[Canada]], in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt; [[Curriculum]] materials based on the Convention were developed in collaboration with children and their teachers for three grade levels. At the grade 6 level (children aged 11 to 13 years), education focused on introducing child rights in terms of their relevance to the individual child. Issues included healthy living, personal safety, families and family life, drug use, and decision-making. For example, to learn about their right to protection from [[narcotics]], students role-played children and drug dealers and examined ways of dealing with pressure to try or sell drugs. At the grade 8 level (ages 13 to 15 years), the focus was on relationships of relevance to the child. The curriculum included units on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Youth justice in Canada|youth justice]], [[child abuse]], and exploitation. For example, students analyzed popular song lyrics to discuss how rights in sexuality are represented in music, and they completed cartoons that involved the competing considerations of freedom of speech and rights against [[discrimination]].  The grade 12 curriculum (for ages 17 to 19) expanded the sphere of children’s rights knowledge with application to global issues. These issues included war-affected children and [[child labor]]. At this level, activities included holding a mock UN Conference on war-affected children where small groups had responsibility for representing the players at the conference, and a [[sweatshop]] talk show in which groups researched child labor and then held a talk show to discuss their findings.

===Hampshire, England===
Writings about the initiative in Cape Breton schools inspired a major initiative in [[Hampshire|Hampshire County]], [[England]], called Rights, Respect and Responsibility or the RRR initiative. It is among the best known and most promising models of children’s human rights education to date.&lt;ref name=implement /&gt;&lt;ref name=rrr&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (2008). "Rights, Respect and Responsibility: Final Report on the County of Hampshire Rights Education Initiative." Available at:  {{cite web |url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/education/childrensrights/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106212258/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/childrensrights/ |archivedate=2012-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an initiative that features not only individual classrooms and schools but a whole school district. The RRR initiative was impelled by the recognition among senior education administrators in Hampshire of the need for a shared values framework and positive school climate for improved learning and educational outcomes. They also were motivated by their reading of the success of the rights education project in Cape Breton.

After study leave in Cape Breton, a group of Hampshire administrators and teachers decided to pilot test and then launch their own version of child rights education in Hampshire. After successful pilot testing in 2002, they officially launched RRR in 2004.&lt;ref name=hants&gt;Hampshire Education Authority (2003). "The case for RRR." Available at: {{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/hias/childrensrights/rrrthecase.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121223170331/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/hias/childrensrights/rrrthecase.htm |archivedate=2012-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To put the objectives of RRR into effect, Hampshire authorities—with funding from the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]]—devised a three-year strategic plan of implementation. This included provisions for teacher training, development of resources, and monitoring of developments. The plan was that the initiative would first be introduced in infant, primary, and junior schools and then over time, as children went into higher grades, it would be introduced in secondary schools. By 2012, in varying degrees of implementation, the majority of Hampshire schools were participating in RRR.

The overall objective of RRR was to improve educational outcomes for children by transforming school cultures, building a shared values framework based on the Convention, and promoting educational practices consistent with the Convention. Knowledge and understanding of rights, respect, and social responsibility were to provide the values framework for all school policies, classroom practices, codes of conduct, mission statements, school regulations, and school curricula. The framework was to be put into effect across the whole school – across classrooms, across grade levels, across curricula, and across school practices. Of particular importance, consistent with children’s participation rights as described in article 12 of the Convention, behavior codes, rules, and regulations were to be developed in collaboration with the children, classroom teaching was to be democratic, and children were to be provided with numerous meaningful opportunities to participate in all aspects of school functioning.

===New Zealand===
Initiatives in Cape Breton and Hampshire have influenced developments in other schools, school districts, and even countries. Among the more ambitious developments have been seen in [[New Zealand]] where efforts are underway to make children’s human rights education a nationwide initiative. The context for the initiative is favorable. A strong human rights theme runs through New Zealand’s Education Act, national education goals, and national administrative guidelines.  In the early 2000s, initial discussions about incorporating children’s rights education into the New Zealand curriculum were given momentum by the evidence provided from the Cape Breton and Hampshire County initiatives.&lt;ref name=hrie&gt;HRiE., (2009).  "Human Rights in Education, 2009 Report." Available at: http://www.rightsined.org.nz {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029140555/http://www.rightsined.org.nz/ |date=2012-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like elsewhere, educators and human rights advocates in New Zealand had been concerned with poor achievement levels, bullying, and violent behaviors that are observed among a significant minority of children in schools. And also like elsewhere, teachers and administrators have been frustrated by the range of difficult demands in schools, the fragmentation of efforts to address common problems, and the disappointing results of those efforts. Learning about successes in the Cape Breton and Hampshire initiatives, the collaborative initiative Human Rights in Education/Mana Tika Tangata (HRiE) was formed. Its aim was to develop positive school cultures on the basis of the rights of the child and to improve achievement for all children through having schools and early childhood education centers become learning communities that know, promote, and live human rights and responsibilities.
 
To achieve this goal, HRiE has been following the Hampshire model in using children’s rights as an overarching and integrating values framework for teaching, learning, and school management and organization. All members of the school community – school leadership, teachers and other staff, students, boards of trustees, and parents – learn about children’s rights and the responsibilities that go with them. They recognize that every member of the school community has the right to be treated with dignity and to participate in effective education. Students are formally recognized as citizens of the school and country with explicit rights and responsibilities. They participate in decision-making across the school, and rights are embedded across the curriculum, school practices, and policies.

===Initiatives with preschool===
Children's rights education initiatives also have occurred at the preschool level. For example, Canadian educators Pamela Wallberg and Maria Kahn introduced rights education to an early childhood program group of 3 and 4 year-old children in [[British Columbia]] over a three-month period.&lt;ref name=wallberg&gt;Wallberg, P., and  Kahn, M. (2011). "The Rights Project: How rights education transformed a classroom." ''Canadian Children,'' 36 (1), 31-35.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of "The Rights Project" was motivated in large part by observations of the children’s self-focus and disregard for the feelings of their peers. Using a coloring book designed to teach very young children about their rights, the teachers hoped to shift the children’s focus from individual wants to community needs – to increase levels of cooperation, altruism, and empathy.

==Evaluations of children’s human rights education==
The earliest reported evaluation of a child rights education project was that of the initiative in Bruges.&lt;ref name=belgium /&gt; Involving children ages 3 to 12, the primary focus of the evaluation was on the students’ social behavior. Gains in social understanding, respectful behaviors, concern for others, and pro-social action were the key observed changes. For example, the children became more interested in social justice and rights-related issues such as peace, war, injustice, and hunger. And they wanted to discuss the rights of marginalized children – those living with disabilities, in institutions, and of ethnic minority status.

Similar outcomes were found in evaluations of the effects of children’s rights education in Cape Breton schools. Evaluations conducted on students in grades 6 and 8 (ages 12 and 14 years) showed improved [[classroom climate]], engagement, and behavior.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt; At the grade 6 level differences were found in children’s understanding of rights, their acceptance of minority children, and their perceived levels of peer and teacher support. Teachers reported improved behavior and more positive classroom climate. In addition at the grade 8 level, children in rights-based classes showed increases in their self-esteem. Similar child-initiated projects to those reported from Bruges were seen also.  For example, at one school upon realizing that not every child in the area was assured their right to nutritious food, the students initiated a breakfast program by obtaining cooperation and donations from the local community. In a different school, the class decided to work at a local [[food bank]] to help children whose families were unable to provide sufficient nutritious food.

Anecdotal data from the teachers who used the grade 12 curriculum described how engaged their students were in the activities, and noted improvements in their students’ appreciation of global problems, and of the complexity and importance of respecting human rights. Students who had participated in the project completed a survey. The results showed them to be three times more likely than their peers to understand humanitarian assistance for children in difficult circumstances as a fundamental human right.

The most comprehensive evaluation data are of the Hampshire RRR initiative.&lt;ref name=dead /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp6&gt;Covell, K., McNeil, J.K, and  Howe, R.B. (2009). "Reducing teacher burnout by increasing student engagement." ''School Psychology International,'' 30 (3), 282-290.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=implement /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp1&gt;Covell, K., and  Howe, R.B. (2011) "Rights, Respect and Responsibility in Hampshire County RRR and Resilience Report." Available at http://www3.hants.gov.uk/hampshire-rrr-resilience-full-report-2011.doc{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp2&gt;Covell, K, Howe, R.B., and Polegato, J. (2011). "Children’s human rights education as a counter to social disadvantage: A case study from England." ''Educational Research,'' 53,(2), 193- 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp3&gt;Howe, R.B., and Covell, K., (2010). "Miseducating children about their rights." ''Education, Citizenship and Social Justice,'' 5 (2), 91-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp5&gt;Covell, K. (2010). "School engagement and rights-respecting schools." ''Cambridge Journal of Education,'' 40 (1), 39-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Annual assessments over six years were conducted to assess the effects of the RRR. Included were children ages 4 – 14. Children and teachers in schools where RRR had been fully implemented were compared with those in demographically equivalent schools without RRR.  These comparisons showed the following effects of RRR. Across ages, children showed a greater understanding of rights and their relation to responsibilities, increased levels of self-regulation, confidence, effort and motivation, participation and engagement in school, and achievement. These cognitive and attitudinal changes were reflected in significant improvements in behaviors. Children were reported by both their classroom teachers and the school principal to be more respectful, cooperative, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of other children. Incidents of bullying were reduced dramatically with disagreements being resolved using the discourse of rights rather than through physical or verbal aggression.

Teaching in RRR schools also led to changes in the teachers. School administrators noted significant changes in teachers use of democratic teaching and positive classroom management, and in less confrontational dealings with their students. Teachers were listening to children and taking their views into account. And the greater the level of student engagement and participation, the more teachers showed gains in a sense of personal achievement and significant decreases in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization.

Among all the positive findings of the evaluation of the RRR, the most intriguing was that at each time of measure the most disadvantaged school showed the greatest positive changes.&lt;ref name=comp2 /&gt; Improvements in engagement, behavior and academic achievement were remarkable, and have been attributed to how the RRR transformed the culture of the school. The evidence suggests that schools that are fully consistent with the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child can mediate the effects of a challenging environment of rearing and help close the achievement gap between disadvantaged children and their more advantaged peers.&lt;ref name=educate /&gt;

==Other evaluations==
Although no formal evaluation has yet been published on the New Zealand initiative, anecdotal evidence suggests the outcomes are comparable to those reported from Hampshire.&lt;ref name=hrie /&gt; Teachers report improved learning environments and decreased stress.  "Makes me think critically about some of the things I do in my classroom", a teacher reported, "especially some of the aspects of my behavior management." Another stressed that she has "had fabulous response from the children."

Evaluation data from Pamela Wallberg and Maria Kahn show that their preschool rights project was highly successful.&lt;ref name=wallberg /&gt; They found that teaching young children about their Convention rights in an age-appropriate way transformed the learning environment. As classroom rules were replaced with rights, less adult control was needed and group conversations changed from chaotic chatter to the respectful exchange of ideas. The children’s behavior toward each other changed markedly. Their interactions reflected an understanding of the universality of rights and the importance of protecting the rights of others. And even at this very young age, rights discourse replaced arguing; for example, "you are hurting my right to play" became an effective problem solver that replaced tears and fighting. Wallberg and Kahn conclude that the children’s recognition of the relationship between rights and responsibilities shifted their focus "from 'me' to 'we'."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2726">'''Christian interpolation''' is a subsidiary category of [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|scribal interpolation in manuscript transmission]]. In [[textual criticism]] the term generally refers to the specific phenomena of textual insertion and textual damage to Jewish sources text during Christian scribal transmission, but may also refer to possible interpolation in secular Roman texts, such as the case of [[Tacitus on Christ]].

==Josephus==
{{main|Josephus on Jesus}}
Notable disputed examples in the works of [[Josephus]] include Josephus' sections on [[John the Baptist]], which is widely accepted,&lt;ref&gt;John the Baptizer and Prophet: A Sociohistorical Study - Page 39 1597529869 Robert L. Webb - 2006 "2.3 The Authenticity of Ant. 18.116-19 The authenticity of Josephus' narrative concerning John the Baptist has often been critically examined. While a few have rejected it as a Christian interpolation, most schoLars have accepted it."&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[Jesus of Nazareth]], which is widely regarded as at best damaged.&lt;ref&gt; Josephus: The Essential Writings - Page 265  Paul L. Maier - 1990 "scholars have long suspected a Christian interpolation, since Josephus would not have believed Jesus to be the ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Testament pseudepigrapha==
Notable examples among the body of texts known as [[List of Old Testament pseudepigrapha|Old Testament pseudepigrapha]] include the disputed authenticity of [[Similitudes of Enoch]] and [[4 Ezra]] which in the form transmitted by Christian scribal traditions contain arguably later Christian understanding of terms such as [[Son of Man]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Nickelsburg, “Son of Man.“ in [[Anchor Bible Dictionary]] 6.138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Enoch-Metatron Tradition - Page 82 3161485440 Andrei A. Orlov - 2005 "The same interchangeability is observable in the titles “son of man“ and “chosen one.” Here ... 88 Some scholars believe that these chapters might represent later interpolation(s) and do not '83 G. Nickelsburg, “Son of Man.“ ABD 6.138."&lt;/ref&gt; Other texts suffering significant Christian interpolation include the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]],&lt;ref&gt; The Lamb Christology of the Apocalypse of John Page 87 316148164X Loren L. Johns - 2003 " 2.2 Testament of Benjamin 3:8 The same sort of Christian interpolation is evident in Testament of Benjamin 3:8, where, according to Howard Clark Kee, "the major text traditions include a Christian interpolation."53"&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sibylline Oracles]] and so on.

'''Closed-loop communication''' is a [[communication]] technique used to avoid misunderstandings. When the sender gives a message, the receiver repeats this back. The sender then confirms the message; thereby common is using the word “''yes''”. When the receiver incorrectly repeats the message back, the sender will say “negative” (or something similar) and then repeat the correct message. If the sender (person giving the message) does not get a reply back, she must repeat it until the receiver starts closing the loop. To get the attention of the receiver, the sender can use the receiver's name or functional position, touch his or her shoulder, etc.

[[File:CODICOLOGY.jpg|thumb|upright|Codicological signs]]
'''Codicology''' (from [[Latin]] {{Lang|la|[[codex]]}}, [[genitive]] {{Lang|la|codicis}}, "notebook, book"; 
and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{Lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is the study of [[codex|codices]] or manuscript books written on parchment (or paper) as physical objects. It is often referred to as 'the archaeology of the book', concerning itself with the materials ([[parchment]], sometimes referred to as membrane or [[vellum]], [[paper]], pigments, inks and so on), and techniques used to make books, including their binding.

There are no clear-cut definitions: some codicologists say that their field encompasses [[palaeography]], the study of handwriting, while some palaeographers say that their field encompasses codicology. The study of written features such as [[marginalia]], [[glosses]], ownership inscriptions, etc. falls in both camps, as does the study of the [[illuminated manuscript|physical aspects of decoration]], which otherwise belongs to [[art history]].

By a close examination of the physical attributes of a book, it is sometimes possible to establish the history and provenance of a book, or to match up long-separated elements originally from the same book.  Palaeographers and codicologists may also study the history of libraries, manuscript-collecting and of book-cataloguing.

'''Communication design''' is a mixed discipline between [[design]] and information-development which is concerned with how [[media (communication)|media]] intervention such as [[printing|printed]], [[craft]]ed, [[electronic media]] or [[presentations]] communicate with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the [[message]] aside from the [[aesthetic]]s in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Some designers use [[graphic design]] and communication design interchangeably due to overlapping skills.

Communication design can also refer to a systems-based approach, in which the totality of media and messages within a culture or organization are designed as a single integrated process rather than a series of discrete efforts. This is done through communication channels that aim to inform and attract the attention of the people one are focusing one's skills on. Design skills must be tailored to fit to different cultures of people, while maintaining pleasurable visual design. These are all important pieces of information to add to a media communications kit to get the best results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgiar.org/www-archive/www.cgiar.org/communicationstoolkit/pdf/Developing%20a%20Communication%20Plan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413032136/http://www.cgiar.org/www-archive/www.cgiar.org/communicationstoolkit/pdf/Developing%20a%20Communication%20Plan.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the discipline of Communication, a framework for Communication as Design has emerged that focuses on redesigning interactivity and shaping communication [[Affordance|affordances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aakhus|first=Mark|date=2007-03-01|title=Communication as Design|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637750701196383|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=74|issue=1|pages=112–117|doi=10.1080/03637750701196383|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software and applications create opportunities for and place constraints on communication. Recently, Guth and Brabham examined the way that ideas compete within a [[crowdsourcing]] platform, providing a model about the relationships among design ideas, communication, and platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guth|first=Kristen L.|last2=Brabham|first2=Daren C.|date=2017-08-04|title=Finding the diamond in the rough: Exploring communication and platform in crowdsourcing performance|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637751.2017.1359748|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–24|doi=10.1080/03637751.2017.1359748|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors have interviewed technology company founders about the democratic ideals they build into the design of [[e-government]] applications and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brabham|first=Daren C.|last2=Guth|first2=Kristen L.|date=2017-08-01|title=The Deliberative Politics of the Consultative Layer: Participation Hopes and Communication as Design Values of Civic Tech Founders|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12316/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=67|issue=4|pages=445–475|doi=10.1111/jcom.12316|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the Communication as Design framework is growing among researchers. 

==Overview==
Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic [[business]] thinking, using [[market research]], [[creativity]], and [[problem-solving]]. Communications designers translate ideas and information through a variety of media. Their particular talent lies not only in the traditional skills of the hand, but also in their ability to think strategically in design and marketing terms, in order to establish credibility through the communication.

The term communication design is often used interchangeably with [[visual communication]], but has an alternative broader meaning that includes [[Auditory system|auditory]], vocal, touch and smell. Examples of communication design include [[information architecture]], [[editing]], [[typography]], [[illustration]], [[web design]], [[animation]], [[advertising]], [[ambient media]], [[Brand management|visual identity design]], [[performing arts]], [[copywriting]] and [[professional writing]] skills applied in the [[creative industries]].

==Education==
Students of communication design learn how to create visual messages and broadcast them to the world in new and meaningful ways. In the complex [[digital environment]] around us, communication design has become a powerful means of reaching out to the [[target audience]]. Students learn how to combine communication with [[art]] and [[technology]]. Communication Design discipline involves teaching how to design [[Web page|web pages]], [[Video game|video games]], [[animation]], [[motion graphics]] and more.

Communication Design has content as its main purpose. It must achieve a reaction, or get customer to see a product in a genuine way to attract sales or get across a message. Students of Communications Design are often Illustrators, Graphic Designers, Web designers, Advertising artists, Animators, Video Editors or Motion graphic artists, or even printmakers and conceptual artists. The term Communications Design is fairly general and practitioners work in various mediums to get a message across.

'''Comparative law''' is the study of differences and similarities between the [[law]] ([[List of national legal systems|legal systems]]) of different countries. More specifically, it involves the study of the different legal "systems" (or "families") in existence in the world, including the [[common law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[socialist law]], [[Canon law]], [[Halakha|Jewish Law]], [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[Hindu law]], and [[Chinese law]]. It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken. The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism, [[economic globalization]], and democratization.

==History==
The origins of modern Comparative Law can be traced back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1667 in his Latin-language book Nova Methodus Discendae Docendaeque Iurisprudentiae (New Methods of Studying and Teaching Jurisprudence).  Chapter 7 (Presentation of Law as the Project for all Nations, Lands and Times) introduces the idea of classifying Legal Systems into several families. Notably, a few years earlier, Leibnitz introduced an idea of Language families.

Although every Legal System is unique, Comparative Law through studies of their similarities and differences allows for classification of Legal Systems, wherein Law Families is the basic level of the classification. The main differences between Law Families are found in the source(s) of Law, the role of court precedents, the origin and development of the Legal System. [[Montesquieu]] is generally regarded as an early founding figure of comparative law. His comparative approach is obvious in the following excerpt from Chapter III of Book I of his masterpiece, ''[[De l'esprit des lois]]'' (1748; first translated by Thomas Nugent, 1750):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit of the Laws|author=Baron De Montesquieu|place=New York |publisher=Hafner |year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|[T]he political and civil laws of each nation ... should be adapted in such a manner to the people for whom they are framed that it should be a great chance if those of one nation suit another.

They should be in relation to the nature and principle of each government: whether they form it, as may be said of politic laws; or whether they support it, as in the case of civil institutions.

They should be in relation to the climate of each country, to the quality of its soil, to its situation and extent, to the principal occupation of the natives, whether husbandmen, huntsmen, or shepherds: they should have relation to the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear; to the religion of the inhabitants, to their inclinations, riches, numbers, commerce, manners, and customs.}}

Also, in Chapter XI (entitled 'How to compare two different Systems of Laws') of Book XXIX, discussing the French and English systems for punishment of false witnesses, he advises that "to determine which of those systems is most agreeable to reason, we must take them each as a whole and compare them in their entirety." Yet another place where Montesquieu's comparative approach is evident is the following, from Chapter XIII of Book XXIX:

[[Image:HSMaine.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|Sir [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], British jurist and first professor of comparative law at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].]]
{{quote|As the civil laws depend on the political institutions, because they are made for the same society, whenever there is a design of adopting the civil law of another nation, it would be proper to examine beforehand whether they have both the same institutions and the same political law.}}

The modern founding figure of comparative and [[legal anthropology|anthropological]] jurisprudence was Sir [[Henry Maine]], a British jurist and legal historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEk-Fpdw4MYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sir Henry Maine: A Study in Victorian Jurisprudence|author=Raymond Cocks|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1861 work ''[[Ancient Law|Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation to Modern Ideas]]'', he set out his views on the development of legal institutions in primitive societies and engaged in a comparative discussion of [[Far East|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|West]]ern legal traditions. This work placed comparative law in its historical context and was widely read and influential.

The first university course on the subject was established at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1869, with Maine taking up the position of professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/358681/Sir-Henry-Maine|title=Sir Henry Maine|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative law in the US was brought by a legal scholar fleeing persecution in Germany, [[Rudolf Schlesinger]]. Schlesinger eventually became professor of comparative law at [[Cornell Law School]] helping to spread the discipline throughout the US.

==Purpose==
Comparative law is an academic discipline that involves the study of legal systems, including their constitutive elements and how they differ,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kristoffel Grechenig &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295-360''] comparing German style and U.S. style legal scholarship&lt;/ref&gt; and how their elements combine into a system.

Several disciplines have developed as separate branches of comparative law, including comparative [[constitutional law]], comparative [[administrative law]], comparative [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] (in the sense of the law of [[tort]]s, [[delict]]s, [[contract]]s and [[Law of obligations|obligations]]), comparative [[commercial law]] (in the sense of [[Companies law|business organisations]] and trade), and comparative [[criminal law]]. Studies of these specific areas may be viewed as micro- or macro-comparative legal analysis, i.e. detailed comparisons of two countries, or broad-ranging studies of several countries. Comparative civil law studies, for instance, show how the law of private relations is organised, interpreted and used in different systems or countries. The purposes of comparative law are:
* To attain a deeper knowledge of the legal systems in effect
* To perfect the legal systems in effect
* Possibly, to contribute to a unification of legal systems, of a smaller or larger scale (cf. for instance, the [[UNIDROIT]] initiative)

==Relationship with other legal subjects==
Comparative law is different from the fields of general [[jurisprudence]] (legal theory), [[international law]], including both [[public international law]] and [[private international law]] (also known as [[conflict of laws]]).

Despite the differences between comparative law and these other legal fields, comparative law helps inform all of these areas of normativity. For example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the [[United Nations System]], in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations. Comparative law would be applicable to private international law when developing an approach to interpretation in a conflicts analysis. Comparative law may contribute to legal theory by creating categories and concepts of general application. Comparative law may also provide insights into the question of [[legal transplants]], i.e. the transplanting of law and legal institutions from one system to another. The notion of [[legal transplants]] was coined by [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]], one of the world's renowned legal scholars specializing in comparative law.

Also, the usefulness of comparative law for [[sociology of law]] and [[law and economics]] (and vice versa) is very large. The comparative study of the various legal systems may show how different legal regulations for the same problem function in practice. Conversely, sociology of law and law &amp; economics may help comparative law answer questions, such as: 
* How do regulations in different legal systems really function in the respective societies? 
* Are legal rules comparable? 
* How do the similarities and differences between legal systems get explained?

==Classifications of legal systems==

===Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff===
Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff&lt;ref&gt;''Traité de droit comparé'' – in French; Paris 1950–1952&lt;/ref&gt; believed that, for purposes of classifying the (then) contemporary legal systems of the world, it was required that those systems ''per se'' get studied, irrespective of external factors, such as geographical ones. They proposed the classification of legal system into seven groups, or so-called 'families', in particular the

* [[Law of France|French group]], under which they also included the countries that codified their law either in 19th or in the first half of the 20th century, using the [[Napoleonic code|Napoleonic ''code civil'']] of year 1804 as a model; this includes countries and jurisdictions such as Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, [[Louisiana]], various South American states such as Brazil, [[Quebec]], [[Saint Lucia]], the [[Ionian Islands]], Egypt, and [[Lebanon]]
* [[Law of Germany|German group]]
* Scandinavian group, comprising the laws of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland
* [[Common law|English group]], including, ''inter alia'', England, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
* Russian group
* [[Sharia|Islamic group]] (used in the [[Muslim world]])
* [[Hindu law|Hindu group]]

===David===
[[René David]]&lt;ref&gt;''Traité élémentaire de droit civil comparé: Introduction à l'étude des droits étrangers et à la méthode comparative'' - in French; Paris, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families:
* [[Western world|Western]] Laws, a group subdivided into the:
** [[Romano-Germanic law|Romano-Germanic subgroup]] (comprising those legal systems where legal science was formulated according to [[Roman Law]] – see [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]])
** [[Common law|Anglo-Saxon subgroup]]
* [[Law of the Soviet Union|Soviet Law]]
* [[Sharia|Muslim Law]]
* [[Hindu law|Hindu Law]]
* [[Chinese law|Chinese Law]]
* [[Jewish Law]]
Especially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Anglo-Saxon Laws and Romano-German Laws, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between (say) the Italian and the American Law, and of a different kind that between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese Law. According to David, the Romano-Germanic legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law, whereas common law countries are those where law was created from the judges. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are
* liberal democracy
* capitalist economy
* Christian religion

===Zweigert and Kötz===
Konrad Zweigert and [[Hein Kötz]] propose a different, multidimensional methodology for categorizing laws, i.e. for ordering families of laws. They maintain that, to determine such families, five criteria should be taken into account, in particular: the historical background, the characteristic way of thought, the different institutions, the recognized sources of law, and the dominant ideology. Using the aforementioned criteria, they classify the legal systems of the world into six families:&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''An Introduction to Comparative Law'', translation from the German original: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung auf dem Gebiete des Privatrechts'' by Tony Weir, 3rd edition; Oxford, 1998. {{ISBN|9780198268598}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roman law|Roman family]]
* [[Law of Germany|German family]]
* [[Common law|Common law family]]
* Nordic family
* Family of the laws of the [[Far East]] (China and Japan)
* Religious family (Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu law)

Up to the second German edition of their introduction to comparative law, Zweigert and Kötz also used to mention [[Socialist law|Soviet or socialist law]] as another family of laws.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung''. 3rd edition. 1996. Mohr Siebeck. Tübingen. 1996. {{ISBN|3-16-146548-2}} (Hein Kötz mentions in the preface to the third edition on page&amp;nbsp;V that the fall of "soviet communism" also made an end to the "soviet family of laws", which made it possible to save some 60&amp;nbsp;pages as compared to the 2nd edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Content and language integrated learning''' ('''CLIL''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/think/knowledge-wiki/clil British Council BBC Teaching English]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson &amp; McKinley|title=Integration of content and language learning|journal=TESOL Encyclopedia of English Language Teaching|date=Feb 2018|volume=1|url=http://www.englishappliedlinguistics.com/uploads/2/4/1/9/2419477/integration_of_content_and_langauge_tesol_encyclopedia_author_version.pdf|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach for learning content through an additional language (foreign or second), thus teaching both the subject and the language. 

==CLIL origin==
The term '''CLIL''' was created in 1994 by  [http://clil-cd.ecml.at/Team/Teammember4/tabid/941/language/en-GB/Default.aspx David Marsh] as a methodology similar to but distinct from [[language immersion]] and [[content-based instruction]]. The idea of its proponents was to create an "umbrella term" which encompasses different forms of using language as the medium of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.onestopenglish.com/clil/what-is-clil/ | title=What is CLIL? | work=Onestopenglish | accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology has been applied in a business context in many countries and widely accepted as an effective approach. In Italy for example, it is being used as an accelerated method to teach management concepts in English to business people. Among CLIL's proponents and practitioners there is Dr Maurizio Morselli, a Human Resources professional and Executive Coach, who believes that "this hybrid immersion approach produces a lot more immediate results and it appeals to self-motivated adult audiences who possess a basic knowledge and understanding of the target language".

==CLIL and language immersion==
CLIL is fundamentally based on methodological principles established by research on [[language immersion]]. This kind of approach has been identified as very important by the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2003:0449:FIN:EN:PDF Commission Of The European Communities Promoting Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity: An Action Plan 2004 – 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; because: "It can provide effective opportunities for pupils to use their new language skills now, rather than learn them now for use later. It opens doors on languages for a broader range of learners, nurturing self-confidence in young learners and those who have not responded well to formal language instruction in general education. It provides exposure to the language without requiring extra time in the curriculum, which can be of particular interest in vocational settings." This approach involves learning subjects such as history, geography, managerial skills/concepts or others, through an additional language. It can be very successful in enhancing the learning of languages and other subjects, and helping children develop a positive attitude towards themselves as language learners. 

The European Commission has therefore decided to promote the training of teachers to "...enhancing the language competences in general, in order to promote the teaching of non-linguistic subjects in foreign languages".&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:320:0001:0003:EN:PDF Journal of the European Union Council Resolution of 21 November 2008 on a European strategy for multilingualism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An educational project called [http://e-clil.uws.ac.uk/ ECLIL] was also supported from the European Union within the [http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/llp/index_en.php Lifelong Learning Programme EACEA Agency], to develop interactive resources for European schools.&lt;/ref&gt;

==CLIL objectives==
CLIL objectives are varied, but among the most relevant ones the following can be pointed out (Coyle et al., 2010)&lt;ref&gt;Coyle, D., Hood, P. &amp; Marsh, D. (2010). CLIL. Cambridge: C.U.P.&lt;/ref&gt;: To improve the educational system. To establish the necessary conditions that will allow students to achieve the appropriate level of academic performance in CLIL subjects. To improve students’ proficiency in both their mother tongue and the target language, attaching the same importance to each. To develop the intercultural understanding. To develop social and thinking skills.

CLIL advocates claim that this educational approach (Lorenzo et al., 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo, F., Trujillo, F. &amp; Vez, M. (2011). Educación bilingüe. Integración de contenidos y segundas lenguas. Madrid: Síntesis.&lt;/ref&gt;: Improves L1 and L2 development. Prepares students for the globalized world. Increases students’ motivation to learn foreign languages. Promotes the learning of a more extensive and varied vocabulary. Enhances students’ confidence in the target language. Improves language competence in the target language, CLIL being more beneficial that traditional foreign language teaching courses. Helps develop intercultural competence.

==CLIL in English as an international language==
The integration of content and language learning in [[international English|English as an international language]] (EIL) is found in approaches to [[bilingual education]].&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches include [[language immersion|immersion]], [[content-based instruction]] (CBI), content-based language teaching (CBLT), and the movement towards [[English-medium education|English medium instruction]] (EMI). All of these approaches raise a number of questions that a view of English as an international language has for content-integrated approaches (Thompson &amp; McKinley, 2018).&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiplicity of terms===
The multiplicity of terms used to refer to instructional approaches for the integration of content and language learning (immersion, CBI, CBLT, CLIL, EMI) can be a source of confusion in EIL studies, although they all commonly share the purpose of additive bilingualism via a dual focus on content and language learning. Debate continues about the extent to which immersion, CBLT, CBI, and CLIL are different, similar, or the same. Some argue that CLIL represents an appropriate umbrella term that can be used to house various approaches towards content integration (e.g., immersion is a type of CLIL), where terms can be used interchangeably (e.g., CLIL and CBI are the same concept with a different name) (Cenoz et al., 2014).&lt;ref name="Cenoz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cenoz, Gennessee &amp; Gorter|title=Critical analysis of CLIL: Taking stock and looking forward.|journal=Applied Linguistics|date=2014|volume=35|issue=3|pages=243-262}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that CLIL and CBI represent very different concepts, where CLIL represents the intersection between content and language from the content perspective (i.e., CLIL happens in content classes), while CBI is an attempt at responding to the content needs of learners in language classes (Dalton-Puffer et al., 2014).&lt;ref name="Dalton-Puffer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalton-Puffer, Llinares, Lorenzo &amp; Nikula|title=“You can stand under my umbrella”: Immersion, clil and bilingual education.

The similarities (and variability) between approaches lead to circular arguments about whether the key features of one approach are also shared by others (e.g., immersion and CLIL), and therefore they are indistinguishable. In some ways, this is an inevitable result of terms being used outside of academia, by educators applying ideas from one context to another,&lt;ref name="Dalton-Puffer"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the lines of demarcation become more unclear as approaches are transported to different countries and contextualized to meet different learning situations.&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In EIL studies, different terms have been associated with different regions, such as CLIL, which is associated with Europe, and was “purposefully coined” by European educators and researchers attempting to influence language policy and ideology (Dalton-Puffer et al., 2014:214).&lt;ref name="Dalton-Puffer"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; CLIL represented a deliberate attempt to develop a European model for additive bilingual education.&lt;ref name="Cenoz"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[policy-maker|policy makers]], educators, and researchers from international contexts have started to apply and develop CLIL approaches in distinctly non-European situations, and the term is now widely used within the wider international foreign language learning community.&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital rhetoric''' is a way of informing, persuading, and inspiring action in an audience through [[digital media]]. It is an advancing form of communication composed, created, and distributed through [[multimedia]] platforms. [[Rhetoric]] combines multiple methods such as [[persuasion]], effective writing, and effective speaking to present information in inventive ways.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, G. (n.d.). What is Rhetoric? Retrieved December 3, 2014, from [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/encompassing%20terms/rhetoric.htm What is Rhetoric?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105226/http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Encompassing%20Terms/rhetoric.htm |date=2014-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of rhetoric has changed over time, developing with changes in technologies. Online media are increasingly used as communication and information platforms, and since more text is placed online, there is more opportunity for persuasion through innovative and creative means. Because of this shift in rhetoric, the relationship between writers and readers has changed in form, communication style, and effectiveness. Digital rhetoric is advancing and changing how people choose to communicate their ideas with broader audiences. Both rhetoric and digital rhetoric hold various meanings and definitions depending upon who is looking at it; for example, the online journal ''[http://harlotofthearts.org/index.php/harlot Harlot of the Arts]'' holds a competition through Twitter for people to define rhetoric, and the submissions are extremely varied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harlotofthearts.org/index.php/harlot/article/view/242/153/|title=#DefineRhetoric 2014|work=Harlot of the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Definition===

The term digital rhetoric was coined by [[rhetoric]]ian Richard A. Lanham in his 1993 essay collection, ''The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo3661152.html|title=The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts|author=Lanham, R. A.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1994|isbn=9780226468853}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, rhetorician [[Elizabeth Losh]]&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[http://losh.ucsd.edu/ Elizabeth Losh]&lt;/ref&gt; offered this four-part definition of digital rhetoric in her book, ''Virtualpolitik'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Losh, E.|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/virtualpolitik|title=Virtualpolitik|year=2009|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262123044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The conventions of new digital genres that are used for everyday discourse, as well as for special occasions, in average people's lives.
# [[Public rhetoric]],  often in the form of political messages from government institutions, is represented or recorded through digital technology and disseminated via electronically distributed networks.
#  The emerging scholarly discipline concerned with the rhetorical interpretation of computer-generated media as objects of study.
# Mathematical theories of communication from the field of information science, many of which attempt to quantify the amount of uncertainty in a given linguistic exchange or the likely paths through which messages travel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Losh|first1=Elizabeth|title=Virtualpolitik: An Electronic History of Government Media-Making in a Time of War, Scandal, Disaster, Miscommunication, and Mistakes|date=2009|publisher=MIT|pages=47–48|url=http://gossettphd.org/library/losh_hackingaristotle.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023101108/http://gossettphd.org/library/losh_hackingaristotle.pdf|archivedate=23 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Losh's definition demonstrates that digital rhetoric is a heterodoxical field, one that relies on different methods to study various permutations of information: as code, as text, as visuals, as videos, and so on.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Though influenced by Lanham and Losh, Douglas Eyman also offers a definition of digital rhetoric in his 2015 book ''Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice'': “... the application of rhetorical theory (as analytic method or heuristic for production) to digital texts and performances”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/13030181.0001.001/1:5/--digital-rhetoric-theory-method-practice?g=dculture;rgn=div1;view=fulltext;xc=1|title=Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice|last=Eyman|first=Douglas|date=2015|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472052684|language=en|doi=10.3998/dh.13030181.0001.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|44}} Eyman’s definition demonstrates that digital rhetoric can be applied in two ways: 1) as an analytic method, digital rhetoric can be used to analyze a digital text, and 2) as a heuristic for production. It offers rhetorical questions that a composer can use to create digital texts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Eyman locates the emerging field of digital rhetoric as interdisciplinary in nature, enriched by related fields such as, but not limited to: [[digital literacy]], visual rhetoric, new media, human-computer interaction and critical code studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|45}}

===Scope of influence===
As the power of technology grows, so too do the uses and scope of digital rhetoric. This includes schools offering online classes and test-taking, online news sources including scholarly journals and online editions of newspapers, and people searching for information online rather than consult a more traditional means such as an [[encyclopedia]]. Teachers can use [[podcast]]s, YouTube videos, and [[social media]] sites like Facebook and LinkedIn to facilitate discussions and increase students' interest in a topic. In addition, they can make use of distance learning modules, as a form of online teaching. In academia, online journals allow for information to be more accessible due to the use of digital rhetoric. Writers also have more opportunities to write in various formats instead of a traditional linear format. In social media, people come into contact with digital rhetoric on a daily basis whether it be an updated Facebook status, a 140 character tweet, or even the use of [[visual rhetoric]] on websites such as Instagram. Social media is being used universally to allow for people to connect from all places. The choice of one's rhetoric can influence and alter other peoples opinions and thoughts on certain subjects impacting the ideology of collective identity vs. individual identities.&lt;ref name="Sparby"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sparby|first=Erika|date=April 2018|title=Digital Social Media and Aggression: Memetic Rhetoric in 4chan’s Collective Identity|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S8755461516300810|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scope of influence that digital rhetoric obtains can also be seen in commercial branding and politics.

====Education====
The urge for digital rhetoric to be introduced to classrooms is the fact that in the era of Web 2.0, quite a proportion of school managements and instructors stick to the traditional rhetoric and resist the pervasiveness of technology. For the first time, the knowledge taught at and the methods employed by the academia are far behind the social and cultural advancement, rather than leading it. As Clark (2010) argues, "...the traditional essayistic literacy ... needs to be replaced by an intentional pedagogy of digital rhetoric that emphasizes the civic importance of education...".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=J. Elizabeth|date=2010|title=The Digital Imperative: Making the Case for a 21st-Century Pedagogy|url=|journal=Computers and Composition: An International Journal for Teachers of Writing|volume=27|pages=27–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In universities, courses on digital rhetoric are taught at the graduate and undergraduate level as courses in English, Communication, and Media Studies departments. Courses in digital rhetoric study the interactions between users and digital texts, as well as how different backgrounds such as age, ethnicity, gender and more can affect these interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|title=Teaching Digital Rhetoric: Community, Critical Engagement, and Application|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/197069/pdf|journal=Pedagogy|volume= 6| issue =  2|pages=231–259|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; By studying digital rhetoric in this way, students are able to better understand the uses and purpose of digital rhetoric in the modern world.

Scholars like Jeff Grabill contribute to the use of digital rhetoric by pushing for its use in the classroom. Grabill embraces the age of technology and encourages his contemporaries to do so as well. His backgrounds in English, education, and technology and work in those fields make him a gateway between the scholarly field of digital rhetoric and its implementation. Another scholar, Cheryl Ball,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ceball.com/ Cheryl Ball]&lt;/ref&gt; specializes in areas that consist of [[wikt:multimodal|multimodal]] composition and editing practices, digital media scholarship, and digital publishing. She also focuses on university writing [[pedagogy]]. Ball teaches people to write and compose multimodal texts by analyzing rhetorical options and choosing the most appropriate genres, technologies, media, and modes for a particular situation. During her own education, Ball made significant advances in the digital rhetoric field by completing her school's first electronic and interactive thesis. She also received tenure at another university using the first all-digital tenure portfolio. For her undergraduate course, Clark created and employed a set of practices, including ePortfolios, digital stories, online games, ''Second Life,'' and blogs. In doing so, she managed to "engage(s) students in the interactivity, collaboration, ownership, authority, and malleability of texts".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In another approach, Douglas Eyman recommends a course in web authoring and design that provides undergraduates more practical instruction in the production and rhetorical understanding of digital texts. Moreover, he explains that web authoring and design for digital rhetoric instruction provides opportunities for students to learn fundamentals of web writing and design conventions, rules and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Digital rhetoric: Theory, Method, and Practice|last1=Eyman|first=Douglas|first2=|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-472-07268-2|location=|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attention to multimodality has &amp;nbsp;also influenced ''Understanding Rhetoric: A Graphic Guide to Writing''  by Elizabeth Losh and Alexander Jonathan, which emphasized engaging the comic form of literacy.

Digital rhetoric pedagogy has been further developed in the secondary level of education due to support at the university level. This allows for students to create and edit projects simultaneously through the internet. Collaboration is seen as one of the biggest advantages to digital rhetoric, as it gives students and teachers the ability to collaborate and critique anywhere anytime. By being educated in various forms of technology, students are exposed to a more multimodal world and teachers foster a more well-rounded learning environment. Through digital writing, students have a broader choice of composing to fit their needs.  Students can have people see their work anywhere, which reflects the accessibility of social media that students are used to in their everyday lives.

==== Politics ====
The increase in [[Digitization|digitalization]] of media has amplified the importance of digital rhetoric in politics as it has introduced a new relationship between politicians and the citizenry. Digital communication platforms and social networking sites (SNS) are means of allowing citizens to share information and engage in debate with other people of similar or distinct political ideologies. The topics and ideas communicated through digital rhetoric have been shown to influence and predict the political behavior of individuals outside the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;Itai Himelboim , Ruthann Weaver Lariscy , Spencer F. Tinkham &amp; Kaye D.Sweetser (2012) Social Media and Online Political Communication: The Role of Interpersonal informational Trust and Openness, Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, 56:1, 92-93, DOI:10.1080/08838151.2011.6486821&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians have been known to use digital rhetoric as a tool to communicate information to the citizens. Likewise, digital rhetoric  has enabled  increasing political participation. Theoretical political research on digital rhetoric has attributed to the increase of political participation to three models; these include the motivation model, learning model, and attitude model. In 2008, the first wide scale political campaign through Twitter was utilized by President Obama. This success is measured in the over half a billion dollars raised through the internet. This use of social media has become a large asset for all political candidates and is currently utilized by all. The 2016 elections brought social media to the forefront and all presidential candidates utilized different forms of persuasion in their 140 character tweets.

* The motivation model proposes that digital rhetoric has decreased the opportunity costs of participating in politics since it makes information readily available to the people. 
* The learning model established the increase in political participation to the vast amount of political information available in the internet which increases the inclusion of the citizens in the political process. 
* The attitude model extended from the previous two by suggesting that digital rhetoric has changed the perception of citizens towards politics, particularly by providing interactive tools that allow people to engage in the political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Liang|last1=Jiang|title=Why context matters: the role of campaign context in the relationship between digital media use and political participation|journal=[[Australian Journal of Political Science]]|volume=52|number=4|pages=580–598|doi=10.1080/10361146.2017.1373064|date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media incorporates numerous characteristics of interactions between people in the public sphere. Social media is not  characterized as an ideal public sphere because it fails to provide equitable access to information and participation for women and minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Lisa M.|last1=Kruse|first2=Dawn R.|last2=Norris|first3=Jonathan R.|last3=Flinchum|title=Social Media as a Public Sphere? Politics on Social Media|journal=[[The Sociological Quarterly]]|volume=59|number=1|pages=62–66|doi=10.1080/00380253.2017.1383143|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, social media has shown to be  useful in the propagation of digital rhetoric for political campaigns as shown in Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns in which digital rhetoric made its first successful appearance at a U.S presidential  election — which marked a guideline for future elections.&lt;ref&gt;Petros Iosifidis &amp; Mark Wheeler (2018) Modern Political Communication and Web 2.0 in Representative Democracies, Javnost - The Public, 25:1-2, 111-112, DOI:10.1080/13183222.2018.1418962&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of digital media companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Twitter has been well established in the promotion of digital rhetoric for political purposes. These firms have influenced the political process by providing strategic information about people [[demographics]], behaviors, attitudes, and interests, all of which have increased the efficiency of political discourse — especially for political campaigns. In 2013, Twitter released a manual targeted towards politicians that outlined the main features of their platform and how they can be used to increase political communications. In 2018, Facebook devoted $62,500 dollars to create a space for politicians to learn ways in which they can use digital rhetoric in Facebook to increase the impact of there campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Daniel|last1=Kreiss|first2=Shannon C.|last2=McGregor|title=Technology Firms Shape Political Communication: The Work of Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, and Google With Campaigns During the 2016 U.S. Presidential Cycle|journal=[[Political Communication (journal)|Political Communication]]|volume=35|issue=2|pages=156–157|doi=10.1080/10584609.2017.1364814|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steir conducted a study to analyze the different types of rhetoric that took place in social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter; during the 2013 election campaign for the German [[Bundestag]], he found that the types  of information that politicians share on both platforms varied — Facebook was found to be the preferred medium for campaign rhetoric while Twitter was mostly utilized for rhetoric regarding political debates, infrastructure discussions, and  law and order.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Stier, Arnim Bleier, Haiko Lietz &amp; Markus Strohmaier (2018) Election Campaigning on Social Media: Politicians, Audiences, and the Mediation of Political Communication on Facebook and Twitter, Political Communication, 35:1, 50-74, DOI: 10.1080/10584609.2017.1334728&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Trump often lacks factual references and has bombastic language that leads to a heavy emphasis on emotional rhetoric. Majority of his tweets lack factual basis that can withstand empirical verification.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McConnell|first=Stephen J.|date=December 2015|title=TWITTER AND THE 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: A RHETORICAL ANALYSIS OF TWEETS AND MEDIA COVERAGE|url=http://sjmcconnell.com/donaldtrumptwitter/|journal=New York University, Master's Thesis|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If taken a position the language used is vague and abstract. Nearly a quarter of Trump's tweets are Ad Hominem. Mostly, utilizing pathos Trump's twitter is now a major play in the world of politics.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Bernie Sanders uses Twitter in response to political events, issues, or fact. 82% of Sanders tweets state a position.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Through these position-based tweets he also makes claim of "values" of himself, his political party, or Americans. While values are not a truth, they are considered a pseudo-truth. These blend together the strong uses of logos as well as pathos.

Hillary Clinton's tweets are mainly driven by facts, logos. This increases the validation through empirical means. Her tweets are written with direct reference to evidence or concrete situation. However, can contain ambiguous language that makes the merit of degree of truth less clear. Clinton also lacks emotive language in her messages, sticking only to the facts.

Jeb Bush employs rhetoric that is mainly fact oriented, with occasional ambiguity. Bush mostly Tweets with ethos through pseudo-concepts. Unlike other candidates, he makes moral statements. Bush's rhetoric mixes logos, pathos, and ethos.

[[Digital media]] has increased its domination of the political sphere, especially with social media. [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Instagram]] have become a significant part of the political engagement process with regard to elections, campaigns, or elected officials trying to connect with their constituencies. Social media globalizes communication. Especially political communication, fostering discussions and connecting communities as it reaches a significant amount of people.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Wendy|last2=Tinati|first2=Ramine|last3=Jennings|first3=Will|date=2018-01-05|title=From Brexit to Trump: Social Media’s Role in Democracy|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8267982/|journal=Computer|language=en-US|volume=51|issue=1|pages=18–27|doi=10.1109/mc.2018.1151005|issn=0018-9162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst all of these outlets, Twitter is the form of social media that’s primarily used by candidates running for public office, elected officials, and government agencies.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

* Currently, in the 115th Congress, 428 out of 435 members of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] have Twitter.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2017-05-23-congress-seed-list|title=A List of Twitter Handles for Members of Congress|work=Social Feed Manager|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On the [[United States Senate|Senate]] side, all 100 members are active on Twitter.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Members of Congress use Twitter, and other forms of social media, to connect with their constituency. Members use social media to convey their stances on important issues, bills they have sponsored or have positions on. They use it to post about events they are hosting and the work they do in Congress. This includes meetings with constituents in Washington and back in their districts. According to former [[George Miller (California politician)|Congressman George Miller]], Twitter is a mechanism to answer questions from people in his district.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Rolfe Daus|date=December 2012|title=To tweet or not to tweet: Exploring the determinants of early adoption of Twitter by House members in the 111th Congress|journal=The Social Science Journal|volume=49|issue=4|pages=430–438|doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2012.07.002|issn=0362-3319|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[John Culberson|Representative John Culberson]] said he uses Twitter to assist people in engaging themselves in their government.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Many of these sites provide features for people to connect with their elected officials. For example, on Facebook the Town Hall feature connects users with their federal, and state officials. According to [[Pew Research Center|PEW Research center]] 20% of people who use social media have taken advantage of the fact that they can connect very easily with their officials by a simple “like” or “follow.”&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2012/PIP_SocialMediaAndPoliticalEngagement_PDF.pdf|title=Social Media and Political Engagement|last=Rainie, Smith, Schlozman, Brady, Verba|first=Lee, Aaron, Kay Lehman, Henry, Sidney|date=October 2012|website=PEW Research Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In addition, there have also been various trends in the differences of uses between political parties in the United States and their usage of social media. In the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]], when Twitter was still fairly new; over half of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] members of the House of Representatives were active on twitter.
* When it comes to citizens, according to PEW, 32% of conservatives follow their elected officials on Twitter, and 27% of Democrats follow their officials.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/10/19/social-media-and-political-engagement/|title=Social Media and Political Engagement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media has a significant influence on political campaigns. The use of social media helps both candidates and constituents connect with one another. During the 2016 election cycle, candidates would post 5-7 times and would tweet 11-12 times a day.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Christine|date=July 2017|title=Introduction : Social Media, Political Marketing and the 2016 U.S. Election|journal=Journal of Political Marketing|volume=16|issue=3–4|pages=207–211|via=|doi=10.1080/15377857.2017.1345828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For candidates, Facebook brings publicity and enables them to communicate effectively to the voters.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; This information has become very valuable for candidates. One super Political Action Committee that was anti-Trump, spent $9.9 million dollars in digital media. For candidates, social media provides them with a platform to highlight their ideas, and curate what they would like voters to see.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to the PEW research center, 35% of users of social media have taken advantage of sites like Facebook, in getting out to vote.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Therefore, it has become a valuable tool for candidates. In the 2012 reelection campaign for [[Barack Obama|President Obama]], the campaign used over 15 different methods of social media.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This was to reach out to a broader audience. Social media provides a mechanism for candidates to directly engage with society and potential voters. In Romania, during the elections for Mayor in a town called [[Bacău|Bacau]] only 3/10 candidates used Facebook in 2012. In 2016 all of the candidates engaged in the use of social media and Facebook.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

Social media also provided candidates with an insight into predicting the outcome of votes, which are more accurate than normal polling methods.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Social media is a tool for campaigns as it provides an analysis as to the political climate, as well as the levels of engagement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

For potential voters, social media is a way to get information. According to the PEW research center, 44% of the voting population surveyed used social media as a way to get information about the 2016 election.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/14/facts-about-the-changing-digital-news-landscape/|title=10 facts about the changing digital news landscape|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was significantly more than print newspapers at the local and national level. Furthermore, 24% of those surveyed claimed that they directly got information about the election at the national level from the two candidates; [[Donald Trump]], and [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==History==

===Rhetoric to digital rhetoric===
[[Rhetoric]] is defined as the art of [[discourse]], and is the root of digital rhetoric. As technology has changed, so have rhetorical situations. While the five canons of rhetoric&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://maryvican.wordpress.com/2008/04/23/cicero%e2%80%99s-classical-canons-of-rhetoric-their-relevance-and-importance-to-the-corporate-workplace/|title=Cicero's Classical Canons of Rhetoric: Their Relevance and Importance to the Corporate Workplace|date=2008-04-23|website=Mary|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed for oratory print still apply, they are reconfigured to work in new contextual forms like the [[database]], the [[hypertext]], the [[cybertext]], and other [[born-digital]] texts.

Ideas evolve as technology evolves, because one way of studying digital rhetoric is to trace the ways that the affordances and constraints of technology "support and enable the transformation of the old rhetoric of persuasion into a new digital rhetoric that encourages self-expression, participation, and creative collaboration".&lt;ref name=Zappen&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zappen, James|title=Digital Rhetoric: Toward an Integrated Theory|year=2005|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=14|issue=3|pages=319–325|url=http://homepages.rpi.edu/~zappenj/Vita/DigitalRhetoric2005.pdf|doi=10.1207/s15427625tcq1403_10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many trace the transformation of old rhetoric into digital rhetoric through the classical rhetorical canons.

===Shift from print to digital===
Dennis Baron states, "The first writing technology was writing itself." While previous writing technologies involved pencils and [[hieroglyphics]], the evolution of communication technology now allows for online and immediate rhetorical conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Baron, D. (n.d.)|title=From Pencils to Pixels: The Stages of Literacy Technology|accessdate=January 1, 2014|publisher=english.illinois.edu|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/faculty/debaron/essays/pencils.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of communicative technologies started with the chisel, then the book, the quill, the [[Greek alphabet]], and the pencil, onto more modern technology such as the computer. The origins of modern computing are to be found in the techno-military context of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=What is Digital Rhetoric?|via=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebsoslgfgts|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the pencil was originally intended as a marking utensil for builders and is now used for writing, the computer was originally intended to compute advanced math problems, but is now used for word-processing and a myriad of other tasks. Technology continues to modify itself to meet the needs of people; in the case of digital rhetoric, technology has become more prevalent to match people's usage of the Internet and computers, which creates a [[technoculture]]. 
Another scholar who highlights the changing landscape from print to digital is Jay Bolter. He argues that the computer is the most significant development since the start of the alphabetic/print tradition and that digital texts will continue to move print to the "margins of literate culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bolter, J.|year=1991|title=Writing space: The computer, hypertext, and the history of writing|location=Hillsdale, N.J.|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts==

===Appropriation===
In the digital age most everything is considered appropriation. Scholars pull their information from a myriad of sources and are constantly redefining terms in order to apply them to the digital world. Appropriation carries both positive and negative connotations. In some ways appropriation is a tool that can be used for the reapplication of outdated ideas to make them better. In other ways appropriation is seen as a threat to creative and cultural identities. Social media receives the bulk of this scrutiny due to the lack of education of its users. Most "contributors are often unaware of what they are contributing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reyman, J.|year=2013|title=User Data on the Social Web: Authorship, Agency, and Appropriation|journal=College English, |volume=75|issue=5|pages=513–532|accessdate=November 1, 2014|via=ncte.org|url=http://www.ncte.org/library/NCTEFiles/Resources/Journals/CE/0755-may2013/CE0755User.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which perpetuates the negative connotation. Many scholars in digital rhetoric explore this topic and its effects on society such as Jessica Reyman, Amy Hea, and Johndan Johnson-Eilola.

===Avatar===
James E. Porter defines avatar as a "virtual body".&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt; With developments in technology, there are new ways to present oneself online. This online presentation of one's own identity is an avatar. While scholars such as Beth Kolko hoped for an online world without physical barriers, making it a "realm of ideas", there are still [[social issue]]s, such as [[gender discrimination]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref name="Kolko"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kolko, Beth E.|year=1999|title=Representing bodies in virtual space: The rhetoric of avatar design|journal=Information Society|volume=15|issue=3|pages=177–186|doi=10.1080/019722499128484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beth E. Kolko believes that an idealistic online world would be a "realm of ideas", without definitive factors such as gender, race, or age. Kolko argues that a non-gendered online world would not garner enough attention, because individuals could not relate to each other without [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name="Kolko" /&gt; Victoria Woolums found in a study of the video game World of Warcraft that the gender identity of the avatar affected behaviors of other characters, showing a bias even in a realm where gender identity of an avatar may not be physically accurate to its user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Woolums, V.|date=Fall 2011|title=Gendered Avatar Identity. Kairos|volume=16|issue=1|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/16.1/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circulation===
[[Rhetorical circulation|Circulation]] theorizes the ways that texts and discourses move through time and space. Any kind of media can be circulated.  Henry Jenkins "sticky vs. spreadable media" applies to circulation.  Essentially, "sticky" media is media that can be spread. 
A new form of communication is composed, created, and distributed through digital technologies. Explained by Henry Jenkins, there is a shift from distribution to circulation which signals a move toward an increasingly participatory model of culture in which people shape, share, reframe and remix media content in ways not previously possible within the traditional rhetorical elements like print.

"A number of scholars have seen delivery in networked systems as circulation of digital texts, following John Trimbur's (2000) argument that circulation should be re-introduced in writing instruction; however, his definition of circulation is as an element or result of delivery. Trimbur suggests that neglecting delivery has led writing teachers to equate the activity of composing with writing itself and to miss altogether the complex delivery systems through which writing circulates. By privileging composing as the main site of instruction, the teaching of writing has taken up what [[Karl Marx]] calls a "one-sided" view of production and thereby has largely erased the cycle that links the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of writing. This cycle of interlocked moments is what Marx calls circulation. (190)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eyman|first=Douglas|date=2015|title=Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/13030181.0001.001/1:5/--digital-rhetoric-theory-method-practice?g=dculture;rgn=div1;view=fulltext;xc=1|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.3998/dh.13030181.0001.001|via=|isbn=978-0-472-05268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration===
Collaboration in digital rhetoric does not mean a [[collaborative writing|co-authorship]] directly, even though this could be constituted as that as well, but collaboration looks more like an outlet that scholars can share their work and receive feedback as well. Instead of using solely the individual and their work, scholars use each other to spur on each other's ideas and build their concepts upon another. Collaboration takes on a much more broad meaning in terms of content on the internet. Not only does it offer the opportunity for scholars to collaborate with each other, but it also gives readers the chance to share their reactions with creators of content on the internet. In this way, digital rhetoric allows the audience to interact and work with creators of content. In Braun's book "Cultivating Ecologies for Digital Media Work: The case of English studies", she suggests a collaborative work by interdisciplinary scholars.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultivating ecologies for digital media work: The case of English studies|last=Braun|first=Chaterine, C|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Carbondale|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This is scholarship", a digital article published in Kairos 12.3,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braun|first=Catherine, C|last2=Gilbert|first2=Kenneth, L|date=|title=This is Scholarship|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/12.3/topoi/braun_gilbert/index.html|journal=Kairos|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the example of collaborative multimedia text by Catherine Braun as a rhetorician and compositionist, and Kenneth Gilbert as an audio-technician. The shared authorship from this work is shown in the editorial process including writing, digital production, display, and design to produce a final piece of a scholarly article in the form of webtext.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Crowdsourcing===
Daren Brabham defines [[Crowdsourcing]] as, "using an online, ... model to leverage the collective intelligence of online communities to serve specific organizational goals."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Brabham, Daren. ''Crowdsourcing''. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;  As a concept within digital rhetoric, it is a utilization of modern technology to collaborate and create collectively. Companies and organizations use crowdsourcing to build creativity, by acquiring information other than what their immediate employees know. However, there are several concerns that come up when crowdsourcing tactics are used. Issues relating to [[Intellectual property|Intellectual Property]] and [[Copyright]] are some of the foremost problems when crowdsourced ideas are used for commercial problems. Because the business did not conceive the idea, terms of use must be clearly set while fielding responses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ethical concerns have been raised as well when engaging in crowdsourcing without a clear set of compensation practices or protections in place to secure personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bashayr|first=A. (Et al.)|date=|title=Legal and Ethical Issues of Crowdsourcing|url=http://www.ijcaonline.org/archives/volume167/number10/alqahtani-2017-ijca-914324.pdf|journal=International Journal of Computer Applications|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delivery===
For the general scholar, the term delivery means the way in which a form of information is conveyed to a particular audience or group of people. These ideas of delivery could mean hearing information spoken at a conference or reading the newspaper. The forms can range from podcasts to videos, pictures to text, or even songs and newspapers. Delivery is the modem in which information is given in order for the topic to be best understood and related to. The term "delivery" is often aligned with the term "performance".  The Forest of Rhetoric states that delivery is not only the fifth canon of rhetoric, but it is also a translation of the word "hypokrisis", or "acting". This Greek word was translated into delivery in the standpoint of spoken or recited information rather than newspapers or essays. Performance of plays, speeches, skits, etc. turns into the delivery of information in the piece being performed or spoken. This is the same as a piece of literature or rhetoric delivering its information through word choice, layout, and structure.&lt;ref name="Burton" /&gt;

===Electracy===
[[Electracy]] is a term developed by Gregory Ulmer describing the emerging digital age.&lt;ref&gt;''Electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print'' —Gregory Ulmer.&lt;/ref&gt; Electracy is often discussed as being in transition, advancing along with digital rhetoric. Electracy explains the full communicative potentials of new electronic media. Electracy is embedded in the approach of digital rhetoric and covers a large paradigm of literacy which is enhanced through Ulmer's idea of 'electracy'. The recent decades observes a sound effect of 'electracy' in the field of digital media. According to Arrayo, "Participatory Compositions begins by exploring the apparatus of electracy in many of its manifestation while focus on the participatory practices found in online video culture. As research suggests the concept of 'electracy' has changed through the very idea of Ulmer who once articulated in the orientation of analogue video that serves rhetorical dimension of &amp;nbsp;'Teletheory'. But his vision of 'electracy' changed by bringing in a more broader literary concept that enterprise writing—coding, hypertext etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Participatory Composition: Video Culture, Writing and Electracy.|last=Arroyo|first=Sarah|publisher=SIU Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0809331468|location=|pages=1–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Kairos ===
''[[Kairos]],'' in the traditional rhetorical canon, is defined as catching the opportune moment. Traditionally, Kairos relates to rhetorical time (versus Kronos, or chronological time). It relates to the occasion and context when a text is written or a speech is given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheard|first=Cynthia|date=1993|title=Kairos and Kenneth Burke's Psychology of Political and Social Communication|url=|journal=College English|volume=55|pages=291–310|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Kairos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aristotles Rhetorical Situation|url=https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/625/03/|accessdate=2018-04-22|first1=Ethan|last1=Sproat|first2=Dana Lynn|last2=Driscoll|first3=Allen|last3=Brizee|date=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the elements of a speech that acknowledge and draw support from the particular setting, time, and place when and where a speech occurs. It is imperative that the speaker knows when and where to place the argument and, if it is appropriate. However, in the digital age, this is changing. Although Aristotle considers Kairos as related to [[ethos]], [[pathos]], and [[logos]],&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; a more modern definition expands that view to include [[Multimodality|multimodal]] texts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Sheridan, Ridolfo, and Michel offer an expanded definition of Kairos that asks rhetors to consider the ramifications of circulation, production and re-production, and distribution of compositions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Kairos has been put on the rhetorical back burner, but has become more theorized in the digital age to discuss the ecology of multimodal texts. Digital scholars like Douglas Eyman, Jim Ridolfo, David Sheridan, Anthony Michel, Ellen Cushman, and Isabel Pedersen are on the forefront of reviving the concept of Kairos and applying its use in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David M. Sheridan|author2=Jim Ridolfo|author3=Anthony J. Michel|lastauthoramp=y|date=March 19, 2012|title=The Available Means of Persuasion: Mapping a Theory and Pedagogy of Multimodal Public Rhetoric|location=Anderson, South Carolina|publisher=Parlor Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory ===
"At first, Memory seemed to have to do solely with [[mnemonics]] (memory aids) that would assist a budding orator in retaining his speech. However, it clearly had to do with more than simply learning how to memorize an already composed speech for re-presentation. The practice of storing up information or other material arrived at through the topics of invention can be called for in a given occasion in order to redistribute information that is already known or given. The canon of Memory also suggests that scholars consider the psychological aspects of preparing to communicate and the performance of communicating itself, especially in an oral or impromptu setting. Typically Memory has to do only with the orator, but invites consideration of how the audience will retain things in mind."&lt;ref name="Burton"&gt;{{cite web|author=Burton, G. (n.d.)|title=What is Rhetoric?|accessdate=December 3, 2014|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/encompassing%20terms/rhetoric.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105226/http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Encompassing%20Terms/rhetoric.htm|archivedate=December 20, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mind sharing ===
Mind sharing is a way to get [[collective intelligence]]—crowd wisdom that is comparable to expert wisdom. The methodology for this is simple. One would look for a consensus from the crowd—the answer that most minds are suggesting is the best answer. If it's a numeric question (like guessing the weight of an ox), it's a calculated average or median. If it's an open question (like "what car should I buy?"), it's the most common answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mindsharing: The Art of Crowdsourcing Everything|last=Zoref|first=Lior|publisher=Portfolio|year=2015|isbn=978-1591846659|location=|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multimodality===
[[Multimodality]] means having several modes, modalities, or maxima—in simpler terms, it is a form of communication that uses multiple methods (or modes) to inform audiences of an idea. It can involve a mix of written text, pictures, audio, or videos. Online journals often embrace multimodality in their issues and articles by publishing works that use more than just written text to communicate the message. While the digital turn in rhetoric and composition has encouraged more discussion, theorization, and pedagogical application of multimodality and multimodal texts, the history of the field demonstrates a continuous concern with multimodal communication beginning with classical rhetoric's concern with delivery, gesture, and memory. All writing and all communication is, theoretically, multimodal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Naming What We Know: Threshold Concepts of Writing Studies|last=Ball|first=Cheryl|last2=Charlton|first2=Colin|publisher=Utah State University Press|year=2014|isbn=|editor-last=Adler-Kassner|editor-first=Linda|location=|pages=|chapter=All Writing is Multimodal|editor2-last=Wardle|editor2-first=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remix===
[[Remix]] is a method of digital rhetoric that manipulates and transforms an original work to convey a new message. The usage of remix can help the creator make an argument by connecting seemingly unrelated ideas into a convincing whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuhn|first=Virginia|date=|title=The Rhetoric of Remix|url=http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/358/279|journal=Transformative Works|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As modern [[technology]] develops, self-publication sites like YouTube, SoundCloud, and WordPress have stimulated remix culture, allowing for easier creation and dissemination of reworked content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Rhetoric/Remediation_and_Remix|title=Digital Rhetoric/Remediation and Remix - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike appropriation, which is the use and potential recontextualization of existing material without significant modification, remix is defined in ''Kairos'' as "the process of taking old pieces of text, images, sounds, and video and stitching them together to form a new product."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.2/topoi/ridolfo_devoss/remix.html|title=Composing for Recomposition: Rhetorical Velocity and Delivery|last=DeVoss|first=Jim Ridolfo and Dànielle Nicole|date=2009-01-15|website=kairos.technorhetoric.net|language=English|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A popular example of remixing is the creation and sharing of [[meme]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.

===Rhetorical velocity===
[[Rhetorical velocity]] is the concept of authors writing in a way in which they are able to predict how their work might be recomposed. With the advancement of technology, there is no limit to the speed and distance at which an author's work is able to travel. Therefore, it is important for them to be able to predict how their audience will recompose their works. Jim Ridolfo and Danielle DeVoss first coined this idea in 2009 when they describe rhetorical velocity as "a conscious rhetorical concern for distance, travel, speed, and time, pertaining specifically to theorizing instances of strategic appropriation by a third party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ridolfo, J.|author2=Devoss, D.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Composing for Recomposition: Rhetorical Velocity and Delivery|journal=Kairos|volume=13|issue=2|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.2/topoi/ridolfo_devoss/intro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual rhetoric ===
[[Visual rhetoric]] relates to digital rhetoric because they can act together to communicate ideas in a way that is not bound by a linear format. Mary Hocks, a visual rhetoric scholar, states "the screen itself is a tablet that combines words, interfaces, icons, and pictures that invoke other modalities like touch and sound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hocks, M.|year=2003|title=Understanding Visual Rhetoric in Digital Writing Environments|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=54|issue=4|pages=629–656|jstor=3594188|doi=10.2307/3594188}}&lt;/ref&gt; By manipulating the tools described by Hocks, a writer in the digital world has access to influence a broader audience, and an influx of modes to communicate their ideas. This in turn creates a way for writers to communicate The use of visual images in rhetoric allows for a writer to convey an idea that may be so abstract that the written linear word will not suffice. Abstract ideas in rhetorical images, as Charles Hill states, that not only are abstract ideas represented in images acceptable but they are prominent, images "do not necessarily have to portray an object, or even a class of objects, that exists or ever did exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Handa, C.|year=2004|chapter=Reading the Visual in College Writing Classes By Charles Hill|title=Visual rhetoric in a digital world: A critical sourcebook|location=Boston|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images allow for the writer to depict the closest representation of their thought possible since they can blend abstract and tangible thoughts. Hill uses the peace sign, swastika, and the confederate flags as examples of abstract ideas represented by images. Ironically the image of a peace sign, which seems to be universally accepted as a call from the 1970s 'hippie' movement, originated as an anti-Christian symbol. The original graphic was used to show an upside down broken cross symbolizing the despair of man and the crucifixion of the Apostle Peter. This shows how visual images can change over time and be adapted in such powerful ways that it actually changes the meaning completely. Images are versatile, and coupled with the motive of the author can provide key components to an argument. By being informed on how visual rhetoric interacts with its different components a reader/viewer can reduce abstract ideas to a more tangible state.

==Controversies==

===Access===
Referred to as the [[digital divide]], issues of economic access and user-level access are recurring issues in digital rhetoric. These issues show up most prevalent in [[computers and writing]] circles. Access can refer to inequality in the access of information, access to a reading public, and access to means of communicating. For those that teach digital rhetoric in schools and universities, student access to technologies at home and in school is an operative concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reynolds, Thomas J.|author2=Charles R. Lewis|lastauthoramp=y|title=The changing topography of computer access for composition students|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=14|issue=2|pages=269–278|year=1997|doi=10.1016/S8755-4615(97)90027-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate about whether mobile computing devices like smartphones make technology access more equitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hea, Amy C.K.|year=2009|title=Going Wireless: A Critical Exploration of Wireless and Mobile Technologies for Composition Teachers and Researchers|location=Cresskill, N.J.|publisher=Hampton Press|pages=15–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright issues===
Copyright controversies in online and digital texts affect the way digital rhetoric is utilized. Many of these arguments deal with the problem of cost for the publishers and consumers of scholarly text. Copyrighting materials is an expensive task, especially when the materials can be translated into many other forms of digital sources that are freely found by the public. Because of this ease of transformation, copyright laws are undermined as scholars lose predication in their online materials through maneuvers as simple as copy and paste or translating hyperlinks. In James P. Zappen's piece "Digital Rhetoric: Toward an Integrated Theory", he refers to transferring material in ways that create misapplication of a work that a scholar has written. "A media database, for example, can produce an almost infinite variety of end-user objects, which can be customized for different users, manipulated through hyperlinks, periodically updated, and scaled upon demand." Zappen's statement of "infinite" is in no way subjective or an over statement. Many digital pieces are infringed upon, stolen, or misused by the avoidance of copyright.  These many forms of copyright avoidance lend to the controversy of digital rhetoric and media as a whole.&lt;ref name="Zappen" /&gt; 

=== Cyberbullying ===
One controversy that has been steady on the rise since the transition of utilizing digital rhetoric in social media is [[Cyberbullying]].  An example can be seen in the TLC television series, [[Here Comes Honey Boo Boo]]. Viewers have the opportunity to post their opinions and responses on sites such as Twitter and Instagram. The trend that people posting about the characters and their lifestyles, it reinforces the iconography of stereotypes (such as "hillbillies") is successful because of the way in which the rhetoric of difference is a naturalized component of the ethnic and racial identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=Carissa|date=Spring 2018|title=The rhetoric of the real: stereotypes of rural youth in American reality television and stock photography|url=|journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The challenge with social media is that since there is a limited amount of characters to convey the message the digital rhetoric tends to be oversimplified and stereotypes flourish. Erika Sparby evaluated that due to the increase of social media users people have found this stronger sense of confidence from the ability from being anonymous and using pseudonymous in digital social media for them to address either someone or something in a negative light.&lt;ref name="Sparby"/&gt;

===Legitimacy===

There is controversy regarding the innovative nature of digital rhetoric. Arguments opposed to legitimizing webtext are Platonically-based in that they reject the new form of scholarship, web text, and praise the old form, print, in the same way that oral communication was originally favored over written communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Borgman, Christine|title=Scholarship in a Digital Age: Information, Infrastructure, and the Internet|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press|year=2007|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally some traditionalists didn't regard online open-access journals with the same legitimacy as print journals for this reason; however, digital arenas have become the primary place for disseminating academic information in many areas of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dunham, Gary|title=What are Trends in Scholarly Publishing?|url=http://www.asha.org/Academic/questions/Trends-Scholarly-Publishing/}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=MiguelAngelFimbres |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars struggle to "claim academic legitimacy" in these new media forms, as the tendency of pedagogy is to write about a subject rather than actively work in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ball, Cheryl E.|year=2004|title=Show, not tell: The value of new media scholarship|journal=Computers &amp; Composition|volume=21|issue=4|pages=403–425|url=http://gossettphd.org/library/ball_shownottell.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2004.08.001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023081524/http://gossettphd.org/library/ball_shownottell.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the past decade, more scholarly texts have been openly accessible, which provides an innovative way for students to gain access to textual materials online for free, in the way that many scholarly journals like ''Kairos'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/ Kairos]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Harlot of the Arts'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://harlotofthearts.org/index.php/harlot Harlot of the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Enculturation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enculturation.net/ Enculturation]&lt;/ref&gt; are already available through open access.

===Open access===
Open access has removed the barriers of fees associated with accessing a work and restrictions of copyright and licensing. The matter of eliminating fees is most prevalent to digital rhetoric, because it allows for more access to works. Open access and digital rhetoric do not eliminate copyright, but eliminates restrictions by giving authors the choice to maintain their right to copy and distribute their materials however they choose, or they may turn the rights over to a specific journal. Digital rhetoric involves works that are found online and open access is allowing more people to be able to reach these works.

The approach itself is largely voluntary and market-driven but often pressed ahead by favorable government treatment or efforts of development co-operation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== History ==
Since the early 1990s the idea of EID evolved from [[Symbiosis|biological symbiosis]].  This concept was adapted by industrial ecologists in the search for innovative approaches to solve problems of waste, energy shortage and degradation of the environment.  A continuous approach towards improving both environmental and economic outcomes is used.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, B. (2007): The Limit and Merit of Taking Sustainable Buildings as a Catalyst for Eco-Industrial Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[international community]] officially connected development co-operation to sustainable environmental protection for the first time. At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ([[UNCED]]) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil nearly 180 states signed the conference’s Rio Declaration. Although non-binding, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development laid out 27 principles that shall guide the increasing inter-connectedness of development cooperation and sustainability.&lt;ref name=UN1992&gt;{{cite web|title=REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/conf151/aconf15126-1annex1.htm|publisher=United nations|accessdate=23 April 2014|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the documents drafting was accompanied by a presentation describing the idea of eco-industrial development for the first time.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In the following years, EID became popular throughout the United States. The recently elected [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration installed a summit of business, labor, government and environmental protection representatives to further develop the approach. This summit established the idea of [[eco-industrial park]]s but soon realized that at first a more efficient management of raw materials, energy and waste has to be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Since then, the broad goals and application principles of EID have hardly changed and only became adapted to the rapid technological progress.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In 2012 the IGEP Foundation, for the promotion of trade,&lt;ref name=IGEP&gt;{{cite web|title=IGEP Foundation homepage|url=http://www.igep.org/|publisher=IGEP Foundation|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a report called ''Pathway to Eco Industrial Development in India – Concepts and Cases''.&lt;ref name=Pathway&gt;{{cite web|title=Pathway to Eco Industrial Development in India – Concepts and Cases|url=http://www.igep.in/live/hrdpmp/hrdpmaster/igep/content/e48745/e50194/e50195/121004_Pathway_EID_ISOX3uncoated-1.pdf|publisher=IGEP Foundation|accessdate=23 April 2014|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field is researched by the Nation Centre for Eco-Industrial Development, a joint project by the [[University of Southern California]] and [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name=usc&gt;{{cite web|title=National Center for Eco-Industrial Development|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/price/research/NCEID/|publisher=usc.edu|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and concepts ==
The primary goal of eco-industrial development is a significant and continuous improvement in both business and environmental performance. Herein, the notion of industry not only relates to private-sector manufacturing but also covers state-owned enterprise, the service sector as well as transportation. EID’s twin guideline is reflected specifically in the “eco” of eco-industrial as it resembles ecology (decrease in pollution and waste) and economy (increase in commercial success) at the same time.&lt;ref name="WhatIs" /&gt; In order to build a framework of defining an enterprise’s sustainable performance at the micro level, resource use optimization, minimization of waste, cleaner technologies and pollution limits are used in achieving a broad range of goals in EID: 
	
* '''[[Resource efficiency]]''' minimizes the use of energy, materials, water and transportation. This, in turn, lowers production costs due to savings in virtually all areas of business.&lt;ref name="Pathway"/&gt;
* '''Cleaner production''' is a predominantly environmental measure, which aims at the reduction or even substitution of toxics, emissions-control or the re-use of residual material.
* '''[[Renewables]]''' in both energy and material use shall eliminate all pollution through fossil fuels.
* '''Greening of buildings or production sites''' installs high energy and environmental standards by relying on innovation in green architecture or engineering. Moreover, new facility and infrastructure design may also enhance the quality of life in neighboring communities significantly.
* '''Environmental management systems''' such as the [[ISO 14000]] ensure a continuous improvement through regular audits and the progressing establishment of environmental targets.
* '''Ecological site planning''' can then combine each of these aspects by developing a clear understanding of air, water and ground system capacities throughout the surrounding eco-system.
  
Eco-industrial development hence explores the possibility of improvement at the local level.&lt;ref name="WhatIs" /&gt; In unique case-to-case analyses, particular geography, human potential or business climate are investigated. In contrast to the widespread race for top-down governmental support such as tax cuts, EID emphasizes locally achievable success and rooms for improvement. As a result, purposeful enforcements of action plans can make a large difference by optimizing the interaction of business, community and ecological systems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Instruments ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
Eco-industrial development includes and employs four major conceptual instruments. Each of the approaches intends to combine the seemingly antithetic processes of industrial development and bolstering sustainability.

* '''[[Industrial Ecology]]''' focuses on both industrial as well as consumer behavior. By assessing flows of energy and material, the approach determines the flows influences on the environment. In turn, it explores ways and means of optimizing the whole production chain from flow and use of resources to their final transformation. During these analyses, influences of economic, political, regulatory and social factors are key.
* The concept of '''[[Industrial Symbiosis]]''' is based on mainly voluntary cooperation of different industries. By conglomerating complementary enterprises and by then adapting their respective production chains, the presence of each may increase viability and profitability of the others. Therefore, symbioses consider resource scarcity and environmental protection as crucial factors in developing sustainable industries and profits. Industrial Symbiosis often becomes manifest in [[Eco-industrial park]]s.
* '''Environmental Management Systems''' include a wide range of different environmental management approaches in order to ensure continual improvement in sustainability. In early stages, monitoring companies facilitates the identification of hazardous environmental aspects. Further on, objectives and targets are set under consideration of legal requirements. Finally, the establishment of regular audits and other reporting systems combined with continuous follow-up targets shall ensure a constant improvement towards greener industrial production.
* The '''Design for the Environment''' concept originated in engineering disciplines as well as from the product life-cycle analysis. It is a simple but all-encompassing assessment of a product’s potential environmental impact – ranging from energy and materials used for packaging, transportation, consumer use and disposal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1871">The '''economics of scientific knowledge''' ('''ESK''') is an approach to understanding science which is predicated on the need to understand scientific knowledge creation and dissemination in economic terms.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

The approach has been developed as a contrast to the [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK)]] which places scientists in their social context and examines their behavior using social theory. ESK typically involves thinking of scientists as having economic interests with these being thought of as utility maximisation and science as being a market process. Modelling strategies might use any of a variety of approaches including the neoclasscial, game theoretic, behavioural (bounded rationality) information theoretic and transaction costs. Boumans and Davis (2010) mention [[Partha Dasgupta|Dasgupta]] and [[Paul A. David|David]] (1994) as being an interesting early example of work in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Boumans, M. and Davis, John B.

'''Ethnomethodology''' is the study of methods people use for understanding and producing the [[social order]] in which they live.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1974 pp 15–18"&gt;Garfinkel, H. (1974) 'The origins of the term ethnomethodology', in R.Turner (Ed.) Ethnomethodology, Penguin, Harmondsworth, pp 15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; It generally seeks to provide an alternative to mainstream [[sociology|sociological]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel, H. (1984) Studies in Ethnomethodology, Polity Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; In its most radical form, it poses a challenge to the social sciences as a whole.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 2002"&gt;Garfinkel, H. (2002) ''Ethnomethodology's Program: Working out Durkheim's Aphorism'', Rowman &amp; Littleford, Lanham.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, its early investigations led to the founding of [[conversation analysis]], which has found its own place as an accepted discipline within the academy. According to Psathas, it is possible to distinguish five major approaches within the ethnomethodological family of disciplines (see {{section link||Varieties}}).&lt;ref&gt;Psathas, G. (1995) ''Talk and Social Structure' and 'Studies of Work'', in Human Studies, 18: 139–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnomethodology provides methods which have been used in [[ethnography|ethnographic]] studies to produce accounts of people's methods for negotiating everyday situations.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, Michael Makowsky (1978). The discovery of society. London: Random House. Page 232&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fundamentally descriptive discipline which does not engage in the explanation or evaluation of the particular social order undertaken as a topic of study.&lt;ref&gt;Wes W. Sharrock, Bob Anderson, R. J. Anderson (1986) The ethnomethodologists. London: Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|0-85312-949-5}}. Page 18&lt;/ref&gt; However, applications have been found within many applied disciplines, such as software design and management studies.&lt;ref&gt;Rooke, J. &amp; Seymour, D. (2005) 'Studies of Work: Achieving Hybrid Disciplines in IT Design and Management Studies', Human Studies 28(2):205–221. http://usir.salford.ac.uk/642&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The term's meaning can be broken down into its three constituent parts: ''ethno'' – ''method'' – ''ology'', for the purpose of explanation. Using an appropriate Southern California example: ''ethno'' refers to a particular socio-cultural group (for example, a particular, local community of surfers); ''method'' refers to the methods and practices this particular group employs in its everyday activities (for example, related to surfing); and ''ology'' refers to the systematic description of these methods and practices. The focus of the investigation used in our example is the social order of surfing, the ethnomethodological interest is in the "how" (the methods and practices) of the production and maintenance of this social order. In essence ethnomethodology attempts to create classifications of the social actions of individuals within groups through drawing on the experience of the groups directly, without imposing on the setting the opinions of the researcher with regards to social order, as is the case with sociological studies.&lt;ref name="lynch1993"&gt;Michael Lynch, Scientific Practice and Ordinary Action: Ethnomethodology and Social Studies of Science, Cambridge UP, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and scope==
The approach was originally developed by [[Harold Garfinkel]], who attributed its origin to his work investigating the conduct of jury members in 1954.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1974 pp 15–18"/&gt; His interest was in describing the common sense methods through which members of a jury produce themselves in a jury room ''as a jury''. Thus, their methods for: establishing matters of fact; developing evidence chains; determining the reliability of witness testimony; establishing the organization of speakers in the jury room itself; and determining the guilt or innocence of defendants, etc. are all topics of interest. Such methods serve to constitute the social order of being a juror for the members of the jury, as well as for researchers and other interested parties, in that specific social setting.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1984"&gt;Garfinkel, H. (1984) Studies in Ethnomethodology, Polity Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;

This interest developed out of Garfinkel's critique of [[Talcott Parsons]]' attempt to derive a general theory of society. This critique originated in his reading of [[Alfred Schutz]], though Garfinkel ultimately revised many of Schutz's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Cuff, E. C., Sharrock, W. W. &amp; Francis, D.W. (2006) Perspectives in Sociology (fifth edition) Unwin Hyman, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Garfinkel also drew on his study of the principles and practices of financial accounting; the classic sociological theory and methods of [[Emile Durkheim|Durkheim]] and [[Max Weber|Weber]]; and the traditional sociological concern with the [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]ian "problem of order".&lt;ref name="annerawls"&gt;Anne Rawls, "Harold Garfinkel", Blackwell Companion to Major Social Theorists, ed. G. Ritzer. Blackwell: London, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the ethnomethodologist, participants produce the order of social settings through their shared sense making practices. Thus, there is an essential natural reflexity between the activity of making sense of a social setting and the ongoing production of that setting; the two are in effect identical. Furthermore, these practices (or methods) are witnessably enacted, making them available for study.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1984"/&gt; This opens up a broad and multi-faceted area of inquiry. [[John Heritage]] writes, "In its open-ended reference to [the study of] any kind of sense-making procedure, the term represents a signpost to a domain of uncharted dimensions rather than a staking out of a clearly delineated territory."&lt;ref&gt;Heritage, J. (1984). ''Garfinkel and ethnomethodology.'' Cambridge, U.K: Polity Press. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and methods==

{{Synthesis|section|date=June 2012}}

Ethnomethodology has perplexed commentators, due to its radical approach to questions of theory and method.&lt;ref name="doug1991"&gt;Doug Maynard &amp; Steve Clayman, "The Diversity of Ethnomethodology", ASR, V.17, pp. 385–418. 1991. A survey of various ethnomethodological approaches to the study of social practices. Pages 413–418.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Heritage, Garfinkel and Ethnomethodology, Cambridge:Polity. 1991.({{ISBN|0-7456-0060-3}}). Page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to theory, Garfinkel has consistently advocated an attitude of ethnomethodological indifference, a principled agnosticism with regard to social theory which insists that the shared understandings of members of a social setting under study take precedence over any concepts which a social theorist might bring to the analysis from outside that setting. This can be perplexing to traditional social scientists, trained in the need for social theory and a multiplicity of theoretical references by Anne Rawls, in her introduction to ''Ethnomethodology's Program'' might be interpreted to suggest a softening of this position towards the end of Garfinkel's life.&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garf0742516423"&gt;[[Harold Garfinkel]] (2002). Ethnomethodology's Program. New York: Rowman and Littlefield. {{ISBN|0-7425-1642-3}}. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the position is consistent with ethnomethodology's understanding of the significance of "member's methods", and with certain lines of philosophical thought regarding the philosophy of science (Polanyi 1958; Kuhn 1970; Feyerabend 1975), and the study of the actual practices of scientific procedure.&lt;ref name="lynch1993"/&gt; It also has a strong correspondence with the later philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], especially as applied to social studies by Peter Winch.&lt;ref&gt;Cuff, E. C., Sharrock, W. W. &amp; Francis, D.W. (2006) Perspectives in Sociology (fifth edition) Unwin Hyman, London&lt;/ref&gt; References are also made in Garfinkel's work to Husserl (Transcendental Phenomenology), Gurwitsch ([[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt Theory]]), and, most frequently, of course, to the works of the social phenomenologist Alfred Schutz (Phenomenology of the Natural Attitude), among others. On the other hand, the authors and theoretical references cited by Garfinkel do not constitute a rigorous theoretical basis for ethnomethodology. Ethnomethodology is not Durkheimian, although it shares some of the interests of Durkheim; it is not phenomenology, although it borrows from Husserl and Schutz's studies of the [[lifeworld]] (''Lebenswelt''); it is not a form of Gestalt theory, although it describes social orders as having Gestalt-like properties; and, it is not Wittgensteinian, although it makes use of Wittgenstein's understanding of rule-use, etc. Instead, these borrowings are only fragmentary references to theoretical works from which ethnomethodology has appropriated theoretical ideas for the expressed purposes of ''doing'' ethnomethodological investigations.

Similarly, ethnomethodology advocates no formal methods of enquiry, insisting that the research method be dictated by the nature of the phenomenon that is being studied.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; Ethnomethodologists have conducted their studies in a variety of ways,&lt;ref name="doug1991" /&gt; and the point of these investigations is "to discover the things that persons in particular situations ''do'', the methods ''they'' use, to create the patterned orderliness of social life."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; [[Michael Lynch (ethnomethodologist)|Michael Lynch]] has noted that: "Leading figures in the field have repeatedly emphasised that there is no obligatory set of methods [employed by ethnomethodologists], and no prohibition against using any research procedure whatsoever, if it is ''adequate'' to the particular phenomena under study".&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lynch1989"&gt;Michael Lynch, The Social Science Encyclopedia, Routledge, 2nd Ed., 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel, H. &amp; Wieder, D. L. (1992) 'Two Incommensurable, Asymmetrically Alternate Technologies of Social Analysis', in G. Watson  &amp; R. M. Seiler (eds.), Text in Context, Sage, London, pp. 175–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some leading policies, methods and definitions==

; The fundamental assumption of ethnomethodological studies : As characterised by Anne Rawls, speaking for Garfinkel: "If one assumes, as Garfinkel does, that the meaningful, patterned, and orderly character of everyday life is something that people must work to achieve, then one must also assume that they have some methods for doing so". That is, "...members of society must have some shared methods that they use to mutually construct the meaningful orderliness of social situations."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt;
; Ethnomethodology is an empirical enterprise : Rawls states: "Ethnomethodology is a thoroughly empirical enterprise devoted to the discovery of social order and intelligibility [sense making] as witnessable collective achievements." "The keystone of the [ethnomethodological] argument is that local [social] orders exist; that these orders are witnessable in the scenes in which they are produced; and that the possibility of [their] intelligibility is based on the actual existence and detailed enactment of these orders."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; Ethnomethodology is not, however, conventionally empricist.  Its empirical nature is specified in the weak form of the ''unique adequacy requirement''.
; The unique adequacy requirement of methods (weak form) : is that the researcher should have a 'vulgar competence' in the research setting. That is, they should be able to function as an ordinary member of that setting.
; The unique adequacy requirement of methods (strong form) : is identical to the requirement for ethnomethodological indifference.
; Ethnomethodological indifference : This is the policy of deliberate [[agnosticism]], or indifference, towards the dictates, prejudices, methods and practices of sociological analysis as traditionally conceived (examples: theories of "deviance", analysis of behavior as rule governed, [[role theory]], institutional (de)formations, theories of [[social stratification]], etc.). Dictates and prejudices which serve to pre-structure traditional social scientific investigations independently of the subject matter taken as a topic of study, or the investigatory setting being subjected to scrutiny.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; The policy of ethnomethodological indifference is specifically not to be conceived of as indifference to the problem of social order taken as a group (member's) concern.
; First time through : This is the practice of attempting to describe any social activity, regardless of its routine or mundane appearance, as if it were happening for the very first time. This is in an effort to expose how the observer of the activity assembles, or constitutes, the activity for the purposes of formulating any particular description. The point of such an exercise is to make available and underline the complexities of sociological analysis and description, particularly the [[indexical]] and reflexive properties of the actors', or observer's, own descriptions of what is taking place in any given situation. Such an activity will also reveal the observer's inescapable reliance on the [[hermeneutic circle]] as the defining "methodology" of social understanding for both lay persons and social scientists.&lt;ref name="Mark Okrent 1988. Pages 157–172"&gt;Mark Okrent, Heidegger's Pragmatism, Cornell University Press, 1988. Pages 157–172&lt;/ref&gt;
; Breaching experiment : A method for revealing, or exposing, the common work that is performed by members of particular social groups in maintaining a clearly recognisable and shared [[social order]]. For example, [[driving the wrong way]] down a busy one-way street can reveal myriads of useful insights into the patterned social practices, and moral order, of the community of road users. The point of such an exercise—a person pretending to be a stranger or boarder in his own household—is to demonstrate that gaining insight into the work involved in maintaining any given social order can often best be revealed by breaching that social order and observing the results of that breach—especially those activities related to the reassembly of that social order, and the normalisation of that social setting.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;
; Sacks' gloss : A question about an aspect of the social order that recommends, as a method of answering it, that the researcher should seek out members of society who, in their daily lives, are responsible for the maintenance of that aspect of the social order. This is in opposition to the idea that such questions are best answered by a sociologist. Sacks' original question concerned objects in public places and how it was possible to see that such objects did or did not belong to somebody. He found his answer in the activities of police officers who had to decide whether cars were abandoned.
; [[Durkheim]]'s aphorism : Durkheim famously recommended: "...our basic principle, that of the objectivity of social facts."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; This is usually taken to mean that we should assume the [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of social facts as a principle of study (thus providing the basis of sociology as a science). Garfinkel's alternative reading of Durkheim is that we should treat the objectivity of social facts as an achievement of society's members, and make the achievement process itself the focus of study.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; An ethnomethodological respecification of Durkheim's statement via a "misreading" (see below) of his quote appears above. There is also a textual link/rationale provided in the literature. Both links involve a leap of faith on the part of the reader; that is, we don't believe that one method for this interpretation is necessarily better than the other, or that one form of justification for such an interpretation outweighs its competitor.
; Accounts : Accounts are the ways members signify, describe or explain the properties of a specific social situation. They can consist of both verbal and non-verbal objectifications. They are always both indexical to the situation in which they occur (see below), and, simultaneously reflexive—they serve to constitute that situation. An account can consist of something as simple as a wink of the eye, a material object evidencing a state of affairs (documents, etc.), or something as complex as a story detailing the boundaries of the universe.
; [[Indexicality]] : The concept of indexicality is a key core concept for ethnomethodology. Garfinkel states that it was derived from the concept of indexical expressions appearing in ordinary language philosophy (1967), wherein a statement is considered to be indexical insofar as it is dependent for its sense upon the context in which it is embedded (Bar-Hillel 1954:359–379). The phenomenon is acknowledged in various forms of analytical philosophy, and sociological theory and methods, but is considered to be both limited in scope and remedied through specification [[operationalisation]]. In ethnomethodology, the phenomenon is universalised to all forms of language and behavior, and is deemed to be beyond remedy for the purposes of establishing a scientific description and explanation of social behavior.&lt;ref name="garf1984"&gt;Harold Garfinkel, Studies in Ethnomethodology, Malden MA: Polity Press/Blackwell Publishing. 1984. ({{ISBN|0-7456-0005-0}}) (first published in 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of the degree of contextual dependence for a "segment" of talk or behavior can range from the problem of establishing a "working consensus" regarding the description of a phrase, concept or behavior, to the end-game of social scientific description itself. Note that any serious development of the concept must eventually assume a theory of [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]] as its foundation (see Gurwitsch 1985). Without such a foundational underpinning, both the traditional social scientist and the ethnomethodologist are relegated to merely telling stories around the campfire (Brooks 1974).
; Misreading (a text) : Misreading a text, or fragments of a text, does not denote making an erroneous reading of a text in whole or in part. As Garfinkel states, it means to denote an, "alternate reading", of a text or fragment of a text. As such, the original and its misreading do not, "...translate point to point", but, "...instead, they go together."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; No criteria are offered for the translation of an original text and its misreading—the outcome of such translations are in Garfinkel's term: "incommensurable."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; The misreading of texts or fragments of texts is a standard feature of ethnomethodology's way of doing theory, especially in regards to topics in phenomenology.
; Reflexivity : Despite the fact that many sociologists use "reflexivity" as a synonym for "[[Introspection|self-reflection]]," the way the term is used in ethnomethodology is different: it is meant "to describe the acausal and non-[[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] determination of meaningful action-in-context."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/mg60u8574h414t0l/ Michael Lynch, Mark Peyrot. "Introduction: A reader's guide to ethnomethodology". ''Qualitative Sociology''. Springer Netherlands. 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Reflexivity (social theory)]].
; Documentary method of interpretation : The documentary method is the method of understanding utilised by everyone engaged in trying to make sense of their social world—this includes the ethnomethodologist. [[Garfinkel]] recovered the concept from the work of [[Karl Mannheim]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Mannheim]], "On the Interpretation of Weltanschauung" (1952),in, From Karl Mannheim (ed. Kurt Wolf), Transaction Publishers, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and repeatedly demonstrates the use of the method in the case studies appearing in his central text, Studies in Ethnomethodology.&lt;ref name="garf1984" /&gt; Mannheim defined the term as a search for an identical homologous pattern of meaning underlying a variety of totally different realisations of that meaning. Garfinkel states that the documentary method of interpretation consists of treating an actual appearance as the "document of", "as pointing to", as "standing on behalf of", a presupposed underlying pattern.&lt;ref name="garf1984" /&gt; These "documents" serve to constitute the underlying pattern, but are themselves interpreted on the basis of what is already known about that underlying pattern. This seeming paradox is quite familiar to hermeneuticians who understand this phenomenon as a version of the hermeneutic circle.&lt;ref name="Mark Okrent 1988. Pages 157–172"/&gt; This phenomenon is also subject to analysis from the perspective of [[Gestaltism|Gestalt]] theory (part/whole relationships), and the phenomenological theory of perception.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aron Gurwitsch]], The Field of Consciousness, Duquesne University Press, 1964 [out-of-print]. Pages 202–227&lt;/ref&gt;
; Social orders : Theoretically speaking, the object of ethnomethodological research is social order taken as a group members' concern. Methodologically, social order is made available for description in any specific social setting as an accounting of specific social orders: the sensible coherencies of accounts that order a specific social setting for the participants relative to a specific social project to be realised in that setting. Social orders themselves are made available for both participants and researchers through phenomena of order: the actual accounting of the partial ([[:wkit:adumbration|adumbrated]]) appearances of these sensibly coherent social orders. These appearances (parts, adumbrates) of social orders are embodied in specific accounts, and employed in a particular social setting by the members of the particular group of individuals party to that setting. Specific social orders have the same formal properties as identified by A. Gurwitsch in his discussion of the constituent features of perceptual ''noema'', and, by extension, the same relationships of meaning described in his account of Gestalt Contextures (see Gurwitsch 1964:228–279). As such, it is little wonder that Garfinkel states: "you can't do anything unless you do read his texts."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;
; Ethnomethodology's field of investigation : For ethnomethodology the topic of study is the social practices of real people in real settings, and the methods by which these people produce and maintain a shared sense of social order.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;

==Differences with sociology ==

Since ethnomethodology has become anathema to certain sociologists, and since those practicing it like to perceive their own efforts as constituting a radical break from prior sociologies, there has been little attempt to link ethnomethodology to these prior sociologies.&lt;ref name="Paul Attewell 1974 pp. 179–210"&gt;Attewell, Paul. (1974). "Ethnomethodology since Garfinkel," ''Theory and Society'' '''1'''(2): 179–210.&lt;/ref&gt; However, whilst ethnomethodology is distinct from sociological methods, it does not seek to compete with it, or provide remedies for any of its practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Garfinkel]], Studies in Ethnomethodology, Malden MA: Polity Press/Blackwell Publishing. 1984. ({{ISBN|0-7456-0005-0}}) (first published in 1967). Page: viii&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethnomethodological approach differs as much from the sociological approach as sociology does from psychology even though both speak of social action.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Mehan &amp; Houston Wood, The reality of ethnomethodology. 1975. Chichester: Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-59060-6}}. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that ethnomethodology does not use traditional sociological forms as a sounding board for its own programmatic development, or to establish benchmarks for the differences between traditional sociological forms of study and ethnomethodology as it only means that ethnomethodology was not established in order to: repair, criticize, undermine, or 'poke fun' at traditional sociological forms {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. In essence the distinctive difference between sociological approaches and ethnomethodology is that the latter adopts a commonsense attitude towards knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Leiter, ''A Primer of Ethnomethodology''. 1980. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-502628-4}}. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to traditional sociological forms of inquiry, it is a hallmark of the ethnomethodological perspective that it does not make theoretical or methodological appeals to: outside assumptions regarding the structure of an actor or actors' characterisation of social reality; refer to the subjective states of an individual or groups of individuals; attribute conceptual projections such as, "value states", "sentiments", "goal orientations", "mini-max economic theories of behavior", etc., to any actor or group of actors; or posit a specific "normative order" as a transcendental feature of social scenes, etc.

For the ethnomethodologist, the methodic realisation of social scenes takes place within the actual setting under scrutiny, and is structured by the participants in that setting through the reflexive accounting of that setting's features. The job of the Ethnomethodologist is to describe the methodic character of these activities, not account for them in a way that transcends that which is made available in and through the actual accounting practices of the individual's party to those settings.

The differences can therefore be summed up as follows:

# While traditional sociology usually offers an analysis of society which takes the [[facticity]] (factual character, objectivity) of the social order for granted, ethnomethodology is concerned with the procedures (practices, methods) by which that social order is produced, and shared.
# While traditional sociology usually provides descriptions of social settings which compete with the actual descriptions offered by the individuals who are party to those settings, ethnomethodology seeks to describe the procedures (practices, methods) these individuals use in their actual descriptions of those settings

==Links with phenomenology==
{{main|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}

Even though ethnomethodology has been characterised as having a "phenomenological sensibility",&lt;ref name="doug1991" /&gt; and reliable commentators have acknowledged that "there is a strong influence of phenomenology on ethnomethodology..." (Maynard and Kardash 2007:1484), orthodox adherents to the discipline—those who follow the teachings of Garfinkel—do not represent it as a branch, or form, of phenomenology, or phenomenological sociology.

The confusion between the two disciplines stems, in part, from the practices of some ethnomethodologists (including Garfinkel), who sift through phenomenological texts, recovering phenomenological concepts and findings relevant to their interests, and then transpose these concepts and findings to topics in the study of social order. Such interpretive transpositions do not make the ethnomethodologist a phenomenologist, or ethnomethodology a form of phenomenology.

To further muddy the waters, some phenomenological sociologists seize upon ethnomethodological findings as examples of applied phenomenology; this even when the results of these ethnomethodological investigations clearly do not make use of phenomenological methods, or formulate their findings in the language of phenomenology. So called phenomenological analyses of social structures that do not have prima facie reference to any of the structures of intentional consciousness should raise questions as to the phenomenological status of such analyses.

Garfinkel speaks of phenomenological texts and findings as being "appropriated" and intentionally "misread" for the purposes of exploring topics in the study of social order.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; These appropriations and methodical "misread[ings]" of phenomenological texts and findings are clearly made for the purposes of furthering ethnomethodological analyses, and should not be mistaken for logical extensions of these phenomenological texts and findings.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;

Lastly, there is no claim in any of Garfinkel's work that ethnomethodology is a form of phenomenology, or phenomenological sociology. To state that ethnomethodology has a "phenomenological sensibility" or that "there is a strong influence of phenomenology on ethnomethodology" is not the equivalent of describing ethnomethodology as a form of phenomenology (see Garfinkel/Liberman 2007:3–7).

Even though ethnomethodology is not a form of phenomenology, the reading and understanding of phenomenological texts, and developing the capability of seeing phenomenologically is essential to the actual doing of ethnomethodological studies. As Garfinkel states in regard to the work of the phenomenologist Aron Gurwitsch, especially his "Field of Consciousness" (1964: ethnomethodology's phenomenological ''urtext''): "you can't do anything unless you do read his texts."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;

== Varieties ==
According to [[George Psathas]], five types of ethnomethodological study can be identified (Psathas 1995:139–155). These may be characterised as:

# ''The organisation of practical actions and practical reasoning''. Including the earliest studies, such as those in Garfinkel's seminal ''Studies in Ethnomethodology''.&lt;ref name="garf1984" /&gt;
# ''The organisation of talk-in-interaction''. More recently known as [[conversation analysis]], [[Harvey Sacks]] established this approach in collaboration with his colleagues [[Emanuel Schegloff]] and [[Gail Jefferson]].
# ''Talk-in-interaction within institutional or organisational settings''. While early studies focused on talk abstracted from the context in which it was produced (usually using tape recordings of telephone conversations) this approach seeks to identify interactional structures that are specific to particular settings.
# ''The study of work''. 'Work' is used here to refer to any social activity. The analytic interest is in how that work is accomplished within the setting in which it is performed.
# ''The [[haecceity]] of work''. Just what makes an activity what it is? e.g. what makes a test a test, a competition a competition, or a definition a definition?

Further discussion of the varieties and diversity of ethnomethodological investigations can be found in Maynard &amp; Clayman's work.&lt;ref name="doug1991"/&gt;

==Relationship with conversational analysis==
The relationship between ethnomethodology and conversation analysis has been contentious at times, given their overlapping interests, the close collaboration between their founders and the subsequent divergence of interest among many practitioners. In as much as the study of social orders is "inexorably intertwined" with the constitutive features of talk about those social orders, ethnomethodology is committed to an interest in both conversational talk, and the role this talk plays in the constitution of that order. Talk is seen as indexical and embedded in a specific social order. It is also naturally reflexive to and constitutive of that order. Anne Rawls pointed out: "Many, in fact most, of those who have developed a serious interest in ethnomethodology have also used conversational analysis, developed by Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson, as one of their research tools."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt;{{rp|143}}

On the other hand, where the study of conversational talk is divorced from its situated context—that is, when it takes on the character of a purely technical method and "formal analytic" enterprise in its own right—it is not a form of ethnomethodology.&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; The "danger" of misunderstanding here, as Rawls notes, is that conversational analysis can become just another formal analytic enterprise, like any other formal method which brings an analytical toolbox of preconceptions, formal definitions, and operational procedures to the situation/setting under study. When such analytical concepts are generated from within one setting and conceptually applied (generalised) to another, the (re)application represents a violation of the strong form of the ''unique adequacy requirement'' of methods.

[[File:Regular_hexagon_as_intersection_of_two_triangles.png|thumb|A regular ''hexagram'', [[List_of_regular_polytopes_and_compounds#Two_dimensional_compounds|{6}[2{3}]{6}]], can be seen as a [[compound polygon|compound]] composed of an upwards (blue here) and downwards (pink) facing [[equilateral triangle]], with their intersection as a regular [[hexagon]] (in green).]]
A '''hexagram''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]) or '''sexagram''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]) is a six-pointed geometric [[star figure]] with the [[Schläfli symbol]] {6/2}, 2{3}, or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Since there are no true regular continuous hexagrams, the term is instead used to refer to the compound figure of two [[equilateral triangle]]s shown to the right. The intersection is a regular [[hexagon]].

The hexagram is part of an infinite series of shapes which are compounds of two n-dimensional [[simplex|simplices]]. In three dimensions, [[Compound of two tetrahedra|the analogous compound]] is the [[stellated octahedron]], and in four dimensions the [[compound of two 5-cells]] is obtained.

It has been historically used in religious and cultural contexts and as decorative motifs; for example by medieval [[Muslims]], especially [[Hanafi]] and [[Maliki]] dynasties,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Delhi: Adventures in a Megacity]]'' (PB) - Page 91, Sam Miller, Sam - 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and later in [[Judaism]] and [[occultism]]. The symbol was used merely as a decorative motif in medieval Christian churches many centuries before its first known use in a Jewish synagogue.{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=244|ps=:"It is not to be found at all in medieval synagogues or on medieval ceremonial objects, although it has been found in quite a number of medieval Christian churches again, not as a Christian symbol but only as a decorative motif. The appearance of the symbol in Christian churches long before its appearance in our synagogues should warn the overzealous interpreters. "}} It was first used as a religious symbol by Arabs in the medieval period, known as the [[Seal of Solomon]], depicted as either a hexagram or [[pentagram]], and which was later adopted by Jewish [[Kabbalists]].{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=246|ps=:"In the beginning these designs had no special names or terms, and it is only in the Middle Ages that definite names began to be given to some of those most widely used. There is very little doubt that terms like these first became popular among the Arabs, who showed a tremendous interest in all the occult sciences, arranging and ordering them systematically long before the Practical Cabalists thought of doing so.{{pb}}It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that for a long time both the five-pointed and the six-pointed stars were called by one name, the "Seal of Solomon," and that no distinction was made between them. This name is obviously related to the Jewish legend of Solomon's dominion over the spirits, and of his ring with the Ineffable Name engraved on it. These legends expanded and proliferated in a marked fashion during the Middle Ages, among Jews and Arabs alike, but the name, "Seal of Solomon," apparently originated with the Arabs."}}&lt;ref&gt;Leonora Leet, "The Hexagram and Hebraic Sacred Science" in :''The Secret Doctrine of the Kabbalah'', 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=61hpoogearsC&amp;pg=PA212 pp. 212-217].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group theory==
In [[mathematics]], the [[root system]] for the simple [[Lie group]] [[G2 (mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is in the form of a hexagram, with six long roots and six short roots.&lt;br/&gt;
[[File:Root system G2.svg|250px]]

== Construction by compass and a straight edge ==
A six-pointed star, like a [[regular hexagon]], can be created using a compass and a straight edge:
*Make a circle of any size with the compass.
*Without changing the radius of the compass, set its pivot on the circle's circumference, and find one of the two points where a new circle would intersect the first circle.
*With the pivot on the last point found, similarly find a third point on the circumference, and repeat until six such points have been marked.
*With a straight edge, join alternate points on the circumference to form two overlapping equilateral triangles.

== Construction by linear algebra ==
[[File:Hexagram-cube.png|thumb]]
A regular hexagram can be constructed by [[orthographic projection|orthographically projecting]] any [[cube]] onto a plane through three vertices that are all adjacent to the same vertex.  The twelve midpoints to edges of the cube form a hexagram.  For example, consider the projection of the unit cube with vertices at the eight possible binary vectors in three dimensions &lt;math&gt;(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1)&lt;/math&gt; onto the plane &lt;math&gt;x+y+z=1&lt;/math&gt;.  The midpoints are &lt;math&gt;(0,0,1/2),(0,1/2,1/2),(0,1,1/2),(1,1,1/2)&lt;/math&gt;, and all points resulting from these by applying a permutation to their entries.  These 12 points project to a hexagram: six vertices around the outer hexagon and six on the inner.

==Origins and shape==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}
It is possible that as a simple geometric shape, like for example the triangle, circle, or square, the hexagram has been created by various peoples with no connection to one another.

The hexagram is a [[mandala]] symbol called ''satkona yantra'' or ''sadkona yantra'' found on ancient South [[India]]n [[Hindu]] temples. It symbolizes the [[nara-narayana]], or perfect [[meditative]] state of balance achieved between Man and God, and if maintained, results in "[[moksha]]," or "[[nirvana]]" (release from the bounds of the earthly world and its material trappings).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Some researchers have theorized that the hexagram represents the [[astrological]] chart at the time of David's birth or [[anointment]] as king. The hexagram is also known as the "King's Star" in astrological circles.

In antique [[papyri]], [[pentagram]]s, together with stars and other signs, are frequently found on [[amulet]]s bearing the Jewish names of [[God]], and used to guard against fever and other diseases. Curiously the hexagram is not found among these signs. In the [[Greek Magical Papyri]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} (Wessely, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;31, 112) at Paris and London there are 22 signs side by side, and a circle with twelve signs, but neither a pentagram nor a hexagram.

==Usage in Dharmic religions==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Jain Cosmology0007small.JPG|thumb|Diagram showing the two mystic syllables Om and Hrim]]
Six-pointed stars have also been found in cosmological diagrams in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. The reasons behind this symbol's common appearance in Indic religions and the West are unknown. One possibility is that they have a common origin. The other possibility is that artists and religious people from several cultures independently created the hexagram shape, which is a relatively simple geometric design.

Within Indic lore, the shape is generally understood to consist of two triangles—one pointed up and the other down—locked in harmonious embrace. The two components are called "Om" and the "Hrim" in Sanskrit, and symbolize man's position between earth and sky. The downward triangle symbolizes [[Shakti]], the sacred embodiment of femininity, and the upward triangle symbolizes [[Shiva]], or [[Agni Tattva]], representing the focused aspects of masculinity. The mystical union of the two triangles represents Creation, occurring through the divine union of male and female. The two locked triangles are also known as 'Shanmukha'—the six-faced, representing the six faces of Shiva &amp; Shakti's progeny [[Kartikeya]]. This symbol is also a part of several yantras and has deep significance in Hindu ritual worship and history.

In [[Buddhism]], some old versions of the [[Bardo Thodol]], also known as The "Tibetan Book of the Dead", contain a hexagram with a [[Swastika]] inside. It was made up by the publishers for this particular publication. In Tibetan, it is called the "origin of phenomenon" (chos-kyi 'byung-gnas). It is especially connected with [[Vajrayogini]], and forms the center part of Her [[mandala]]. In reality, it is in three dimensions, not two, although it may be portrayed either way.

The [[Shatkona]] is a symbol used in [[Hindu]] [[yantra]] that represents the union of both the [[male]] and [[Female|feminine]] form. More specifically it is supposed to represent [[Purusha]] (the supreme being), and [[Prakriti]] (mother nature, or causal matter). Often this is represented as [[Shiva]] - [[Shakti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sivasakti.com/articles/intro-yantra.html sivasakti.com: ''Iintroduction to Yantra'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shatkona is a hexagram and looks exactly like the [[Star of David]].

===Anahata: The Heart Chakra===

|width=170 valign=top|[[File:Anahata Mandala.svg|center|170px]]
|valign=top|'''[[Anahata]]''' (also known as '''Anahata-puri''', or '''Padma-sundara''') is symbolized by a lotus flower with twelve petals. (See also [[bodhicitta|heartmind]]). Anahata is related to the colors green or pink. Key issues involving Anahata involve complex emotions, compassion, tenderness, unconditional love, equilibrium, rejection and well-being. Physically Anahata governs circulation, emotionally it governs unconditional love for the self and others, mentally it governs passion, and spiritually it governs devotion.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;
|-

In the [[endocrine system]], [[Anahata]] is associated with the [[thymus]] gland, located in the chest. This gland produces [[T-cells]], that combat disease, and bring equilibrium to the body. The functioning of the [[thymus]] is greatest before [[puberty]] and is impaired by the appearance of [[sex hormones]] in the blood stream from [[puberty]] onwards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Usage by the Abrahamic religions==

===Usage by Jews===
{{Main|Star of David}}
[[File:Leningrad Codex Carpet page e.jpg|thumb|The Star of David in the oldest surviving complete copy of the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Leningrad Codex]], dated 1008.]]
The ''Magen David'' is a generally recognized symbol of Judaism and Jewish identity and is also known colloquially as the Jewish Star or "Star of David." Its usage as a sign of Jewish identity began in the Middle Ages, though its religious usage began earlier, with the current earliest archeological evidence being a stone bearing the shield from the arch of a 3–4th century synagogue in the Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;"King Solomon's Seal", ''MFA'', [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/King%20Solomon-s%20Seal King Solomon-s Seal].&lt;/ref&gt; A more enduring symbol of Judaism, the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], has been in use since about 1300 BC according to the [[Torah]] {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:31-40|HE}}.

===Usage by Christians===
The hexagram may be found in some Churches and stained-glass windows. In Christianity it is sometimes called the star of creation.  A very early example, noted by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], can be found in [[Winchester Cathedral]], England in one of the canopies of the choir stalls, circa 1308.&lt;ref&gt;Buildings of England: Hampshire and the North (now second edition) {{ISBN|978 0 300 12084 4}}, p.604. &lt;/ref&gt;

In Balkan countries, hexagrams can be found more often in Orthodox Christian churches than in Roman Catholic churches.  
 
====Latter-day Saints (Mormons)====
[[File:Salt Lake Assembly Hall Star of David.jpg|thumb|Star of David on the [[Salt Lake Assembly Hall]]]]
{{Main|Mormonism and Judaism}}
The Star of David is also used less prominently by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in the temples and in architecture. It symbolizes God reaching down to man and man reaching up to God, the union of Heaven and earth. It may also symbolize the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]] and friendship and their affinity towards the Jewish people. Additionally, it is sometimes used to symbolize the quorum of the twelve apostles, as in Revelation 12, wherein the Church of God is symbolized by a woman wearing a crown of twelve stars. It is also sometimes used to symbolize the Big Dipper, which points to the North Star, a symbol of Jesus Christ.

====Rastafari====
A black star of David is used to identify the black population, in Africa or otherwise, with one of the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Due to the culture of Rastafari emerging out of the Judeo-Christian Ethiopian history, dating back to Solomonic dynastic rule, the star of David, or the Seal of Solomon is a prevalent symbol amongst its adherents. Rastafari has adherents from every race across the globe, rooted in Christian doctrine, it is not an African or bloodline doctrine.

===Usage by Muslims===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The symbol is known in Arabic as ''Khātem Sulaymān'' ([[Seal of Solomon]]; {{lang|ar|خاتم سليمان}}) or ''Najmat Dāwūd'' ([[Star of David]]; {{lang|ar|نجمة داوود}}). The "Seal of Solomon" may also be represented by a five-pointed star or [[pentagram]].

In the [[Qur'an]], it is written that David and [[King Solomon]] (Arabic, ''Suliman'' or ''Sulayman'') were prophets and kings, and are figures revered by Muslims. The Medieval pre-Ottoman [[Hanafi]] [[Anatolian beyliks]] of the [[Karamanids]] and [[Jandarids]] used the star on their flag.&lt;ref name="Muwahhidists"&gt;The Muslim Empires of the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, By Stephen F. Dale, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol also used on [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] flag. Today the six-pointed star can be found in [[mosques]] and on other [[Arabic Art|Arabic]] and [[Islamic art]]ifacts.

Professor [[Gershom Sholem|Gershom Scholem]] theorizes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-curious-history-of-the-six-pointed-starhow-the-magen-david-became-the-jewish-symbol/|title=The Curious History of the Six-Pointed Star:How the “Magen David” Became the Jewish Symbol - Commentary Magazine|work=Commentary Magazine|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the "Star of David" originates in the writings of [[Aristotle]], who used triangles in different positions to indicate the different basic elements. The superposed triangles thus represented combinations of those elements. From Aristotle's writings those symbols made their ways into early, pre-Muslim Arab literature.

==Usage in heraldry==
In [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]], a hexagram is a fairly common charge employed, though it is rarely called by this name. In Germanic regions it is known simply as a "star." In English and French heraldry, however, the hexagram is known as a "mullet of six points," where ''mullet'' is a French term for a [[spur|spur rowel]] which is shown with five pointed arms by default unless otherwise specified. In [[Albania]]n heraldry and vexillology, hexagram has been used since [[classical antiquity]] and it is commonly referred to as ''sixagram''. [[:File:Coa Kastrioti Family.svg|Coa Kastrioti Family]] of the [[House of Kastrioti]] depicts the hexagram on a '''[[pile (heraldry)|pile]]''' argent over the double headed eagle. A hexagram also appears on the '''Dardania''' Flag, proposed for [[Kosovo]] by the [[Democratic League of Kosovo]].

==Usage in theosophy==
The Star of David is used in the seal and the emblem of the [[Theosophical Society]] (founded in 1875). Although it is more pronounced, it is used along with other religious symbols. These include the [[Swastika]], the [[Ankh]], the [[Om|Aum]], and the [[Ouroboros]]. The star of David is also known as the Seal of Solomon that was its original name until around 50 years ago.

==Usage in occultism==
The hexagram, like the [[pentagram]], was and is used in practices of the [[occult]] and [[ceremonial magic]] and is attributed to the 7 "old" planets outlined in [[astrology]].

The six-pointed star is commonly used both as a [[talisman]]&lt;ref&gt;P299 (and throughout) of ''The Complete Goldendawn'' by Israel Regardie. {{ISBN|978-0875426631}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for conjuring spirits and spiritual forces in diverse forms of [[Magic (paranormal)|occult magic]]. In the book [[The History and Practice of Magic, Vol. 2]], the six-pointed star is called the talisman of Saturn and it is also referred to as the Seal of Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;"The History and Practice of Magic" (Secaucus, NJ: University Books, published by arrangement with Lyle Stewart, 1979), Vol. II, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Details are given in this book on how to make these symbols and the materials to use.
[[File:Star of David GGNC grave marker engraving.JPG|thumb|200x200px|Double hexagram.]]
Traditionally, the Hexagram can be seen as the combination of the four elements. Fire is symbolized as an upwards pointing triangle, while Air (its elemental opposite) is also an upwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. Water is symbolized as a downwards pointing triangle, while Earth (its elemental opposite) is also a downwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. When you combine the symbols of Fire and Water, a hexagram (six-pointed star) is created. The same follows for when you combine the symbols of Air and Earth.  When you combine both hexagrams, you get the double-hexagram. Thus, a combination of the elements is created.&lt;ref&gt;P315-316 of ''The Wicca Bible'' by Ann-Marie Gallagher. {{ISBN|978-1-84181-250-2}}. Same information also found in many other books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] Magic, the seven Traditional Planets correspond with the angles and the center of the Hexagram as follows, in the same patterns as they appear on the [[Sephiroth]] and on the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. Saturn, although formally attributed to the Sephira of [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]], within this frame work nonetheless occupies the position of [[Da'at (Kabbalah)|Daath]].&lt;ref&gt;P31 of ''The Ritual Magic Manual: A Complete Course in Practical Magic'' by David Griffin. {{ISBN|978-0965840897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in Freemasonry==
{{quote|"The interlacing triangles or deltas symbolize the union of the two principles or forces, the active and passive, male and female, pervading the universe ... The two triangles, one white and the other black, interlacing, typify the mingling of apparent opposites in nature, darkness and light, error and truth, ignorance and wisdom, evil and good, throughout human life." –&amp;nbsp;Albert G. Mackey: ''Encyclopedia of [[Freemason]]ry''}}

The hexagram is featured within and on the outside of many [[Masonic temple]]s as a decoration. It may have been found within the structures of [[King Solomon]]'s temple, from which [[Freemasons]] are inspired in their philosophies and studies. Like many other symbols in Freemasonry, the deciphering of the hexagram is non-dogmatic and left to the interpretation of the individual.

* In [[alchemy]], the two triangles represent the reconciliation of the opposites of fire and water. Non-Jewish Kabbalah (also called Christian or Hermetic Kabbalah) interprets{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} the hexagram to mean the divine union of male and female energy, where the male is represented by the upper triangle and the female by the lower one. Moreover, it derives four triangular symbols from it (two triangles crossed like a capital letter A and two uncrossed) to represent the four elements: water, fire, air, and earth. This use of the symbol was used as an important plot point in [[Dan Brown]]'s popular novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and [[Da Vinci Code (film)|the ''Da Vinci Code'' film]] cites this as the origin of the star.
* It was also used as a sign for [[Aether (classical element)#Fifth element|quintessence]], the fifth element.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* In southern Germany the hexagram can be found as part of tavern anchors. It is symbol for the tapping of beer and sign of the brewer's guild. In German this is called "Bierstern" (beer star) or "[[:de:Brauerstern|Brauerstern]]" (brewer's star).
* A six-point star is used as an identifying mark of the [[Folk Nation]].

* The Indian sage and seer [[Sri Aurobindo]] used it—e.g. on the cover of his books—as a symbol of the aspiration of humanity calling to the Divine to descend into life (the triangle with the point at the top), and the descent of the Divine into the earth's atmosphere and all individuals in response to that calling (the triangle with the point at the bottom). (This was explained by the Mother, his spiritual partner in Her 14-volume Agenda and elsewhere by Sri Aurobindo in his writings.){{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13332">'''Historical editions''' form part of a category of printed music, which generally consists of [[classical music]] and [[opera]] from a past repertory, where the term can apply to several different types of published music.  However, it is principally applied to one of three types of music of this sort:
* '''Scholarly or critical editions''' are music editions in which careful scholarship has been employed to ensure that the music contained within is as close to the composer's original intentions as possible. Such editions are sometimes called [[urtext edition]]s.
* '''Collected Works or Complete Works''', generally in multi-volume sets, are devoted to a particular composer or to a particular musical repertory.  This is sometimes referred to in German as  ''Gesamtausgabe''&lt;ref&gt;Literally: "whole edition"&lt;/ref&gt; when containing the works of one particular composer.
* '''Monuments or Monumental Editions''' (or the German ''Denkmäler'')&lt;ref&gt;Literally: "memorials"&lt;/ref&gt; when containing a repertory defined by geography, time period, or musical genre.

== The origins of historical editions ==
Up until the 18th century, music performance and distribution centered around current compositions.  Even professional musicians rarely were familiar with music written more than a half century before their own time.&lt;ref&gt;Moser, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  In the second half of the 18th century, an awakening of interest in the history of music prompted the publication of numerous collections of older music (for example, [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]]'s ''Cathedral Music'', published around 1760-63, and [[Giovanni Battista Martini]]'s ''Esemplare, ossia Saggio... di contrappunto'', published around 1774-5).&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Robinson Charles, [http://www.grovemusic.com "Editions, Historical", ''Grove Music Online''] ed. L. Macy. Accessed 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Around the same time, the proliferation of pirated editions of music by popular composers (such as [[Haydn]] and [[Mozart]]) prompted respected music publishers to embark on "oeuvres complettes," intended as uniform editions of the entire musical output of these composers.  Unfortunately, many of these early complete works projects were never finished.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the emergence of [[romantic hero]] worship of composers, sometimes described as the "cult of genius," fired the enthusiasm for Complete Works series for important composers.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;  The development of the academic field of musicology also contributed to an interest in more accurate and well-researched editions of musical works.  Finally, the rise of [[Nationalism]] within music circles influenced the creation of Monumental Editions devoted to geographical regions, such as ''Denkmäler deutscher Tonkunst'' begun in 1892 and ''Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich'' begun in 1894.

== Editing historical editions ==
In creating a scholarly or critical edition, an editor examines all available versions of the given piece (early musical sketches, manuscript versions, publisher’s proof copies, early printed editions, and so on) and attempts to create an edition that is as close to the composer’s original intentions as possible. Editors use their historical knowledge, detective skills, and musical understanding to choose what one hopes is the most accurate version of the piece.  More recent scholarly editions often include footnotes or critical reports describing discrepancies between differing versions, or explaining appropriate performance practice for the time period.  In general, editing music is a much more challenging endeavor than editing text-based works of literature, as [[musical notation]] can be imprecise, musical handwriting can be difficult to decipher, and first or early printed editions of pieces often contained mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;James Grier, "Editing" in [http://www.grovemusic.com ''Grove Music Online''] Accessed 24 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, what are known as performers’ editions do not rely on a thorough examination of all known sources, and often purposely include extraneous markings not written by the composer ([[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], articulation marks, bowing indications, fingerings, and so on) to aid a musician playing from that score.

==Scholarly or critical editions==

===Opera===
''For information on critical editions of operatic works, see '''[[critical edition (opera)]]'''''

==Collected Works or Complete Works ==
The German music publisher [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] initiated many of the earliest complete works series of major composers.  A few of these include:
* [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]: [[Bach Gesellschaft|''Werke'']] (1851-1900; supplemental volume [revised edition of ''[[The Art of Fugue]]''] 1926)
* [[George Frideric Handel]]: [[Händel-Gesellschaft|''Werke'']] (1858-1902)
* [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]: ''Werke'' (1862-1907)
* [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]: [[Beethoven Gesamtausgabe|''Werke'']] (1862–65, supplemental volume 1888)
* [[Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy]]: ''Werke'' (1874-1877)
* [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]: [[Alte Mozart-Ausgabe|''Werke'']] (1877-1883, supplements until 1910)
Many of these early complete works series were edited by music scholars or composers famous in their own right, such as [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Guido Adler]], [[Julius Rietz]], [[Friedrich Chrysander]], and others.

After the upheavals of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], which slowed the output of musical scholarship and publishing, renewed activity led to many new series as well as to a reassessment of the older complete works series.  New techniques in photographic and other types of reproduction allowed scholars to consult many more early sources, either in microfilm or facsimile copies.  Entirely new series were published for several major composers for whom complete works sets already existed.  These updated editions incorporated new scholarship in their editing and allowed for a broader definition of complete works, often including early versions of pieces, sketches, and so on.&lt;ref name=CHAS&gt;Charles, ''Grove Music Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these new series have been published by the German music publisher Bärenreiter, and include:
* Bach: ''[[Neue Bach-Ausgabe]]'' (1954-)
* Handel: ''Hallische Händel-Ausgabe'' (1955-)
* Mozart: ''[[Neue Mozart-Ausgabe]]'' (1955-)
In addition to the reworking of older Complete Works series, many new series have been initiated for composers not previously featured in this way.  Some examples include:
* [[Leoš Janáček]]: ''Complete Critical Edition'' (1978-)
* [[Edward Elgar]]: ''Elgar Complete Edition'' (1981-)
* [[Alban Berg]]: ''Sämtliche Werke'' (1984-)
* [[Claude Debussy]]: ''Oeuvres complètes'' (1985-)
* [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]]: [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach: The Complete Works|''The Complete Works'']] (2005-)
* [[Johann Christian Bach]]: [[Collected Works of Johann Christian Bach|''Collected Works'']] (1984–99)
It would be impossible to list here all of the new Complete Works series that have been initiated in the last century.  Some of the major publishers of these series include [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]], Bärenreiter, Stainer &amp; Bell, [[G. Henle Verlag]], and others.

==Monuments or Monumental Editions==
Many of the early Monumental Editions were devoted to geographic regions, and often had the support of their respective governments.  For example, the series ''[[Denkmäler deutscher Tonkunst]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Literally: Memorials of German Musical Art&lt;/ref&gt; begun in 1892 by a group of German musicians that included [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Joseph Joachim]], and [[Philipp Spitta]], was supported by the German government.&lt;ref name=CHAS/&gt; Examples of other monumental editions (still ongoing) include:
* ''Samfundet til udgivelse af dansk musik'' (1872-)
* ''[[Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich]]'' (1894-)
* ''Monumenta Musicae Belgicae'' (1932-)
* ''[[Music of the United States of America (publications)|Music of the United States of America]]'' (1988-) 
Some recent projects include not only those focusing on geographic regions, but also many devoted to particular time periods or repertory, such as:
* ''Monumenta Musicae Byzantinae'' (1935-)
* ''Polyphonic Music of the Fourteenth Century'' (1956–58)
* ''Recent Researches in Music'' (1962-)
* ''Italian Opera, 1640-1770'' (1977-)
It would be impossible to list all of the Monumental Editions currently ongoing.  Several of the major publishers of these series include the [http://www.corpusmusicae.com American Institute of Musicology], [http://www.areditions.com A-R Editions], Bärenreiter, Istituto Italiano per la Storia della Musica, Instituto Español de musicologia, [[Éditions de l'Oiseau-Lyre]], and others.

===Characteristics of complete works and monumental editions===
Publication of these multi-volume series is usually spread over many years, sometimes decades.  Depending on the financial state of the publisher, some projected sets are never finished, and some sets are taken over by other publishers.  There are often different editors for individual volumes, with a general editor or committee of editors to oversee the entire series.  Complete Works series are often organized by genre, for example grouping all symphonies together, or all piano sonatas.  Several of the complete works sets have complicated, multi-tiered systems for numbering the volumes.  Monumental Editions have varying organizational schemes, but several of them include numerous sub-series, some of which are devoted to the music of single composers.

These publications are often sponsored by musicological research bodies or by civic organizations.  Many of these endeavors also value international cooperation, creating editorial boards that include scholars from various countries.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Finding pieces within historical edition sets ==
Finding a particular piece of music within one of these multi-volume sets can often be difficult, as many of the series do not have general indices.  For pieces within a composer's complete works set, researchers often consult the ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' (Second Edition, 2001), either online or in its printed version.  Articles on composers will list the title and publisher of any complete works sets that exist, and within the list of compositions by that composer, will include volume numbers of the complete works set in which each piece is found.

To find pieces within older Monumental Editions, the best resource is still the 3rd edition of [[Anna Harriet Heyer]]'s ''Historical Sets, Collected Editions, and Monuments of Music: A Guide to their Content'', published in 1980.  A more up to date description of newer complete works and monumental edition sets can be found in the work of George Hill and Norris Stephens, but there is no index to find individual pieces.  An online database, called the "Index to Printed Music: Collections &amp; Series," is currently underway, but it is accessible by subscription only, and is not yet complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14942">'''Iconology''' is a method of interpretation in cultural history and the history of art used by [[Aby Warburg]], [[Erwin Panofsky]] and their followers that uncovers the cultural, social, and historical background of themes and subjects in the visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;Roelof van Straten, ''An Introduction to Iconography: Symbols, Allusions and Meaning in the Visual Arts''. Abingdon and New York 1994, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is derived from synthesis rather than scattered analysis and examines symbolic meaning on more than its face value by reconciling it with its historical context and with the artist's body of work&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biddingtons.com/content/pedigreeicon.html Iconography and Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; in contrast to the widely descriptive [[iconography]], which, as described by Panofsky, is an approach to studying the content and meaning of works of art that is primarily focused on classifying, establishing dates, provenance and other necessary fundamental knowledge concerning the subject matter of an artwork that is needed for further interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Ljunggren Szepessy, "Panofsky - Iconology and Iconography". In ''The Marriage Maker: The Pergamon Hermaphrodite as the God Hermaphroditos, Divine Ideal and Erotic Object''. MA thesis, University of Oslo 2014, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Panofsky strongly differentiated between iconology and iconography, the distinction is not very widely followed, "and they have never been given definitions accepted by all iconographers and iconologists".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0161.xml Oxford Bibliographies: Paul Taylor, "Iconology and Iconography"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Few 21st-century authors continue to use the term consistently.

It should also be noted that Panofsky's "use of iconology as the principle tool of art analysis brought him critics." For instance, in 1946, [[Jan Gerrit Van Gelder]] "criticized Panofsky's iconology as putting too much emphasis on the symbolic content of the work of art, neglecting its formal aspects and the work as a unity of form and content."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthistorians.info/panofskye Dictionary of Art Historians: Panofsky, Erwin]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, iconology is mostly avoided by social historians who do not accept the theoretical dogmaticism in the work of Panofsky.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus von Beyme, "Why is there no Political Science of the Arts?" In Udo J. Hebel and Christoph Wagner, eds., ''Pictorial Cultures and Political Iconographies: Approaches, Perspectives, Case Studies from Europe and America''. Berlin and New York 2011, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contrast to iconography==
Erwin Panofsky defines iconography as "a known principle in the known world", while iconology is "an iconography turned interpretive".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tudor, ''Image and Influence: Studies in the Sociology of Film''. New York 1974, p.115.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his view, iconology tries to reveal the underlying principles that form the basic attitude of a nation, a period, a class, a religious or philosophical perspective, which is modulated by one personality and condensed into one work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roelof van Straten, iconology "can explain why an artist or patron chose a particular subject at a specific location and time and represented it in a certain way. An iconological investigation should concentrate on the social-historical, not art-historical, influences and values that the artist might not have consciously brought into play but are nevertheless present. The artwork is primarily seen as a document of its time."&lt;ref&gt;Roelof van Straten, ''An Introduction to Iconography: Symbols, Allusions and Meaning in the Visual Arts''. Abingdon and New York 1994, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warburg used the term "iconography" in his early research, replacing it in 1908 with "iconology" in his particular method of visual interpretation called "critical iconology", which focused on the tracing of motifs through different cultures and visual forms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Hatt]] and Charlotte Klonk, "Iconography - iconology: Erwin Panofsky". In ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to Its Methods''. Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Panofsky published a seminal article, introducing a three-step method of visual interpretation dealing with (1) primary or natural subject matter; (2) secondary or conventional subject matter, i.e. iconography; (3) tertiary or intrinsic meaning or content, i.e. iconology.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Panofsky, "Zum Problem der Beschreibung und Inhaltsdeutung von Werken der bildenden Kunst." ''Logos'', Vol. 21 (1932), pp. 103-119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas iconography analyses the world of images, stories and allegories and requires knowledge of literary sources, an understanding of the history of types and how themes and concepts were expressed by objects and events under different historical conditions, iconology interprets intrinsic meaning or content and the world of symbolical values by using "synthetic intuition". The interpreter is aware of the essential tendencies of the human mind as conditioned by psychology and world view; he analyses the history of cultural symptoms or symbols, or how tendencies of the human mind were expressed by specific themes due to different historical conditions. Moreover, when understanding the work of art as a document of a specific civilization, or of a certain religious attitude therein, the work of art becomes a symptom of something else, which expresses itself in a variety of other symptoms. Interpreting these symbolical values, which can be unknown to, or different from, the artist's intention, is the object of iconology.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Ljunggren Szepessy, "Panofsky - Iconology and Iconography". In ''The Marriage Maker: The Pergamon Hermaphrodite as the God Hermaphroditos, Divine Ideal and Erotic Object''. MA thesis, University of Oslo 2014, pp.13, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Panofsky emphasized that "iconology can be done when there are no originals to look at and nothing but artificial light to work in."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ann Holly, ''Panofsky and the Foundations of Art History''. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1984, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ernst Gombrich]], "the emerging discipline of iconology ... must ultimately do for the image what linguistics has done for the word."&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Gombrich, ''Reflections on the History of Art: Views and Reviews'', ed. Richard Woodfield. Oxford 1987, p.246.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Michael Camille]] is of the opinion that "though Panofsky's concept of iconology has been very influential in the humanities and is quite effective when applied to Renaissance art, it is still problematic when applied to art from periods before and after."&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.arizona.edu/downloads/Garcia,_Dominique_Writing_Sample.pdf Dominique E. Garcia, "Nationalistic Iconography and 'Anti-Iconology' of the Aztec Coatlicue Sculpture"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuances==
In 1952, [[Creighton Gilbert]] added another opinion about the meaning of the word "iconology". According to his view, iconology was not the actual investigation of the work of art but rather the result of this investigation. The Austrian art historian [[Hans Sedlmayr]] differentiated between "sachliche" and "methodische" iconology. "Sachliche" iconology refers to the "general meaning of an individual painting or of an artistic complex (church, palace, monument) as seen and explained with reference to the ideas which take shape in them." In contrast, "methodische" iconology is the "integral iconography which accounts for the changes and development in the representations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3407705539/iconology-and-iconography.html Encyclopedia.com: Iconology and Iconography]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Iconology: Images, Text, Ideology'' (1986), [[W.J.T. Mitchell]] writes that iconology is a study of "what to say about images", concerned with the description and interpretation of visual art, and also a study of "what images say" – the ways in which they seem to speak for themselves by persuading, telling stories, or describing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iconictheory.blogspot.de/2010/05/iconology.html Karen Hope, The Iconic Image: Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt; He pleads for a postlinguistic, postsemiotic "iconic turn", emphasizing the role of "non-linguistic symbol systems".&lt;ref&gt;W.J.T. Mitchell, ''Iconology: Images, Text, Ideology''. University of Chicago Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-sites.net/english/mitchell.htm w.j.t. mitchell and the image (review)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.J.T. Mitchell, "Iconology and Ideology: Panofsky, Althusser, and the Scene of Recognition". In David B. Downing and Susan Bazargan, eds., ''Image and Ideology in Modern/Postmodern Discourse''. New York 1991, pp.321-329.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of just pointing out the difference between the material (pictorial or artistic) images, "he pays attention to the dialectic relationship between material images and mental images".&lt;ref&gt;[https://ksangmin.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/w-j-t-mitchell-iconology-and-picture-theory/ W. J. T. Mitchell's Iconology and Picture Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dennise Bartelo and Robert Morton, the term "iconology" can also be used for characterizing "a movement toward seeing connections across all the language processes" and the idea about "multiple levels and forms used to communicate meaning" in order to get "the total picture” of learning. "Being both literate in the traditional sense and visually literate are the true mark of a well-educated human."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wac.colostate.edu/journal/vol8/bartelo_morton.pdf Dennise Bartelo and Robert Morton, "Iconology: An Alternate Form of Writing"]&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years, new approaches to iconology have developed in the theory of images. This is the case of what [[Jean-Michel Durafour]], French philosopher and theorist of cinema, proposed to call "econology", a biological approach to images as forms of life, crossing iconology, ecology and sciences of nature. In an econological regime, the image (''eikon'') self-speciates, that is to say, it self-iconicizes with others and eco-iconicizes with them its iconic habitat (''oikos''). The iconology, mainly Warburghian iconology, is thus merged with a conception of the relations between the beings of the nature inherited, among others ([[Arne Næss]], etc.) from the writings of [[Kinji Imanishi]]. For Imanishi, living beings are subjects. Or, more precisely, the environment and the living being are juste one. One of the main consequences is that the "specity", the living individual, "self-eco-speciates its place of life" (''Freedom in Evolution''). As far as the images are concerned: "If the living species self-specify, the images self-iconicize. This is not a tautology. The images update some of their iconic virtualities. They live in the midst of other images, past or present, but also future (those are only human classifications), which they have relations with. They self-iconicize in an iconic environment which they interact with, and which in particular makes them the images they are. Or more precisely, insofar as images have an active part: ''the images self-eco-iconicize their iconic environment''.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Durafour, ''"L'Étrange Créature du lac noir" de Jack Arnold. Aubades pour une zoologie des images'', Aix-en-Provence, Rouge profond, 2017, 200 p. ({{ISBN|978-2915083910}}), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;"

==Studies in iconology==
''Studies in Iconology'' is the title of a book by Erwin Panofsky on humanistic themes in the art of the Renaissance, which was first published in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of a peer-reviewed series of books started in 2014 under the editorship of [[Barbara Baert]] and published by Peeters international academic publishers, [[Leuven]], Belgium, addressing the deeper meaning of the visual medium throughout human history in the fields of philosophy, art history, theology and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peeters-leuven.be/search_serie_book.asp?nr=284 Peeters Publishers: Studies in Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Industrial arts''' is an educational program which features fabrication of objects in wood or metal using a variety of hand, power, or machine tools. It may include [[small engine repair]] and [[automobile maintenance]], and all programs usually cover [[technical drawing]] as part of the curricula. As an educational term, ''industrial arts'' dates from 1904 when Charles R. Richards of Teachers College, Columbia University, New York suggested it to replace ''[[manual training]]''.

In the [[U.S.A.|United States]], industrial arts classes are colloquially known as "'''[[Workshop |shop]] class'''"; these programs expose children to the basics of home repair, manual craftsmanship, and machine safety. Most industrial arts programs were established in comprehensive rather than dedicated [[vocational schools]] and focused on a broad range of skills rather than on a specific [[vocational training]]. In 1980, the name of industrial arts education in New York State was changed to "[[technology education]]" during what was called the "Figuring Project". The project goal was to increase students' [[technological literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.oswego.edu/technology/history-1/ |title= History {{!}} Department of Technology |last=|first= |date= 2017 |website= www.oswego.edu |at=sec. Technology Education |language= en |archive-url=|archive-date= |dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (VIC, Australia) industrial arts is still a key part of the high school curriculum. The term now describes a key study of [[technology]] that focuses on both engineering and industrial technologies. Additionally, [[design]] using the aforementioned technologies is now a key part of the industrial arts curriculum and has been since the mid-1980s when the subject of technics was introduced into Victorian high schools.

One of the most important aspects of industrial arts is still that while students design they ultimately realize a solution; learning the challenges involved with working with materials and also the challenges of small scale project management.

Some universities have doctoral programs in industrial arts.

==Industrial arts clubs==
An industrial arts club is an organization that promotes the use of industrial fabrication equipment by the general public. Clubs have grown out of the decline of industrial arts (aka shop class) programs in comprehensive school systems in the US.
Clubs began as student organizations in primary and secondary schools offering industrial, the [[TechShop]] and Sparqs Industrial Arts Club based in Massachusetts which grew out of campus activities at [[MIT]].

==Industrial Arts in New South Wales==
Industrial Arts (IA) is an important part of the (NSW) high school curriculum. Industrial Arts syllabi are managed, like all NSW syllabi by the [[Board of Studies]]. In some schools Industrial Arts faculties have become part of a larger Technology faculty, however many schools still have a stand-alone Industrial Arts faculty.

The primary role of Industrial Arts education is to expose students to a variety of industrial and [[engineering]] technologies that improve their understanding of the industrial and engineered world. Moreover, students learn both project management and design principles, most courses are project based with students realizing a solution to a design or engineering challenge. Two key components of the projects are '''synthesis''' of a solution and '''evaluation''' of the final product. Both of these components are the highest order objectives in [[Bloom's Taxonomy]].

===Industrial Arts Curricula in NSW===
Industrial Arts has a single compulsory course for Years 7 and 8: Technology (Mandatory). This course also has area that cover Home Economics concepts and Information Communication Technologies (ICT) content.

For Years 9 and 10 all Industrial Arts courses are electives, the three electives on offer are Design and Technology, Graphics Technology and Industrial Technology. The most popular Industrial Arts elective is Industrial Technology.

*'''Design and Technology''': this course centres on design without a prescribed context, so students may work with a variety of non-specified technologies. Students are given a design challenge and they come up with a solution. Their passage through the design process is documented in a Design Folio. In some schools Design and Technology may not be delivered by the Industrial Arts faculty, in some schools the [[Home Economics]] faculty may run the Design and Technology course.
*'''Graphics Technology''': this course introduces students to both manual (pencil) technical drawing and [[Computer Aided Design]] (CAD). This course has a core study in Year 9 and then a variety of electives for Year 10 including: Engineering Drawing, Architectural Drawing and Computer Animation.
*'''Industrial Technology''': this course may be studied with a variety of different disciplines with the most popular ones being: [[timber]], [[metal]], [[electronics]], [[multimedia]] and [[engineering]]. All have a common theme that students are involved in designing and making projects relevant to the context being studied. For example, a student in Industrial Technology – Multimedia may be asked to design an animation or website advertising a product. The development of their project is documented in their Project Report. A key part of the project report is evaluation of the finished product.

In Years 11 and 12 Industrial Arts offers three [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]] (HSC) non-Vocational courses: Design and Technology, Engineering Studies and Industrial Technology.
*'''Design and Technology''' is an extension of the junior course of the same name. The course centres on design without a prescribed context, so students may work with a variety of non-specified technologies. For their HSC students must create a Major Design Project. Students establish a need and then try to solve it and realise a solution. A key part of the project is evaluation through the design process. The Major Design project counts for 60% of their final HSC examination mark.
*'''Engineering Studies''' is primarily a theory course that introduces students to the engineered world. The course looks at a variety of engineering applications and fields of engineering. Students learn about engineering history and societal implications, [[engineering mechanics]], [[engineering materials]], engineering electronics and engineering communication methods. The course introduces students to many concepts that they would otherwise first encounter in undergraduate engineering programmes at university.  One of the fundamental aspects of the course is learning engineering through the investigation of real life applications. This builds greater significance and understanding in students.
*'''Industrial Technology''' is also an extension of the junior course of the same name. The course centres on students working within a prescribed technology such as: Timber Products and Furniture Industries, Multimedia Industries Automotive Industries, Electronics Industries, Graphics Industries and Metal and Engineering Industries. For their HSC students must create a Major Project. Students develop a project and document their progress through the project. Hence they learn the vital skills of project management. Similar to Design and Technology evaluation of the project is an important part of the associated documentation.  The Major Project counts for 60% of their final HSC examination mark. The fundamental difference between Industrial Technology and Design and Technology is that a student studying Industrial Technology must study theory relevant to specific technology and also study industry practices relevant to their technology.

==Professional Association for Industrial Arts in New South Wales==
In NSW the professional association for Industrial Arts teachers is the [[Institute of Industrial Arts Technology Education]] ([[IIATE]]). This organisation releases a quarterly journal (on CD) and also runs an annual conference that investigates matters relevant to Industrial Arts education. Moreover, the IIATE represents Industrial Arts teachers in a variety of situations such as syllabus development meetings and teacher training interviews.

Another important role that The IIATE fulfils is that of Professional Learning. The IIATE has run some very successful training days called ''Hands on Technology'' where teachers are able to build their skills and knowledge in a variety of areas. This ''Hands on'' concept has now been extended with the ''Hands on Engineering'' day now being developed to assist teachers in delivering the Industrial Arts' courses Industrial Technology - Engineering and Engineering Studies.

The IIATE has also successfully run training programmes for CAD software which has enable many more teachers to effectively embed CAD into their teaching.

'''Intercultural communication''' (or [[cross-cultural communication|'''cross-cultural communication''']]) is a discipline that studies [[communication]] across different [[culture]]s and [[social group]]s, or how culture affects communication. It describes the wide range of communication processes and problems that naturally appear within an organization or social context made up of individuals from different religious, social, ethnic, and educational backgrounds. In this sense it seeks to understand how people from different countries and cultures act, communicate and [[perception|perceive]] the world around them. Many people in intercultural business communication argue that culture determines how individuals encode messages, what medium they choose for transmitting them, and the way messages are interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauring|first=Jakob|title=Intercultural Organizational Communication: The Social Organizing of Interaction in International Encounters|journal=Journal of Business and Communication|year=2011|volume=48 |issue=3|pages=231–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
With regard to intercultural communication proper, it studies situations where people from different cultural backgrounds ''interact''. Aside from language, intercultural communication focuses on social attributes, thought patterns, and the cultures of different groups of people. It also involves understanding the different cultures, languages and customs of people from other countries. Intercultural communication plays a role in [[social science]]s such as [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and [[communication studies]]. Intercultural communication is also referred to as the base for international businesses. Several cross-cultural service providers assist with the development of intercultural communication skills. Research is a major part of the development of intercultural communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://communication-design.net/3-tips-for-effective-global-communication// | title=3 Tips For Effective Global Communication | date=April 9, 2010 | author=Drary, Tom | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413232213/http://communication-design.net/3-tips-for-effective-global-communication// | archivedate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/intercultural-communication// |title=Intercultural Communication Law &amp; Legal Definition |publisher=Definitions.uslegal.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identity and culture are also studied within the discipline of communication to analyze how globalization influences ways of thinking, beliefs, values, and identity, within and between cultural environments. Intercultural communication scholars approach theory with a dynamic outlook and do not believe culture can be measured nor that cultures share universal attributes. Scholars acknowledge that culture and communication shift along with societal changes and theories should consider the constant shifting and nuances of society.

The study of intercultural communication requires intercultural understanding, which is an ability to understand and value cultural differences. Language is an example of an important cultural component that is linked to intercultural understanding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Saint-Jacques, Bernard. 2011. “Intercultural Communication in a Globalized World.” In Intercultural Communication: A Reader, edited by Larry A. Samovar, Richard E. Porter, and Edwin R. McDaniel, 13 edition, 45-53. Boston, Mass: Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Intercultural communication'' is in a way the 'interaction with speakers of other languages on equal terms and respecting their identities'.&lt;ref&gt;Byram, Gribkova &amp; Starkey, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of interest ==

=== Cross-cultural business communication ===
Cross-cultural business communication is very helpful in building cultural intelligence through coaching and training in cross-cultural communication management and facilitation, cross-cultural negotiation, multicultural conflict resolution, customer service, business and organizational communication. Cross-cultural understanding is not just for incoming expats. Cross-cultural understanding begins with those responsible for the project and reaches those delivering the service or content.  The ability to communicate, negotiate and effectively work with people from other cultures is vital to international business.

====Management====
Important points to consider:

* Develop cultural sensitivity
* Anticipate the meaning the receiver will get.
* Careful encoding
* Use words, pictures, and gestures.
* Avoid slang, idioms, regional sayings.
* Selective transmission 
* Build relationships, face-to-face if possible.
* Careful decoding of feedback
* Get feedback from multiple parties.
* Improve listening and observation skills.
* Follow-up actions

====Facilitation====
There is a connection between a person's personality traits and the ability to adapt to the host-country's environment—including the ability to communicate within that environment.

Two key personality traits are openness and resilience. Openness includes traits such as tolerance for ambiguity, extrovertedness, and open-mindedness. Resilience includes having an internal locus of control, persistence, tolerance for ambiguity, and resourcefulness.

These factors, combined with the person's cultural and racial identity and level of preparedness for change, comprise that person's potential for adaptation.

=== Cultural&amp;nbsp;perceptions ===
There are common conceptualizations of attributes that define [[Collectivism|collectivistic]] and [[Individualism|individualistic]] cultures. Operationalizing the perceptions of cultural identities works under the guise that cultures are static and homogeneous, when in fact cultures within nations are multi-ethnic and individuals show high variation in how cultural differences are internalized and expressed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Globalization ===
[[Globalization]] plays a central role in theorizing for mass communication, media, and cultural communication studies.&lt;ref&gt;Crofts Wiley, Stephen B. 2004. “Rethinking Nationality in the Context of Globalization.” Communication Theory 14 (1):78–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Intercultural communication scholars emphasize that globalization emerged from the increasing diversity of cultures throughout the world and thrives with the removal of cultural barriers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The notion of nationality, or the construction of national space, is understood to emerge dialectically through communication and globalization.

The Intercultural Praxis Model by Kathryn Sorrells, PH.D shows us how to navigate through the complexities of cultural differences along with power differences. This model will help you understand who you are as an individual, and how you can better communicate with others that may be different from you. In order to continue living in a globalized society one can use this Praxis model to understand cultural differences (based on race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, etc.) within the institutional and historical systems of power. Intercultural Communication Praxis Model requires us to respond to someone who comes from a different culture than us, in the most open way we can. The media are influential in what we think of other cultures and also what we think about our own selves. However it is important, we educate ourselves, and learn how to communicate with others through Sorrells Praxis Model.[https://www.csun.edu/sites/default/files/field_download/page/Difficult%20Dialogues%20Learning%20Activity%20-%20Kathryn%20Sorrells.pdf]

== Problems ==
The problems in intercultural communication usually come from problems in message transmission and in reception. In communication between people of the same culture, the person who receives the message interprets it based on values, beliefs, and expectations for behavior similar to those of the person who sent the message. When this happens, the way the message is interpreted by the receiver is likely to be fairly similar to what the speaker intended. However, when the receiver of the message is a person from a different culture, the receiver uses information from his or her culture to interpret the message. The message that the receiver interprets may be very different from what the speaker intended.

Nonverbal communication has been shown to account for between 65% and 93% of interpreted communication.&lt;ref name="Samovar Larry 2006. pp13"&gt;Samovar Larry, Porter Richard, McDaniel Edwin, Roy Carolyn. 2006. Intercultural Communication A Reader. Nonverbal Communication. pp13.&lt;/ref&gt; Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause mistrust and misperception of the situation among cross-cultural parties. This is where nonverbal communication can cause problems with intercultural communication. Misunderstandings with nonverbal communication can lead to miscommunication and insults with cultural differences. For example, a handshake in one culture may be recognized as appropriate, whereas another culture may recognize it as rude or inappropriate.&lt;ref name="Samovar Larry 2006. pp13" /&gt;

Effective communication depends on the informal understandings among the parties involved that are based on the trust developed between them. When trust exists, there is implicit understanding within communication, cultural differences may be overlooked, and problems can be dealt with more easily. The meaning of trust and how it is developed and communicated vary across societies. Similarly, some cultures have a greater propensity to be trusting than others.

==Theories==
The following types of theories can be distinguished in different strands: focus on effective outcomes, on accommodation or adaption, on [[identity negotiation]] and management, on [[communication network]]s,on [[acculturation]] and [[Adjustment disorder|adjustment]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Gudykunst 2003 for an overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social engineering effective outcomes ===
*Cultural convergence
**In a relatively closed social system in which communication among members is unrestricted, the system as a whole will tend to ''converge'' over time toward a state of greater cultural ''uniformity''. The system will tend to diverge toward diversity when communication is restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid, D. L. (1988). The convergence theory of intercultural communication. In Y. Y. Kim &amp; W. B. Gudykunst (Eds.), Theories in intercultural communication (pp. 280–298). Newbury Park, CA: Sage. p.289&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Communication accommodation theory]]
**This theory focuses on linguistic strategies to decrease or increase communicative distances.Communication accommodation theory seeks to explain and predict why, when, and how people adjust their communicative behavior during social interaction, and what social consequences result from these adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1002/9781118540190.wbeic006|chapter=Communication Accommodation Theory|title=The International Encyclopedia of Interpersonal Communication|pages=1–21|year=2015|last1=Dragojevic|first1=Marko|last2=Gasiorek|first2=Jessica|last3=Giles|first3=Howard|isbn=9781118540190|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/306556/files/2007_gilesogay_cat.pdf|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Intercultural adaption
**Intercultural adaptation involves learned communicative competence. Communicative competence is defined as thinking, feeling, and pragmatically behaving in ways defined as appropriate by the dominant mainstream culture. Communication competence is an outcomes based measure conceptualized as functional/operational conformity to environmental criteria such as working conditions. Beyond this, adaptation means "the need to conform" to mainstream "objective reality" and "accepted modes of experience".&lt;ref name="Gudykunst, W. 2003"&gt;Gudykunst, W. &amp; Kim, Y. Y. (2003). Communicating with strangers: An approach to intercultural communication, 4th ed., 378. New York: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;  
*[[Co-cultural communication theory|Co-cultural theory]]
**In its most general form, co-cultural communication refers to interactions among underrepresented and dominant group members.&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, 1998. p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Co-cultures include but are not limited to people of color, women, people with disabilities, gay men and lesbians, and those in the lower social classes. Co-cultural theory, as developed by Mark P. Orbe, looks at the strategic ways in which co-cultural group members communicate with others. In addition, a co-cultural framework provides an explanation for how different persons communicate based on six factors.

===Identity negotiation or management===
*[[Identity management theory]]
*[[Identity negotiation]]
*Cultural identity theory
*[[Double-swing model]]

=== Communication networks ===
*Networks and outgroup communication competence
*[[Intracultural]] versus intercultural networks
*Networks and acculturation

=== Acculturation and adjustment ===
*Communication acculturation
**This theory attempts to portray "cross-cultural adaptation as a collaborative effort in which a stranger and the receiving environment are engaged in a joint effort."&lt;ref&gt;Kim Y.Y.(1995), p.192&lt;/ref&gt;
*Anxiety/Uncertainty management
**When strangers communicate with hosts, they experience uncertainty and anxiety. Strangers need to manage their uncertainty as well as their anxiety in order to be able to communicate effectively with hosts and then to try to develop accurate predictions and explanations for hosts' behaviors.
*[[Cultural assimilation|Assimilation]], [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]], and [[Social alienation|alienation]] states
**Assimilation and adaption are not permanent outcomes of the adaption process; rather, they are temporary outcomes of the communication process between hosts and immigrants. "Alienation or assimilation, therefore, of a group or an individual, is an outcome of the relationship between deviant behavior and neglectful communication."&lt;ref&gt;Mc.Guire and Mc.Dermott, 1988, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;
*Assimilation
** Assimilation is the process of absorbing the traits of the dominant culture to the point where the group that was assimilated becomes indistinguishable from the host culture. Assimilation can be either forced or done voluntarily depending on situations and conditions. Regardless of the situation or the condition it is very rare to see a minority group replace and or even forget their previous cultural practices.&lt;ref name="Assimilation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pauls|first1=Elizabeth|title=Assimilation|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/assimilation-society|website=www.britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Alienation
** Alienation  frequently refers to someone who is ostracized or withdrawn from other people with whom they would ordinarily be expected to associate with. Hajda, a representative theorist and researcher of social alienation says: " alienation is an individuals feeling of uneasiness or discomfort which reflects his exclusion or self-exclusion from social and cultural participation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Giffin|first1=Kim|title=Social alienation by communicaton denial|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|volume=56|issue=4|pages=347–357|doi=10.1080/00335637009383022|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other theories===
* [[Meaning of meanings theory]] – "A misunderstanding takes place when people assume a word has a direct connection with its referent. A common past reduces misunderstanding. Definition, metaphor, feedforward, and Basic English are partial linguistic remedies for a lack of shared experience."&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (2000), p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Face negotiation theory]] – "Members of collectivistic, high-context cultures have concerns for mutual face and inclusion that lead them to manage conflict with another person by avoiding, obliging, or compromising. Because of concerns for self-face and autonomy, people from individualistic, low-context cultures manage conflict by dominating or through problem solving"&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (2000), p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Standpoint theory]] – An individual's experiences, knowledge, and communication behaviors are shaped in large part by the social groups to which they belong. Individuals sometimes view things similarly, but other times have very different views in which they see the world. The ways in which they view the world are shaped by the experiences they have and through the social group they identify themselves to be a part of.&lt;ref&gt;[[Social group]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, P. H. (1990). Black feminist thought: Knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment. Boston: Unwin Hyman.&lt;/ref&gt; "Feminist standpoint theory claims that the social groups to which we belong shape what we know and how we communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 2005 {{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory is derived from the Marxist position that economically oppressed classes can access knowledge unavailable to the socially privileged and can generate distinctive accounts, particularly knowledge about social relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://read.amazon.com/?asin=B00DG8M7EU | title=Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice | publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc | year=2013 | isbn=978-1412927444 | edition=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stranger theory]] – At least one of the persons in an intercultural encounter is a stranger.  Strangers are a 'hyperaware' of cultural differences and tend to overestimate the effect of cultural identity on the behavior of people in an alien society, while blurring individual distinctions.
* [[Feminist genre theory]] – Evaluates communication by identifying feminist speakers and reframing their speaking qualities as models for women's liberation.
* [[Genderlect theory]] – "Male-female conversation is cross-cultural communication. Masculine and feminine styles of discourse are best viewed as two distinct cultural dialects rather than as inferior or superior ways of speaking. Men's report talk focuses on status and independence. Women's support talk seeks human connection."&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (2000), p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cultural critical studies theory]] – The theory states that the mass media impose the dominant ideology on the rest of society, and the connotations of words and images are fragments of ideology that perform an unwitting service for the ruling elite.
* [[Marxism]] – aims to explain class struggle and the basis of social relations through economics.

==History of assimilation==
* Forced assimilation was very common in the European colonial empires the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Colonial policies regarding religion conversion, the removal of children, the division of community property, and the shifting of gender roles primarily impacted North and South America, Australia, Africa, and Asia. 
Voluntary assimilation has also been a part of history dating back to the Spanish Inquisition of the late 14th and 15th centuries, when many Muslims and Jews voluntarily converted to Roman Catholicism as a response to religious prosecution while secretly continuing their original practices. Another example is when the Europeans moved to the United States.&lt;ref name="Assimilation"/&gt;

== Intercultural competence ==

Intercultural communication is competent when it accomplishes the objectives in a manner that is appropriate to the context and relationship. Intercultural communication thus needs to bridge the dichotomy between appropriateness and effectiveness:&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt; Proper means of intercultural communication leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/| title=Facts and Figures| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Appropriateness:''' Valued rules, norms, and expectations of the relationship are not violated significantly.
*'''Effectiveness:''' Valued goals or rewards (relative to costs and alternatives) are accomplished.

'''Competent communication''' is an interaction that is seen as effective in achieving certain rewarding objectives in a way that is also related to the context in which the situation occurs. In other words, it is a conversation with an achievable goal that is used at an appropriate time/location.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"&gt;(Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Components===

Intercultural communication can be linked with identity, which means the competent communicator is the person who can affirm others' avowed identities. As well as goal attainment is also a focus within intercultural competence and it involves the communicator to convey a sense of communication appropriateness and effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;

Ethnocentrism plays a role in intercultural communication. The capacity to avoid ethnocentrism is the foundation of intercultural communication competence. Ethnocentrism is the inclination to view one's own group as natural and correct, and all others as aberrant.

People must be aware that to engage and fix intercultural communication there is no easy solution and there is not only one way to do so. Listed below are some of the components of intercultural competence.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;

* Context: A judgment that a person is competent is made in both a relational and situational context.This means that competence is not defined as a single attribute, meaning someone could be very strong in one section and only moderately good in another. Situationally speaking competence can be defined differently for different cultures. For example, eye contact shows competence in western cultures whereas, Asian cultures find too much eye contact disrespectful.
* Appropriateness: This means that one's behaviours are acceptable and proper for the expectations of any given culture.
* Effectiveness: The behaviours that lead to the desired outcome being achieved.
* Motivations:This has to do with emotional associations as they communicate interculturally. Feelings which are one's reactions to thoughts and experiences have to do with motivation. Intentions are thoughts that guide one's choices, it is a goal or plan that directs one's behaviour. These two things play a part in motivation.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;

=== Basic tools for improvement ===

The following are ways to improve communication competence:
* Display of interest: showing respect and positive regard for the other person.
* Orientation to knowledge: Terms people use to explain themselves  and their perception of the world.
* Empathy:  Behaving in ways that shows one understands the point of view of others
* Task role behaviour: initiate ideas that encourage problem solving activities.
* Relational role behaviour: interpersonal harmony and mediation.
* Tolerance for unknown and ambiguity: The ability to react to new situations with little discomfort.
* Interaction posture: Responding to others in descriptive, non-judgmental ways.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;
* Patience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geldart|first1=Phil|title=Excellent Communication Requires Patience|url=https://www.eaglesflight.com/blog/bid/153152/Excellent-Communication-Requires-Patience|website=eaglesflight}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Active listening&lt;ref name="linguasoftech.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Importance of Communication Skills at Work Place|url=https://www.linguasoftech.com/blog/importance-of-communication-skills-at-work-place/|website=linguasofttech|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clarity  &lt;ref name="linguasoftech.com"/&gt;

=== Important factors===

* Proficiency in the host culture language: understanding the grammar and vocabulary.
* Understanding language pragmatics: how to use politeness strategies in making requests and how to avoid giving out too much information.
* Being sensitive and aware to nonverbal communication patterns in other cultures.
* Being aware of gestures that may be offensive or mean something different in a host culture rather than one's own culture.
* Understanding a culture's proximity in physical space and paralinguistic sounds to convey their intended meaning.&lt;ref name="Intercultural Communication"&gt;(Intercultural Communication)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traits ===

* Flexibility.
* Tolerating high levels of uncertainty.
* Self-reflection.
* Open-mindedness.
* Sensitivity.
* Adaptability.
* "[[Thinking outside the box]]" and [[lateral thinking]]&lt;ref name="Intercultural Communication"/&gt;

==Verbal communication==
Verbal communication consist of messages being sent and received continuously with the speaker and the listener, it is focused on the way messages are portrayed. Verbal communication is based on language and use of expression, the tone in which the sender of the message relays the communication can determine how the message is received and in what context.

'''Factors that affect verbal communication:'''

* Tone of voice
* Use of descriptive words
* Emphasis on certain phrases
* Volume of voice

The way a message is received is dependent on these factors as they give a greater interpretation for the receiver as to what is meant by the message. By emphasizing a certain phrase with the tone of voice, this indicates that it is important and should be focused more on.

Along with these attributes, verbal communication is also accompanied with non-verbal cues. These cues make the message clearer and give the listener an indication of what way the information should be received.&lt;ref&gt;Hinde, R. A. (1972). Non-verbal communication; edited by R. A. Hinde. -. Cambridge [Eng.]: University Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Example of non-verbal cues'''

* Facial expressions
* Hand gestures
* Use of objects
* Body movement

In terms of intercultural communication there are language barriers which are effected by verbal forms of communication. In this instance there is opportunity for miscommunication between two or more parties.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, A. (2007). Verbal and nonverbal communication behaviours [electronic resource] : COST Action 2102 International Workshop, Vietri sul Mare, Italy, March 29–31, 2007 : revised selected and invited papers / Anna Esposito ... [et al.] (eds.). Berlin ; New York : Springer, c2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Other barriers that contribute to miscommunication would be the type of words chosen in conversation. Due to different cultures there are different meaning in vocabulary chosen, this allows for a message between the sender and receiver to be misconstrued.&lt;ref&gt;Scollon, R., &amp; Scollon, S. K. (2001). Intercultural communication : a discourse approach / Ron Scollon and Suzanne Wong Scollon. Malden, MA : Blackwell Publishers, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nonverbal communication ==
Nonverbal communication is behavior that communicates without words—though it often may be accompanied by words. Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause differing interpretations of the situation among cross-cultural parties.

Kinesic behavior is communication through body movement—e.g., posture, gestures, facial expressions and eye contact. The meaning of such behavior varies across countries.

Occulesics are a form of kinesics that includes eye contact and the use of the eyes to convey messages.

[[Proxemics]] concern the influence of proximity and space on communication (e.g., in terms of personal space and in terms of office layout). For example, space communicates power in the US and Germany.

[[Paralanguage]] refers to how something is said, rather than the content of what is said—e.g., rate of speech, tone and inflection of voice, other noises, laughing, yawning, and silence.

Object language or material culture refers to how people communicate through material artifacts—e.g., architecture, office design and furniture, clothing, cars, cosmetics, and time. In monochronic cultures, time is experienced linearly and as something to be spent, saved, made up, or wasted. Time orders life, and people tend to concentrate on one thing at a time. In polychronic cultures, people tolerate many things happening simultaneously and emphasize involvement with people. In these cultures, people may be highly distractible, focus on several things at once, and change plans often.

Clothing and the way people dress is used as a form of nonverbal communication.

== Interdisciplinary orientation ==
Cross-cultural communication endeavours to bring together such relatively unrelated areas as [[cultural anthropology]] and established areas of communication. Its core is to establish and understand how people from different cultures communicate with each other. Its charge is to also produce some guidelines with which people from different cultures can better communicate with each other.

Cross-cultural communication, as with many scholarly fields, is a combination of many other fields. These fields include [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]] and communication. The field has also moved both toward the treatment of interethnic relations, and toward the study of communication strategies used by [[co-cultural populations]], i.e., communication strategies used to deal with majority or mainstream populations.

The study of languages other than one's own can serve not only to help one understand what we as humans have in common, but also to assist in the understanding of the diversity which underlines our languages' methods of constructing and organizing knowledge. Such understanding has profound implications with respect to developing a critical awareness of social relationships. Understanding social relationships and the way other cultures work is the groundwork of successful globalization business affairs.

Language socialization can be broadly defined as “an investigation of how language both presupposes and creates anew, social relations in cultural context”.&lt;ref name="Rymes"&gt;Rymes, (2008). Language Socialization and the Linguistic Anthropology of Education. Encyclopedia of Language and Education, 2(8, Springer)&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative that the speaker understands the grammar of a language, as well as how elements of language are socially situated in order to reach communicative competence. Human experience is culturally relevant, so elements of language are also culturally relevant.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|3}}  One must carefully consider semiotics and the evaluation of sign systems to compare cross-cultural norms of communication.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|4}} There are several potential problems that come with language socialization, however. Sometimes people can over-generalize or label cultures with stereotypical and subjective characterizations. Another primary concern with documenting alternative cultural norms revolves around the fact that no social actor uses language in ways that perfectly match normative characterizations.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|8}} A methodology for investigating how an individual uses language and other semiotic activity to create and use new models of conduct and how this varies from the cultural norm should be incorporated into the study of language socialization.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|11,12}}

The '''International Association for the Cognitive Science of Religion''' ('''IACSR'''), founded in 2006, is a scholarly association dedicated to the promotion of the [[Cognitive Science of Religion]]. The IACSR is an interdisciplinary association, including scholars from a wide variety of disciplines in the human, social, natural and health sciences that are interested in the academic, scientific study of religious phenomena. The IACSR seeks to advance the naturalistic study of religion. It is strictly scientific and does not encourage or welcome those who are interested in dialogue between science and religion, attempt to find religion in science and science in religion, or attempt to validate religious or spiritual doctrines through cognitive science.&lt;ref&gt;[[IACSR]] as cited in {{cite web |url=http://www.iacsr.com/Home.html |title=IACSR-Home |accessdate=2008-08-08 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Janzen–Connell hypothesis''' is a widely accepted explanation for the maintenance of [[tree]] [[species]] [[biodiversity]] in [[tropical rainforests]].  It was published independently in the early 1970s by [[Daniel Janzen]]&lt;ref name="Janzen"&gt;Janzen, Daniel H. "Herbivores and the Number of Tree Species in Tropical Forests." The American Naturalist. 104.940 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Connell]].&lt;ref name="Connell"&gt;Connell, J.H. "On the role of natural enemies in preventing competitive exclusion in some marine animals and in rain forest trees." In: Dynamics of Population. Ed. P.J. Den Boer and G.R. Gradwell. Wageningen: Pudoc, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; According to their hypothesis, [[Host (biology)|host]]-specific [[Herbivore|herbivores]], [[pathogens]], or other [[natural enemies]] (often referred to as [[Predation|predators]]&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt;) make the areas near a parent tree (the seed producing tree) inhospitable for the survival of seedlings.  These natural enemies are referred to as 'distance-responsive predators' if they kill seeds or seedlings near the parent tree, or 'density-dependent predators' if they kill seeds or seedlings where they are most abundant (which is typically near the parent tree&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt;). Such predators can prevent any one species from dominating the landscape, because if that species is too common, there will be few safe places for its seedlings to survive.  However, because the predators are host-specific (also called [[specialist predator|specialists]]), they will not harm other tree species.  As a result, if a species becomes very rare, then more predator-free areas will become available, giving that species' seedlings a competitive advantage.  This negative feedback allows the tree species to coexist, and can be classified as a [[coexistence theory|stabilizing mechanism]].

The Janzen-Connell hypothesis has been called a special case of [[keystone species|keystone predation]], [[niche partitioning#Types of niche differentiation|predator partitioning]] or the pest pressure hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Carson"&gt;Carson, Walter A. and Stefan A. Schnitzer. Tropical Forest Community Ecology. Blackwell Publishing: Hoboken, NJ, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Gregory|editor1-last=Burslem|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Pinard|editor2-first=Michelle|editor3-last=Hartley|editor3-first=Sue|title=Biotic interactions in the tropics : their role in the maintenance of species diversity|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521609852|pages=141-164}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pest pressure hypothesis states that plant diversity is maintained by specialist natural enemies.&lt;ref name="gillette1962"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillette|first1=J.B.|title=Pest pressure, an underestimated factor in evolution|journal=Taxonomy and Geography; a symposium|date=1962|volume=4|issue=37|pages=37-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Janzen-Connell hypothesis expands on this, by claiming that the natural enemies are not only specialists, but also are distance-responsive or density-responsive.&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt;

This mechanism has been proposed as promoting diversity of forests as it promotes survival of a number of different plant species within one localized region. While previously thought to explain the high diversity of tropical forests in particular, subsequent research has demonstrated the applicability of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis in temperate settings as well. The Black Cherry is one such example of a [[temperate forest]] species whose growth patterns can still be explained by the Janzen–Connell hypothesis.

==History==

===Daniel Janzen’s hypothesis===
Daniel Janzen published his hypothesis in 1970 in ''[[The American Naturalist]]'' under the article "Herbivores and the Number of Tree Species in Tropical Forests."&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt; His hypothesis was based on the observation that in tropical forests (when compared to temperate forests), there were few new adult trees in the immediate vicinity of their parent tree. He explained the low density of tropical trees and lack of "bunching" of tree types around parent trees for two reasons: (1) the number of [[seeds]] decline with distance from the parent tree and (2) that the adult tree, its seeds, and seedlings are a source of food for host-specific parasites and diseases.
Using his observations, Janzen created a model demonstrating the probability of a seed maturation or a seedling survival as a function of distance from the parent tree (as well as total seed count, dispersal mechanism, and predatorial activity).

===Joseph Connell hypothesis===
Joseph Connell published his hypothesis in 1971 in Dynamics of Populations.&lt;ref name="Connell" /&gt; Unlike Janzen, Connell proposed experiments that focused on the key prediction that exclusion of host-specific predators would cause a decrease in diversity as tree species with greater establishment or competitive ability formed low-diversity seedling and sapling communities where dominance was concentrated in a few species.

He formed his hypothesis through observations in [[Queensland]], Australia.  Along with Jack Greening Tracey and Larry Johnson Webb, he mapped trees in two rainforests and observed that smaller seedlings tended to occur in single-species clumps.  Smaller seedlings also exhibited greater [[Mortality rate|mortality]], especially when their nearest neighbor was an individual of the same species.  This pattern lessened with growth and age until seedlings exhibited similar pattern diversity to adults.  To reinforce these observations, Connell ran an experiment showing that adult trees have a deleterious effect on smaller trees of the same species.  In another experiment, Connell found that pre-germination predation was greater on seeds near adults of the same species than those near adults of others.  Through these observations, Connell suggests that each tree species has host-specific enemies that attack it and any of its offspring which are close to the parent.  This emphasizes the importance of the role of predation in preventing trees from forming single-species groves, which is probably the only way in which one species of tree could exclude others by interspecies competition.

==Effects on forest dynamics==

===Disease dynamics and tree density===
Plant pathogens follow [[infectious disease dynamics]]. The [[basic reproductive rate]] &lt;math&gt;(R_0)&lt;/math&gt; of a disease is dependent on three variables such that:

&lt;br&gt;{{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} &amp;beta;''L''''S''}}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Where &amp;beta; is the transmission rate or infectiousness of the disease, ''L'' is the average infection time of the host, and ''S'' is the density of the host population.  By decreasing any one of the variables, the reproduction rate of the disease decreases.  Since seed dispersal is such that the highest density of seeds is around the parent with density decreasing with distance from the parent, the reproduction rate of a disease infecting seeds and seedlings will be highest around the parent and decrease with distance. Thus, seedlings close to the parent are likely to die due to the disease prevalence. However, seedlings farther away are less likely to encounter the disease and therefore will more likely grow into adults.

===Herbivory and tree density===
Specialist herbivores who consume plant matter can also be thought of as having a "transmission rate" between individuals similarly to a disease. Tree predators (especially herbivorous insects) are limited by the ease of movement. When individuals are closer together at high density, movement between trees is easier and the predators quickly spread out. However, at low tree density, predators can not find the next individual with as much ease and thus often have low transmission rates leading to less specialist predation.

==Problematic aspects==

Many studies examining the Janzen–Connell hypothesis have shown supporting patterns with a number of tree species, but despite this there are also problematic aspects of the hypothesis.
# The first is that the Janzen–Connell hypothesis explains diversity at a community-wide scale, but most studies have only looked at a single species or a localized region. Most studies do not test the diversity prediction and did not determine the causes for patterns consistent with Janzen–Connell effects.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;  As Wright (2002) pointed out, "field measurements only demonstrate that niche differences, Janzen–Connell effects, and negative density dependence occur. Implications for species coexistence and plant diversity remain conjectural."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, J.S.  "Plant diversity in tropical forests: a review of mechanisms of species coexistence."  Oecologia. 130.1 (2002): 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt;
# While these host-specific predators may play [[keystone species]] roles as they possibly aid in the prevention of superior tree competitors from monopolizing an area, no study has yet to examine species richness and abundance after removing natural enemies, creating a gap in the supporting research for the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
# Diversity may be maintained, at least in part, by episodic outbreaks of specialized pests, which may reduce the survivorship, growth, and [[fecundity|reproductive success]] of adults of a species whenever they are particularly aggregated.  Thus, specialist predation also impacts adult density, rather than just juveniles which has been the focus of research efforts.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
# Disease and predation may be just affecting overall density rather than in localized regions around adults alone.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
# Theoretical work has suggested that distance-responsive predators are less able to promote coexistence than equivalent predators that are not distance-responsive.&lt;ref name="stump2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stump|first1=Simon Maccracken|last2=Chesson|first2=Peter|title=Distance-responsive predation is not necessary for the Janzen–Connell hypothesis|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=December 2015|volume=106|pages=60–70|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2015.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Many empirical studies have shown that few natural enemies are host-specific specialists,&lt;ref name="novotny2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novotny|first1=V.|last2=Basset|first2=Y.|title=Host specificity of insect herbivores in tropical forests|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 June 2005|volume=272|issue=1568|pages=1083–1090|doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.3023|pmc=1559807}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the original hypothesis claimed.  However, theoretical work has suggested that predators can have broader diets as long as they are more damaging to their primary host than other species.&lt;ref name="sedio2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sedio|first1=Brian E.|last2=Ostling|first2=Annette M.|last3=Ris Lambers|first3=Janneke Hille|title=How specialised must natural enemies be to facilitate coexistence among plants?|journal=Ecology Letters|date=August 2013|volume=16|issue=8|pages=995–1003|doi=10.1111/ele.12130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The responses of density-dependent predators' may not be restricted to a single trophic level, and when multiple trophic levels interact, Janzen-Connell effects may be negated. This is an example of "the enemy of my enemy is my friend"  and it has been shown that the potential of host-specific insects to induce negative-density dependence in plant populations can be severely limited when the natural enemies of the seed predators are also density responsive &lt;ref name="VisserMuller-Landau2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visser|first1=Marco D.|last2=Muller-Landau|first2=Helene C.|last3=Wright|first3=S. Joseph|last4=Rutten|first4=Gemma|last5=Jansen|first5=Patrick A.|title=Tri-trophic interactions affect density dependence of seed fate in a tropical forest palm|journal=Ecology Letters|volume=14|issue=11|year=2011|pages=1093–1100|issn=1461023X|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01677.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Research testing the hypothesis==

===Supporting research===
There have been over 50 studies designed to test predictions of this hypothesis in tropical and other settings and most show that many tree species exhibit patterns consistent with Janzen–Connell effects.  Studies that have supported the Janzen–Connell hypothesis:
* A 2010 study of [[Panama]] forest reinforced that Janzen–Connell effects are also prevalent in tropical rainforests as seedlings growing close to their parents are likely to die due to [[microorganisms]] in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Mangan, Scott A., et al. "Negative plant–soil feedback predicts tree-species relative abundance in a tropical forest." Nature 466 (8 July 2010) 752–755.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2008 study by Petermann ''et al.'' in [[grasslands]] showed that soil-borne pests created a feedback very similar to the Janzen–Connell effect, supporting the hypothesis as a driver of diversity in temperate [[ecosystems]]. This study suggests that the predator/density mechanism that promotes species diversity is not contained to tropical forests alone – even if tropical ecosystems do have the highest diversity. This supports the hypothesis as a mechanism for diversity, but not as an explanation [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Pertermann, Jana S. et al. "Janzen–Connell Effects are Widespread and Strong Enough to Maintain Diversity in Grasslands." Ecology 89.9 (2008): 2399–2406.&lt;/ref&gt;
* An examination of spatial data for 24 woody tropical rain forest plants showed either density-dependence or distance-dependence in plant offspring, supporting the hypothesis. However, other causal factors such as [[allelopathy]] were also suggested in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Deborah A. and David B. Clark. "Dynamics of a Tropical Rain Forest Tree: Evaluation of the Janzen–Connell Model." The American Naturalist. 124.6 (1984):769–788.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissenting Research===
Studies questioning the Janzen–Connell hypothesis:
* Hyatt ''et al.'' examined the hypothesis across a number of tree species (rather than focusing on the effects on just one) and found no support for the distance-dependence of the hypothesis and concluded that the Janzen–Connell hypothesis was not a mechanism for diversity. They did find however that in temperate settings, distance from parent reduced survivorship. But in tropical settings there was a slight positive correlation between the improved competitive ability of seeds and  distance from parent.&lt;ref name="Hyatt"&gt;Hyatt, Lauren A. et al. "The Distance Dependence Prediction of the Janzen–Connell Hypothesis: a Meta-Analysis." Oikos. 103.3 (2003): 590–602.&lt;/ref&gt;  These findings were later challenged: Using additional data, and slightly different statistical techniques, Comita ''et al.''&lt;ref name="comita_2014_meta"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Comita|first1=Liza S.|last2=Queenborough|first2=Simon A.|last3=Murphy|first3=Stephen J.|last4=Eck|first4=Jenalle L.|last5=Xu|first5=Kaiyang|last6=Krishnadas|first6=Meghna|last7=Beckman|first7=Noelle|last8=Zhu|first8=Yan|last9=Gómez-Aparicio|first9=Lorena|title=Testing predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis: a meta-analysis of experimental evidence for distance- and density-dependent seed and seedling survival|journal=Journal of Ecology|date=July 2014|volume=102|issue=4|pages=845–856|doi=10.1111/1365-2745.12232|pmc=4140603}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that there was strong evidence for distance-dependence at the seedling stage, but not at the seed stage.
* A 1994 study by Burkey found that seed predation did not follow a pattern supporting that of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis along a meaningful scale. Seeds within 1 metre from the trunk were highly predated. However, seeds reached their peak density while still under the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] of their parent. The authors concluded that seed predation did not follow the Janzen–Connell hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Burkey, T.V. "Tree Species Diversity: A Test of the Janzen–Connell Model." Oecologia. 97. (1994): 533–540.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current conclusions and further research==
It is tricky to form conclusions regarding the accuracy of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis as it is difficult to falsify. This is because:
* Heavy predation may keep some species rare and widely spaced, and these species may also be the best competitors.  If so, these species are most likely to form dense aggregations that would reduce diversity in local areas. But due to their rarity or a belief that rare species are not regulated by density-dependence, these species may be the ones least likely to be studied.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
* This means that the failure to find Janzen–Connell effects for what could be hundreds of tree species does not reject the hypothesis, as ecologists are missing the few key species where it does apply. However, dissenting findings do reduce the importance of the hypothesis for explaining overall coexistence of a number species.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
** For example, Hyatt ''et al.'' (2003) found that there were "individual cases of conformity to the hypothesis,"&lt;ref name="Hyatt" /&gt; which is all that is needed for the hypothesis to work if the specific cases represent tree species that are excellent competitors, highly shade tolerant, habitat generalists, or some combination of these traits that would allow these species to otherwise dominate the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;

It is likely that a number of mechanisms underscore the coexistence of similar species and thus cause biodiversity in ecosystems. It is possible the Janzen–Connell hypothesis is applicable only for some species depending on species characteristics. The hypothesis may also be affected by the kind of predator or pathogen as preliminary research has shown that the hypothesis is true only when host-specific predators have limited mobility with a range less than the seed dispersal range.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan, Ran and Renato Casagrandi. "A simple mechanistic model of seed dispersal, predation and plant establishment: Janzen–Connell and beyond." Journal of Ecology. 92. (2004): 733–746.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[interwar period]] he made a significant but controversial social effort to help women of limited means with [[sex education]], [[birth control]] and [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://denstoredanske.dk/Krop,_psyke_og_sundhed/Sundhedsvidenskab/L%C3%A6ger/Jonathan_H%C3%B8egh_von_Leunbach  Article in Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Jonathan Leunbach was the son of Jørgen Høegh Leunbach (1842-1903) and Cassandra Wilhelmine Hjardemaal (1845-1925).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geni.com/people/J%C3%B8rgen-H%C3%B8egh-Leunbach/6000000032962371954&lt;/ref&gt; He took a master's degree in medicine in 1912 and worked as a general practitioner in Brønderslev in [[Jylland]] 1915-1917. After some years of hospital employment in [[Copenhagen]], he established himself here in 1922 as a general practitioner.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.museion.ku.dk/da/aktuelt/udstillinger/9-laeger-9-liv/de-9/jonathan-leunbach/&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a [[socialism|socialist]], Leunbach was in favour of [[Wilhelm Reich|Wilhelm Reich's]] sexual political ideas. In the 1920s he was known to the public through his agitation for better sex education, safe and affordable contraception and better access to abortion, particularly for poor families with many children.  In 1924, together with writer [[Thit Jensen]] he initiated ''Foreningen for seksuel Oplysning'' (Organization for Sexual Awareness), which worked for women's right to use [[birth control]], in particular the [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]].

Thit Jensen broke off her collaboration with Leunbach in 1928, as she did not support his work for induced abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_litteraturs_historie/Dansk_litteraturs_historie_3/Kvinden_i_historien_-_Thit_Jensen/Det_frivillige_hellige_moderskab&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, Leunbach was a respected name, being co-founder of  the ''Verdensligaen for seksuel Reform'' (World League for Sexual Reform) in Copenhagen in 1927, while in Denmark he was met with massive resistance from most political parties, medical and ecclesial communities as well as the women's rights organisation [[Dansk Kvindesamfund]].

In the early 1930s Leunbach performed some 300 abortions,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  and he was charged twice with complicity in illegal abortion. He was acquitted in 1935, but the following year was sentenced to three months in prison,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dagensmedicin.dk/opinion/debat/forsvar-for-leunbach/&lt;/ref&gt; lost his civil rights for five years, including being barred from working as a doctor. He and some contemporaries regarded this as a political conviction. Leunbachs work helped launch a debate on abortion, which in 1937 brought the Danish parliament to pass Denmark's first abortion legislation, which reduced the penalty for induced abortion and gave better opportunities to let a woman have an abortion for health reasons.

In 1939, the private organisation ''Mødrehjælpen'' (Mothers' Help), which was created in 1924 to help pregnant women to have their child, regardless of whether they were married or single, was made part of the public Danish social system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dr.dk/skole/historie/doktor-leunbach&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[sexual liberation]], induced abortion was made legal in Denmark in 1973, and much of what Leunbach originally fought for is now regarded as self-evident rights.

Leunbach died in a drowning accident in Italy and is buried in [[Hellerup Cemetery]].

== Miscellaneous ==
Leunbach is mentioned in episode 10 of the Danish TV series [[Matador (Danish TV series)|Matador]], where in 1935 one of the leading ladies creates a commotion in the town by supporting his thoughts on abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://tommierieland.dk/film/matado10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;http://www.dr.dk/skole/Historie/1950erne/sexogmoral/moral1940/20100514154121_1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://matadoronline.dk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/manus-episode10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Le Guide musical''''' (English: The Music Guide) was a weekly French-language Belgian and French classical music periodical founded 1 March 1855 in Brussels by Peter Bernhard Schott (1821–1873), of the Brussels music publishing house [[Schott frères]] (Schott brothers).&lt;ref name="Sandrine" /&gt;

==Editors and history==
[[Maurice Kufferath]] (1852–1919) was editor from 1887 to 1891.&lt;ref&gt;''The Music Reviews and Criticism in Wallonia and Brussels in the Nineteenth Century'', by Henri Albert Alexander Vanhulst (born 1943) (Brussels), ''Periodica Musica'' (in French), [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]]: [[University of Maryland]] (publisher), vol. IX (1991), pp. 15–19; {{ISSN|0822-7594}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, the editorial office relocated to Paris and began publishing from both Paris and Brussels. In 1892, Otto Junne, director of [[Schott frères]], sold the periodical to Kufferath, the editor. From 1894 to 1905, Hugues Imbert (1842–1905) became editor-in-chief, then Henri de Curzon (1861–1942). Kufferath preserved the publication's Franco-Belgium character. The publication ceased publication in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Guide musical|url=http://www.ripm.org/?page=JournalInfo&amp;ABB=GMU|publisher=ripm|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

mainzed is based on different long-term cooperations between various institutions in Mainz. The research and development institution for digital humanities of the Academy of Sciences and Literature Mainz, ''Digitale Akademie'', was founded in 2009 and is connected to the Institute of Historical Regional Studies at the University of Mainz, the Leibniz Institute of European History and the universities of Mainz. Since 1997, the Romano-Germanic Central Museum Mainz and the i3mainz – Institute for Spatial Information and Surveying Technology have operated the ''Competence Centre for Spatial Information Technology in the Humanities'' at the Mainz University of Applied Sciences. In autumn 2013, the informal ''Network DHMainz''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Forum DHMainz: Kompetenz-Marktplatz für digitale Geisteswissenschaften {{!}} i3mainz|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://i3mainz.hs-mainz.de/de/pressemitteilungen/ForumDHMainz2014|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-01-11|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created with the help of the Mainz Research Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Homepage of Mainz Research Alliance |periodical= |publisher= |url=https://www.wissenschaftsallianz-mainz.de/en/ |deadurl= |format= |accessdate=2018-05-22 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |last= |date= |year= |month= |day= |language= |pages= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network was responsible for the preparation of the Digital Humanities Day 2014 in Mainz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Digital Humanities Tag 2014 – Programm {{!}}|periodical=|publisher=Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz|url=https://www.digitale-bibliotheksdienste.uni-mainz.de/kurse-und-veranstaltungen/digital-humanities-tag-2014-methoden-technologien-horizonte-impulse-aus-der-praxis/programm/|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-01-11|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where first drafts were made for the continuation of the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-mainz.de/studium-und-lehre/Dateien/JGU_LuST_05.pdf Magazin zu Lehre und Studium Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz], S. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=mainzed jahresbericht 2015/2016 |periodical= |publisher= |url=http://mainzed.org/jahresbericht/2015/ |deadurl= |format= |accessdate=2018-01-11 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |last= |date= |year= |month= |day= |language=German |pages= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mating call''' is the auditory signal used by animals to attract mates. It can occur in males or females, but literature is abundantly favored toward researching mating calls in males. In addition, mating calls are often the subject of [[mate choice]], in which the preferences of one gender for a certain type of mating call can drive sexual selection in a species. This can result in [[sympatric speciation]] of some animals, where two species diverge from each other while living in the same environment.

There are many different mechanisms to produce mating calls, which can be broadly categorized into vocalizations and mechanical calls. Vocalizations are considered as sounds produced by the [[larynx]] and are often seen in species of birds, mammals, amphibians, and insects. Mechanical calls refer to any other type of sound that the animal produces using unique body parts and/or tools for communication with potential mates. Examples include crickets that vibrate their wings, birds that flap their feathers, and frogs that use an air sac instead of lungs.

Different aspects and features of bird song such as structure, amplitude and frequency have evolved as a result of sexual selection.&lt;ref name=nemeth2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nemeth|first=E|author2=Kempenaers, B |author3=Matessi, G |author4= Brumm, H |title=Rock sparrow song reflects male age and reproductive success.|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=8|pages=e43259|pmid=22927955|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0043259 |pmc=3426517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large song repertoires are preferred by females of many avian species.&lt;ref name=pfaff2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pfaff|first=JA|author2=Zanette, L |author3=MacDougall-Shackleton, SA |author4= MacDougall-Shackleton, EA |title=Song repertoire size varies with HVC volume and is indicative of male quality in song sparrows (Melospiza melodia).|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|date=Aug 22, 2007|volume=274|issue=1621|pages=2035–40|pmid=17567560|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0170 |pmc=2275172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One hypothesis for this is that song repertoire is positively correlated with the size of the brain's [[HVC (avian brain region)|song control nucleus]] (HVC). A large HVC would indicate developmental success. In [[song sparrow]]s, males with large repertoires had larger HVCs, better body condition and lower heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratios indicating better immune health. This supports the idea that song sparrows with large song repertoires have better lifetime fitness and that song repertoires are honest indicators of the male's "quality". Possible explanations for this adaptation include direct benefits to the female, such as superior parental care or territory defense, and indirect benefits, such as good genes for their offspring.&lt;ref name=pfaff2007 /&gt;

[[Japanese bush warbler]] songs from island populations have an acoustically simple structure when compared to mainland populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamao|first=Shoji|title=Acoustic structure of songs in island populations of the Japanese bush warbler, Cettia diphone, in relation to sexual selection|journal=Journal of Ethology|year=2012|volume=31|issue=1|pages=9–15|doi=10.1007/s10164-012-0341-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Song complexity is correlated with higher levels of sexual selection in mainland populations, showing that a more complex song structure is advantageous in an environment with high levels of sexual selection. Another example is in [[purple-crowned fairywren]]s; larger males of this species sing advertising songs at a lower frequency than smaller rival males. Since body size is a characteristic of good health, lower frequency calls are a form of honest signaling. Negative correlation between body size and call frequency is supported across multiple species within the taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=ML|author2=Kingma, SA |author3=Peters, A |title=Male songbird indicates body size with low-pitched advertising songs.|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2013|volume=8|issue=2|pages=e56717|pmid=23437221|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0056717|pmc=3577745}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[rock sparrow]], song frequency is positively associated with reproductive success. Slower song rate is associated with age and is preferred by females. Reproductive status of the individual is communicated through higher maximum frequency. There was also positive correlation between age and extra pair copulation frequency.&lt;ref name=nemeth2012/&gt;[[File:Red deer stag 2009 denmark.jpg|thumb|Red deer stag during rut]]

Bird calls are also known to continue after pair formation in several socially [[Monogamous pairing in animals|monogamous]] bird species. In one experimental population of [[zebra finch]]es, there was increased singing activity by the male after breeding.&lt;ref name="bolund2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolund|first=Elisabeth|author2=Schielzeth, Holger |author3=Forstmeier, Wolfgang |title=Singing activity stimulates partner reproductive investment rather than increasing paternity success in zebra finches|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=2012|volume=66|issue=6|pages=975–984|doi=10.1007/s00265-012-1346-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase is positively correlated with the partner's reproductive investment. The female finches were bred in cages with two subsequent males that differed with varying amounts of song output. Females produced larger [[Bird egg|eggs]] with more orange yolks when paired with a male with a high song output. This suggests that the relative amount of song production in paired zebra finch males might function to stimulate the partner rather than to attract extra-pair females.&lt;ref name="bolund2012" /&gt;

=== Mammals ===
During the [[breeding season]], mammals will call out to the opposite sex. Male [[koala]]s that are bigger will let out a different sound than smaller koalas. The bigger males which are routinely sought out for are called sires. Females choose sires because of indirect benefits that their offspring could inherit, like larger bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charlton | first1 = B.

Acoustic signaling is a type of call that can be used from a significant distance encoding an organism's location, condition and identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkins | first1 = M.

When females hear these songs, named a 'whistle', they call onto the males to breed with a screech of their own. This action is termed 'calling of the sexes'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2008 | title = SONGS , SCENTS , AND SENSES : SEXUAL SELECTION IN THE GREATER SAC-WINGED BAT , SACCOPTERYX BILINEATA | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 1401–1410 | doi=10.1644/08-mamm-s-060.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Red deer]] and [[spotted hyena]]s along with other mammals also perform acoustic signaling.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, C.

[[File:Tungara Frog (Engystomops pustulosus) Calling.jpg|thumb|Tungara frog]]

=== Amphibians ===
Most frogs use an air sac located under their mouth to produce mating calls. Air from the lungs channels to the air sac to inflate it, and the air sac resonates to produce a mating call. The larynx is larger and more developed in males, which causes their call to be louder and stronger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilczynski | first1 = W. | last2 = McClelland | first2 = B. E. | last3 = Rand | first3 = A.

In the [[Tungara frog|túngara frog]], males use a whining call followed by up to seven clucks. Males who have a whine-cluck call are more successful in attracting females than males whose call is a whine alone. The ability to produce clucks is due to a specialized fibrous mass attached to the frog's vocal folds, creating an unusual vocalization similar to the two-voiced songs found in some birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Animal communication: Complex call production in the túngara frog|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7089/full/441038a.html|journal = Nature|date = 2006-05-04|issn = 0028-0836|pages = 38-38|volume = 441|issue = 7089|doi = 10.1038/441038a|first = M.|last = Gridi-Papp|first2 = A. S.|last2 = Rand|first3 = M. J.|last3 = Ryan|pmid=16672962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[common toad]], sexual competition is driven in large part by fighting—successful males often physically displaced other males from the backs of a female in order to gain access to mating with that female. Larger males were more successful in such takeovers, and had higher reproductive success as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Competitive mate searching in male common toads, Bufo bufo|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003347279900708|journal = Animal Behaviour|pages = 1253–1267|volume = 27|doi = 10.1016/0003-3472(79)90070-8|first = N.B.|last = Davies|first2 = T.R.|last2 = Halliday}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vocalizations of these toads provide a reliable signal of body size and thus fighting ability, allowing contests for possession of females to be settled without risk of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Deep croaks and fighting assessment in toads Bufo bufo|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v274/n5672/abs/274683a0.html|journal = Nature|date = 1978-08-17|pages = 683–685|volume = 274|issue = 5672|doi = 10.1038/274683a0|first = N. B.|last = Davies|first2 = T. R.|last2 = Halliday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insects ===
While mating calls in insects are usually associated with mechanical mating calls, such as in crickets, several species of insects use vocalizations to attract mates. In the [[Ostrinia furnacalis|Asian corn borer]], males emit clicking sounds that mimic the echolocation of bats which prey on the moths. They then take advantage of the female's "freezing" response to mate with the female.

In the [[Arctiinae (erebid moths)|Japanese lichen moth]], however, the female is able to distinguish between the sounds made by males and those made by bats and other predators.As a result, the males use ultrasonic clicking as a more conventional mating signal, compared to the "deceptive" courtship song used in the Asian Corn Bearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evolution of deceptive and true courtship songs in moths|url = http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02003|journal = Scientific Reports|date = 2013-06-20|pmc = 3687589|pmid = 23788180|volume = 3|doi = 10.1038/srep02003|first = Ryo|last = Nakano|first2 = Takuma|last2 = Takanashi|first3 = Annemarie|last3 = Surlykke|first4 = Niels|last4 = Skals|first5 = Yukio|last5 = Ishikawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical calls==
Mating calls also take form through mechanical processes. Animals that are unable to vocalize their call may use their body to attract mates.

=== Crickets ===
[[File:Field cricket Gryllus pennsylvanicus.ogg|thumb|Mating call of field cricket, ''Gryllus pennsylvanicus'']]

In the field cricket, ''Gryllus integer'', males rub their wings together to create a rapid trill that produces sound.&lt;ref name="Hedrick, A. V. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedrick | first1 = A. V. | year = 2000 | title = Crickets with extravagant mating songs compensate for predation risk with extra caution | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 267 | issue = 1444| pages = 671–675 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1054 | pmid=10821611 | pmc=1690585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males individually vary in the durations of their trilling or, what is more sophisticatedly called, bout length. The bout length of each male is heritable and passed on to his future offspring. Also, females prefer to mate with males that have longer bout lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedrick | first1 = AV | year = 1986 | title = Female preferences for male calling bout duration in a field cricket | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 73–77 | doi=10.1007/bf00303845}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end result is that males with longer bout lengths produce more offspring than males with shorter bout lengths.

Other factors that influence the formation of these bout lengths include temperature and predation. In field crickets, males prefer warmer sites for mating as shown by an increase in the frequency of their mating calls when they were living in warmer climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedrick | first1 = A. | last2 = Perez | first2 = D. | last3 = Lichti | first3 = N. | last4 = Yew | first4 = J. | year = | title = Temperature preferences of male field crickets (Gryllus integer) alter their mating calls | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00359-002-0368-9 | journal = Journal of Comparative Physiology A| volume =  188| issue = | pages =  799–805| doi=10.1007/s00359-002-0368-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predation also affects the mating calls of field crickets. When in a potentially dangerous environment, males cease calling for longer periods of time when interrupted by a predator cue.&lt;ref name="Hedrick, A. V. 2000"/&gt; This suggests that there is an interplay between intensity of mating call and risk of predation.

=== Sonation ===
{{main|Sonation}}
As described in [[Sonation]], "the term sonate is described as the deliberate production of sounds, not from the throat, but rather from structures such as the bill, wings, tail, feet and body feathers, or by the use of tools". In several amphibian and fish species, other special structures are used to produce different sounds to attract mates. Birds are common users of sonation, although several amphibian and fish species have been shown to use sonation as a form of mating call as well. In general, sonation is one factor that plays into how a female may choose a mate. There are other features of mating such as territory defense or mate defense, which contribute to the cause of finding suitable mates.

As outlined below, each species uses a distinct method to produce a non-vocal mating call in order to be most successful in attracting mates. The examples below represent the most common examples found in the literature, although many more examples may exist in nature that are still currently unknown.
[[File:Feather of male Pavo cristatus (Indian peafowl).jpg|thumb|Feather of male ''Pavo cristatus'' (Indian peafowl). These feathers are used in sonation to create infrasound with intent of mating.]]

==== Birds ====
The feathers, the beak, the feet, and different tools are all used by different bird species to produce mating calls to attract mates. For example, the snipe uses its feathers to produce a [[drumming (snipe)|"drumming"]] sound to attract mates during a special mating dance. Snipes used specialized tail feathers to create a sound described as a "rattle" or "throbbing" noise.&lt;ref&gt;Bahr, P. H. "On the "bleating" or "drumming" of the snipe (Gallinago coelestis)." Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. Vol. 77. No. 1. Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; Palm cockatoos use sticks to drum on hollow trees, creating a loud noise to attract the attention of mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = Patricia M. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1915 | title = Enhanced: The Music of Nature and the Nature of Music | url = | journal = Science Online | volume = 291 | issue = | pages = 52–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bustards]] are large, highly terrestrial birds that stamp their feet during mating displays to attract mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alonso | first1 = Juan C. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2010 | title = Correlates of male mating success in great bustard leks: the effects of age, weight, and display effort | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 64 | issue = 10| pages = 1589–1600 | doi=10.1007/s00265-010-0972-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mirafra apiata]]'', commonly known as the Clapper lark, engages in a complex display flight that is characterized by the rattling of the wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maclean | first1 = Gordon L | year = 1970 | title = Breeding behaviour of larks in the Kalahari Sandveld | url = | journal = Annals of the Natal Museum | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 388–401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many species of birds use sonation for mating calls such as manakins and hummingbirds. However, peacocks exhibit a feature of sonation that reveals intrasexual and intersexual properties of this type of mating call.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Infrasound in mating displays: a peacock's tale|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347215000391|journal = Animal Behaviour|date = 2015-04-01|pages = 241–250|volume = 102|doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.01.029|first = Angela R.|last = Freeman|first2 = James F.|last2 = Hare}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males move their feathers to produce low-frequency sonations ([[infrasound]]) and sonate more frequently in response to sonations by other males. This is attributable to a male's desire to advertise its presence above other males looking for mates, suggesting that sonation carries an intrasexual function. In addition, females show increased alertness when hearing the infrasound signals produced by males' wing-shaking, which highlights how the two sexes use sonation to interact with each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Fish ====

While most bird species use their feathers, tools, or feet to produce sounds and attract mates, many fish species use specialized internal organs to sonate. In [[Gadidae|Gadoid fish]], special muscles attached to the swimbladder assist in the production of knocking or grunting sounds to attract mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Just Rasmussen | first2 = Knud | year = 1978 | title = The calls of gadoid fish | url = | journal = Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom | volume = 58 | issue = 04| pages = 891–911 | doi=10.1017/s0025315400056848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lepidoptera ====
In many lepidoptera species including the adzuki bean borer ([[Ostrinia scapulalis]]), ultrasonic mating calls are used to attract females and keep them motionless during copulation. These pulses have an average frequency of 40&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takanashi|first=Takuma|last2=Nakano|first2=Ryo|last3=Surlykke|first3=Annemarie|last4=Tatsuta|first4=Haruki|last5=Tabata|first5=Jun|last6=Ishikawa|first6=Yukio|last7=Skals|first7=Niels|date=2010-10-04|title=Variation in Courtship Ultrasounds of Three Ostrinia Moths with Different Sex Pheromones|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013144|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=5|issue=10|pages=e13144|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013144|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speciation due to mating call differences ==

Differences in mating calls can lead to the separation of different populations within a species. These differences can be due to several factors, including body size, temperature, and other ecological factors.These can arise in the form of tonal, temporal, or behavioral variations in mating calls that subsequently lead to the separation of populations. The separation of these populations due to differences in mating call and mating call preferences can lead to the evolution and creation of new, unique species.

This type of speciation is most often sympatric speciation: where two or more species are created from an existing parent species that all live in the same geographic location. Although there is an absence of research on mammals and birds, this phenomenon has been heavily researched in several frog species around the world. The examples below illuminate speciation due to mating call differences in several frog species around the world. These distinct species are included because they are the focus of the majority of current research. 
[[File:Gastrophryne olivacea01a.jpg|thumb|Two ''Microhyla olivacea'' in a mating position]]

=== ''Microhyla olivacea'' and ''Microhyla carolinensis'' ===
These two species of narrow-mouthed frog live in the southern United States and have overlapping ranges in Texas and Oklahoma. Researchers have discovered that these two different species alter the frequencies of their call in the overlap zone of their ranges. For example, the ''Microhyla olivacea'' mating call has a significantly lower midpoint frequency in the overlap zone than the mating call outside this zone. This leads researchers to suggest that the differences in mating call in the overlap zone of ''M. olivacea and M. carolinensis'' act as an isolating mechanism between the two species. They also hypothesize that the evolution of these differences in mating call led to the separation of these two different frog species from one common species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Mating Call in the Speciation of Anuran Amphibians|last = Blair|first = Frank|date = 1958|journal = The American Naturalist|doi = 10.1086/282007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Engystomops petersi 1.jpg|thumb|
''Engystomops petersi''
]]

=== ''Engystomops petersi'' ===
Female preferences for specific male mating calls can lead to sexual selection in mating calls. Females may prefer a specific type of call that certain males possess, in which only those males will be able to mate with females and pass on their genes and specific mating call. As a result, this female preference may lead to divergence of two species.

In Amazonian frogs, sexual selection for different calls has led to the [[Reproductive isolation|behavioral isolation]] and speciation of the túngara frog (''Engystomops petersi)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sexual selection drives speciation in an Amazonian frog|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/274/1608/399|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2007-02-07|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 1702375|pmid = 17164204|pages = 399–406|volume = 274|issue = 1608|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2006.3736|first = Kathryn E.|last = Boul|first2 = W. Chris|last2 = Funk|first3 = Catherine R.|last3 = Darst|first4 = David C.|last4 = Cannatella|first5 = Michael J.|last5 = Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; From genetic and mating call analysis and, researchers were able to identify that two populations of the túngara frog were almost completely reproductively isolated. From their research, scientists believe that differences in female preferences for mating call type have led to the evolution of this speciation process. Specifically, the Yasuní population females prefer the male mating call that includes a whine, while the other population does not prefer this whine. Subsequently, the Yasuní males include the whine in their call, while the other males do not. For this reason, the differences in call have led to the mechanical separation of this species.

=== ''Pseudacris triseriata'' ===
[[File:Western Chorus Frog (6922520670).jpg|thumb|A Chorus Frog making a mating call]]
Several studies have shown that the species ''Pseudacris triseriata'' (Chorus Frog) can be divided into two subspecies, ''P. t. maculata'' and ''P. t. triseriata,'' due to speciation events from mating call differences. The Chorus Frog has a very large home range, from New Mexico to Southern Canada. These two subspecies have an overlapping range from South Dakota to Oklahoma. In this overlapping range, both the call duration and the calls per second for each species is much different than outside of this range. This means that calls of these two subspecies are more similar outside of this range, and starkly different within the range. For this reason, scientists suggest that these subspecies evolved from differences in mating call type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Speciation within the Chorus Frog Pseudacris triseriata: Morphometric and Mating Call Analyses of the Boreal and Western Subspecies|journal = Copeia|date = 1989-08-08|pages = 704–712|volume = 1989|issue = 3|doi = 10.2307/1445498|first = James E.|last = Platz|jstor=1445498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these subspecies are rarely recorded to have hybrid offspring, which further suggests that there is complete speciation due to mating call differences. The differences in mating calls also help to reinforce the speciation process.

MIT Press, 2004, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Neil Postman states, "if in biology a 'medium' is something in which a bacterial culture grows (as in a Petri dish), in media ecology, the medium is 'a technology within which a [human] culture grows.'" &lt;ref&gt;Postman, N. (2006). Media Ecology Education. Explorations in Media Ecology, 5(1), 5-14. doi:10.1386/eme.5.1.5_1&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "Media ecology looks into the matter of how media of communication affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value; and how our interaction with media facilitates or impedes our chances of survival. The word ecology implies the study of environments: their structure, content, and impact on people. An environment is, after all, a complex message system which imposes on human beings certain ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/media_ecology/|title=What is Media Ecology?|last=Postman|first=Neil|date=|website=Media Ecology Association|publisher=|access-date=2 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Media ecology argues that media act as extensions of the human senses in each era, and [[communication technology]] is the primary cause of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hakanen|first=Ernest A.|title=Branding the teleself: Media effects discourse and the changing self|year=2007|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7391-1734-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan is famous for coining the phrase, "[[the medium is the message]]", which is an often-debated phrase believed to mean that the medium chosen to relay a message is just as important (if not more so) than the message itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; McLuhan proposed that media influence the progression of society, and that significant periods of time and growth can be categorized by the rise of a specific technology during that period.

Additionally, scholars have compared media broadly to a system of infrastructure that connect the nature and culture of a society with media ecology being the study of "traffic" between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=eea7d6ba-45f9-4434-912c-3d9a2405e153@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=Infrastructuralism: Media as Traffic between Nature and Culture.: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

===Marshall McLuhan===

In 1934, Marshall McLuhan enrolled as a student at [[Cambridge University]], a school which pioneered modern literary [[criticism]]. During his studies at Cambridge, he became acquainted with one of his professors, [[I.A. Richards]], a distinguished English professor, who would inspire McLuhan's later scholarly works. McLuhan admired Richards' approach to the critical view that English studies are themselves nothing but a study of the process of communication.&lt;ref name="Marchand"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchand|first=Philip|title=Marshall McLuhan: The Medium and The Messenger : A Biography|year=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-63186-5|pages=37–39|edition=Rev Sub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards believed that "words won't stay put and almost all verbal constructions are highly ambiguous".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; This element of Richards' perspective on communication influenced the way in which McLuhan expressed many of his ideas using metaphors and phrases such as "[[Global village (term)|The Global Village]]" and "[[The Medium Is the Message]]" two of his most well known phrases that encapsulate the theory of Media Ecology.  
[[File:Marshall McLuhan.jpg|thumb|[[Marshall McLuhan]], c. 1936.]]
McLuhan used the approaches of Richards, [[William Empson]], and [[Harold Innis|Harlold Innis]] as an "entrée to the study of media".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; However, it took many years of work before he was able to successfully fulfill their approaches. McLuhan determined that "if words were ambiguous and best studied not in terms of their 'content' but in terms of their effects in a given context and if the effects were often subliminal, the same might be true of other human artifacts, the wheel, the printing press, the telegraph and the TV".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; This led to the emergence of his ideas on Media Ecology.

In addition to his scholarly work, McLuhan was also a well known media personality of his day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marshallmcluhan.com/biography/|title=Who was Marshall McLuhan? – The Estate of Marshall McLuhan|website=marshallmcluhan.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on television shows, in magazine articles, and even had a small cameo in the movie ''[[Annie Hall]]''.

Few theories receive the kind of household recognition that Media Ecology received, due directly to McLuhan's role as a pop culture icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mullen|first=Megan|year=2006|title=Coming to Terms with the Future He Foresaw : Marshall McLuhan's 'Understanding Media'|jstor=40061070|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=47|issue=2|pages=373–380|doi=10.1353/tech.2006.0143}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an excellent debater and public speaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marshall McLuhan: The medium and the messenger|last=Marchand|first=Phillip|publisher=Ticknor &amp; Fields|year=1989|isbn=0899194850|location=New York|pages=153|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his writing was not always what would normally pass in academia.

=== Neil Postman ===
Inspired by McLuhan, [[Neil Postman]] founded the Program in Media Ecology at [[New York University]] in 1971, as he further developed the theory McLuhan had established. According to Postman, media ecology emphasizes the environments in which communication and technologies operate and spread information and the effects these have on the receivers.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. "What is Media Ecology." ''Media Ecology Association.'' 2009. Web. 29 Sept 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; "Such information forms as the alphabet, the printed word, and television images are not mere instruments which make things easier for us. They are environments - like language itself, symbolic environments with in which we discover, fashion, and express humanity in particular ways."&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. "Teaching as a conserving activity." Instructor 89.4 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

Postman focused on media technology, process, and structure rather than content and considered making moral judgments the primary task of media ecology. "I don't see any point in studying media unless one does so within a moral or ethical context."&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;Griffin, Em. A First Look at Communication Theory. 7th ed. New York, NY: The McGraw-Hill , 2009. Print&lt;/ref&gt;  Postman's media ecology approach asks three questions: What are the moral implications of this bargain? Are the consequences more humanistic or antihumanistic? Do we, as a society, gain more than we lose, or do we lose more than we gain?&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

=== North American, European and Eurasian versions ===
Media ecology is a contested term within [[media studies]] for it has different meanings in European and North American contexts. The North American definition refers to an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of media theory and media design involving the study of media environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/media_ecology/index.html|title=What is Media Ecology?|last=Nystrom|first=Christine|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European version of media ecology is a materialist investigation of media systems as complex dynamic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strate|first=Lance|year=2004|title=A Media Ecology Review|url=http://cscc.scu.edu/trends/v23/v23_2.pdf|journal=Communication Research Trends|volume=23|pages=28–31|issn=0144-4646|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, a similar theory was independently developed by [[Yuri Rozhdestvensky]]. In more than five monographs, Rozhdestvensky outlined the systematic changes which take place in society each time new communication media are introduced, and connected these changes to the challenges in politics, philosophy and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Polski, M. |author2=Gorman, L.|year=2012|title=Yuri Rozhdestvensky vs. MArshall McLuhan: A triumph vs. a Vortex|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=10 |issue=3–4|url=http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-Article,id=13566/|doi=10.1386/eme.10.3-4.263_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a founder of the vibrant school of ecology of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Polski, M.|year=2013|title=Media Ecology Pedagogy—Art or Techne?|conference=MEA conference|location=Grand Rapids, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European version of media ecology rejects the North American notion that ecology means environment. Ecology in this context is used "because it is one of the most expressive [terms] language currently has to indicate the massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patterns and matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fuller, Matthew|title=Media Ecologies: Materialist Energies in Art and Technoculture|publisher=MIT Press|year=2005|pp=2–3|isbn=9780262062473|series=Leonardo Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following theorists such as [[Felix Guattari]], [[Gregory Bateson]], and [[Manuel De Landa]], the European version of media ecology (as practiced by authors such as [[Matthew Fuller (author)|Matthew Fuller]] and [[Jussi Parikka]]) presents a post-structuralist political perspective on media as complex dynamical systems.

=== Other contributions ===
Along with McLuhan {{Harv|McLuhan|1962}}, Postman {{Harv|Postman|1985}} and [[Harold Innis]], media ecology draws from many authors, including the work of [[Walter Ong]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Félix Guattari]], [[Eric Havelock]], [[Susanne Langer]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Edward T. Hall]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], and [[Gregory Bateson]].

==Core concepts==

=== Assumptions of the theory ===
* Media are infused in every act and action in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = West|first = Richard|title = Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|year = 2010|publisher = Mc Graw Hill|location = New York|isbn = 978-0-07-338507-5|pages = 428–430|edition = 4|author2 = Lynn H. Turner|chapter = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Media fix our perceptions and organize our experiences.
* Media tie the world together.

These three assumptions can be understood as: media are everywhere all the time; media determine what we know and how we feel about what we know; and media connect us to others. Communication media have penetrated the lives of almost all people on the planet, arranging people into an interconnected human community.

===McLuhan's media history===

McLuhan believed there are three inventions that transformed the world: the [[phonemic orthography|phonetic alphabet]], the [[printing press]], and the [[telegraph]]. Due to these technologies, the world was taken from one era into the next. In order to understand the effects of symbolic environment, McLuhan split history into four periods:&lt;ref name="epoch" /&gt; the tribal age, the literary age, the print age, and the [[electronic age]] (information age). Throughout the structure of their distinctive methods of communication (e.g., oral, written, printed, electronic), different media arouse patterns in the brain that are distinctive to each and every particular form of communication.&lt;ref name="epoch"&gt;{{cite book|last = McLuhan|first = M.|title = The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects|year = 1967|publisher = HardWired|location = San Francisco|isbn = 978-1-888869-02-6|pages = |author2 = Fiore Q.|author3 = Agel J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tribal age====

The first period in history that McLuhan describes is the Tribal Age, a time of community because the ear is the dominant sense organ. This is also known as an acoustic era because the senses of hearing, touch, taste, and smell were far more strongly developed than the ability to visualize. During this time, hearing was more valuable because it allowed people to be more immediately aware of their surroundings, which was extremely important for hunting. Everyone hears at the same time making listening to someone in a group a unifying act, deepening the feeling of community. In this world of surround sound, everything is more immediate, more present, and fosters more passion and spontaneity. During the Tribal Age, hearing was believing.

====Literacy age====

The second age is the Literacy Stage, a time of private detachment because the eye is the dominant sense organ; also known as the visual era. Turning sounds into visible objects radically altered the symbolic environment. Words were no longer alive and immediate, they were able to read over and over again. Hearing no longer becomes trustworthy; seeing was believing. Even though people read the same words, the act of reading is an individual act of singular focus. Tribes didn't need to come together to get information anymore. This is when the invention of the alphabet came about. During this time, when people learned to read, they became independent thinkers.

====Print age====

The third stage is the Print Age, when individual products were mass produced due to the invention of the printing press. It gave the ability to reproduce the same text over and over again. With printing came a new visual stress: the portable book. It allowed people to carry books, so they could read in privacy isolated from others. Libraries were created to hold these books and also gave freedom to be alienated from others and from immediacy of their surroundings.

====Electronic age====

Lastly, the Electronic Age, otherwise included under the [[Information Age|information age]], is an era of instant communication and a return to an environment with simultaneous sounds and touch. It started with a device created by Samuel Morse's invention of the telegraph and led to the telephone, the cell phone, television, internet, DVD, video games, etc. This ability to communicate instantly returned us to the tradition of sound and touch rather than sight. Being able to be in constant contact with the world becomes a nosy generation where everyone knows everyone's business and everyone's business is everyone else's. This phenomenon is called the [[Global village (term)|global village]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Updating the ages ====
[[Robert K. Logan]] is professor emeritus of [[physics]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and Chief Scientist of the Strategic Innovation Lab at the [[Ontario College of Art and Design]]. He worked collaboratively with Marshall McLuhan at the University of Toronto, co-publishing various works and producing his own works, heavily inspired by McLuhan. Logan updates the era of communications, adding two new eras:
# Age of nonverbal mimetic communication (characteristic of archaic [[Homo sapiens]])
# Age of orality
# Age of literacy
# Age of electric mass media
# Age of digital interactive media, or 'new media'&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding New Media: Extending Marshall McLuhan|last=Logan|first=Robert K.|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2010|isbn=9781433111266|location=New York|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, through the study of media ecology, it is argued that through technological advancements in media, many societies have become a "[[participatory culture]]." Tom Valcanis argues that this very easily witnessed by looking at the rise of Apple's iPhone. "If the technology is the medium in which a culture grows, the interactive and user oriented nature of these technologies have given rise to a participatory and 'mash-up' culture in which the ways of producing and accessing content are deconstructed, uploaded, mixed, converged, and reconstructed through computers and smartphones mediated by online platforms; it becomes a 'participatory culture'..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=2a4280c5-20e6-4610-831e-e8e7e7c9ae04@sessionmgr4007|title=AN IPHONE IN EVERY HAND: MEDIA ECOLOGY, COMMUNICATION STRUCTURES, AND THE G...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==='The medium is the message'===

"The medium is the message"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding media|last = McLuhan|first = Marshall|publisher = Mentor|year = 1964|isbn = 978-0262631594|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the most famous insight from McLuhan, and is one of the concepts that separates the North American theory from the European theory. Instead of emphasizing the information content, McLuhan highlighted the importance of medium characteristics which can influence and even decide the content. He proposed that it is the media format that affects and changes on people and society.

For example, [[traditional media]] is an extension of the human body, while the [[new media]] is the extension of the human nervous system. The emergence of new media will change the equilibrium between human sensual organs and affect human psychology and society.  The extension of human senses will change our thoughts and behaviors and the ways we perceive the world. That's why McLuhan believed when a new medium appears, no matter what the concrete content it transmits, the new form of communication brings in itself a force that causes social transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xianhong|author2=Guilan Ding|title=SPECIAL COMMENTARY New media as relations|journal=Chinese Journal of Communication|date=November 2009|volume= 2| issue =  3|pages=367–369|url=http://www.informaworld.com|doi=10.1080/17544750903209242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We are accustomed to thinking the [[message]] is separate from a [[Medium (website)|medium.]] McLuhan saw the message and the medium to mean the same thing. The audience is normally focused on the content and overlook the medium. What we forget is that the content cannot exist outside of the way that it is mediated. McLuhan recognized that the way media work as environments is because we are so immersed in them. "It is the medium that has the greatest impact in human affairs, not specific messages we send or receive.&lt;ref name="Strate"&gt;Strate, Lance. "Studying Media as Media: McLuhan and the Media Ecology Approach." MediaTropes eJournal. 1. (2008): 1-16. Web. 28 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The media shape us because we partake in them over and over until they become a part of us.

Different mediums emphasize different senses and encourage different habits, so engaging in this medium day after day conditions our senses.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Different forms of media also affect what their meaning and impact will be. The form of medium and mode of information determines who will have access, how much information will be distributed, how fast it will be transmitted, how far it will go, and, most importantly, what form it will be displayed.&lt;ref name="Strate" /&gt; With society being formed around the dominant medium of the day, the specific medium of communication makes a remarkable difference.

==== The Metaphor ====
The key elements to Media Ecology has been largely attributed to Marshal McLuhan, who coined the statement “the medium is the message.” Levinson furthers McLuhan’s statement by stating that “the way we communicate, often taken for granted, often determines what we communicate, and therein just about everything else in life and society” &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levinson|first=paul|date=2000|title=McLuhan and Media Ecology|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v1/levinson01.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Media Ecology Association|volume=1|pages=17-22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan gave a center of gravity, a moral compass to Media Ecology which was later adapted and formally introduced by Neil Postman&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

The very foundation for this theory is based on a metaphor that provides a model for understanding the new territory, offers a vocabulary, and indicates in which directions to continue exploring.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scolari|first=Carlos A.|date=2012-04-09|title=Media Ecology: Exploring the Metaphor to Expand the Theory|url=https://academic.oup.com/ct/article-abstract/22/2/204/4085708?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=204–225|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01404.x|issn=1050-3293}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Carlos Scolari states, “the configuration of media ecology in the 1960s and 1970s was part of a broader process of the general application of the ecological metaphor to the social sciences and humanities in the postwar period.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There is still a scholarly debate over who coined the phrase “the medium is the message”. Author Niall Stephan argues that while most attribute the  metaphor to Marshall McLuhan, it is better directed to Neil Postman, who helped popularize McLuhan under the banner of “media ecology”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Niall|date=2014|title=Toward a More Substantive Media Ecology: Postman's Metaphor Versus Posthuman Futures|url=|journal=International Journal of Communications|volume=8|pages=2027-2045|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[Janet Sternburg|Janet Sternberg]] has a different take on the metaphor- using her own metaphor to make sense of it all. Sternberg applies the Chinese “yin/ yang” metaphor to media ecology as a means of better understanding the divergence among scholars. She states that there are two basic intellectual traditions can be distinguished in the field: the “yang” tradition of studying media as environments, focusing on mass communication and on [[intrapersonal communication]] and the “yin” tradition is studying environments as media, emphasizing interpersonal communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v3/Sternberg03.pdf|title=The Yin and Yang of Media Ecology|last=Sternberg|first=Janet|date=2002|year=|website=MEA Convention Proceedings|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Connection to general systems theory ====
While [[general systems theory]] originated in 1928 in the Ph.D. thesis of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]. Robert Logan summarizes a general system as "one that is composed of interacting and interrelated components such as an understanding of it must entail considering the general system as a whole and not as a collection of individual components".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://summit.is4is.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/logan3text.pdf|title=General Systems Theory and Media Ecology: Parallel Disciplines that Inform Each Other|date=June 2015|doi=10.1386/eme.14.1-2.39_1|author=Robert Logan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logan argues that general systems theory, as well as cybernetics, complexity theory, and emergent dynamics, and media ecology "cross pollinate each other" in that,  "a general system is a medium" due to the non-linear aspects of messages and that general systems are "quasi-deterministic".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This thinking is in line with McLuhan who once wrote, "A new medium is never an addition to an old one, nor does it leave the old one in peace. It never ceases to oppress the older media until it finds new shapes and positions for them."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Global village ===
Marshall McLuhan used the phrase [[Global village (term)|global village]] to describe that "humans can no longer live in isolation, but rather will always be connected by continuous and instantaneous [[electronic media]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introducing communication theory: analysis and application|last=West|first=Richard|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9780073385075|pages=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan addresses the idea of a global village in his book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' saying, "Such is the character of a village or, since electric media, such is also the character of global village. And it is the advertising and PR community that is most aware of this basic new dimension of global interdependence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tremblay|first1=Gaetan|title=From Marshall McLuhan to Harold Innis, or From the Global Village to the World Empire|journal=Canadian Journal of Communications|date=2012|volume=37|issue=4|page=572|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/2662/2341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology, especially electronic media in today's age, makes the world increasingly interconnected. Socially, economically, politically, culturally, what happens in one part of the world has a ripple effect into other countries.

This seems like a common sense idea today, where the internet makes it possible to check news stories around the globe, and social media connects individuals regardless of location. However, in McLuhan's day, the global village was just becoming possible due to technology like television and long distance phone calls. This concept has become one of the most prolific and understandable ideas to come out of media ecology, and has spurred significant research in many areas. It is especially relevant in today's society, where the internet, social media, and other new media have made the world a smaller place, and today many researchers give McLuhan credit for his foresight.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Walkosz, Barbara J.|author2=Tessa Jolls|author3= Mary Ann Sund|title=Global/Local: Media Literacy for the Global Village|work=Medialit.org|conference= Proc. of International Media Literacy Research Forum, London|publisher=OfCom|year=2008|url=http://www.medialit.org/sites/default/files/33_globallocal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of note is McLuhan's insistence that the world becoming a global village should lead to more global responsibility. Technology has created an interconnected world, and with that should come concern for global events and occurrences outside one's own community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Postman builds on this concept with the idea of teaching the narrative of 'Spaceship Earth' where students are taught the importance of everyone taking care of planet earth as a fragile system of diversity both biological and cultural;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hepg.org/her-home/issues/harvard-educational-review-volume-66-issue-4/herarticle/redefining-the-value-of-school_287|title=The Harvard Educational Review - HEPG|website=hepg.org|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the original person to coin the term 'Spaceship Earth' was futurists R. Buckminster Fuller who once said, "I've often heard people say: 'I wonder what it would feel like to board a spaceship,' and the answer is very simple. What does it feel like? That's all we have experienced. We're all astronauts on a little spaceship called earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/spaceshipearth|title=Spaceship Earth {{!}} The Buckminster Fuller Institute|website=www.bfi.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics do worry though, that in creating a truly global village, some cultures will become extinct due to larger or more dominant cultures imposing their beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K|first=Dixon, Violet|date=2009-01-01|title=Understanding the Implications of a Global Village|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/61/understanding-the-implications-of-a-global-village|journal=Inquiries Journal|volume=1|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the global village helps to conceptualize [[globalization]] within society. Michael Plugh writes, "[The] village is an environment produced both by technological change and human imagination of this globalized environment."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global village: Globalization through a media ecology lens|date=2014|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=13|issue=3-4|pages=219–235|doi=10.1386/eme.13.3-4.219_1|author=Plugh, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the rise in media communication technology has uniformed the way individuals across the globe process information. Plugh says, "Where literate societies exchange an 'eye for an ear,' according to McLuhan, emphasizing the linear and sequential order of the world, electronic technology retrievers the total awareness of environment, characteristic of oral cultures, yet to an extended or 'global' level."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Hot vs. cool media===
McLuhan developed an idea called hot and cold media.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall, and Quentin Fiore. "The medium is the message." New York 123 (1967): 126-128.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hot media]] refer to a high-definition communication that demand little involvement from the audience and concentrate on one sensory organ at a time. These types of media require no interpretation because they give all the information necessary to comprehend. Some examples of hot media include radio, books, and lectures. [[Cool media]] describe media that demand active involvement from the audience. Cool media require the audience to be active and fill in information by mentally participating. This is multi-sensory participation. Some examples of cool media are TV, seminars, and cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|title=Understanding media: The Extension of Man|year=1994|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-63159-4|author2=Lewis H. Lapham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"McLuhan frequently referred to a chart that hung in his seminar room at the University of Toronto. This was a type of shorthand for understanding the differences between hot and cool media, characterized by their emphasis on the eye or the ear."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Innis: The Philosophical Historian. An Exchange of Ideas Between Prof. Marshall McLuhan and Prof. Eric A. Havelock," recorded at Innis College, Toronto, October 14, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Eye'': left hemisphere (hot) controls right side of the body; visual; speech; verbal; analytical; mathematical; linear; detailed; sequential; controlled; intellectual; dominant worldly;quantitative; active; sequential ordering
* ''Ear:'' right hemisphere (cool) controls the left side of the body; spatial; musical; acoustic; holistic; artistic; symbolic; simultaneous; emotional; creative; minor; spiritual; qualitative; receptive; synthetic; gestalt; facial recognition; simultaneous comprehension; perception of abstract patterns

===Laws of media===
Another aspect of media ecology is the ''laws of media,'' which McLuhan outlined with his son [[Eric McLuhan]] to further explain the influence of technology on society.&lt;ref name="Laws of media"&gt;{{cite book|title=Laws of media: The new science|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-8020-7715-8|location=Toronto|pages=98–99|author2=Eric McLuhan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws of media theory are depicted by a tetrad, which poses questions about various media, with the goal of developing peoples' critical thinking skills and to prepare people for "the social and physical chaos" that accompany every technological advancement or development. There is no specific order to the laws of media, as the effects occur simultaneously and form a feedback loop: technology impacts society, which then impacts the development of technology.
[[File:MediaTetrad.svg|thumb|Depiction of Media Tetrad]]
The four effects, as depicted in the [[tetrad of media effects]] are:&lt;ref name="Laws of media" /&gt;
* ''Enhancement'': What does the medium enhance? Media can enhance various social interactions, such as the telephone, which reduced the need for face-to-face interactions.
* ''Obsolescence'': What does the medium obsolesce? Technological advancements can render older media obsolete, as television did for the radio. This does not necessarily mean that the older medium is completely eradicated however, as radio, for example, is still in use today. 
* ''Retrieval'': What does the medium retrieve? New media can also spur a restoration of older forms of media, which the new forms may not be able to incorporate into their new technologies. For example, the Internet has promoted new forms of social conversations, which may have been lost through television. 
* ''Reversal'': What will the medium reverse? When a medium is overwhelmed due to its own nature, "pushed to the limit of its potential,"&lt;ref name="Laws of media" /&gt; it ceases to have functional utility and can cause a reversion to older media.

==Criticism==

===Technological determinism===
A significant criticism of this theory is a result of its deterministic approach. [[Determinism]] insists that all of society is a result of or effected by one central condition. In some cases the condition can be language ([[linguistic determinism]]), religion ([[theological determinism]]), financial ([[economic determinism]]). In the case of McLuhan, Postman and Media Ecology, technology is the sole determinant for society and by breaking up time in measures of man's technological achievements they can be classified as [[technological determinism]]. According to Postman, "The printing press, the computer, and television are not therefore simply machines which convey information. They are metaphors through which we conceptualize reality in one way or another. They will classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, argue a case for what it is like. Through these media metaphors, we do not see the world as it is. We see it as our coding systems are. Such is the power of the form of information."&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Teaching as a Conserving Activity (1979), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Postman has also stated that "a medium is a technology within which a culture grows; that is to say, it gives form to a culture's politics, social organization, and habitual ways of thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Postman|first=Neil|title=The Humanism of Media Ecology|url=http://media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v1/humanism_of_media_ecology.html|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as [[Michael Zimmer (academic)|Michael Zimmer]] view McLuhan and his "Medium is the Message" theory as a prime example of technological determinism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...an overarching thread in media ecological scholarship, exemplified by McLuhan's (1964/1994) assertion 
that "the medium is the message", the technological bias of a medium carries greater importance than the particular message it is delivering. McLuhan saw changes in the dominant medium of communication as the main determinant of major changes in society, culture, and the individual. This McLuhanesque logic, which rests at the center of the media ecology tradition, is often criticized for its media determinism. Seeing the biases of media technologies as the primary force for social and cultural change resembles the hard technological determinism of the embodied theory of technological bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Zimmer, Michael|authorlink=Michael Zimmer (academic)|title=Media Ecology and Value Sensitive Design: A Combined Approach to Understanding the Biases of Media Technology|conference=Proceedings of the Media Ecology Association|volume=6|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The critics of such a deterministic approach could be theorists who practice other forms of determinism, such as economic determinism. Theorists such as John Fekete believes that McLuhan is oversimplifying the world "by denying that human action is itself responsible for the changes that our socio-cultural world is undergoing and will undergo, McLuhan necessarily denies that a critical attitude is morally significant or practically important."&lt;ref name="Fekete, John 1973"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fekete, John|title=McLuhanacy: Counterrevolution in cultural theory|journal=Telos|year=1973|volume=1973|issue=15|pp=75–123|doi=10.3817/0373015075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lance Strate]], on the other hand, argues that McLuhan's theories are in no way deterministic. "McLuhan never actually used the term, "determinism," nor did he argue against human agency. In his bestselling book, ''The Medium is the Message'', he wrote, "there is absolutely no inevitability as long as there is a willingness to contemplate what is happening" (McLuhan &amp; Fiore, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;25). John Culkin (1967) summed up McLuhan's position with the quote, "we shape our tools and thereafter they shape us",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Culkin, J.|year=1967|chapter=Each culture develops its own sense ratio to meet the demands of its environment|editor=G. Stearn|title=McLuhan: Hot and cool|pp=49–57|location=New York: New American Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting a transactional approach to media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strate, Lance|title=Studying media as media: McLuhan and the media ecology approach|journal=MediaTropes|volume=1|issue=1|year=2008|p=133|url=http://www.mediatropes.com/index.php/Mediatropes/article/view/3344/1488}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement from Strate would define McLuhan and Media Ecology as "[[soft determinism]]" opposed to "[[hard determinism]]" with the difference being that "hard determinism" indicates that changes to society happen with no input or control from the members of that society, whereas "soft determinism" would argue that the changes are pushed by technology but free will and agency of the members of society ultimately have a chance to influence the outcome.

While ideas of technological determinism generally have negative connotations, technology philosopher Paul-Peter Verbeek argued that technologies are "inherently moral agents" and their development is a "moral enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cussing the buzz-saw, or, the medium is the morality of Peter-Paul Verbeek|date=2016|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=15|issue=2|pages=129–139|doi=10.1386/eme.15.2.129_1|author=Grosswiler, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Can Technological Artefacts Be Moral Agents?|date=2011|publisher=|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics|volume=17|issue=3|pages=411–424|doi=10.1007/s11948-010-9241-3|pmid=20927601|pmc=3183318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peter-Paul Verbeek|title=Obstetric Ultrasound and the Technological Mediation of Morality: A Postphenomenological Analysis|date=1 March 2008|publisher=|journal=Human Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=11–26|doi=10.1007/s10746-007-9079-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disruptions to existing systems ===
While advancing technologies allow for the study of media ecology, they also frequently disrupt the existing system of communication as they emerge. In general, four types of disruption can occur within the study of media ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.waccglobal.org/articles/a-shifting-media-ecology-what-the-age-of-luther-can-teach-us|title=A shifting media ecology: What the age of Luther can teach us|journal=Media Development|date=2017|volume=64|issue=2|pp=5–10|author=Soukup, Paul A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# New Technologies
# New Audiences
# New Authority
#New Rhetoric

One example where this can be seen is in do-it-yourself education. Advancing technologies have also expanded access to do-it-yourself (DIY) education. DIY education can be defined to include "any attempt to decentralize or disrupt traditional place-based educational models through the sometimes collective, other times individual use of digital media".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A media ecological analysis of do-it-yourself education: Exploring relationships between the symbolic and the material realms of human action|author=John Dowd|doi=10.1386/eme.13.2.155_1|date=June 2014|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=13|number=2|pp=155–175(21)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an analysis of media ecology the impact of these new technologies on society can better be understood.

==== Mobility and Modality ====
Various scholars have looked to media ecology theory through different lenses to better understand this theory in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. While Sternberg applied the yin/yang metaphor to make sense of the theory, Julia Hildebrand and John Dimmick et. al create a new languages of modality. As such, contributing to a new rhetoric to contextualize Media Ecology in the age of the internet, social media, and advances in technologies. Hildebrand uses the conceptualization of ‘mediated mobilities’ to illustrate a connection between media ecology and mobilities research, ultimately making a case for a ''modal medium theory''. She looks into the articles of Emily Keightley and Anna Reading, and Lance Strate as a basis for her case. In 1999, Lance Strate states Media Ecology Theory is “grammar and rhetoric, semiotics and systems theory, the history and the philosophy of technology”.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hildebrand|first=Julia M|date=2017-05-11|title=Modal media: connecting media ecology and mobilities research|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0163443717707343|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=348–364|doi=10.1177/0163443717707343|issn=0163-4437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hildebrand explains that Strate’s concept of media ecology is not limited to the study of information and communication technology but technology, in general. Technology is therefore implying materialities and mobilities that is put into relation with media ecology. As Hildebrand states, “[e]nvironments are created and shaped by different media and modes and the physical, virtual, and mental processes and travels they generate”.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Much like Media Ecology, mobilities research talk about a “flow” that shapes the environment, creating a contact zones. Dimmick furthers this statement by creating a term that describes the intersection of communication environments (“contact zones”) and issues of mobility- ''interstices.''&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimmick|first=John|last2=Feaster|first2=John Christian|last3=Hoplamazian|first3=Gregory J.|date=2010-05-18|title=News in the interstices: The niches of mobile media in space and time|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1461444810363452|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=23–39|doi=10.1177/1461444810363452|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes two scholars, Hemment and Caronia, to contextualize his new word. Hemment argues that mobile technologies create a place out of space and time, a kind of “nonspace” or “nonplace” considering they are independent from the variables of space and time. Caronia notes that such technologies extend media to creating empty space and places.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===The medium is not the message===
McLuhan's critics state the medium is not the message. They believe that we are dealing with a mathematical equation where medium equals x and message equals y. Accordingly, x = y, but really "the medium is the message" is a metaphor not an equation.  His critics also believe McLuhan is denying the content altogether, when really McLuhan was just trying to show the content in its secondary role in relation to the medium. McLuhan says technology is an "extension of man" and when the way we physically sense the world changes, how we perceive it will also collectively change, but the content may or may not affect this change in perception. McLuhan said that the user is the content, and this means that the user must interpret and process what they receive, finding sense in their own environments.&lt;ref name=Grosswiler&gt;{{cite book|last=Grosswiler|first=Paul|title=Transforming McLuhan: Cultural, Critical, and Postmodern Perspectives|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|location=p.52|isbn=9781433110672|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of McLuhan's high profile critics was [[Umberto Eco]]. Eco comes from background in [[semiotics]], which goes beyond linguistics in that it studies all forms of communication. He reflected that a cartoon of a cannibal wearing an alarm clock as a necklace was counter to McLuhan's assertion that the invention of clocks created a concept of time as consistently separated space. While it could mean this it could also take on different meanings as in the depiction of the cannibal. The medium is not the message. An individual's interpretation can vary.  Believing this to be true Eco says, "It is equally untrue that acting on the form and content of the message can convert the person receiving it." In doing this Eco merges form and content, the separation of which is the basis of McLuhan's assertion. McLuhan does not offer a theory of communication. He instead investigates the effects of all media mediums between the human body and its physical environment, including language.&lt;ref name=Gordon&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=W. Terrance|title=McLuhan: A Guide for the Perplexed|year=2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing|location=London, GBR|isbn=9781441143808|pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===

The North American variant of media ecology is viewed by numerous theorists such as John Fekete&lt;ref name="Fekete, John 1973"/&gt; and Neil Compton as meaningless or "McLuhanacy". According to Compton, it had been next to impossible to escape knowing about McLuhan and his theory as the media embraced them. Compton wrote, "it would be better for McLuhan if his oversimplifications did not happen to coincide with the pretensions of young status-hungry advertising executives and producers, who eagerly provide him with a ready-made claque, exposure on the media, and a substantial income from addresses and conventions."&lt;ref name=Rosenthal&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenthal|first=Raymond|title=McLuhan: Pro and Con|year=1968|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls|location=New York|pages=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists such as [[Jonathan Miller]] claim that McLuhan used a subjective approach to make objective claims, comparing McLuhan's willingness to back away from a "probe" if he did not find the desired results to that of an objective scientist who would not abandon it so easily.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Jonathan|title=Marshall McLuhan|year=1971|publisher=Viking Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0670019120|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theorists against McLuhan's idea, such as [[Raymond Rosenthal]], also believe that he lacked the scientific evidence to support his claims:&lt;ref name='Strate'/&gt; "McLuhan's books are not scientific in any respect; they are wrapped however in the dark, mysterious folds of the scientific ideology."&lt;ref name=Rosenthal /&gt; Additionally, As [[Lance Strate]] said: "Other critics complain that media ecology scholars like McLuhan, Havelock, and Ong put forth a "Great Divide" theory, exaggerating, for example, the difference between orality and literacy, or the alphabet and hieroglyphics.

==Research ==

===New media===
Many ecologists are using media ecology as an analytical framework, to explore whether the current [[new media]] has a "new" stranglehold on culture or are they simply extensions of what we have already experienced. The new media is characterised by the idea of [[web 2.0]]. It was coined in 2003 and popularized by a media consultant, [[Tim O'Reilly]]. He argues that a particular assemblage of software, hardware and sociality have brought about 'the widespread sense that there's something qualitatively different about today's Web. This shift is characterised by co-creativity, participation and openness, represented by software that support for example, wiki-based ways of creating and accessing knowledge, social networking sites, blogging, tagging and 'mash ups'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Reilly|first=Tim|title=What Is Web 2.0? Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2005/09/what-is-web-20.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interactive and user-oriented nature of these technologies have transformed the global culture into a [[participatory culture]] which proves Neil Postman's saying "[[Wikiversity:Neil Postman: Five Things We Need to Know About Technological Change|technological change]] is not additive; it is ecological".

As new media power takes on new dimension in the digital realm, some scholars begin to focus on defending the democratic potentialities of the Internet on the perspective of corporate impermeability. Today, corporate encroachment in cyberspace is changing the balance of power in the new media ecology, which "portends a new set of social relationships based on commercial exploitation".&lt;ref name=Milberry&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milberry|first=K|author2=Anderson, S.|title=Open Sourcing Our Way to an Online Commons: Contesting Corporate Impermeability in the New Media Ecology|journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry|year=2009|pages=393–412|volume=33|issue=4|doi=10.1177/0196859909340349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many social network websites inject customized advertisements into the steady stream of personal communication. It is called commercial incursion which converts user-generated content into fodder for marketers and advertisers.&lt;ref name=Milberry/&gt; So the control rests with the owners rather than the participants. It is necessary for online participants to be prepared to act consciously to resist the enclosure of digital commons.

There is some recent research that puts the emphasis on the youth, the future of the society who is at the forefront of new media environment. Each generation, with its respective worldview, is equipped with certain media grammar and [[media literacy]] in its youth.&lt;ref name="Gumpert 1985 23–35"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gumpert|first=Gary|author2=Robert Cathcart|title=Media grammars, generations, and media gaps|journal=Critical Studies in Mass Communication|year=1985|volume=2|pages=23–35|doi=10.1080/15295038509360059}}&lt;/ref&gt; As each generation inherits an idiosyncratic media structure, those born into the age of radio perceive the world differently from those born into the age of television.&lt;ref name="Gumpert 1985 23–35"/&gt; The nature of new generation is also influenced by the nature of the new media.

According to the media ecology theory, analyzing today's generational identity through the lens of media technologies themselves can be more productive than focusing on media content. Media ecologists employ a media ecology interpretative framework to deconstruct how today's new media environment increasingly mirrors the values and character attributed to young people. Here are some typical characteristics of the new generation: first, it is "the world's first generation to grow up thinking of itself as global. The internet and satellite television networks are just two of the myriad technologies that have made this possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huntley|first=Rebecca|title=The World According to Y: Inside the New Adult Generation|year=2006|publisher=Crows Nest NSW|location=Australia|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, "there may actually be no unified ethos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Serazio|first=Michael|title=(New) Media Ecology and Generation Mash-Up Identity: The Technological Bias of Millennial Youth Culture|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/3/8/6/6/p238668_index.html|conference= NCA 94th Annual Convention}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With "hundreds of cable channels and thousands of computer conferences, young generation might be able to isolate themselves within their own extremely opinionated forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Screenagers: Lessons In Chaos From Digital Kids|year=2006|publisher=Hampton Press|location=Cresskill, NJ|isbn=978-1572736245|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In 2009 a study was published by Cleora D'Arcy, Darin Eastburn and Bertram Bruce entitled "How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D'Arcy, C. J.|author2=Eastburn, D. M.|author3=Bruce, B. C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs|journal=College Teaching|volume=57|issue=1|pp=56–63|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/274764053|doi=10.3200/CTCH.57.1.56-63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this study was to use Media Ecology in order to determine which media is perceived as the most useful as an instructional tool in post-secondary education. This study specifically analyzed and tested "new media" such as podcasts, blogs, websites, and discussion forums with other media, such as traditional text books, lectures, and handouts. Ultimately comparing "hot" and "cold" media at today's standard of the terms. The result of the study, which included student surveys, indicated that a mixture of media was the most "valued" method of instruction, however more interactive media enhanced student learning.

==Application and Case Studies ==
There is significant research being done on the rise of [[social media]] platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and their influence on communication in society. Some of that research is being done through a media ecology perspective. Below are some examples: 

=== Social media activism ===
While many people utilize social media platforms to stay in contact with friends and family, socialize, or even shop,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Correa|first=Teresa|last2=Hinsley|first2=Amber Willard|last3=de Zúñiga|first3=Homero Gil|date=2010-03-01|title=Who interacts on the Web?: The intersection of users' personality and social media use|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563209001472|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=26|issue=2|pages=247–253|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2009.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; these platforms have also been pivotal for social activism. [[Social media activism]] and [[hashtag activism]] have become popular ways to gain mainstream media and public attention for causes, and to facilitate protests.

Thomas Poell researched the influence of social media on the 2010 protests of the [[2010 G20 Toronto summit|Toronto G20 Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poell|first=Thomas|year=2014|title=Social media and the transformation of activist communication: exploring the social media ecology of the 2010 Toronto G20 protests|url=|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=17|issue=6|pages=716–731|via=|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2013.812674}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, he focused on identifying how each social media site was used independently, and then how they were integrated together. The sites analyzed were [[Twitter]], [[YouTube]], [[Flickr|Flikr]], Facebook, and an open publishing website. What he found is that each site is used differently for social media activism. While this kind of activism was originally looked at as a way to promote causes and encourage long term focus on the issues, Poell found that sites like Twitter and Facebook tend to do the opposite. Posts center around photographs and videos of action during protests and rallies, not on the issues that are being protested. This would be an example of hot media, because the user can scroll through photos or watch videos without being otherwise engaged, instead of cool media where the user has to be more involved. Additionally, because activists are using sites they do not own, the social media platform actually has more control over the information being posted. For example, Twitter no longer allows unrestricted access to all posts made with a certain hashtag after a period of time. This seems to mean that the issue being highlighted fades over time.

Additionally, Heather Crandall and Carolyn M. Cunningham focus on hashtag activism, where activists use [[Tag (metadata)|metadata tags]] to focus on specific issues (ex: #activism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crandall|first=Heather|last2=Cunningham|first2=Carolyn M.|year=2016|title=Media ecology and hashtag activism: #Kaleidoscope|url=|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=15|issue=1|pages=22–32|doi=10.1386/eme.15.1.21_1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not look at one specific protest like the G20 summit, but rather at the benefits and criticisms of hashtag activism as a whole. They discuss that social media is a new media ecology, one where users can connect and share ideas without boundaries. This falls under McLuhan's idea of the world as a global village. By using hashtags, activists are able to bring awareness to social issues. Crandall and Cunningham point out that this is both beautiful and interesting, because it encourages learning, conversations, and community for social justice, and that it is also dark and confusing, because the open environment of the internet also allows hashtags to be used for hate speech and threats of violence. Also, they posit that hashtag activism is pointed and stacked, in that hashtags are often short lived, and the user has to be able to navigate the platform and understand hashtags in order to gain knowledge of the issue. When viewed through media ecology, hashtag activism is changing the way people encounter and engage in social justice.

=== Case Studies ===

==== [[Arab Spring]]: Egypt and Iran ====
Doctor Mark Allen Peterson of in the Department of Anthropology at Miami University published an article in the Summer of 2011 comparing the media ecology of 1970's Iran to that in Egypt in 2011. The article, title "Egypt's Media Ecology in a Time of Revolution"&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;Peterson, Mark Allen. "Egypt's media ecology in a time of revolution." Arab media &amp; society 13 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; looks at the difference that social media made in the Egyptian uprising and makes two observations: social media extends the "[[Grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]]" network and that social media, despite the result of the uprising, completely changes the "[[mediascape]]" of Egypt. One dramatic difference between the two uprising noticed by Peterson is the ultimate position of the media of choice during each in the end. On the one hand, Iran's news media, the primary source of information at that time, reverted to its original role, while the Egyptian use of social media changed the media of choice for Egypt.

Peterson's study compared his observations to that of William Beeman, who in 1984 published an essay, "The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after"&lt;ref name=Beeman&gt;Beeman, William O. "The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after." The news media and national and international conflict (1984): 147-165.&lt;/ref&gt; on the media ecology of Iran. Beeman's ultimate conclusion of his review of the [[Iranian Revolution]] followed that of what you would expect to find from most media ecologists: "At times newly introduced mass media have produced revolutionary effects in the societal management of time and energy as they forged new spaces for themselves. Thus media are cultural forces as well as cultural objects. In operation, they produce specific cultural effects that cannot be easily predicted."&lt;ref name=Beeman/&gt;{{rp|147}}

Although there were many similarities between the Iranian and [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian revolutions]], such as censorship in media, including newspaper and television, the one major difference was the availability of the internet and social media as a tool to spread messages and increase awareness in Egypt. Social media in 2011's uprising was equivalent to the use of cassette tapes in Iran in the 1970s. The tapes provided a way to spread information that could not be as easily censored and was repeatable through the country.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|5}} The rise of social media helped free Egyptians from censorship of other media. In this case, the medium was the message, a message of freedom and by the Egyptian government's attempt to also censor this medium, they only managed to spread the message further and faster:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although we may never know the true impact, in fact it likely sped up the regime's fall. In the absence of new technologies, people were forced to rely on traditional means of communication, including knocking on doors, going to the mosque, assembling in the street, or other central gathering places. Thomas Schelling won a Nobel prize in part for discovering that in the absence of information, people will coordinate by selecting a focal point that seems natural, special or relevant to them. Given the protests, Tahrir Square was the obvious focal point. By blocking the Internet, the government inadvertently fueled dissent and galvanized international support for the people of Egypt.

Cairo Review of Global Affairs. http://www.aucegypt.edu/GAPP/CairoReview/Pages/articleDetails.aspx?aid=34 [accessed November 14, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since 2011, leaders of the protest continue to utilize social media as a method to push democratic reform.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|4}} According to Peterson the role of social media in Egypt is also evolving the political culture as even state figures are beginning to make announcements using social media rather than more traditional forms of media.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|5}}

==== [[Gezi Park protests|Gezi Protests]]: Turkey  ====
Much like the Arab Spring, the Gezi protests were an environmental sit-in that ultimately turned into a social movement based on the influence of various forms of social media. Rolien Hoyng and Murat Es coin the term “Turkish media ecology” to evoke a sense of particularly on the part of Turkey’s relationship with media outlets and platforms.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc|title=Conspiratorial Webs: Media Ecology and Parallel Realities in Turkey|last=Hoyng|first=Rolien|last2=Es|first2=Murat|date=2016|website=International Journal of Communications|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey, media censorship and control by state institutions most directly impact broadcast media. Both authors emphasize how “…media-ecological affordances are conditioned and modulated by legal frameworks and institutional-political rationalities”.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They also note that such censored media ecology forms a ‘fertile milieu’ for the proliferation of conspiracy theories which both feed on one another.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Scholar Gulizar Haciyakupoglu examines how social media influenced the protests, specifically looking at how trust was built and maintained among protestors across multiple platforms.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haciyakupoglu|first=Gulizar|last2=Zhang|first2=Weiyu|date=2015-03-18|title=Social Media and Trust during the Gezi Protests in Turkey|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/20/4/450/4067584|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=450–466|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12121|issn=1083-6101}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his interviews, the scholar extrapolates that “closed groups” like Whatsapp and Facebook “…allowed the circulation of confidential and trustworthy information among first- and second-degree friends” whereas Twitter was used for “rapid acquisition of logistic information” that became important during the protest.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; 

====[[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15M Movement]]: Spain  ====
Emiliano Treré looks to the Media Ecology metaphor as a way to investigate the relationship between social movements, media ecologies and communication technologies through the lens of Spain’s 15M movement. Treré states how most scholars believe the media ecological framework is particularly suited for the study of the social movements/media nexus “…because of its ability to provide fine-tuned explorations of the multiplicity, the interconnections, the dynamic evolution of old and new media forms for social change”.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treré|first=Emiliano|last2=Mattoni|first2=Alice|date=2015-11-25|title=Media ecologies and protest movements: main perspectives and key lessons|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1109699|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=290–306|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2015.1109699|issn=1369-118X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author also agrees with Scolari (mentioned above) that the key reflections from the theory is especially beneficial for modern analysis on media and social events.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; One such application is seen with the analysis of Spain’s anti-austerity movement, also called the “15M movement.” Facing different degrees of mainstream media manipulation and bias “various media activists turned to Web TV services, radical online tools, Twitter and Facebook among others to organize, and contrast the official narratives of the protest."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Scholar John Postill argues that Twitter, among all the types of technologies used, produced a greater effect for setting and tone and agenda of the movement.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Postill|first=John|date=2013-10-23|title=Democracy in an age of viral reality: A media epidemiography of Spain’s indignados movement|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1466138113502513|journal=Ethnography|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=51–69|doi=10.1177/1466138113502513|issn=1466-1381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such appropriation of technologies demonstrates the dichotomies between old and new technologies that in term created a kind of “technological sovereignty” among activists.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Media Ecology has the innate ability to aggregate different analytical approaches to better understand the technology that is at place during such a protest. Postill and other scholars ultimately look to a new age in social activism, where “viral” posts shared by media professionals and amateurs empower people and become the rising voice for the future of democracy in Spain.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14052">In contemporary art, '''monumental sculpture''' is large sculpture regardless of purpose, carrying a sense of permanent, solid, objects, rather than the temporary or fragile assemblages used in much contemporary sculpture. In ancient and medieval sculpture, size is normally taken as the criterion for definition, although smaller architectural sculptures may also be labelled monumental sculpture. In the [[Early Modern period]] a specific funerary function may be attributed to monumental sculpture.

Historically monumental sculpture (using the size criterion) in a culture, is regarded as of great significance. A culture may cease to produce monumental sculpture due to [[societal collapse]] or [[aniconism]], usually religiously motivated.[[File:Moissac Abbaye portail sud.jpg|thumb|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] portal of [[Moissac]] Abbey; a classic example of what is meant by "monumental sculpture" in ancient and medieval art history.]]
[[File:Venezia - Chiesa dei SS. Giovanni e Paolo (S. Zanipolo) - Foto G. Dall'Orto 2 lug 2006 - 08.jpg|thumb|Medieval and Renaissance wall tombs in [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice]]. In discussing the [[Early Modern period]], the term may mean specifically sculptures that are [[memorial]]s.]]

==Defining ''monumental''==
The term ''monumental sculpture'' is often used in [[art history]] and [[Art criticism|criticism]], but not always consistently. It combines two concepts, one of function, and one of size, and may include an element of a third more subjective concept. It is often used for all sculptures that are large. Human figures that are perhaps half life-size or above would usually be considered monumental in this sense by art historians,&lt;ref&gt;For example, none of the figures in sculptures at the [[Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey]] are larger than this, and they are described by [[Meyer Schapiro]] as "one of the largest groups of monumental carving in Spanish [[Romanesque art]]". Schapiro, 29&lt;/ref&gt; although in [[contemporary art]] a rather larger overall scale is implied.  Monumental sculpture is therefore distinguished from small portable [[figurine]]s, small metal or [[ivory]] [[relief]]s, [[diptych]]s and the like.

It is also used of sculpture that is architectural in function, especially if used to create or form part of a [[monument]] of some sort, and therefore capitals and reliefs attached to buildings will be included, even if small in size. Typical functions of monuments are as grave markers, [[tomb monument]]s or [[memorial]]s, and expressions of the power of a ruler or community, to which churches and so religious statues are added by convention, although in some contexts monumental sculpture may specifically mean just [[funerary art|funerary]] sculpture for [[church architecture|church monuments]].  A related idea is that of permanence, emphasized in some discussions of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Gilibert, 2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The third concept that may be involved when the term is used is not specific to sculpture, as the other two essentially are.  The entry for "Monumental" in "A Dictionary of Art and Artists" by [[Peter Murray (art historian)|Peter and Linda Murray]] describes it as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Monumental|title=A Dictionary of Art and Artists|edition=Revised|publisher=Penguin|year=1968|author=Peter and Linda Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The most overworked word in current art history and criticism.  It is intended to convey the idea that a particular work of art, or part of such a work, is grand, noble, elevated in idea, simple in conception and execution, without any excess of virtuousity, and having something of the enduring, stable, and timeless nature of great architecture. ... It is not a synonym for 'large'.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

However, this does not constitute an accurate or adequate description of the use of the term for sculpture, though many uses of the term that essentially mean either large or "used in a memorial" may involve this concept also, in ways that are hard to separate.  For example, when [[Meyer Schapiro]], after a chapter analysing the carved capitals at [[Moissac]], says: "in the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of the south portal [''(right)''] the sculpture of Moissac becomes truly monumental.  It is placed above the level of the eye, and is so large as to dominate the entire entrance.  It is a gigantic semi-circular relief ...",&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 201&lt;/ref&gt; size is certainly the dominant part of what he means by the word, and Schapiro's further comments suggest that a lack of "excess of virtuousity" does not form part of what he intends to convey.  Nonetheless, parts of the Murray's concept ("grand, noble, elevated in idea") are included in his meaning, although "simple in conception and execution" hardly seems to apply.

==Meaning in different contexts==
The term 'Monumental Sculptures' has acquired various meanings over the years, but these different meanings have not caused much difficulty in classification, as the various interpretations incorporate the changing nature of sculptures through temporal and spacial landscapes in this category.&lt;ref&gt;The Getty [http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=monumental&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300073760 Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Online] definition only refers to "Very large, comparable to a typical monument in massiveness", but the notes below on the many reference works consulted give a range of different emphases on size and function.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term may be used differently for different periods in history, with breaks occurring around the [[Renaissance]] and the early 20th century. The ancient and medieval sculpture size is normally taken as the criterion for definition, although smaller architectural sculptures can also be addressed by the term. In the [[Early Modern period]] a specific funerary function may have been meant, but the meaning of size was once again adopted while referring to contemporary sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;For examples, concerned with funerary sculpture only are:''The Silent Rhetoric of the Body A History of Monumental Sculpture and Commemorative Art in England, 1720–1770'', by Matthew Craske, Yale UP, {{ISBN|0-300-13541-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-13541-1}} [http://www.yalebooks.co.uk/yale/display.asp?K=9780300135411&amp;bic=AFKB&amp;sort=SORT_DATE/d&amp;ds=Sculpture&amp;m=9&amp;dc=44]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, and several of the titles covered on the [http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/newfile30.htm bibliography page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101112536/http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/newfile30.htm |date=2009-01-01 }} of the website of the Church Monuments Society. For contemporary sculpture, see the [[New York Times]] of August 30, 1981, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/30/nyregion/art-art-s-role-in-government-architecture-is-explore.html "Arts role in government architecture is explore"] by Helen Harrison.

==In art history==

===Appearance of monumental sculpture in a culture===
In [[archeology]] and art history the appearance, and sometimes disappearance, of monumental sculpture (using the size criterion) in a culture, is regarded as of great significance, though tracing the emergence is often complicated by the presumed existence of sculpture in wood and other perishable materials of which no record remains;&lt;ref&gt;See for example Martin Robertson, ''A shorter history of Greek art'', p. 9, Cambridge University Press, 1981, {{ISBN|0-521-28084-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-28084-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=BoUsvD1_VNQC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22monumental+sculpture%22&amp;ei=iiL3SbqpFZS6M8Hm0eQD Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[totem pole]] is an example of a tradition of monumental sculpture in wood that would leave no traces for archaeology.  The ability to summon the resources to create monumental sculpture, by transporting usually very heavy materials and arranging for the payment of what are usually regarded as full-time sculptors, is considered a mark of a relatively advanced culture in terms of social organization.
[[File:Nim Li Punit stela.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Maya stela]]]]

In [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] probably dates to the 3rd millennium BC and may be older than the [[Pyramids of Egypt]].  Recent unexpected discoveries of Ancient Chinese [[bronze age]] figures at [[Sanxingdui]], some more than twice human size, have disturbed many ideas held about early Chinese civilization, since only much smaller bronzes were previously known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_san.shtm NGA, Washington] feature on exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some undoubtedly advanced cultures, such as the [[Indus Valley civilization]], appear to have had no monumental sculpture at all, though producing very sophisticated figurines and seals.  The [[Mississippian culture]] seems to have progressing towards its use, with small stone figures, when it collapsed.  Other cultures, such as Ancient Egypt and the [[History of Easter Island|Easter Island culture]], seem to have devoted enormous resources to very large-scale monumental sculpture from a very early stage&lt;ref&gt;Bruce G. Trigger, "Monumental Architecture: A Thermodynamic Explanation of Symbolic Behaviour Author", World Archaeology, vo.22, no.2, 1990, pp.119-132. &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Disappearance of monumental sculpture===
There may be a number of reasons why a culture ceases to produce monumental sculpture. The most common is [[societal collapse]], as occurred in Europe during the so-called [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] or the [[Classic Maya collapse]] in [[Mesoamerica]].  Another may be [[aniconism]], usually religiously motivated, as followed the [[Muslim conquests]].  Both the rise of Christianity (initially) and later the [[Protestant Reformation]] brought a halt to religious monumental sculpture in the regions concerned, and greatly reduced production of any monumental sculpture for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt; Post, Chandler Rathfon, A History of European and American Sculpture: From the Early Christian Period to the Present Day, Volume l, Harvard University Press, London, 1921 p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; [[Byzantine art]], which had largely avoided the societal collapse in the [[Western Roman Empire]], never resumed the use of monumental figurative sculpture, whether in religious or secular contexts, and was to ban even two-dimensional religious art for a period in the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]].

==Contemporary work==
Monumental sculpture is still used within the stoneworking and funeral trades to cover all forms of grave headstones and other funerary art, regardless of size.  In contemporary art, however, it is used to refer to all large sculptures regardless of purpose, and also carries a sense of permanent, solid, objects, rather than the temporary or fragile assemblages used in much contemporary sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, several uses of the term in [http://www.sculpture.org.uk/blog/monumentally-virtual-ephemerally-physical-directions-in-new-sculpture-and-new-media "Monumentally Virtual, Ephemerally Physical: Directions in new sculpture and new media"], blogpost by Joseph Taylor McRae, Lecturer in Computer Games Arts and editor of Art/Games Journal, published on May 25th, 2016, by the [[Cass Sculpture Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sculptures covered by the term in modern art are likely to be over two metres in at least one dimension, and sufficiently large not to need a high [[plinth]], though they may have one.  Many are still commissioned as [[public art]], often for placing at outdoor sites.

[[File:Tongass national forest juneau img 7501.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Tongass National Forest]] in [[Alaska]] is managed by the [[United States Forest Service]]]]

'''Natural resource management''' refers to the management of [[natural resource]]s such as [[Land (economics)|land]], [[water]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, with a particular focus on how management affects the [[quality of life]] for both present and future generations ([[stewardship]]).

Natural resource management deals with managing the way in which people and natural [[landscapes]] interact. It brings together land use planning, water management, [[Conservation biology|biodiversity conservation]], and the future sustainability of industries like [[agriculture]], [[mining]], [[tourism]], [[fisheries]] and [[forestry]]. It recognises that people and their livelihoods rely on the health and productivity of our landscapes, and their actions as stewards of the land play a critical role in maintaining this health and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Brochure%20-%20Resilient%20landscapes.pdf|format=PDF|title=Resilient landscapes and communities  managing natural resources in New South Wales|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208173746/http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Brochure%20-%20Resilient%20landscapes.pdf|archivedate=8 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural resource management specifically focuses on a scientific and technical understanding of resources and [[ecology]] and the life-supporting capacity of those resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Massey University|url=http://study.massey.ac.nz/massey/students/studymassey/programme.cfm?major_code=2261&amp;prog_code=93013|title=Bachelor of Applied Science (Natural Resource Management)|accessdate=27 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Environmental management]] is also similar to natural resource management. In academic contexts, the [[Rural sociology|sociology of natural resources]] is closely related to, but distinct from, natural resource management.

==History==
[[File:US-DOI-BureauOfLandManagement-Logo.svg|thumb|right|135px|The [[Bureau of Land Management]] in the United States manages America's [[public land]]s, totaling approximately 264 million acres (1,070,000 km2) or one-eighth of the landmass of the country.]]

The emphasis on sustainability can be traced back to early attempts to understand the ecological nature of [[North America]]n [[rangeland]]s in the late 19th century, and the [[Conservation movement|resource conservation]] movement of the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley University of California: Geography: [http://geography.berkeley.edu/programcourses/CoursePagesSP2006/Geog175Rangelands/Geog175syllabus.pdf Geog 175: Topics in the History of Natural Resource Management: Spring 2006: Rangelands] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611112307/http://geography.berkeley.edu/ProgramCourses/CoursePagesSP2006/Geog175Rangelands/Geog175syllabus.pdf |date=11 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco State University: Department of Geography: GEOG 657/ENVS 657:  Natural Resource Management:  Biotic Resources: [http://bss.sfsu.edu/holzman/courses/GEOG%20657/env%20history%20lecture.pdf Natural Resource Management and Environmental History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217101744/http://bss.sfsu.edu/holzman/courses/GEOG%20657/env%20history%20lecture.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of analysis coalesced in the 20th century with recognition that preservationist [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] strategies had not been effective in halting the decline of natural resources. A more integrated approach was implemented recognising the intertwined social, cultural, economic and political aspects of resource management.&lt;ref name="Thakadu2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thakadu |first=O. T. |year=2005 |title=Success factors in community based natural resources management in northern Botswana: Lessons from practice |journal=Natural Resources Forum |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=199–212 |doi=10.1111/j.1477-8947.2005.00130.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more holistic, national and even global form evolved, from the [[Brundtland Commission]] and the advocacy of [[sustainable development]].

In 2005 the government of [[New South Wales]], established a ''Standard for Quality Natural Resource Management'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;NSW Government 2005, Standard for Quality Natural Resource Management, NSW Natural Resources Commission, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt; to improve the consistency of practice, based on an [[adaptive management]] approach.

In the [[United States]], the most active areas of natural resource management are [[wildlife management]] often associated with [[ecotourism]] and [[rangeland management]]. In [[Australia]], water sharing, such as the [[Murray Darling Basin|Murray Darling Basin Plan]] and [[catchment management]] are also significant.

==Ownership regimes==

Natural resource management approaches can be categorised according to the kind and right of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], natural resources:

* State property:  Ownership and control over the use of resources is in hands of the state. Individuals or groups may be able to make use of the resources, but only at the permission of the state. National forest, National parks and military reservations are some US  examples.

* Private property: Any property owned by a defined individual or corporate entity. Both the benefit and duties to the resources fall to the owner(s). Private land is the most common example.

* Common property: It is a private property of a group. The group may vary in size, nature and internal structure e.g. indigenous neighbours of village. Some examples of common property are community forests.

* Non-property (open access): There is no definite owner of these properties. Each potential user has equal ability to use it as they wish. These areas are the most exploited. It is said that "Everybody's property is nobody's property". An example is a lake fishery. [[Common land]] may exist without ownership, in which case in the UK it is vested in a local authority.

* Hybrid: Many ownership regimes governing natural resources will contain parts of more than one of the regimes described above, so natural resource managers need to consider the impact of hybrid regimes. An example of such a hybrid is native vegetation management in NSW, Australia, where legislation recognises a public interest in the preservation of native vegetation, but where most native vegetation exists on private land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/vegetation/nvact.htm|title=Native Vegetation Act 2003|publisher=Environment.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholder analysis==

[[Stakeholder analysis]] originated from business management practices and has been incorporated into [[natural resource]] management in ever growing popularity. Stakeholder analysis in the context of natural resource management identifies distinctive interest groups affected in the utilisation and conservation of natural resources.&lt;ref name="Dandy"&gt;Dandy, N. et al. (2009) ‘Who's in and why? A typology of stakeholder analysis methods for natural resource management,’ Journal of Environmental Management, vol. 90, pp. 1933–1949&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no definitive definition of a stakeholder as illustrated in the table below. Especially in natural resource management as it is difficult to determine who has a stake and this will differ according to each potential stakeholder.&lt;ref name="Billgrena"&gt;Billgrena, C., Holme, H. (2008) ‘Approaching reality: Comparing stakeholder analysis and cultural theory in the context of natural resource management,’ Land Use Policy, vol. 25, pp. 550–562&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, it is dependent upon the circumstances of the stakeholders involved with natural resource as to which definition and subsequent theory is utilised.

Billgrena and Holme&lt;ref name="Billgrena" /&gt; identified the aims of stakeholder analysis in natural resource management:

*Identify and categorise the stakeholders that may have influence
*Develop an understanding of why changes occur
*Establish who can make changes happen
*How to best manage natural resources

This gives transparency and clarity to policy making allowing stakeholders to recognise conflicts of interest and facilitate resolutions.&lt;ref name="Billgrena" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimble"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grimble, R|date=1998|title=Stakeholder methodologies in natural resource management, Socioeconomic Methodologies|publisher=Chatham: Natural Resources Institute|pages=1–12|url=http://www.nri.org/old/publications/bpg/bpg02.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are numerous stakeholder theories such as Mitchell et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mitchell, R. K.|date=1997|title=TOWARD A THEORY OF STAKEHOLDER IDENTIFICATION AND SALIENCE: DEFINING THE PRINCIPLE OF WHO AND WHAT REALLY COUNTS|publisher=Academy of Management Review|volume=22|number=4|pages=853–886|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Grimble&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt; created a framework of stages for a Stakeholder Analysis in natural resource management. Grimble&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;  designed this framework to ensure that the analysis is specific to the essential aspects of natural resource management.

'''Stages in Stakeholder analysis:'''&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;
#        Clarify objectives of the analysis
#       Place issues in a systems context
#        Identify decision-makers and stakeholders
#         Investigate stakeholder interests and agendas
#           Investigate patterns of inter-action and dependence  (e.g. conflicts and compatibilities, trade-offs and synergies)

'''Application:'''

Grimble and Wellard&lt;ref name="GrimbleWellard" /&gt; established that Stakeholder analysis in natural resource management is most relevant where issued can be characterised as;

*	Cross-cutting systems and stakeholder interests
*	Multiple uses and users of the resource.
*	[[Market failure]]
*	[[Subtractability]] and temporal trade-offs
*	Unclear or [[open-access]] [[property rights]]
*	Untraded products and services
*	[[Poverty]] and under-representation&lt;ref name="GrimbleWellard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;

'''Case studies:'''

In the case of the [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]], a comprehensive stakeholder analysis would have been relevant and the Batwa people would have potentially been acknowledged as stakeholders preventing the loss of people's livelihoods and loss of life.&lt;ref name="GrimbleWellard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;

Nepal, Indonesia and Koreas' [[community forestry#5Best Practices|community forestry]] are successful examples of how stakeholder analysis can be incorporated into the management of natural resources. This allowed the stakeholders to identify their needs and level of involvement with the forests.

'''Criticisms:'''

*	Natural resource management stakeholder analysis tends to include too many stakeholders which can create problems in of its self as suggested by Clarkson. ‘‘Stakeholder theory should not be used to weave a basket big enough to hold the world's misery.’’&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson, M.B.E. (1994) A risk based model of stakeholder theory. Toronto: Working Paper, University of Toronto, pp.10&lt;/ref&gt;
*	Starik&lt;ref&gt;Starik, M. (1995) ‘Should trees have managerial standing? Toward stakeholder status for non-human nature,’ Journal of Business Ethics, vol. 14, pp. 207–217&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that nature needs to be represented as stakeholder. However this has been rejected by many scholars as it would be difficult to find appropriate representation and this representation could also be disputed by other stakeholders causing further issues.&lt;ref name="Billgrena" /&gt;
*	Stakeholder analysis can be used exploited and abused in order to marginalise other stakeholders.&lt;ref name="Dandy" /&gt;
*	Identifying the relevant stakeholders for participatory processes is complex as certain stakeholder groups may have been excluded from previous decisions.&lt;ref name="Prell"&gt;Prell, C., et al. (2007) Stakeholder Analysis and Social Network Analysis in Natural Resource Management. Leeds: Sustainability Research Institute, University of Leeds, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;
*	On-going conflicts and lack of trust between stakeholders can prevent compromise and resolutions.&lt;ref name="Prell" /&gt;

'''Alternatives/ Complementary forms of analysis:'''

*	[[Social network analysis]]
*	[[Common pool resource]]

==Management of the resources==

Natural resource management issues are inherently complex. They involve the ecological cycles, hydrological cycles, climate, animals, plants and geography, etc. All these are dynamic and inter-related. A change in one of them may have far reaching and/or long term impacts which may even be irreversible. In addition to the natural systems, natural resource management also has to manage various stakeholders and their interests, policies, politics, geographical boundaries, economic implications and the list goes on. It is a very difficult to satisfy all aspects at the same time. This results in conflicting situations.

After the United Nations Conference for the Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, most nations subscribed to new principles for the integrated management of land, water, and forests. Although program names vary from nation to nation, all express similar aims.

The various approaches applied to natural resource management include:

* Top-down (command and control)
* Community-based natural resource management
* [[Adaptive]] management
* Precautionary approach
* Integrated natural resource management

=== Community-based natural resource management ===

The community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) approach combines conservation objectives with the generation of economic benefits for rural communities. The three key assumptions being that: locals are better placed to conserve natural resources, people will conserve a resource only if benefits exceed the costs of conservation, and people will conserve a resource that is linked directly to their quality of life.&lt;ref name="Thakadu2005" /&gt; When a local people's quality of life is enhanced, their efforts and commitment to ensure the future well-being of the resource are also enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrom, E,  Schroeder, L and Wynne, S 1993. Institutional incentives and sustainable development: infrastructure policies in perspective. Westview Press. Oxford, UK. 266 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Regional and community based natural resource management is also based on the principle of [[subsidiarity]].

The United Nations advocates CBNRM in the Convention on Biodiversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification. Unless clearly defined, decentralised NRM can result an ambiguous socio-legal environment with local communities racing to exploit natural resources while they can e.g. forest communities in central Kalimantan (Indonesia).&lt;ref&gt;Bartley, T Andersson, K, Jager P and Van Laerhoven 2008 The contribution of Institutional Theories for explaining [[Decentralization]] of Natural Resource Governance. Society and Natural Resources, 21:160-174 {{doi|10.1080/08941920701617973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A problem of CBNRM is the difficulty of reconciling and harmonising the objectives of socioeconomic development, biodiversity protection and sustainable resource utilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kellert, S|author2=Mehta, J|author3=Ebbin, S|author4=Litchtenfeld, L.|date=2000|title=Community natural resource management: promise, rhetoric, and reality|publisher=Society and Natural Resources, 13:705-715|url=http://biologicalcapital.com/art/Article-%20Community%20Natural%20Resource%20Management.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept and conflicting interests of CBNRM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brosius, J.|author2=Peter Tsing|author3=Anna Lowenhaupt|author4=Zerner, Charles|date=1998 |title=Representing communities: Histories and politics of community-based natural resource management |journal=Society &amp; Natural Resources|publisher=Society &amp; Natural Resources: An International Journal |volume=11 |issue=2|pages=157–168|url=http://www.informaworld.com/10.1080/08941929809381069|accessdate=27 October 2014|doi=10.1080/08941929809381069}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twyman, C 2000.

Understanding power relations is crucial to the success of community based NRM. Locals may be reluctant to challenge government recommendations for fear of losing promised benefits.

CBNRM is based particularly on advocacy by nongovernmental organizations working with local groups and communities, on the one hand, and national and transnational organizations, on the other, to build and extend new versions of environmental and social advocacy that link social justice and environmental management agendas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shackleton, S|author2=Campbell, B|author3=Wollenberg, E|author4=Edmunds, D.|date=March 2002|title=Devolution and community-based natural resource management: creating space for local people to participate and benefit? |publisher=ODI, Natural Resource Perspectives|number=76|url=http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3646/76-devolution-community-based-natural-resource-management.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with both direct and indirect benefits observed including a share of revenues, employment, diversification of livelihoods and increased pride and identity.

Caring for our Country is an Australian Government initiative jointly administered by the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. These Departments share responsibility for delivery of the Australian Government's environment and sustainable agriculture programs, which have traditionally been broadly referred to under the banner of ‘natural resource management’. These programs have been delivered regionally, through 56 State government bodies, successfully allowing regional communities to decide the natural resource priorities for their regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/2010%20Progress%20report.pdf|title=PROGRESS TOWARDS HEALTHY RESILIENT LANDSCAPES IMPLEMENTING THE STANDARD, TARGETS AND CATCHMENT ACTION PLANS|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217095859/http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/2010%20Progress%20report.pdf|archivedate=17 February 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=27 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, a research study based in Tanzania and the Pacific researched what motivates communities to adopt CBNRM's and found that aspects of the specific CBNRM program, of the community that has adopted the program, and of the broader social-ecological context together shape the why CBNRM's are adopted&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mascia|first=Michael B.|last2=Mills|first2=Morena|title=When conservation goes viral: The diffusion of innovative biodiversity conservation policies and practices|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12442/abstract|journal=Conservation Letters|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/conl.12442|issn=1755-263X}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Governance is seen as a key consideration for delivering community-based or regional natural resource management. In the State of NSW, the 13 [[Catchment Management Authority of (New South Wales)|catchment management authorities]] (CMAs) are overseen by the [http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/ Natural Resources Commission] (NRC), responsible for undertaking audits of the effectiveness of regional natural resource management programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/viewtop/inforce/act+102+2003+cd+0+N/?autoquery=%28Content%3D%28%28%22natural%22%20OR%20%22resources%22%20OR%20%22commission%22%29%29%29%20AND%20%28%28Type%3D%22act%22%20AND%20Repealed%3D%22N%22%29%20OR%20%28Type%3D%22subordleg%22%20AND%20Repealed%3D%22N%22%29%29&amp;dq=Document%20Types%3D%22Acts,%20Regs%22,%20Any%20Words%3D%22natural%20resources%20commission%22,%20Search%20In%3D%22Text%22&amp;fullquery=%28%28%28%22natural%22%20OR%20%22resources%22%20OR%20%22commission%22%29%29%29|title=NSW Legislation|publisher=Legislation.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptive management===
The primary methodological approach adopted by [[Catchment Management Authority (New South Wales)|catchment management authorities]] (CMAs) for regional natural resource management in Australia is [[adaptive management]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

This approach includes recognition that adaption occurs through a process of ‘plan-do-review-act’. It also recognises seven key components that should be considered for quality natural resource management practice:
*	Determination of scale
*	Collection and use of knowledge
*	[[Information management]]
*	Monitoring and evaluation
*	[[Risk management]]
*	[[Community engagement]]
*	Opportunities for [[collaboration]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Integrated natural resource management ===
Integrated natural resource management (INRM) is a process of managing natural resources in a systematic way, which includes multiple aspects of natural resource use (biophysical, socio-political, and economic) meet production goals of producers and other direct users (e.g., food security, profitability, risk aversion) as well as goals of the wider community (e.g., poverty alleviation, welfare of future generations, environmental conservation). It focuses on sustainability and at the same time tries to incorporate all possible stakeholders from the planning level itself, reducing possible future conflicts. The conceptual basis of INRM has evolved in recent years through the convergence of research in diverse areas such as sustainable land use, participatory planning, integrated watershed management, and adaptive management.&lt;ref name="Conservation Ecology 52: 25"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lovell, C.|author2=Mandondo A.|author3=Moriarty P.|date=2002|title=The question of scale in integrated natural resource management|publisher=Conservation Ecology 5(2): 25|url=http://www.consecol.org/vol5/iss2/art25/|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holling C.S pages 328"&gt;Holling C.S. and Meffe, G.

==Frameworks and modelling==
There are various frameworks and computer models developed to assist natural resource management.

'''Geographic Information Systems (GIS)'''

[[GIS]] is a powerful analytical tool as it is capable of overlaying datasets to identify links. A bush regeneration scheme can be informed by the overlay of rainfall, cleared land and erosion.&lt;ref&gt;Harding R., 1998, Environmental Decision-Making: The Role of Scientists, Engineers and the Public, Federation Press, Leichhardt. pp366.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, Metadata Directories such as NDAR provide data on Australian natural resources such as vegetation, fisheries, soils and water.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, C and Attwater, R (1996) Usage of, and demand for Environmental Statistics in Australia, in Tracking Progress: Linking Environment and Economy Through Indicators and Accounting Systems Conference Papers, 1996 Australian Academy of Science Fenner Conference on the Environment, Institute of Environmental Studies, UNSW, Sydney, 30 September to 3 October 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; These are limited by the potential for subjective input and data manipulation.

'''Natural Resources Management Audit Frameworks'''

The NSW Government in Australia has published an audit framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20framework.pdf|format=PDF|title=Framework for Auditing the  Implementation of Catchment Action Plans|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621122515/http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20framework.pdf|archivedate=21 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for natural resource management, to assist the establishment of a performance audit role in the governance of regional natural resource management. This audit framework builds from other established audit methodologies, including [[performance audit]], [[environmental audit]] and [[internal audit]]. Audits undertaken using this framework have provided confidence to stakeholders, identified areas for improvement and described policy expectations for the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20report%20-%20Murray%202010.pdf|format=PDF|title=MURRAY CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY : Audit Report|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621120858/http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20report%20-%20Murray%202010.pdf|archivedate=21 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riskaudit.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Nature-audit-NZ-Accountants-Journal-March-2010.pdf|format=PDF|title=Nature Audit|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Government has established a framework for auditing greenhouse emissions and energy reporting, which closely follows Australian Standards for Assurance Engagements.

The Australian Government is also currently preparing an audit framework for auditing water management, focussing on the implementation of the Murray Darling Basin Plan.

==Other elements==
;Biodiversity Conservation

The issue of biodiversity conservation is regarded as an important element in natural resource management. What is biodiversity? Biodiversity is a comprehensive concept, which is a description of the extent of natural diversity. Gaston and Spicer&lt;ref&gt;Gaston, KJ &amp; Spicer, JI 2004, Biodiversity: An Introduction, Blackwell Publishing Company, Malden.&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;3) point out that biodiversity is "the variety of life" and relate to different kinds of "biodiversity organization". According to Gray&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gray, JS|date=1997|title=Marine biodiversity: patterns, threats and conservation needs|url=http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~bpaynewww/CMR/marinebiod.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721172744/http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~bpaynewww/CMR/marinebiod.pdf|archive-date=21 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;154), the first widespread use of the definition of biodiversity, was put forward by the United Nations in 1992, involving different aspects of biological diversity.

;Precautionary Biodiversity Management

The "threats" wreaking havoc on biodiversity include; [[habitat fragmentation]], putting a strain on the already stretched biological resources; forest deterioration and deforestation; the invasion of "alien species" and "climate change"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cooney, R|date=2004|title=The Precautionary Principle in Biodiversity Conservation and Natural Resource Management|publisher=IUCN Policy and Global Change Series|number=2|url=http://pprinciple.net/publications/PrecautionaryPrincipleissuespaper.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509063720/http://www.pprinciple.net/publications/PrecautionaryPrincipleissuespaper.pdf|archive-date=9 May 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;( p.&amp;nbsp;2). Since these threats have received increasing attention from environmentalists and the public, the precautionary management of biodiversity becomes an important part of natural resources management. According to Cooney, there are material measures to carry out precautionary management of biodiversity in natural resource management.

;Concrete "policy tools"

Cooney claims that the policy making is dependent on "evidences", relating to "high standard of proof", the forbidding of special "activities" and "information and monitoring requirements". Before making the policy of precaution, categorical evidence is needed. When the potential menace of "activities" is regarded as a critical and "irreversible" endangerment, these "activities" should be forbidden. For example, since explosives and toxicants will have serious consequences to endanger human and natural environment, the South Africa Marine Living Resources Act promulgated a series of policies on completely forbidding to "catch fish" by using explosives and toxicants.

;Administration and guidelines

According to Cooney, there are 4 methods to manage the precaution of biodiversity in natural resources management;

# "[[Ecosystem-based management]]" including "more risk-averse and precautionary management", where "given prevailing uncertainty regarding ecosystem structure, function, and inter-specific interactions, precaution demands an ecosystem rather than single-species approach to management".
# "[[Adaptive management]]" is "a management approach that expressly tackles the uncertainty and dynamism of complex systems".
# "[[Environmental impact assessment]]" and exposure ratings decrease the "uncertainties" of precaution, even though it has deficiencies, and
# "Protectionist approaches", which "most frequently links to" biodiversity conservation in natural resources management.

;Land management

In order to have a sustainable environment, understanding and using appropriate management strategies is important. In terms of understanding, Young&lt;ref&gt;Young, A 1998, Land resources: now and for the future, Cambridge University Press, UK&lt;/ref&gt; emphasises some important points of land management:

* Comprehending the processes of nature including ecosystem, water, soils
* Using appropriate and adapting management systems in local situations
* Cooperation between scientists who have knowledge and resources and local people who have knowledge and skills

Dale et al. (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Dale, VH, Brown, S, Hawuber, RA, Hobbs, NT, Huntly, Nj Naiman, RJ, Riebsame, WE, Turner, MG &amp; Valone, TJ 2000, ‘Ecological guidelines for land use and management’, in Dale, VH &amp; Hawuber, RA (eds), Applying ecological principles to land management, Springer-Verlag, NY&lt;/ref&gt; study has shown that there are five fundamental and helpful ecological principles for the land manager and people who need them. The ecological principles relate to time, place, species, disturbance and the landscape and they interact in many ways.It is suggested that land managers could follow these guidelines:

* Examine impacts of local decisions in a regional context, and the effects on natural resources.
* Plan for long-term change and unexpected events.
* Preserve rare landscape elements and associated species.
* Avoid land uses that deplete natural resources.
* Retain large contiguous or connected areas that contain critical habitats.
* Minimize the introduction and spread of non-native species.
* Avoid or compensate for the effects of development on ecological processes.
* Implement land-use and land-management practices that are compatible with the natural potential of the area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5148">'''OTSEM''' (''Old Testament Studies: Epistemologies and Methods'') is a research network of several Northern European universities. Originally Nordic-German in nature, it now includes British universities as well, which gives it a Nordic-German-Anglo profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stenström|authorlink1=Unity and Diversity in Nordic Biblical Scholarship|editor1-last=Boer|editor1-first=Roland|title=The Future of the Biblical Past: Envisioning Biblical Studies on a Global Key|date=2012|publisher=SBL|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization focuses on research into the [[Hebrew Bible]] and promotes the development of young scholars in particular, especially through annual seminars and special lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learning Together at the OTSEM Meeting in Hamburg {{!}} Changes in Sacred Texts and Traditions|url = http://blogs.helsinki.fi/sacredtexts/2014/09/17/learning-together-at-the-otsem-meeting-in-hamburg/|website = blogs.helsinki.fi|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though encompassing theological faculties and using the term [[Old Testament]], OTSEM is non-confessional, with members from Christian (both Protestant and Catholic), Jewish, Muslim, and secular backgrounds.

==Institutions==

Currently, OTSEM consists of sixteen institutions from eight different countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Member Institutions|url=http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/204017.html|website=OTSEM Research Network|publisher=University of Göttingen|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Norway'': [[University of Oslo]], [[MF Norwegian School of Theology]], Norwegian School of Mission and Theology
* ''Sweden'': [[Uppsala University]], [[Lund University]]

==History==

The history of OTSEM divides into three distinct periods: Proto-OTSEM, OTSEM I, and OTSEM II (the present iteration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OTSEM History|url=http://www.otsem.uni-hamburg.de/index.php/about-otsem/otsem-history|website=OTSEM|publisher=University of Hamburg|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proto-OTSEM===

OTSEM's antecedents reach back to the 1970s. At that time, Helsinki and Göttingen had a student and professor exchange between their theological faculties. Beginning in the 1990s, bi- and trilateral doctoral seminars took place among the various institutions that would later become members of OTSEM.

* 1994: Helsinki visited Hamburg (where current Göttingen affiliates previously were)
* 1995: Aarhus visited Hamburg
* 1996: Hamburg visited Aarhus
* 1997: Lund visited Hamburg
* 1998: Hamburg visited Lund
* 2000: Göttingen visited Lund
* 2001: Lund and Oslo visited MF 
* 2002: MF visited Göttingen
* 2003: Lund, Göttingen, and Oslo visited MF

In addition to arranging doctoral seminars, future members also organised professorial exchanges.

* 1995: Hamburg visited Aarhus
* 1998: Lund visited Aarhus
* 1999: Helsinki visited Göttingen; Aarhus visited Lund and MF; Lund visited MF
* 2000: Helsinki visited Göttingen; Göttingen visited Lund; Lund visited MF; MF visited Lund
* 2001: Lund visited MF; Helsinki visited MF

===OTSEM I===

From 2004 through 2008, the Nordic Council (''NordForsk'') co-funded the research network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nordic Research Gems: Success stories from NORIA|date=2008|publisher=Nordic Council of Ministers|pages=26–27|url=http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A707825&amp;dswid=1563|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Granerød|first1=Gard|title=Abraham and Melchizedek: Scribal Activity of Second Temple Times in Genesis 14 and Psalm 110|date=2010|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin|page=v}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, OTSEM saw formalization and expansion. This expansion included an increase in not only the number of members and member institutions but also meetings and individual exchanges. In particular, the now formal organization commenced its annual conferences (Oslo in 2004, Göttingen in 2005, Aarhus in 2006, Helsinki in 2008, and Lund in 2008). With the end of funding from the Nordic Council came the end of OTSEM I and start of OTSEM II.

===OTSEM II===

Since 2009, OTSEM has been financed solely by its associated institutions. Nevertheless, the research network has continued its annual conference and individual exchanges.

==Notable members==

OTSEM members with a high international profile have included the following:

*[[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]]
*Fredrik Lindström
*[[Reinhard Gregor Kratz]]
*[[Martti Nissinen]]
*[[Hermann Spieckermann]]
*Terje Stordalen

'''''Oragenitalism''''' is a book by the American folklorist [[Gershon Legman]], published by the Julian Press in 1969. The book describes various types of [[oral sex]]. 
The book is intended as "instruction manual, conduct guide, and household advice book".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7OeNRe9V1K8C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq= Kick 2006, p. 66a]&lt;/ref&gt;  The author claimed that it was the earliest book of its kind on the subject, and for a long time the only one.&lt;ref name=brottman31&gt;Brottman (2004) p.31&lt;/ref&gt; 
Its contents are divided into four sections: "[[Cunnilingus|Cunnilinctus]]" written under the pen-name Roger-Maxe de la Glannege (an [[anagram]] of his real name) and published by Jacob Brussel of New York in 1940;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Martha Cornog |author2=Timothy Perper | title=Make love, not war: The legacy of Gershon Legman, 1917-1999 | doi=10.1080/00224499909552002 | journal=Journal of Sex Research | volume=36 | issue=3 |date=August 1999 | pages=316–317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slade (2001) p.802&lt;/ref&gt; the three remaining sections "[[Fellatio]]", "[[Irrumatio]]n", and "[[69 (sex position)|Sixty-Nine]]" were not published until 1969.&lt;ref name=brottman31/&gt;

==Background==

The creation of Oral History of American Music was a result of [[musicology|musicologist]] Vivian Perlis's research on the life of American composer [[Charles Ives]], for which she interviewed sixty individuals who had known him personally. During the course of the interviews, Perlis recognized the need for a larger project that would collect and preserve the oral history of American composers, and began the OHAM project in 1969 with that intent.&lt;ref name="Musicworks"&gt;{{cite journal|title=In the Voice of the Artist: An Interview with Vivian Perlis|journal=Musicworks|date=Autumn 1991|issue=51|pages=22–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perlis's interviews with friends, family and colleagues of Ives became OHAM's initial collection, and were later used in her 1974 book, ''Charles Ives Remembered: An Oral History'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Dale|title=Saving a Spoken Soundscape|publisher=New Haven Register|date=February 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which she received the [[American Musicological Society]]'s Otto Kinkeldey Award—the first time it had been awarded either to a woman or for work on American music.&lt;ref name="Kinkeldey Winners"&gt;{{cite web|title=Otto Kinkeldey Award Winners|url=http://www.ams-net.org/awards/kinkeldeywinners.php|website=American Musicological Society|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Perlis's biography of Ives, the project's collection played an instrumental role in a number of other historical works: ''A Good Dissonance Like a Man'', a documentary film about Ives;&lt;ref name=Newsletter&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=John J.|title=Oral History, American Music Celebrates 10th Birthday|journal=New England Association for Oral History Newsletter|date=Fall 1981|volume=6|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Copland]]'s two-volume autobiography ''Copland: 1900 through 1942'' and ''Copland: Since 1943'', co-written with Perlis;&lt;ref name=Alumni&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elder|first1=Sharon|title=Let's Talk Music|journal=Yale Alumni Magazine|date=May 1991|pages=16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the book ''Composers' Voices from Ives to Ellington'', co-written by Perlis and [[Libby Van Cleve]].&lt;ref name="NYT Wise"/&gt; Perlis served as the project's director until she retired in 2010 and was succeeded by its current director, Van Cleve.&lt;ref name="YSM Retirement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vivian Perlis announces retirement from Oral History of American Music project|url=http://music.yale.edu/2010/07/27/vivian-perlis-announces-retirement-from-oral-history-of-american-music-project/|website=Yale School of Music Website|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OHAM expanded through interviews conducted by Perlis, Van Cleve and others, as well as by acquisitions of recordings from scholars, radio producers, and concert presenters. Its largest component today is the Major Figures in American Music series, which primarily documents classical composers at varying stages in their careers. OHAM also holds five series of extensive interviews centered around specific persons and topics.&lt;ref name="OHAM More About"/&gt;

Grants to preserve and digitize OHAM's recordings have come from the [[Grammy Foundation]],&lt;ref name="GRAMMY"&gt;{{cite web|title=GRAMMY Foundation Grant Recipients|url=https://www.grammy.org/grammy-foundation/grants/past-recipients|website=GRAMMY.org|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation,&lt;ref name="Delmas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Library Program Grants, 1993–2015|url=http://delmas.org/grants/past-grants/research-library-grants/|website=The Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]],&lt;ref name="NEH1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grant Details|url=https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=RO-*1335-80|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEH2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grant Details|url=https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=RC-20497-83|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEH3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grant Details|url=https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=RC-21182-87|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Save America's Treasures]] initiative.&lt;ref name="Save America's Treasures"&gt;{{cite web|title=Save America's Treasure Awards 1999–2010 by State|url=http://www.pcah.gov/sites/default/files/SAT%20Awards%201999-2010%20Table_2.pdf|publisher=Save America's Treasures|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Aaron Copland]] Fund for Music donated $500,000 to establish an endowment fund for the organization.&lt;ref name="YaleNews Copland"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale's Oral History of American Music Project Receives Endowment Support from the Aaron Copland Fund for Music|url=http://news.yale.edu/2009/12/03/yale-s-oral-history-american-music-project-receives-endowment-support-aaron-copland-fund-|website=YaleNews|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==

Oral History of American Music's collection consists primarily of audio and video interviews which are [[digitized]] and [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]]. The collection is split into six major components in addition to its acquired materials:

* Major Figures in American Music: audio and video interviews with about 1,000 composers, performers, and other significant musicians

'''Oral tradition''', or '''oral lore''', is a form of human [[communication]] wherein knowledge, art, ideas and cultural material is received, preserved and transmitted orally from one generation to another.&lt;ref name = "Vansina"&gt;[[Jan Vansina|Vansina, Jan]]: ''Oral Tradition as History'' (1985), reported statements from present generation which "specifies that the message must be oral statements spoken, sung or called out on musical instruments only"; "There must be transmission by word of mouth over at least a generation". He points out, "Our definition is a working definition for the use of historians. Sociologists, linguists or scholars of the verbal arts propose their own, which in, e.g., sociology, stresses common knowledge. In linguistics, features that distinguish the language from common dialogue (linguists), and in the verbal arts features of form and content that define art (folklorists)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannicaot/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ki-Zerbo"&gt;Ki-Zerbo, Joseph: "Methodology and African Prehistory", 1990, ''UNESCO International Scientific Committee for the Drafting of a General History of Africa''; James Currey Publishers, {{ISBN|0-85255-091-X}}, 9780852550915; see Ch. 7; "Oral tradition and its methodology" at pages 54-61; at page 54: "Oral tradition may be defined as being a testimony transmitted verbally from one generation to another.  Its special characteristics are that it is verbal and the manner in which it is transmitted."&lt;/ref&gt; The transmission is through speech or song and may include folktales, ballads, chants, prose or verses. In this way, it is possible for a society to transmit [[oral history]], [[oral literature]], [[oral law]] and other knowledge across generations without a [[writing system]], or in parallel to a writing system. Religions such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], for example, have used an oral tradition, in parallel to a writing system, to transmit their canonical scriptures, secular knowledge such as [[Sushruta Samhita]], hymns and mythologies from one generation to the next.&lt;ref name="Goody1987p82"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Goody |title=The Interface Between the Written and the Oral  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TepXQMN6lfUC |year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press  |isbn=978-0-521-33794-6 |pages=110–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=witzel68/&gt;&lt;ref name=lopez1995p21&gt;{{cite journal|author=Donald S.

==History==
According to John Foley, oral tradition has been an ancient human tradition found in "all corners of the world".&lt;ref name="MacKay1999p1"/&gt; Modern archaeology has been unveiling evidence of the human efforts to preserve and transmit arts and knowledge that depended completely or partially on an oral tradition, across various cultures:

{{Quote|
The Judeo-Christian Bible reveals its oral traditional roots; medieval European manuscripts are penned by performing scribes; geometric vases from archaic Greece mirror Homer's oral style. (...) Indeed, if these final decades of the millennium have taught us anything, it must be that oral tradition never was the other we accused it of being; it never was the primitive, preliminary technology of communication we thought it to be. Rather, if the whole truth is told, oral tradition stands out as the single most dominant communicative technology of our species as both a historical fact and, in many areas still, a contemporary reality.

In Asia, the transmission of folklore, mythologies as well as scriptures in ancient India, in different Indian religions, was by oral tradition, preserved with precision with the help of elaborate [[Vedic chant|mnemonic techniques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Donald S. Lopez Jr. |year=1995|title= Authority and Orality in the Mahāyāna|journal= Numen|volume= 42 |number= 1|pages= 21–47|publisher= Brill Academic|jstor= 3270278}}; Quote: The early Buddhist texts are also generally believed to be of oral tradition, with the first Pali Canon written many centuries after the death of the Buddha.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars such as Jack Goody state that the Vedas are not the product strictly of an oral tradition, basing this view by comparing inconsistencies in the transmitted versions of literature from various oral societies such as the Greek, Serbia and other cultures, then noting that the Vedic literature is too consistent and vast to have been composed and transmitted orally across generations, without being written down.&lt;ref name="Goody1987p82"/&gt; According to Goody, the Vedic texts likely involved both a written and oral tradition, calling it a "parallel products of a literate society".&lt;ref name="Goody1987p82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez1995p21"/&gt;

In ancient Greece, the oral tradition was a dominant tradition. [[Homer]]'s epic poetry, states Michael Gagarin, was largely composed, performed and transmitted orally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Gagarin |editor=E. Anne MacKay| title=Signs of Orality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vkfRvkgDTOsC |year=1999|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=978-9004112735|pages=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; As folklores and legends were performed in front of distant audiences, the singers would substitute the names in the stories with local characters or rulers to give the stories a local flavor and thus connect with the audience, but making the historicity embedded in the oral tradition as unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Kullmann |editor=E.

==Transmission==
[[File:Helsinki-Folk-singer-statue-1750.JPG|thumb|The legendary Finnish storyteller [[Väinämöinen]] with his [[kantele]]]]
Oral traditions face the challenge of accurate transmission and verifiability of the accurate version, particularly when the culture lacks written language or has limited access to writing tools. Oral cultures have employed various strategies that achieve this without writing. For example, a heavily rhythmic speech filled with [[mnemonic device]]s enhances memory and recall. A few useful mnemonic devices include [[alliteration]], repetition, [[assonance]], and proverbial sayings. In addition, the verse is often metrically composed with an exact number of syllables or [[morae]] - such as with Greek and Latin prosody and in [[Sanskrit prosody|Chandas]] found in Hindu and Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name="TElizarenkova1995p112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan2013p228"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Scharf|editor=Keith Allan|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BQfDosHckzEC|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-164344-6|pages=228–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verses of the epic or text are typically designed wherein the long and short syllables are repeated by certain rules, so that if an error or inadvertent change is made, an internal examination of the verse reveals the problem.&lt;ref name="TElizarenkova1995p112"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tatyana J.

| The law itself in oral cultures is enshrined in formulaic sayings, proverbs, which are not mere jurisprudential decorations, but themselves constitute the law. A judge in an oral culture is often called on to articulate sets of relevant proverbs out of which he can produce equitable decisions in the cases under formal litigation before him.&lt;ref name="Longman Publishers USA"/&gt;
|}

[[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[The Jungle Book]] provides an excellent demonstration of oral governance in the [[Law of the Jungle]]. Not only does grounding rules in oral proverbs allow for simple transmission and understanding, but it also legitimizes new rulings by allowing extrapolation. These stories, traditions, and proverbs are not static, but are often altered upon each transmission barring the overall meaning remains intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanson|first1=Erin|title=Oral Traditions|url=http://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/home/culture/oral-traditions.html|website=Indigenous Foundations|accessdate=5 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082618/http://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/home/culture/oral-traditions.html|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the rules that govern the people are modified by the whole and not authored by a single entity.

===Indian religions===
Ancient texts of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] were preserved and transmitted by an oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hartmut Scharfe |title=Handbook of Oriental Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7s19sZFRxCUC |year=2002|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-12556-6 |pages=24–29, 226–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Lopez |title=Buddhist Scriptures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Pd-2IIzip4C |year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-190937-0 |pages=xi–xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[śruti]]s of Hinduism called the [[Veda]]s, the oldest of which trace back to the second millennium BCE. [[Michael Witzel]] explains this oral tradition as follows:&lt;ref name=witzel68/&gt;

{{quote|The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalized early on.  This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is, in fact, something like a ''tape-recording''... Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present.|Michael Witzel&lt;ref name=witzel68&gt;M Witzel, "Vedas and Upaniṣads", in Flood, Gavin, ed. (2003), The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism, Blackwell Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|1-4051-3251-5}}, pages 68-71&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ancient Indians developed techniques for listening, memorization and recitation of their knowledge, in schools called [[Guru]]kul, while maintaining exceptional accuracy of their knowledge across the generations.&lt;ref name=scharfe28&gt;{{cite book|author=Hartmut Scharfe |title=Handbook of Oriental Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7s19sZFRxCUC |year=2002|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-12556-6 |pages=24–29, 226–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many forms of recitation or ''paths'' were designed to aid accuracy in recitation and the transmission of the ''[[Veda]]s'' and other knowledge texts from one generation to the next. All hymns in each Veda were recited in this way; for example, all 1,028 hymns with 10,600 verses of the Rigveda was preserved in this way; as were all other Vedas including the [[Principal Upanishads]], as well as the Vedangas. Each text was recited in a number of ways, to ensure that the different methods of recitation acted as a cross check on the other. Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat summarizes this as follows:&lt;ref name=filliozat-p139/&gt;
* ''Samhita-patha'': continuous recitation of Sanskrit words bound by the phonetic rules of euphonic combination;
* ''Pada-patha'': a recitation marked by a conscious pause after every word, and after any special grammatical codes embedded inside the text; this method suppresses euphonic combination and restores each word in its original intended form;
* ''Krama-patha'': a step-by-step recitation where euphonically-combined words are paired successively and sequentially and then recited; for example, a hymn "word1 word2 word3 word4...", would be recited as "word1word2 word2word3 word3word4 ...."; this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Gargya and Sakarya in the Hindu tradition and mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini (dated to pre-Buddhism period);
* ''Krama-patha'' modified: the same step-by-step recitation as above, but without euphonic-combinations (or free form of each word); this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Babhravya and Galava in the Hindu tradition, and is also mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini;
* ''{{IAST|Jata-pāṭha}}'', ''{{IAST|dhvaja-pāṭha}}'' and ''{{IAST|ghana-pāṭha}}'' are methods of recitation of a text and its oral transmission that developed after 5th century BCE, that is after the start of Buddhism and Jainism; these methods use more complicated rules of combination and were less used.

These extraordinary retention techniques guaranteed an accurate Śruti, fixed across the generations, not just in terms of unaltered word order but also in terms of sound.&lt;ref name=scharfe28/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilke, Annette and Moebus, Oliver.

P. 495. {{ISBN|3110181592}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That these methods have been effective, is testified to by the preservation of the most ancient Indian religious text, the ''[[Rigveda|{{IAST|Ṛgveda}}]]'' ([[circa|ca.]] 1500 BCE).&lt;ref name=filliozat-p139&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat|editor=Karine Chemla|title=History of Science, History of Text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9w13rSxWcsC|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-2321-7|pages=138–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronology===
[[File:Filip Visnjic guslar.jpg|thumb|right|[[Filip Višnjić]] (1767&amp;ndash;1834), [[Serbia]]n blind [[gusle|guslar]]]]
The following overview draws upon ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography'', (NY: Garland Publishing, 1985, 1986, 1989); additional material is summarized from the overlapping prefaces to the following volumes: ''The Theory of Oral Composition: History and Methodology'', (Indiana University Press, 1988, 1992); ''Immanent Art: From Structure to Meaning in Traditional Oral Epic'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991); ''The Singer of Tales in Performance'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1995) and ''Comparative Research on Oral Traditions: A Memorial for Milman Parry'' (Columbus, Ohio: Slavica Publishers, 1987). in the work of the Serb scholar [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] (1787–1864), a contemporary and friend of the [[Brothers Grimm]]. Vuk pursued similar projects of "salvage folklore" (similar to [[rescue archaeology]]) in the [[cognate]] traditions of the Southern [[Slavs|Slavic]] regions which would later be gathered into [[Yugoslavia]], and with the same admixture of [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[nationalistic]] interests (he considered all those speaking the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]] as Serbs). Somewhat later, but as part of the same scholarly enterprise of nationalist studies in folklore,&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/5i/5_radloff.pdf "Early Scholarship on Oral Traditions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529035828/http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/5i/5_radloff.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}: Radloff, Jousse and Murko ''Oral Tradition'' 5:1 (1990) 73-90&lt;/ref&gt; the [[turcology|turcologist]] [[Vasily Radlov]] (1837–1918) would study the songs of the [[Kara-Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast|Kara-Kirghiz]] in what would later become the Soviet Union; Karadzic and Radloff would provide models for the work of Parry.

===Walter Ong===
In a separate development, the [[media theory|media theorist]] [[Marshall McLuhan]] (1911–1980) would begin to focus attention on the ways that [[communication|communicative]] [[Mass media|media]] shape the nature of the content conveyed.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Marshall McLuhan, ''The Gutenberg Galaxy:  The Making of Typographic Man''.  University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; He would serve as mentor to the [[Jesuit]], [[Walter Ong]] (1912–2003), whose interests in [[cultural history]], [[psychology]] and [[rhetoric]] would result in ''Orality and Literacy'' (Methuen, 1980) and the important but less-known ''Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality and Consciousness'' (Cornell, 1981)&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Ong.  ''Fighting for Life:  Context, Sexuality, and Consciousness''.  Cornell University Press, Ithaca &amp; London, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; These two works articulated the contrasts between cultures defined by [[Orality#Primary orality|primary orality]], writing, print, and the [[secondary orality]] of the electronic age.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, pp. 57 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

| I style the morality of a culture totally untouched by any knowledge of writing or print, 'primary orality'.  It is 'primary' by contrast with the 'secondary orality' of present-day high technology culture, in which a new orality is sustained by telephone, radio, television and other electronic devices that depend for their existence and functioning on writing and print.  Today primary culture in the strict sense hardly exists, since every culture knows of writing and has some experience of its effects.  Still, to varying degrees many cultures and sub-cultures, even in a high-technology ambiance, preserve much of the mind-set of primary orality.&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Ong.  ''Orality and Literacy'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Ong's works also made possible an integrated theory of oral tradition which accounted for both production of content (the chief concern of Parry-Lord theory) and its reception.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; This approach, like McLuhan's, kept the field open not just to the study of aesthetic culture but to the way physical and behavioral artifacts of oral societies are used to store, manage and transmit knowledge, so that oral tradition provides methods for investigation of cultural differences, other than the purely verbal, between oral and literate societies.

The most-often studied section of ''Orality and Literacy'' concerns the "[[psychodynamics]] of orality" This chapter seeks to define the fundamental characteristics of 'primary' orality and summarizes a series of descriptors (including but not limited to verbal aspects of culture) which might be used to index the relative orality or literacy of a given text or society.&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Ong.  ''Orality and literacy:  the technologizing of the word'', pp. 31-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Miles Foley===
In advance of Ong's synthesis, [[John Miles Foley]] began a series of papers based on his own fieldwork on South Slavic oral genres, emphasizing the dynamics of performers and audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, p 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Foley effectively consolidated oral tradition as an academic field [http://illumination.missouri.edu/spr05/fol1.htm] when he compiled ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research'' in 1985. The bibliography gives a summary of the progress scholars made in evaluating the oral tradition up to that point, and includes a list of all relevant scholarly articles relating to the theory of [[Oral-Formulaic Composition]]. He also both established both the journal ''Oral Tradition'' and founded the ''Center for Studies in Oral Tradition'' (1986) at the [[University of Missouri]]. Foley developed Oral Theory beyond the somewhat mechanistic notions presented in earlier versions of Oral-Formulaic Theory, by extending Ong's interest in cultural features of oral societies beyond the verbal, by drawing attention to the agency of the [[bard]] and by describing how oral traditions bear meaning.

The bibliography  would establish a clear underlying methodology which accounted for the findings of scholars working in the separate [[Linguistics]] fields (primarily [[Ancient Greek]], Anglo-Saxon and Serbo-Croatian).  Perhaps more importantly, it would stimulate conversation among these specialties, so that a network of independent but allied investigations and investigators could be established.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''Oral Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography''. NY: Garland, 1985. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, pp. 64-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acceptance and further elaboration===
The theory of oral tradition would undergo elaboration and development as it grew in acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. "Oral Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography." NY: Garland, 1985. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; While the number of formulas documented for various traditions proliferated,&lt;ref&gt;A. Orchard, 'Oral Tradition', ''Reading Old English Texts'', ed. K O'Brien O'Keeffe (Cambridge, 1997), pp. 101-23&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of the formula remained lexically-bound. However, numerous innovations appeared, such as the "formulaic system"&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Donald K. "Old English Formulas and Systems" ''English Studies'' 48 (1967):193-204. responds to what was known, pejoratively, in Greek studies as the "hard Parryist" position, in which the formula was defined in terms of verbatim lexical repetition (see Rosenmyer, Thomas G. "The Formula in Early Greek Poetry" ''Arion'' 4 (1965):295-311). Fry's model proposes underlying generative templates which provide for variation and even artistic creativity within the constraints of strict metrical requirements and extempore composition-in-performance&lt;/ref&gt; with structural "substitution slots" for [[syntax|syntactic]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and [[narrative]] necessity (as well as for artistic invention).&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Adam Brooke "Verba volent, scripta manent: Oral Tradition and the Non-Narrative Genres of Old English Poetry."  Diss. Univ. of Missouri at Columbia.  DAI 52A (1991), 2137  pp. 202, 205&lt;/ref&gt; Sophisticated models such as Foley's "word-type placement rules" followed.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. Immanent Art: From Structure to Meaning in Traditional Oral Epic. Bloomington: IUP, 1991. 30, 31, 202n22, 207 n36, 211n43&lt;/ref&gt; Higher levels of formulaic composition were defined over the years, such as "[[ring composition]]",&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. "The Singer of Tales in Performance. Bloomington: IUP, 1995. 55, 60, 89 108, 122n40&lt;/ref&gt; "responsion"&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Alexandra Hennessey. "Oral -Formulaic Research in Old English Studies:II" ''Oral Tradition'' 3:1-2 (1988) 138-90, p. 165) Olsen cites Foley's "Hybrid Prosody and Old English Half-Lines" in ''Neophilologus'' 64:284-89 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; and the "[[type-scene]]" (also called a "theme" or "typical scene"&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Singer of Tales in Performance''. Bloomington: IUP, 1995. 2, 7, 8n15, 17 et passim.&lt;/ref&gt;). Examples include the "Beasts of Battle"&lt;ref&gt;Magoun, Francis P.  "The Oral-Formulaic Character of Anglo-Saxon Narrative Poetry."  ''Speculum'' 28 (1953):  446-67&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Cliffs of Death".&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Donald K. "The Cliff of Death in Old English Poetry." In ''Comparative Research in Oral Traditions:  A Memorial for Milman Parry'', ed. John Miles Foley.  Columbus:  Slavica, 1987, 213-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these characteristic patterns of narrative details, (like "the arming sequence;"&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Zumthor|Zumthor, Paul]] "The Text and the Voice." Transl. Marilyn C. Englehardt. ''New Literary History'' 16 (1984):67-92&lt;/ref&gt; "the hero on the beach";&lt;ref&gt;D. K. Crowne, "The Hero on the Beach: An Example of Composition by Theme in Anglo-Saxon Poetry", ''Neuphilologische Mitteilungen'', 61 (1960), 371.&lt;/ref&gt; "the traveler recognizes his goal")&lt;ref&gt;Clark, George. "The Traveller Recognizes His Goal." ''Journal of English and Germanic Philolog''y, 64 (1965):645-59.&lt;/ref&gt; would show evidence of global distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, James I.  "The Arming Motif in the Iliad".  ''The American Journal of Philology'', Vol. 79, No. 4. (1958), pp. 337-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the fairly rigid division between oral and literate was replaced by recognition of transitional and compartmentalized texts and societies, including models of [[diglossia]] ([[Brian Stock (historian)|Brian Stock]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Stock (historian)|Brian Stock]]. "The Implications of Literacy. Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries" (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz Bäuml]],&lt;ref&gt;Bäuml, Franz H. "Varieties and Consequences of Medieval Literacy and Illiteracy", in ''Speculum'', Vol. 55, No. 2 (1980), pp.243-244.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eric Havelock]]).&lt;ref&gt;Havelock, Eric Alfred. ''Preface to Plato''. "Vol. 1 A History of the Greek Mind", Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts: 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps most importantly, the terms and concepts of "[[orality]]" and "[[literacy]]" came to be replaced with the more useful and apt "[[traditionality]]" and "[[textuality]]".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Davis, Adam Brooke. "Agon and Gnomon: Forms and Functions of the Anglo-Saxon Riddles" in ''De Gustibus: Essays for Alain Renoir''. Ed John Miles Foley. NY: Garland, 1992 110-150&lt;/ref&gt; Very large units would be defined ([[The Indo-European Return Song]])&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''Immanent Art'' Bloomington: IUP, 1991. 15, 18, 20-21, 34, 45, 63-64, 64n6, 64-68,, 74n23, 75, 76, 77n28, 78, 80, 82, 82n38, 83, 87-91, 92, 93, 94, 102, 103, 104n18, 105, 109, 110n32&lt;/ref&gt; and areas outside of [[epic poetry|military epic]] would come under investigation: women's song,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marta Weigle|Weigle, Marta]].

The methodology of oral tradition now conditions a large variety of studies, not only in [[folklore]], [[literature]] and [[literacy]], but in [[philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Robb. "Greek Oral Memory and the Origins of Philosophy." ''The Personalist: An International Review of Philosophy'', 51:5-45.;
A study of the AG oral mentality that assumes (1) the existence of composition and thinking that took shape under the aegis of oral patterns, (2) the educational apparatus as an oral system, and (3) the origins of philosophy as we know it in the abstract intellectual reaction against the oral mentality. The opening section on historical background covers developments in archaeology and textual criticism (including Parry's work) since the late nineteenth century, with descriptions of and comments on formulaic and thematic structure. In "The Technique of the Oral Poet" (14-22), he sketches both a synchronic picture of the singer weaving his narrative and a diachronic view of the tradition developing over time. In the third part, on the psychology of performance, he discusses "the prevalence of rhythmic speech over prose; the prevalence of the event' over the abstraction'; and the prevalence of the paratactic arrangement of parts... over alternative schema possible in other styles" (23). In sympathy with Havelock (1963), he interprets Plato's reaction against the poets as one against the oral mentality and its educative process.&lt;/ref&gt; [[communication theory]],&lt;ref&gt;"Review: Communication Studies as American Studies" Daniel Czitrom  ''American Quarterly'', Vol. 42, No. 4 (Dec., 1990), pp. 678-683&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semiotics]],&lt;ref&gt;Nimis, Stephen A.

This paper has to do with the challenges of globalization in modern Nigeria and the process of "culture education," a terminology used to emphasize the peculiar means and methods of instruction by which a society imparts its body of values and mores in the pursuance and attainment of the society's collective vision, aspirations, and goals. Within this framework, this paper examines the legacies of imperialism and colonization within the Nigerian educational system––particularly in reference to the teaching of folklore and oral tradition––including the destruction of indigenous knowledge systems and the continuing lack of adequate resources in African universities. The paper concludes by offering suggestions for a more fully synthesized indigenous and formal Nigerian educational system as a method of addressing postcolonial rupture.

==Criticism and debates==
The theory of oral tradition encountered early resistance from scholars who perceived it as potentially supporting either one side or another in the controversy between what were known as [[Homeric question|"unitarians" and "analysts"]]&amp;nbsp;– that is, scholars who believed [[Homer]] to have been a single, historical figure, and those who saw him as a conceptual "author function," a convenient name to assign to what was essentially a repertoire of traditional narrative.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick M. Combellack]],  "Milman Parry and Homeric Artistry" ''Comparative Literature'', Vol. 11, No. 3 (Summer, 1959), pp. 193-208 . p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; A much more general dismissal of the theory and its implications simply described it as "unprovable"&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, R.B. Homer: Odyssey Books XIX &amp; XX,, Cambridge UP 1992 remarks on oral-formulaic diction, pp. 47-49&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, mainly outside the field of oral tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Botstein, Leon. "Hearing Is Seeing: Thoughts on the History of Music and the Imagination." ''The Musical Quarterly'' 1995 79(4):581-89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_folklore_research/v043/43.3oring.html Elliot Oring cites Bruchac, Joe Storytelling: Oral History or Game of 'Telephone'?"] ''American Folklore Society Newsletter'' 19/2:3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://christopherbutler.wordpress.com/2006/04/28/scriptural-transmission-inspiration-and-inerrancy/ |title=Christopher Butler cites Bart Ehrman, ‘Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why’ |publisher=Christopherbutler.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105051417/http://christopherbutler.wordpress.com/2006/04/28/scriptural-transmission-inspiration-and-inerrancy/ |archivedate=2012-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valdosta.edu/folkwriting/pdf/chapter4.PDF |title=chapter4.DOC |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213082630/http://www.valdosta.edu/folkwriting/pdf/chapter4.PDF |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; represent (either dismissively or with approval) this body of theoretical work as reducing the great [[Epic poetry|epics]] to children's party games like "[[telephone (game)|telephone]]" or "[[Chinese whispers]]".  While games provide amusement by showing how messages distort content via uncontextualized transmission, Parry's supporters argue that the theory of oral tradition reveals how oral methods optimized the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and thus improved the quality, stability and [[integrity]] of content transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard. ''The God Delusion''. Great Britain: Bantam, 2006 p. 118 -- Dawkins contradicts this view, however, on p. 227)&lt;/ref&gt;

There were disputes concerning particular findings of the theory. For example, those trying to support or refute Crowne's hypothesis found the "Hero on the Beach" formula in numerous Old English poems. Similarly, it was also discovered in other works of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] origin, [[Middle English poetry]], and even an [[Iceland]]ic prose [[saga]]. J.A. Dane, in an article&lt;ref&gt;Dane, J.A. "Finnsburh and Iliad IX: A Greek Survival of the Medieval Germanic Oral-Formulaic Theme  The Hero on the Beach." ''Neophilologus'' 66:443-449&lt;/ref&gt; characterized as "polemics without rigor"&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography'', (NY: Garland Publishing, 1985), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the appearance of the theme in [[Ancient Greek]] poetry, a tradition without known connection to the Germanic, invalidated the notion of "an autonomous theme in the baggage of an oral poet."

Within Homeric studies specifically, Lord's ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'', which focused on problems and questions that arise in conjunction with applying oral-formulaic theory to problematic texts such as the ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[Odyssey]]'', and even ''[[Beowulf]]'', influenced nearly all of the articles written on [[Homer]] and oral-formulaic composition thereafter. However, in response to Lord, Geoffrey Kirk published ''The Songs of Homer'', questioning Lord's extension of the oral-formulaic nature of Serbian and Croatian literature (the area from which the theory was first developed) to Homeric epic. Kirk argues that Homeric poems differ from those traditions in their "metrical strictness", "formular system[s]", and creativity. In other words, Kirk argued that Homeric poems were recited under a system that gave the reciter much more freedom to choose words and passages to get to the same end than the Serbo-Croatian poet, who was merely "reproductive".&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Geoffrey S. ''The Songs of Homer.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962. pp88 - 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Eric Havelock's ''Preface to Plato'' revolutionized how scholars looked at Homeric epic by arguing not only that it was the product of an oral tradition, but also that the oral-formulas contained therein served as a way for ancient Greeks to preserve cultural knowledge across many different generations.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Parry]], in his 1966 work "Have we Homer's ''Iliad''?", theorized the existence of the most fully developed oral poet to his time, a person who could (at his discretion) creatively and intellectually create nuanced characters in the context of the accepted, traditional story. In fact, he discounted the Serbo-Croatian tradition to an "unfortunate" extent, choosing to elevate the Greek model of oral-tradition above all others.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. pp. 36, 505.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Adam. "Have we Homer's ''Iliad''?"''Yale Classical Studies.''20 (1966), pp.. 177-216.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord reacted to Kirk's and Parry's essays with "Homer as Oral Poet", published in 1968, which reaffirmed Lord's belief in the relevance of Yugoslav poetry and its similarities to Homer and downplayed the intellectual and literary role of the reciters of Homeric epic.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. pp. 40, 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the criticisms of the theory have been absorbed into the evolving field as useful refinements and modifications. For example, in what Foley called a "pivotal" contribution, [[Larry Benson]] introduced the concept of "written-formulaic" to describe the status of some Anglo-Saxon poetry which, while demonstrably written, contains evidence of oral influences, including heavy reliance on formulas and themes&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography''. New York: Garland Publishing, Inc. 1985. p. 42.; Foley cites "The Literary Character of Anglo-Saxon Formulaic Poetry" Publications of the Modern Language Association 81 (1966):, 334-41&lt;/ref&gt; A number of individual scholars in many areas continue to have misgivings about the applicability of the theory or the aptness of the South Slavic comparison,&lt;ref&gt;George E. Dimock. "From Homer to Novi Pazar and B ack." ''Arion'', 2, iv:40-57. Reacts against the Parry-Lord hypothesis of an oral Homer, claiming that, although Lord demonstrated that the oral poet thinks in verse and offered many explanations of the various facets of the Homeric Question by recourse to the Yugoslav analogy, the difference between Homer and other, literate poets is one of degree rather than kind. Wants to rescue Homer's art from what he sees as the dangers inherent in the oral theory model.&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly what they regard as its implications for the creativity which may legitimately be attributed to the individual artist.&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps the most prominent and steadfast opponent of oral traditional theory on these grounds was [[Arthur Brodeur]], in, e.g., ''The Art of Beowulf''. Berkeley: University of California Press. 3rd printing 1969; "A Study of Diction and Style in Three Anglo-Saxon Narrative Poems." In ''Nordica et Anglica''. Ed. Allan H. Orrick. The Hague: Mouton. pp. 97-114; "Beowulf: One Poem or Three?" In ''Medieval Literature and Folklore Studies in Honor of Francis Lee Utley''. Ed. Jerome Mandel and Bruce A. Rosenberg. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press. pp. 3-26.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at present, there seems to be little systematic or theoretically coordinated challenge to the fundamental tenets of the theory; as Foley put it, ""there have been numerous suggestions for revisions or modifications of the theory, but the majority of controversies have generated further understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Theory of Oral Composition: History and Methodology''. Bloomington:IUP, 1988." p.93&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pattern language''' is a method of describing good design practices or patterns of useful organization within a field of expertise. The term was coined by architect [[Christopher Alexander]] and popularized by his 1977 book ''[[A Pattern Language]]''.

A pattern language can also be an attempt to express the deeper wisdom of what brings aliveness within a particular field of human endeavor, through a set of interconnected patterns. Aliveness is one placeholder term for "the quality that has no name": a sense of wholeness, spirit, or grace, that while of varying form, is precise and empirically verifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alexander |first1=Christopher |title=The Timeless Way of Building |date=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-502402-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some advocates{{who|date=March 2016}} of this design approach claim that ordinary people can use it to successfully solve very large, complex design problems.

==What is a pattern?==
{{See also|Design pattern}}
When a designer designs something – whether a house, computer program, or lamp – they must make many decisions about how to solve problems. A single problem is documented with its typical place (the [[syntax]]), and use (the [[grammar]]) with the most common and recognized good solution seen in the wild, like the examples seen in [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. Each such entry is a single [[design pattern]]. Each pattern has a name, a descriptive entry, and some cross-references, much like a dictionary entry. A documented pattern should explain why that solution is good in the pattern's contexts.

Elemental or universal ''patterns'' such as "door" or "partnership" are versatile ideals of design, either as found in experience or for use as components in practice, explicitly described as holistic resolutions of the forces in recurrent contexts and circumstances, whether in architecture, medicine, software development or governance, etc. Patterns might be invented or found and studied, such as the naturally occurring patterns of design that characterize human environments.&lt;ref&gt;Henshaw, J. [http://www.synapse9.com/pub/2015_PURPLSOC-JLHfinalpub.pdf Guiding Patterns of Naturally Occurring Design: Elements. PURPLSOC 2015 proceedings, July 3-5 2015 Krems, Austria] PURPLSOC meeting on the many open scientific questions, e.g. regarding the theoretical background of patterns and the practical implementation of pattern methods in research and teaching.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all languages, a pattern language has [[vocabulary]], [[syntax]], and [[grammar]] – but a pattern language applies to some complex activity other than communication. In pattern languages for design, the parts break down in this way:
* The language description – the ''vocabulary'' – is a collection of named, described solutions to problems in a field of interest. These are called ''design patterns''. So, for example, the language for architecture describes items like: settlements, buildings, rooms, windows, latches, etc.
* Each solution includes ''syntax'', a description that shows where the solution fits in a larger, more comprehensive or more abstract design. This automatically links the solution into a web of other needed solutions. For example, rooms have ways to get light, and ways to get people in and out.
* The solution includes ''grammar'' that describes how the solution solves a problem or produces a benefit. So, if the benefit is unneeded, the solution is not used. Perhaps that part of the design can be left empty to save money or other resources; if people do not need to wait to enter a room, a simple doorway can replace a waiting room.
* In the language description, grammar and syntax cross index (often with a literal alphabetic index of pattern names) to other named solutions, so the designer can quickly think from one solution to related, needed solutions, and document them in a logical way. In Christopher Alexander's book ''A Pattern Language'', the patterns are in decreasing order by size, with a separate alphabetic index.
* The web of relationships in the index of the language provides many paths through the design process.

This simplifies the design work because designers can start the process from any part of the problem they understand and work toward the unknown parts. At the same time, if the pattern language has worked well for many projects, there is reason to believe that even a designer who does not completely understand the design problem at first will complete the design process, and the result will be usable. For example, skiers coming inside must shed snow and store equipment. The messy snow and boot cleaners should stay outside. The equipment needs care, so the racks should be inside.

==Many patterns form a language==
Just as [[words]] must have [[Grammar|grammatical]] and [[Semantics|semantic]] relationships to each other in order to make a spoken [[language]] useful, design patterns must be related to each other in position and utility order to form a pattern language. Christopher Alexander's work describes a process of decomposition, in which the designer has a problem (perhaps a commercial assignment), selects a solution, then discovers new, smaller problems resulting from the larger solution. Occasionally, the smaller problems have no solution, and a different larger solution must be selected. Eventually all of the remaining design problems are small enough or routine enough to be solved by improvisation by the builders, and the "design" is done.

The actual organizational structure ([[Hierarchy|hierarchical]], [[Iterative method|iterative]], etc.) is left to the discretion of the designer, depending on the problem. This explicitly lets a designer explore a design, starting from some small part. When this happens, it's common for a designer to realize that the problem is actually part of a larger solution. At this point, the design almost always becomes a better design.

In the language, therefore, each pattern has to indicate its relationships to other patterns and to the language as a whole. This gives the designer using the language a great deal of guidance about the related problems that must be solved.

The most difficult part of having an outside expert apply a pattern language is in fact to get a reliable, complete list of the problems to be solved. Of course, the people most familiar with the problems are the people that need a design. So, Alexander famously advocated on-site improvisation by concerned, empowered users,&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Christopher, The Oregon Project&lt;/ref&gt; as a powerful way to form very workable large-scale initial solutions, maximizing the utility of a design, and minimizing the design rework. The desire to empower users of architecture was, in fact, what led Alexander to undertake a pattern language project for architecture in the first place.

==Design problems in a context==
An important aspect of design patterns is to identify and document the key ideas that make a good system different from a poor system (that may be a house, a computer program or an object of daily use), and to assist in the design of future systems. The idea expressed in a pattern should be general enough to be applied in very different systems within its context, but still specific enough to give constructive guidance.

The range of situations in which the problems and solutions addressed in a pattern apply is called its context. An important part in each pattern is to describe this context. Examples can further illustrate how the pattern applies to very different situation.

For instance, Alexander's pattern "A PLACE TO WAIT" addresses bus stops in the same way as waiting rooms in a surgery, while still proposing helpful and constructive solutions. The [[Design Patterns|"Gang-of-Four" book ''Design Patterns'']] by Gamma et al. proposes solutions that are independent of the programming language, and the program's application domain.

Still, the problems and solutions described in a pattern can vary in their level of abstraction and generality on the one side, and specificity on the other side. In the end this depends on the author's preferences. However, even a very abstract pattern will usually contain examples that are, by nature, absolutely concrete and specific.

Patterns can also vary in how far they are proven in the real world. Alexander gives each pattern a rating by zero, one or two stars, indicating how well they are proven in real-world examples. It is generally claimed that all patterns need at least some existing real-world examples. It is, however, conceivable to document yet unimplemented ideas in a pattern-like format.

The patterns in Alexander's book also vary in their level of scale – some describing how to build a town or neighbourhood, others dealing with individual buildings and the interior of rooms. Alexander sees the low-scale artifacts as constructive elements of the large-scale world, so they can be connected to a [[#Aggregation in an associative network (pattern language)|hierarchic network]].

===Balancing of forces===
A pattern must characterize the problems that it is meant to solve, the context or situation where these problems arise, and the conditions under which the proposed solutions can be recommended.

Often these problems arise from a conflict of different interests or "forces". A pattern emerges as a dialogue that will then help to balance the forces and finally make a decision.

For instance, there could be a pattern suggesting a wireless telephone. The forces would be the need to communicate, and the need to get other things done at the same time (cooking, inspecting the bookshelf). A very specific pattern would be just "WIRELESS TELEPHONE". More general patterns would be "WIRELESS DEVICE" or "SECONDARY ACTIVITY", suggesting that a secondary activity (such as talking on the phone, or inspecting the pockets of your jeans) should not interfere with other activities.

Though quite unspecific in its context, the forces in the "SECONDARY ACTIVITY" pattern are very similar to those in "WIRELESS TELEPHONE". Thus, the competing forces can be seen as part of the essence of a design concept expressed in a pattern.

===Patterns contain their own rationale===
Usually a pattern contains a rationale referring to some given values. For Christopher Alexander, it is most important to think about the people who will come in contact with a piece of architecture. One of his key values is making these people feel more alive. He talks about the "quality without a name" (QWAN).

More generally, we could say that a good system should be accepted, welcomed and happily embraced as an enrichment of daily life by those who are meant to use it, or – even better – by all people it affects. For instance, when discussing a street café, Alexander discusses the possible desires of a guest, but also mentions people who just walk by.

The same thinking can be applied to technical devices such as telephones and cars, to social structures like a team working on a project, or to the user interface of a computer program. The qualities of a software system, for instance, could be rated by observing whether users spend their time enjoying or struggling with the system.

By focusing on the impacts on human life, we can identify patterns that are independent from changing technology, and thus find "timeless quality" (Alexander).

==Generic structure and layout==
Usually the author of a pattern language or collection chooses a generic structure for all the patterns it contains, breaking each into generic sections like context, problem statement, solution etc.

Christopher Alexander's patterns, for instance, each consist of a short name, a rating (up to two '*' symbols), a sensitizing picture, the context description, the problem statement, a longer part of text with examples and explanations, a solution statement, a sketch and further references. This structure and layout is sometimes referred to as the "Alexandrian form".

Alexander uses a special text layout to mark the different sections of his patterns. For instance, the problem statement and the solution statement are printed in bold font, the latter is always preceded by the "Therefore:" keyword. Some authors instead use explicit labels, which creates some degree of redundancy.

===Meaningful names===
When design is done by a team, pattern names will form a vocabulary they can share. This makes it necessary for pattern names to be easy to remember and highly descriptive. Some examples from Alexander's works are WINDOW PLACE (helps define where windows should go in a room) and A PLACE TO WAIT (helps define the characteristics of bus stops and hospital waiting rooms, for example).

==Aggregation in an associative network (pattern language)==
A pattern language, as conceived by Alexander, contains links from one pattern to another, so when trying to apply one pattern in a project, a designer is pushed to other patterns that are considered helpful in its context.

In Alexander's book, such links are collected in the "references" part, and echoed in the linked pattern's "context" part – thus the overall structure is a directed graph. A pattern that is linked to in the "references" usually addresses a problem of lower scale, that is suggested as a part of the higher-scale problem. For instance, the "PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM" pattern has a reference to "STAIR SEATS".

Even without the pattern description, these links, along with meaningful names, carry a message: When building a place outside where people can spend time ("PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM"), consider to surround it by stairs where people can sit ("STAIR SEATS"). If you are planning an office ("WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES"), consider to arrange workspaces in small groups ("SMALL WORKING GROUPS"). Alexander argues that the connections in the network can be considered even more meaningful than the text of the patterns themselves.

The links in Alexander's book clearly result in a hierarchic network. Alexander draws a parallel to the hierarchy of a grammar – that is one argument for him to speak of a pattern ''language''.

The idea of linking is generally accepted among pattern authors, though the semantic rationale behind the links may vary. Some authors, however, like Gamma et al. in ''[[Design Patterns]]'', make only little use of pattern linking – possibly because it did not make that much sense for their collection of patterns. In such a case we would speak of a ''pattern catalogue'' rather than a ''pattern language''.&lt;ref name="dearden"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andy Dearden, Janet Finlay | title = Pattern Languages in HCI: A critical review | date = January 2006 | journal = Human Computer Interaction | volume = 21 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
Alexander encouraged people who used his system to expand his language with patterns of their own. In order to enable this, his books do not focus strictly on architecture or civil engineering; he also explains the general method of pattern languages. The original concept for the book ''A Pattern Language'' was that it would be published in the form of a 3-ring binder, so that pages could easily be added later; this proved impractical in publishing.&lt;ref&gt;Portland Urban Architecture Research Laboratory
Symposium 2009, presentation by 4 of 6 original authors of ''A Pattern Language''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pattern language approach has been used to document expertise in diverse fields. Some examples are [[Design pattern (architecture)|architectural patterns]], [[Design pattern (computer science)|computer science patterns]], [[interaction design pattern]]s, [[pedagogical patterns]],  social action patterns, and group facilitation patterns. The pattern language approach has also been recommended as a way to promote [[civic intelligence]] by helping to coordinate actions for diverse people and communities who are working together on significant shared problems.&lt;ref&gt;For additional discussion of motivation and rationale as well as examples and experiments, see: {{cite web |last=Schuler |first=Douglas |url=http://publicsphereproject.org/sites/default/files/Critical%20Enablers%20of%20Civic%20Intelligence.reduced.pdf |title=Choosing success: pattern languages as critical enablers of civic intelligence |publisher=Portland Urban Architecture Research Laboratory Conference, Portland, OR, 2009 |website=publicsphereproject.org |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's specifications for using pattern languages as well as creating new ones remain influential, and his books are referenced for style by experts in unrelated fields.

It is important to note that notations such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] or the [[flowchart]] symbol collection are not pattern languages. They could more closely be compared to an alphabet: their symbols could be used to document a pattern language, but they are not a language by themselves. A [[recipe]] or other sequential set of steps to be followed, with only one correct path from start to finish, is also not a pattern language. However, the process of designing a new recipe might benefit from the use of a pattern language.

===Simple example of a pattern===
*''Name'': ChocolateChipRatio
*''Context'': You are baking chocolate chip cookies in small batches for family and friends
*''Consider these patterns first'': SugarRatio, FlourRatio, EggRatio
*''Problem'': Determine the optimum ratio of chocolate chips to cookie dough
*''Solution'': Observe that most people consider chocolate to be the best part of the chocolate chip cookie. Also observe that too much chocolate may prevent the cookie from holding together, decreasing its appeal. Since you are cooking in small batches, cost is not a consideration. Therefore, use the maximum amount of chocolate chips that results in a really sturdy cookie.
*''Consider next'': NutRatio or CookingTime or FreezingMethod

==Origin==
[[Christopher Alexander]], an architect and author, coined the term pattern language.&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]], USA | isbn = 0-19-501919-9 | last = Alexander | first = Christopher | title = A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction | year = 1977 | page = 1216}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used it to refer to common problems of the [[design]] and [[construction]] of buildings and towns and how they should be solved. The solutions proposed in the book include suggestions ranging from how cities and towns should be structured to where windows should be placed in a room.

The framework and philosophy of the "pattern language" approach was initially popularized in the book ''[[A Pattern Language]]'' that was written by Christopher Alexander and five colleagues at the Center for Environmental Structure in Berkeley, California in the late 1970s. While ''A Pattern Language'' contains 253 "patterns" from the first pattern, "Independent Regions" (the most general) to the last, "Things from Your Life", Alexander's book ''[[The Timeless Way of Building]]'' goes into more depth about the motivation and purpose of the work. The following definitions of "pattern" and "pattern language" are paraphrased from ''A Pattern Language''&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"/&gt;:

"A ''pattern'' is a careful description of a perennial solution to a recurring problem within a building context, describing one of the configurations that brings life to a building. Each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use the solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"/&gt;

A ''pattern language'' is a network of patterns that call upon one another. Patterns help us remember insights and knowledge about design and can be used in combination to create solutions.

== Application domains ==
Christopher Alexander's idea has been adopted in other disciplines, often much more heavily than the original [[Pattern (architecture)|application of patterns to architecture]] as depicted in the book ''[[A Pattern Language]]''.&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"/&gt; Recent examples include [[software design pattern]]s in software engineering and, more generally, [[Architectural pattern (computer science)|architectural patterns in computer science]], as well as [[interaction design pattern]]s. [[Pedagogical patterns]] are used to document good practices in teaching. The book ''Liberating Voices: A Pattern Language for Communication Revolution'', containing 136 patterns for using information and communication to promote sustainability, democracy and positive social change, was published in 2008 along with a website containing even more patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicsphereproject.org/patterns/ |title=Liberating Voices Pattern Language |website=publicsphereproject.org |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deck "Group Works: A Pattern Language for Bringing Life to Meetings and Other Gatherings" was published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://groupworksdeck.org/ |title=Group Pattern Language Project |website=groupworksdeck.org |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, patterns were also introduced into [[systems architecture]] design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hein|first=Andreas|title=Adopting Patterns for Space Mission and Space Systems Architecting|url=https://www.academia.edu/2110976/A.M._Hein_Adopting_Patterns_for_Space_Mission_and._Space_Systems_Architecting_|work=5 th International Workshop on System &amp; Concurrent Engineering for Space ApplicationsSECESA 2012|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hein|first=Andreas|title=Project Icarus: Stakeholder Scenarios for an Interstellar Exploration Program|url=https://www.academia.edu/1354848/PROJECT_ICARUS_STAKEHOLDER_SCENARIOS_FOR_AN_INTERSTELLAR_EXPLORATION_PROGRAM|work=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, 64, 224-233, 2011|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cloutier|first=Robert|title=The Concept of Reference Architectures|url=http://www.calimar.com/TheConceptOfReferenceArchitectures.pdf|work=Systems Engineering Vol. 13, No. 1, 2010|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chess]] [[Chess strategy|strategy]] and [[Chess tactics|tactics]] involve many patterns from [[Chess opening|opening]] to [[checkmate]].

[[Ward Cunningham]], the inventor of [[wiki]], coauthored a paper with [[Michael Mehaffy]] arguing that there are deep relationships between wikis and pattern languages, and that wikis "were in fact developed as tools to facilitate efficient sharing and modifying of patterns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cunningham |first1=Ward |authorlink1=Ward Cunningham |last2=Mehaffy |first2=Michael W. |authorlink2=Michael Mehaffy |date=2013 |chapter=Wiki as pattern language |title=Proceedings of the 20th Conference on [[Pattern Languages of Programs]], October 23–26, 2013, Monticello, Illinois |series=PLoP '13 |location=Corryton, TN |publisher=[[The Hillside Group]] |pages=32:1–32:14 |isbn=9781941652008 |chapterurl=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2725669.2725707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Performativity''' is [[language]] which effects change in the world and functions as a form of social action.&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavanaugh|first1=Jillian R.|title=Performativity|journal=Anthropology|date=10 March 2015|doi=10.1093/OBO/9780199766567-0114|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0114.xml|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has multiple applications in diverse fields, such as [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], [[jurisprudence|law]], [[gender studies]], [[performance studies]], and [[economics]].

Performativity was first defined by [[philosopher of language]] [[J. L. Austin|John L. Austin]] as the capacity of speech and communication to act or to consummate an action. Common examples of performative language are making promises, betting, performing a wedding ceremony, an umpire calling a strike, or a judge pronouncing a verdict. Austin differentiated this from constative language, which he defined as descriptive language that can be "evaluated as true or false".&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh/&gt;

Influenced by Austin, philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] argued that [[social construction of gender|gender is socially constructed]] through commonplace [[speech act]]s and [[nonverbal communication]] that are performative, in that they serve to define and maintain [[social identity|identities]].&lt;ref name="Butler1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of performativity reverses the idea that a person's identity is the source of their secondary actions (speech, gestures). Instead, it views actions, behaviors and gestures as both the result of an individual's identity as well as a source that contributes to the formation of one's identity which is continuously being redefined through speech acts and symbolic communication.&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh/&gt; This view was also influenced by philosophers such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Studies and Discourse Analysis – Barker &amp; Galasinski&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===J. L. Austin===

The term derives from the founding work in [[speech act]] theory by ordinary language philosopher [[J. L. Austin]], who did not use the word "performativity", but did, beginning in the 1950s, give the name [[performative utterances]] to situations where saying something was doing something, rather than simply reporting on or describing reality. The paradigmatic case here is speaking the words "I do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=J L|title=How To Do Things With Words|year=1962|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking with [[analytic philosophy]], Austin argued in ''[[How to Do Things With Words]]'' that a "performative utterance" cannot be said to be either true or false, as a constative utterance might be. It can only be judged either "happy" or "infelicitous", depending upon whether the conditions required for its success have been met. In this sense, performativity is a function of the [[pragmatics]] of language. Having shown that ''all'' utterances perform actions, even apparently constative ones, Austin famously discarded the distinction between "performative" and "constative" utterances halfway through the lecture series that became the book and replaced it with a three-level framework:

* ''locution'' (the actual words spoken, that which the linguists and linguistic philosophers of the day were mostly interested in analyzing) 
* ''illocutionary force'' (what the speaker is attempting to do ''in'' uttering the locution) 
* ''perlocutionary effect'' (the actual effect the speaker actually has on the interlocutor ''by'' uttering the locution)

For example, if a speech act is an attempt to distract someone, the illocutionary force is the attempt to distract and the perlocutionary effect is the actual distraction caused by the speech act in the interlocutor.

Austin's account of performativity has been subject to extensive discussion in philosophy, literature, and beyond. [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Shoshana Felman]], [[Judith Butler]], and [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] are among the scholars who have elaborated upon and contested aspects of Austin's account from the vantage point of [[deconstruction]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[feminism]], and [[queer theory]]. Particularly in the work of feminists and queer theorists, performativity has played an important role in discussions of [[social change]] (Oliver 2003).

The concept of performativity has also been used in [[science and technology studies]] and in [[economic sociology]]. [[Andrew Pickering]] has proposed to shift from a "representational idiom" to a "performative idiom" in the study of science. [[Michel Callon]] has proposed to study the performative aspects of [[economics]], i.e. the extent to which economic science plays an important role not only in describing markets and economies, but also in framing them. Karen Barad has argued that science and technology studies deemphasize the performativity of language in order to explore the performativity of matter (Barad 2003).

Other uses of the notion of performativity in the social sciences include the daily behavior (or performance) of individuals based on social norms or habits. Philosopher and feminist theorist [[Judith Butler]] has used the concept of performativity in her analysis of [[gender]] development, as well as in her analysis of political speech. [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] describes [[Queer theory|queer]] performativity as an ongoing project for transforming the way we may define—and break—boundaries to identity. Through her suggestion that shame is a potentially performative and transformational emotion, Sedgwick has also linked queer performativity to [[affect theory]]. Also innovative in Sedgwick's discussion of the performative is what she calls ''periperformativity'' (2003: 67–91), which is effectively the group contribution to the success or failure of a speech act.

===John Searle's reformulation===
In ''[[A Taxonomy of Illocutionary Acts]]'', [[John Searle]] takes up and reformulates the ideas of his colleague [[J. L. Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Searle largely supports and agrees with Austin’s theory of speech acts, he has a number of critiques, which he outlines: “In sum, there are (at least) six related difficulties with Austin’s taxonomy; in ascending order of importance: there is a persistent confusion between verbs and acts, not all the verbs are illocutionary verbs, there is too much overlap of the categories, too much heterogeneity within the categories, many of the verbs listed in the categories don't satisfy the definition given for the category and, most important, there is no consistent principle of classification.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last key departure from Austin lies in Searle’s claim that four of his universal ‘acts’ do not need ‘extra-linguistic’ contexts to succeed.&lt;ref name="John1979"&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to Austin who thinks all illocutionary acts need extra-linguistic institutions, Searle disregards the necessity of context and replaces it with the “rules of language.”&lt;ref name="John1979" /&gt;

=== Jacques Derrida ===
Philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] drew on Austin's theory of performative speech act while deconstructing its logocentric and phonocentric premises and reinscribing it within the operations of generalized writing. In contrast to structuralism's focus on linguistic form, Austin had introduced the ''force'' of speech acts, which Derrida aligns with [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] insights on language. 

In "Signature, Event, Context," Derrida focused on Austin's privileging of speech and the accompanying presumptions of the presence of a speaker ("signature") and the bounding of a performative's force by an act or a context. In a passage that would become a touchstone of poststructuralist thought, Derrida stresses the citationality or iterability of any and all signs.&lt;blockquote&gt;Every sign, linguistic or nonlinguistic, spoken or written (in the current sense of this opposition), in a small or large unit, can be ''cited'', put between quotation marks; in doing so it can break with every given context, engendering an infinity of new contexts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable. This does not imply that the mark is valid outside of a context, but on the contrary that there are only contexts without any center or absolute anchorage [''ancrage'']. This citationality, this duplication or duplicity, this iterability of the mark is neither an accident nor an anomaly, it is that (normal/abnormal) without which a mark could not even have a function called "normal." What would a mark be that could not be cited? Or one whose origins would not get lost along the way?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Limited, Inc.|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0810107885|location=Evanston|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Derrida's stress on the citational dimension of performativity would be taken up by Judith Butler and other theorists. While he addressed the performativity of individual subject formation, Derrida also raised such questions as whether we can mark when the event of the Russian revolution went awry, thus scaling up the field of performativity to historical dimensions. 

=== Judith Butler ===
{{Main|Gender performativity}}

Philosopher and [[feminist]] theorist [[Judith Butler]] offered a new, more [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] (specifically, [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]]) reading of the notion of performativity, which has its roots in [[linguistics]] and [[philosophy of language]]. She describes performativity as “that reiterative power of discourse to produce the phenomena that it regulates and constrains.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bodies that Matter:  On the Discursive Limits of "Sex"|last = Butler|first = Judith|publisher = Routledge|year = 1993|isbn = 9780415903660|location = New York|pages = xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has largely used this concept in her analysis of [[gender]] development.&lt;ref&gt;This idea was first introduced in 1988 in an issue of ''[[Theatre Journal]]'' (Brickell, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept places emphasis on the manners by which identity is passed or brought to life through discourse.  Performative acts are types of authoritative speech. This can only happen and be enforced through the law or norms of the society. These statements, just by speaking them, carry out a certain action and exhibit a certain level of power. Examples of these types of statements are declarations of ownership, baptisms, inaugurations, and legal sentences. Something that is key to performativity is repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halberstam|first=Jack|title=An audio overview of queer theory in English and Turkish by Jack Halberstam|url=https://archive.org/details/HalberstamQueerTheory-AnkaraTurkey|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statements are not singular in nature or use and must be used consistently in order to exert power (Hall 2000).

==== Performance theory and gender perspectives ====

Butler sees gender as an act that has been rehearsed, much like a script, and that people, as actors who make a script a reality through repetition, come to perform in the mode of belief. “For Butler, the distinction between the personal and the political or between private and public is itself a fiction designed to support an oppressive status quo: our most personal acts are, in fact, continually being scripted by hegemonic social conventions and ideologies” (Felluga, 2006).  Butler sees gender not as an expression of what one is, rather as something that one does.  Furthermore, she sees it not as a social imposition on a gender neutral body, but rather as a mode of "self-making" through which subjects become socially intelligible.  According to Butler’s theory, homosexuality and heterosexuality are not fixed categories.  A person is merely in a condition of “doing straightness” or “doing queerness” (Lloyd, 1999).

==== Theoretical criticisms ====

There are several criticisms that have been raised against Butler's concept of performativity.  The first is that the theory is individual in nature and does not take other factors into consideration.  These factors include the space within which the performance occurs, the others involved and how they might see or interpret what they witness.  Also, the unplanned effects of the performance act are overlooked and the contingencies are not taken into consideration. (Lloyd, 1999)

Another criticism is that Butler is not clear about the concept of subject.  It has been said that in her writings, sometimes the subject only exists tentatively, sometimes they possess a “real” existence and other times are socially active.  Also, some observe that the theory might be better suited to literary analysis as opposed to social theory. (Brickell, 2005)

Others criticize Butler for taking [[Ethnomethodology|ethnomethodological]] and [[Symbolic interactionism|symbolic interactionist]] sociological analyses of gender and merely reinventing them in the concept of performativity (Dunn 1997; Green 2007).  For example, Green (2007) argues that the work of [[Sue Kessler|Kessler]] and [[Wendy McKenna|McKenna]] (1978) and West and Zimmerman (1987) builds directly from [[Harold Garfinkel|Garfinkel]] (1967) and [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] (1959) to deconstruct gender into moments of attribution and iteration in a continual social process of "doing" [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]] in the [[performative interval]].  These latter works are premised on the notion that gender does not precede but, rather, follows from practice, instantiated in micro-interaction. Butler downgrades gender's constructed nature to fight for oppressed identities.

=== Jean-François Lyotard ===
In ''[[The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge]]'' (1979, English translation 1986), philosopher and cultural theorist [[Jean-François Lyotard]] defined performativity as the defining mode of [[legitimation]] of postmodern knowledge and social bonds, that is, power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge.|last=Lyotard|first=Jean-Francois|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0816611737|location=Minneapolis|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the legitimation of modern knowledge through such grand narratives as Progress, Revolution, and Liberation, performativity operates by system optimization or the calculation of input and outputs. In a footnote, Lyotard aligns performativity with Austin's concept of performative speech act. Postmodern knowledge must not only report: it must do something and do it efficiently by maximizing input/output ratios.

Lyotard uses [[Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics|Wittgenstein's]] notion of language games to theorize how performativity governs the articulation, funding, and conduct of contemporary research and education, arguing that at bottom it involves the threat of terror: "be operational (that is commensurable) or disappear" (xxiv). While Lyotard is highly critical of performativity, he notes that it calls on researchers to explain not only the worth of their work but also the worth of that worth. 

Lyotard associated performativity with the rise of digital computers in the post-World War II period. In ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945,'' historian [[Tony Judt]] cites Lyotard to argue that the Left has largely abandoned revolutionary politics for human rights advocacy. The widespread adoption of performance reviews, organizational assessments, and learning outcomes by different social institutions worldwide has led social researchers to theorize "audit culture" and "global performativity." 

Against performativity and [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]]' call for consensus, Lyotard argued for legitimation by ''paralogy'', or the destabilizing, often paradoxical, introduction of difference into language games.

==Other applications==

===Video art===

Theories of performativity have extended across multiple disciplines and discussions. Notably, interdisciplinary theorist [[José Esteban Muñoz]] has related video to theories of performativity. Specifically, Muñoz looks at the 1996 documentary by Susana Aiken and Carlos Aparicio, "The Transformation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics|author = Muñoz|authorlink = José Esteban Muñoz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historically and theoretically related to performance art, [[video art]] is not an immediate performance; it is mediated, iterative and citational. In this way, video art raises questions of performativity. Additionally, video art frequently puts bodies and display, complicating borders, surfaces, embodiment, and boundaries and so indexing performativity.

=== Finance and economics ===
In economics, the “performativity thesis” is the claim that the assumptions and models used by professionals and popularizers affect the phenomena they purport to describe; bringing the world more into line with theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://kieranhealy.org/files/drafts/performativity.pdf|title = The Performativity of Networks|last = Healy|first = Kieran|date = 2015|journal = European Journal of Sociology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doing"&gt;{{cite book|title=Doing Economics|date=2010|publisher=The Open University|location=Milton Keynes|isbn=978 1 8487 34692|page=493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is debated in ''Do Economists Make Markets'' edited by [[Donald Angus MacKenzie]], Fabian Muniesa and Lucia Siu, and in ''Enacting Dismal Science'' edited by Ivan Boldyrev and Ekaterina Svetlova. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8442.html | title=Do Economists Make Markets?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.palgrave.com/de/book/9781137492104# | title=Enacting Dismal Science - New Perspectives on the Performativity of Economics &amp;#124; Ivan Boldyrev &amp;#124; Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journalism ===

The German news anchorman [[Hanns Joachim Friedrichs]] once argued that a good journalist should never act in collusion with anything, not even with a good thing. In the evening of November 9, 1989, the evening of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], however, Friedrichs reportedly broke his own rule when he announced: "The gates of the wall are wide open." („Die Tore in der Mauer stehen weit offen.“) In reality, the gates were still closed. According to a historian, it was this announcement that encouraged thousands of East Berliners to march towards the wall, finally forcing the border guards to open the gates. In the sense of performativity, Friedrichs's words became a reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/tv/mauerfall/der-schoenste-fehler-in-40-jahren-tagesthemen-54357108.bild.html | title=Zum Jubiläum - der schönste Fehler in 40 Jahren "Tagesthemen"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/30/AR2009103001846.html | title=Mary Elise Sarotte -- How an accident caused the Berlin Wall to come down| date=November 2009| last1=Sarotte| first1=Mary Elise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public humanities''' is the work of engaging diverse publics in reflecting on heritage, traditions, and history, and the relevance of the [[humanities]] to the current conditions of civic and cultural life. Public humanities is often practiced within federal, state, [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] and community-based cultural organizations that engage people in conversations, facilitate and present lectures, exhibitions, performances and other programs for the general public on topics such as history, philosophy, popular culture and the arts. 

Workers within the public humanities endeavor to create physical and virtual spaces where the public can engage in conversation, learning and reflection about issues and ideas.  Public humanities projects include exhibitions and programming related to historic preservation, oral history, archives, material culture, public art, cultural heritage, and cultural policy. The [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] notes that public humanities projects it has supported in the past include "interpretation at historic sites, television and radio productions, museum exhibitions, podcasts, short videos, digital games, websites, mobile apps, and other digital media."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neh.gov/divisions/public|title=Division of Public Programs|website=National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many practitioners of public humanities are invested in ensuring the [[accessibility]] and relevance of the humanities to the general public or [[community group]]s.

The American Council of Learned Societies' National Task Force on Scholarship and the Public Humanities suggests that the nature of public humanities work is to teach the public the findings of academic scholarship: it sees "scholarship and the public humanities not as two distinct spheres but as parts of a single process, the process of taking private insight, testing it, and turning it into public knowledge."&lt;ref name="Quay1989" /&gt; Others suggest a more balanced understanding of the ways in which history, heritage and culture are shared between the academy and the public, drawing on the notion of [[shared historical authority]].

Subfields of the public humanities include [[public history]], [[public sociology]], [[public folklore]], [[public anthropology]], [[public philosophy]], [[historic preservation]], [[museum studies]], [[museum education]], [[cultural heritage management]], [[community archaeology]], [[public art]], and [[public science]].

== Programs in Public Humanities ==
Several universities have established programs in the public humanities (or have otherwise expressed commitments to public humanities via the creation of centers, degrees, or certificate programs with investments in various forms of "public" work), including:

*[http://www.bishopg.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx Bishop Grosseteste University], Lincoln, UK, whose newly created [http://www.bishopg.ac.uk/study/courses/Pages/sociology.aspx BA Sociology degree] has deliberately been placed within a School of Humanities, and will be delivered by members of a research cluster wherein the idea of "public sociology" (i.e. a sociology that engages audiences beyond the academy in cultural, literary and sociology debate) is activeliy cultivated and fostered. 
*[[Brown University]], whose [http://www.brown.edu/Research/JNBC/index.html John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage] supports public humanities programs and offers a master's degree in public humanities. Brown's public humanities program emphasizes practice, balanced with theory and a ground in a field of study.

'''Revision''' is the stage in the [[writing process]] where the [[author]] reviews, alters, and amends their message, according to what has been written in the [[Draft document|draft]]. Revision follows drafting and precedes [[editing]]. Drafting and revising often form a loop as a work moves back and forth between the two stages. It is not uncommon for professional writers to go through many drafts and revisions before successfully creating a written piece that is ready for the next stage: editing. Revision itself is not indicative of the quality of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Revision Cognitive and Instructional Processes: Cognitive and Instructional Processes|last=Allal|first=Linda|last2=Chanquoy|first2=L.|last3=Largy|first3=Pierre|publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC|year=2004|isbn=9789401037761|location=New York|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their seminal book, ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', [[William Strunk, Jr.]] and [[E.B. White]] acknowledge the need for revision in the writing process: “Few writers are so expert that they can produce what they are after on the first try. Quite often you will discover, on examining the completed work, that there are serious flaws in the arrangement of the material, calling for [[:wikt:transpose|transposition]]s... do not be afraid to experiment with your text.”

For an essay, a successful revision involves:

'''Identification of thesis'''. The purpose of the essay should be re-considered based on what has been written in the draft. If this purpose differs from the original [[thesis]], the author must decide from which thesis to continue writing.

'''Consideration of structure'''. The author should identify the strengths of the draft, then re-consider the order of those strengths, adjusting their placement as necessary so the work can build with [[Auxesis (figure of speech)|auxesis]] to a [[crescendo]].

'''Uncovering weakness in argument or presentation'''. Once the strengths of the draft have been identified and placed in the strongest order, the author can re-examine the work for weaknesses in argument or presentation. Faulty [[logic]], missing [[Transition words|transitions]], and unsupported  or poorly supported assertions are common weaknesses. Identifying these weaknesses during revision will inform the next draft.

In general, revision of written work can be guided by the following questions:

* Is the writing clear? Does it make sense?
* Is there enough information to describe ideas?
* Is there too much information so that the writing wanders off topic?
* Are the ideas or the narrative flow in a logical order?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beginning Writing Lab|last=Atlee|first=Nancy|publisher=Prufrock Press Inc.|year=1998|isbn=1883055296|location=San Luis, CA|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful revision is not improving [[grammar]] or [[diction]]. Those will be the focus of later editing. However, there are instances when the writer or the author employs a strategy that involves a reviewing process. There are scholarship and theories citing this particular theme such as the case of the three-component model identified by Hayes and Flower&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Effective Learning and Teaching of Writing: A Handbook of Writing in Education|last=Rijlaarsdam|first=|last2=Bergh|first2=Huub|last3=Couzijn|first3=Michel|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|year=2007|isbn=1402027249|location=New York|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the James Britton's model of the writing process as a series of stages described in metaphors of linear growth, conception - incubation - production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landmark Essays on Writing Process|last=Perl|first=Sondra|publisher=Hermagoras Press|year=1994|isbn=1880393131|location=Davis, CA|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, a review by the writer or a third party, which often entails corrective annotations, is part of the process that leads to the revision stage. Recently, due to the collaborative capabilities offered by the [[Internet]], there are writers who "[[Crowdsourcing|crowdsource]]" reviews from several people, who contribute digital annotations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''SAMUS: South African Music Studies''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] and the official journal of the [[South African Society for Research in Music]] (SASRIM). Contents and abstracts are listed in [[RILM]] Abstracts, The Music Index, Sabinet Online, and [[African Journals OnLine]].

'''''SAMUS''''' succeeds the now defunct '''''South African Journal of Musicology''''' which was published by the former [[Musicological Society of Southern Africa]]. SASRIM is a post-apartheid amalgamation of the Musicological Society of Southern Africa and the Ethnomusicology Symposium. Consequently '''''SAMUS''''' is an interdisciplinary journal, which publishes an eclectic range of research in the disciplines of musicology, ethnomusicology, music theory and analysis, popular music, composition, performance, music therapy, and music education. The journal is published once a year.

Notable music researchers who have published in both the '''''South African Journal of Musicology''''' and '''''SAMUS''''' include Christopher Ballantine, [[John Blacking]], [[Michael Blake (composer)|Michael Blake]], Sylvia Bruinders, [[Nicholas Cook]], David Coplan, Lindelwa Dalamba, Chatradari Devroop, Michael Drewett, Veit Erlmann, [[Robert Fokkens]], Klaus Heimes, Marie Jorritsma, [[Clare Loveday]], Christine Lucia, Winfried Lüdemann, J.P Malan, James May, Stephanus Muller, Grant Olwage, Beverly Parker, [[Roger Parker]], Mary Rörich, Martin Scherzinger, Ruth A.

'''Science studies'''  is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] research area that seeks to situate scientific [[expertise]] in broad social, historical, and philosophical contexts. It uses various methods to analyze the production, representation and reception of scientific knowledge and its [[epistemology|epistemic]] and [[semiotics|semiotic]] role.

Similarly to [[cultural studies]], science studies are defined by the subject of their research and encompass a large range of different theoretical and methodological perspectives and practices. The interdisciplinary approach may include and borrow methods from the humanities, natural and formal sciences, from [[scientometrics]] to [[ethnomethodology]] or [[cognitive science]]. Science studies have a certain importance for [[evaluation]] and science policy. Overlapping with the field of [[science, technology and society]], practitioners study the relationship between science and technology, and the interaction of expert and lay knowledge in the public realm.

== Scope ==
The field started with a tendency toward [[Omphaloskepsis|navel-gazing]]: it was extremely self-conscious in its genesis and applications.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; From early concerns with scientific [[discourse]], practitioners soon started to deal with the relation of scientific expertise to politics and lay people.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; Practical examples include [[bioethics]], [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE), [[pollution]], [[global warming]],&lt;ref&gt;Martello M (2004) Global change science and the Arctic citizen.Sci Public Policy 31(2):107–115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff S (ed) (2004) States of knowledge: the co-production of science and social order. Routledge, Abingdon&lt;/ref&gt; [[biomedical sciences]], [[physical sciences]], [[natural hazard]] predictions, the (alleged) impact of the Chernobyl disaster in the UK, generation and review of science policy and risk governance and its historical and geographic contexts.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; While staying a discipline with multiple metanarratives, the fundamental concern is about the role of the perceived ̳expert‘ in providing governments and local authorities with information from which they can make decisions.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;
The approach poses various important questions about what makes an expert and how experts and their authority are to be distinguished from the lay population and interacts with the values and policy making process in liberal democratic societies.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;

Practitioners examine the forces within and through which scientists investigate specific phenomena such as
* technological milieus, epistemic instruments and [[Epistemic cultures|cultures]] and [[laboratory life]] (compare [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]], [[Bruno Latour]], Hans-Jörg Rheinberger)
* Science and technology (e.g. [[Wiebe Bijker]], [[Trevor Pinch]], [[Thomas P. Hughes]])
* Science, technology and society (e.g. [[Peter Weingart]], [[Ulrike Felt]], [[Helga Nowotny]] and [[Reiner Grundmann]])
* Language and  [[rhetoric of science]] (e.g. [[Charles Bazerman]], [[Alan G. Gross]], Greg Myers)
* [[Aesthetics#Aesthetics and science|aesthetics of science]] and visual culture in science (u.a. [[:de:Peter Geimer]]), the role of aesthetic criteria in scientific practice (compare [[mathematical beauty]]) and the relation between emotion, [[cognition]] and rationality in the development of science.&lt;ref&gt;International Studies in the Philosophy of Science   Volume 16,  Issue 1, 2002, Recent work on aesthetics of science DOI:10.1080/02698590120118783 James W. McAllister pages 7-11, 21 Jul 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[semiotics|Semiotic]] studies of creative processes, as in the discovery, conceptualization, and realization of new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Zeichen für Kunst: Zur Organisierbarkeit von Kreativität Detlev Nothnagel, ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 {{ISBN|978-3-86057-887-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the interaction and management of different forms of knowledge in cooperative research.&lt;ref&gt;Organisierte Kreativität: Die vielen Gesichter der Innovation, Rene J.Jorna, in Zeichen für Kunst: Zur Organisierbarkeit von Kreativität Detlev Nothnagel, ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 {{ISBN|978-3-86057-887-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Large scale research and research institutions, e.g. particle colliders ([[Sharon Traweek]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Traweek | first = Sharon | author-link = Sharon Traweek | title = Beamtimes and lifetimes: the world of high energy physicists | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780674044449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[research ethics]], [[science policy]], and the role of the university.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Biagioli: ''The science studies reader''. Routledge, New York 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-91867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Derek de Solla Price]]: ''Little Science, Big Science. Von der Studierstube zur Großforschung.'' Suhrkamp, 1982, {{ISBN|978-3518076484}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the field ==
[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanislaw Ossowski]] started to introduce the concept in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Kölbel: [http://www.dart-europe.eu/full.php?id=466024 ''Wissensmanagement in der Wissenschaft''], Berlin: Gesellschaft für Wissenschaftsforschung e.V. c/o Inst. f. Bibliotheks- und Informationswissenschaft der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, 2002, elektronische Bereitstellung 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn's]] ''[[Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962) led to an increased interest in not only the [[history of science]], but also its [[history and philosophy of science|philosophical underpinnings]]. Kuhn's work established that the [[history of science]] was less a linear succession of discoveries, but rather the concept of [[paradigm]]s to the [[philosophy of science]]. Paradigms are broader, socio-intellectual constructs that determine which types of truth claims are permissible. Science studies try to identify crucial [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]] as in science and technology, nature and culture, theories and experiments; science and fine art leading to the separation of various science fields and practices. [[Sociology of scientific knowledge]] developed at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where [[David Bloor]] and his colleagues developed what has been termed the '[[strong programme]]'. The strong programme proposed that both 'true' and 'false' scientific theories should be treated the same way.&lt;ref&gt;David Bloor, "The strengths of the strong programme." Scientific rationality: The sociological turn (Springer Netherlands, 1984) pp. 75-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Both are caused by social factors or conditions, such as cultural context and self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Wiebe E. Bijker, et al. The social construction of technological systems: New directions in the sociology and history of technology (MIT press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; All human knowledge, as something that exists in the human cognition, must contain some social components in its formation process.&lt;ref&gt;Harry M. Collins, "Introduction: Stages in the empirical programme of relativism." Social studies of science (1981): 3-10. in JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt;

It proved however difficult to address natural science topics with sociologist methods, as proven by the US [[science wars]].&lt;ref name=thn/&gt; The use of a deconstructive approach (as for works on arts or religion) on natural sciences risked to endanger not only the "hard facts" of natural sciences, but as well the objectivity and positivist tradition of sociology itself.&lt;ref name=thn&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Latour | first = Bruno | author-link = Bruno Latour | title = When things strike back: a possible contribution of ‘science studies’ to the social sciences | journal = [[British Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–123 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-4446.2000.00107.x | date = March 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2000.00107.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view on scientific knowledge production as a (at least partial) social construct was not easily accepted.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;  Latour and others identified a dichotomy crucial for modernity, the division between nature (things, objects) as being [[Transcendental idealism|transcendent]], allowing to detect them, and society (the subject, the state) as [[Immanence#Continental philosophy|immanent]] as being artificial, constructed. The dichotomy allowed for a mass production of things (technical-natural hybrids) and large scale [[global issue]]s that in the meanwhile threaten endangered the distinction as such. E.g. ''[[We Have Never Been Modern]]'' asks to reconnect the social and natural worlds returning to the premodern use of "thing"&lt;ref&gt;In premodern times (and various languages) the term both meant an object and [[Thing (assembly)|an assembly]]&lt;/ref&gt; - addressing objects as hybrids made and scrutinized by the public interaction of people, things and concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lash | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Lash |year=1999 | title = Objects that judge: Latour's parliament of things, in another modernity, a different rationality | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford  | isbn = 9780631164999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science studies scholars such as [[Trevor Pinch]] and [[Steve Woolgar]] started already in the 1980s to involve "technology", and called their field '[[science, technology and society]]'.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span dir="ltr"&gt;An Introduction to Science and Technology Studies&lt;/span&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Sergio+Sismondo%22 &lt;span dir="ltr"&gt; Sergio Sismondo&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span dir="ltr"&gt; John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/span&gt;, 17.08.2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This "turn to technology" brought science studies into communication with academics in science, technology, and society programs.

More recently, a novel approach known as [[mapping controversies]] has been gaining momentum among science studies practitioners, and was introduced as a course for students in engineering,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demoscience.org/ MIT] web.mit.edu Retrieved on 2009-02-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch/ Ecoles Polytechniques Fédérales de Lausanne] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712012636/http://mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch/ |date=2012-07-12 }} mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch Retrieved on 2009-02-21&lt;/ref&gt; and architecture schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.co.uk University of Manchester] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515123357/http://www.mappingcontroversies.co.uk/ |date=2009-05-15 }} mappingcontroversies.co.uk Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002 [[Harry Collins]] and Robert Evans asked for a third wave of science studies (a pun on ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler)|The Third Wave]]''), namely studies of ''expertise'' and ''experience'' answering to recent tendencies to dissolve the boundary between experts and the public.&lt;ref&gt;Social Studies of Science April 2002 vol. 32 no. 2 235-296 The Third Wave of Science Studies Studies of Expertise and Experience H.M.

=== Sheepfarming after Chernobyl ===
[[File:Pair of Herdwicks grazing.jpg|thumb|[[Herdwick]]s grazing in Cumbria]]

A showcase of the rather complex problems of scientific information and its interaction with lay persons is [[Brian Wynne]]'s study of Sheepfarming in Cumbria after the [[Chernobyl disaster]].&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;&lt;ref name=mah&gt;Wynne B (1989) Sheepfarming after Chernobyl: a case study in communicating scientific information. Environment 31(2):33–39
&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated on the responses of sheep farmers in [[Cumbria]], who had been subjected to administrative restrictions because of [[radioactive contamination]], allegedly caused by the nuclear accident at [[Chernobyl]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt;  The sheep farmers suffered economic losses and their resistance against the regulation imposed was being deemed irrational and not adequate.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt;  It turned out that the source of radioactivity was actually the [[Sellafield]] nuclear reprocessing complex; thus, the experts who were responsible for the duration of the restrictions were completely mistaken.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt; The example lead to various attempts to better involve local knowledge and experience of lay people and to assess its often highly geographically and historically defined background.&lt;ref&gt;Risk, Environment and Modernity: Towards a New Ecology [[Scott Lash]] [[Bronislaw Szerszynski]], [[Brian Wynne]] SAGE, 05.04.1996&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science studies / STS on volcanology ===
[[Image:Soufrière Hills volcanic aftermath (Aerial views, Montserrat, 2007) 02.jpg|thumb|The aftermath of the 2007 [[Soufrière Hills]] eruption in Montserrat]]

Donovan et al. (2012) used and described the STS respectively science studies for ''social studies of [[volcanology]]'' and the generation of knowledge and expert advice on various active volcanoes.&lt;ref name=vulc&gt;Amy Donovan, Clive Oppenheimer, Michael Bravo. Social studies of volcanology: knowledge generation and expert advice on active volcanoes. Bulletin of Volcanology, Springer Verlag (Germany), 2012, 74 (3), pp.677-689. doi:&lt;10.1007/s00445-011-0547-z insu-00691620&lt;/ref&gt; It contains a survey of volcanologists carried out during 2008 and 2009 and interviews with scientists in the [[List of volcanoes in the United Kingdom|UK]], [[Soufrière Hills|Montserrat]], [[Volcanology of Italy|Italy]] and [[Volcanology of Iceland|Iceland]] during fieldwork seasons. Donovan et al. (2012) asked the experts about the felt purpose of volcanology and what they considered the most important eruptions in historical time. The survey tries to identify eruptions that had an influence on volcanology as a science and to assess the role of scientists in policymaking.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; 
A main focus was on the impact of the Montserrat eruption 1997. The eruption, a classical example of the [[black swan theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Donovan et al. (2012) cite Taleb NN (2007) The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable. Allen Lane, London 
&lt;/ref&gt; directly killed (only) 19 persons. However the outbreak had major impacts on the local society and destroyed important infractructure, as the [[W. H. Bramble Airport|island's airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/country_profiles/3666502.stm |title=BBC country profile: Montserrat |accessdate=2008-03-08 | date=22 September 2009 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 7,000 people, or two-thirds of the population, left Montserrat; 4,000 to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4237882.stm |date=12 September 2005 |title=Montserrat evacuation remembered |publisher=BBC |accessdate= 19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Montserrat case put immense pressure on volcanologists, as their expertise suddenly became the primary driver of various public policy approaches.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; The STS approach provided valuable insights in that situation.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; There were various miscommunications among scientists. Matching scientific uncertainty (typical of volcanic unrest) and the request for a single unified voice for political advice was a challenge.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; The Montserrat Volcanologists began to use statistical elicitation models to estimate the probabilities of particular events, a rather subjective method, but allowing to synthesizing consensus and experience-based expertise step by step.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; It involved as well local knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;

[[Volcanology]] as a science currently faces a shift of its epistemological foundations of volcanology. The science started to involve more research into risk assessment and risk management. It requires new, integrated methodologies for knowledge collection that transcend scientific disciplinary boundaries but combine qualitative and quantitative outcomes in a structured whole.&lt;ref&gt;Horlick-Jones T, Sime J (2004) Living on the border: knowledge, risk and transdisciplinarity. Futures 36(4):441&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experts and Democracy ==
Science has become a major force in Western democratic societies, which depend on innovation and technology (compare [[Risk society]]) to address its risks.&lt;ref name="Ulrich Beck"&gt;{{cite book |title=Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity |author=[[Ulrich Beck]] |publisher=Sage Publications |location=New Delhi |date=1992 |isbn=978-0803983465}} (in German: Die Risikogesellschaft 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Beliefs about science can be very different from those of the scientists themselves, for reasons of e.g. moral values, epistemology or political motivations.The designation of expertise as authoritative in the interaction with lay people and decision makers of all kind is nevertheless challenged in contemporary risk societies, as suggested by scholars who follow [[Ulrich Beck]]'s theorisation. The role of expertise in contemporary democracies is an important theme for debate among science studies scholars. Some argue for a more widely distributed, pluralist understanding of expertise ([[Sheila Jasanoff]] and [[Brian Wynne]], for example), while others argue for a more nuanced understanding of the idea of expertise and its social functions (Collins and Evans, for example).&lt;ref name="CollinsEvans"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rethinking Expertise |first1= Harry |last1=Collins |first2=Robert |last2=Evans |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2007 |isbn=978-0226113623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins|first1=Harry |title=Interactional expertise as a third kind of knowledge |journal=Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences |volume=3 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=125–143 |issn=1568-7759 |doi=10.1023/B:PHEN.0000040824.89221.1a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Scientific study of religion''' represents the systematic effort by scholars and researchers to investigate religious phenomena, as well as the sociology of church participation. 

The [[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion]] was founded in 1949 by scholars in religion and social science, and it publishes the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', a quarterly which "offers perspectives on national and international issues such as brainwashing and cults, religious persecution, and [[right wing authoritarianism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0021-8294&amp;site=1 |title=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion - Wiley Online Library |publisher=Blackwellpublishing.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for the Scientific Study of Religion (CSSR) at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] is a leading center for the sociology of religion, and particularly for the study of religious influences on human behavior and population outcomes. The CSSR went offline in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prc.utexas.edu/cssr/about_the_center/about_the_center.htm | publisher=University of Texas at Austin | work=Center for the Scientific Study of Religion (CSSR) | title=About the Center | accessdate=September 7, 2015 | author=Roemer, Michael K.| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609010657/http://www.prc.utexas.edu/cssr/about_the_center/about_the_center.htm | archivedate=June 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Does the CSSR still exist?

'''Social science''' is a category of [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]], concerned with [[society]] and the [[Social relation|relationships]] among [[individuals]] within a society. Social science as a whole has many branches, each of which is considered a social science. The social sciences include, but are not limited to: [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[history]], [[human geography]], [[jurisprudence]], [[linguistics]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[public health]], and [[sociology]]. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original "science of society", established in the 19th century. For a more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences see: [[Outline of social science]].

[[Positivism|Positivist]] social scientists use methods resembling those of the [[natural science]]s as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter [[Modern science|modern sense]]. [[Antipositivism|Interpretivist]] social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically [[falsifiable]] theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often [[Eclecticism|eclectic]], using multiple [[Methodology|methodologies]] (for instance, by combining both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research]]). The term "[[social research]]" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.

==History==
{{Main|History of the social sciences}}
The history of the social sciences begins in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] after 1650,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S3zZ18tt3gkC|title=The Social Science Encyclopedia|last=Kuper|first=Adam|date=1996|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415108294|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which saw a revolution within [[natural philosophy]], changing the basic framework by which individuals understood what was "scientific". Social sciences came forth from the [[moral philosophy]] of the time and were influenced by the [[Age of Revolution]]s, such as the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; The ''social sciences'' developed from the [[science]]s ([[experimental science|experimental]] and [[applied science|applied]]), or the systematic knowledge-bases or prescriptive practices, relating to the [[social improvement]] of a [[community|group of interacting entities]].&lt;ref name="SocialColumbian1897"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peck1897"/&gt;

The beginnings of the social sciences in the 18th century are reflected in the [[Encyclopédie|grand encyclopedia of Diderot]], with articles from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and other pioneers. The growth of the social sciences is also reflected in other specialized encyclopedias. The modern period saw "''social science''" first used as a distinct conceptual field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution of Wealth Most Conducive to Human Happiness; applied to the Newly Proposed System of Voluntary Equality of Wealth |year=1824 |author=[[William Thompson (philosopher)|William Thompson]] (1775–1833)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social science was influenced by [[positivism]],&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; focusing on knowledge based on actual positive sense experience and avoiding the negative; [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation was avoided. [[Auguste Comte]] used the term "''science sociale''" to describe the field, taken from the ideas of [[Charles Fourier]]; Comte also referred to the field as ''social physics''.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Comte, the ''social physics'' field was similar to that of [[natural sciences]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this period, there were five paths of development that sprang forth in the social sciences, influenced by Comte on other fields.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; One route that was taken was the rise of [[social research]]. Large [[statistical survey]]s were undertaken in various parts of the United States and Europe. Another route undertaken was initiated by [[Émile Durkheim]], studying "social facts", and [[Vilfredo Pareto]], opening metatheoretical ideas and individual theories. A third means developed, arising from the methodological dichotomy present, in which [[social phenomena]] were identified with and understood; this was championed by figures such as [[Max Weber]]. The fourth route taken, based in economics, was developed and furthered economic knowledge as a [[hard science]]. The last path was the [[correlation]] of knowledge and [[Value (ethics)|social values]]; the [[antipositivism]] and [[verstehen]] sociology of [[Max Weber]] firmly demanded this distinction. In this route, theory (description) and prescription were non-overlapping formal discussions of a subject.

Around the start of the 20th century, [[Enlightenment philosophy]] was challenged in various quarters. After the use of classical theories since the end of the scientific revolution, various fields substituted mathematics studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure. The development of social science subfields became very quantitative in [[methodology]]. The [[interdisciplinary]] and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behaviour, social and environmental factors affecting it, made many of the natural sciences interested in some aspects of social science methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vessuri | first1 = H. | doi = 10.1177/0011392102050001010 | title = Ethical Challenges for the Social Sciences on the Threshold of the 21st Century | journal = Current Sociology | volume = 50 | pages = 135–150 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social research of [[medicine]], [[sociobiology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[bioeconomics (biophysical)|bioeconomics]] and the [[history of science|history]] and [[sociology of science]]. Increasingly, [[quantitative research]] and [[qualitative methods]] are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences. In the first half of the 20th century, statistics became a free-standing discipline of applied mathematics. Statistical methods were used confidently.

In the contemporary period, [[Karl Popper]] and [[Talcott Parsons]] influenced the furtherance of the social sciences.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; Researchers continue to search for a unified consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed "grand theory" with the various midrange theories that, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks; for more, see [[consilience]]. The social sciences will for the foreseeable future be composed of different zones in the research of, and sometime distinct in approach toward, the field.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt;

The term "social science" may refer either to the specific ''sciences of society'' established by thinkers such as Comte, Durkheim, Marx, and Weber, or more generally to all disciplines outside of "noble science" and [[arts]]. By the late 19th century, the academic social sciences were constituted of five fields: [[jurisprudence]] and amendment of the [[law]], [[education]], [[health]], [[economy]] and [[trade]], and [[art]].&lt;ref name="SocialColumbian1897" /&gt;

Around the start of the 21st century, the expanding domain of [[economics]] in the social sciences has been described as [[economic imperialism (economics)|economic imperialism]].&lt;ref name="Imperialism"/&gt;

The social science disciplines are branches of knowledge taught and researched at the college or university level. Social science disciplines are defined and recognized by the [[academic journal]]s in which research is published, and the learned social science societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong. Social science fields of study usually have several sub-disciplines or branches, and the distinguishing lines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous.

===Anthropology===
{{Main|Anthropology|Outline of anthropology}}

[[Anthropology]] is the holistic "science of man", a science of the totality of human existence. The discipline deals with the integration of different aspects of the social sciences, [[humanities]], and [[human biology]]. In the twentieth century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains. The ''natural sciences'' seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments. The ''humanities'' generally study local traditions, through their history, literature, music, and arts, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras. The ''social sciences'' have generally attempted to develop scientific methods to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences.

The anthropological social sciences often develop nuanced descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology. Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wallerstein | first1 = I. | title = Anthropology, Sociology, and Other Dubious Disciplines | doi = 10.1086/375868 | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 453–465 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, anthropology is divided into four sub-fields: [[archaeology]], [[Physical Anthropology|physical]] or [[Physical Anthropology|biological anthropology]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]]. It is an area that is offered at most undergraduate institutions. The word ''anthropos'' (ἄνθρωπος) in [[Ancient Greek]] means "human being" or "person". [[Eric Wolf]] described sociocultural anthropology as "the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences."

The goal of anthropology is to provide a [[Holism|holistic]] account of humans and human nature. This means that, though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub-field, they always keep in mind the biological, linguistic, historic and cultural aspects of any problem. Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called "primitive" in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of "inferior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lowie |first=Robert |title=Primitive Religion |publisher=Routledge and Sons |year=1924}}; {{cite book |last=Tylor |first=Edward |year=1920 |title=Primitive Culture |location=New York: |publisher=J. P. Putnam's Sons}} Originally published 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, anthropologists use terms such as "less complex" societies or refer to specific modes of [[subsistence]] or [[Modes of production|production]], such as "pastoralist" or "forager" or "horticulturalist" to refer to humans living in non-industrial, non-Western cultures, such people or folk (''ethnos'') remaining of great interest within anthropology.

The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and linguistic data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs.&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena and Richard Warms. ''Culture Counts''. Wadsworth. 2008. Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato. ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. 1993; Inda, John Xavier and Renato Rosaldo. ''The Anthropology of Globalization''. Wiley-Blackwell. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication studies===
{{Main|Communication studies|History of communication studies}}
Communication studies deals with processes of human [[communication]], commonly defined as the sharing of [[symbols]] to create [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face [[conversation]] to mass media outlets such as [[television broadcasting]]. Communication studies also examines how messages are interpreted through the political, cultural, economic, and social dimensions of their contexts. Communication is institutionalized under many different names at different universities, including "communication", "communication studies", "speech communication", "rhetorical studies", "communication science", "[[media studies]]", "communication arts", "[[mass communication]]", "[[media ecology]]", and "communication and media science".

Communication studies integrates aspects of both social sciences and the humanities. As a social science, the discipline often overlaps with sociology, psychology, anthropology, biology, political science, economics, and public policy, among others. From a humanities perspective, communication is concerned with rhetoric and persuasion (traditional graduate programs in communication studies trace their history to the rhetoricians of Ancient Greece). The field applies to outside disciplines as well, including engineering, architecture, mathematics, and information science.

===Economics===
{{Main|Economics|Outline of economics}}
[[Economics]] is a social science that seeks to analyze and describe the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109547?query=Economics&amp;ct= economics – Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The word "economics" is from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἶκος}} ''oikos'', "family, household, estate", and νόμος ''nomos'', "custom, law", and hence means "household management" or "management of the state". An [[economist]] is a person using economic concepts and data in the course of employment, or someone who has earned a [[academic degree|degree]] in the subject. The classic brief definition of economics, set out by [[Lionel Robbins]] in 1932, is "the science which studies human behavior as a relation between scarce means having alternative uses". Without scarcity and alternative uses, there is no [[economic problem]]. Briefer yet is "the study of how people seek to satisfy needs and wants" and "the study of the financial aspects of human behavior".
{|align=right
|[[File:Market-Chichicastenango.jpg|thumb|right|Buyers bargain for good prices while sellers put forth their best front in [[Chichicastenango]] Market, [[Guatemala]].]]
|}
Economics has two broad branches: [[microeconomics]], where the unit of analysis is the individual agent, such as a household or firm, and [[macroeconomics]], where the unit of analysis is an economy as a whole. Another division of the subject distinguishes [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] economics, which seeks to predict and explain economic phenomena, from [[normative economics]], which orders choices and actions by some criterion; such orderings necessarily involve [[Subjectivity|subjective]] value judgments. Since the early part of the 20th century, economics has focused largely on measurable quantities, employing both theoretical models and empirical analysis. Quantitative models, however, can be traced as far back as the [[physiocrats|physiocratic school]]. Economic reasoning has been increasingly applied in recent decades to other social situations such as [[public choice theory|politics]], [[law]], [[Experimental economics|psychology]], [[Economic history|history]], [[religion]], marriage and family life, and other social interactions.
This paradigm crucially assumes (1) that resources are scarce because they are not sufficient to satisfy all wants, and (2) that "economic value" is willingness to pay as revealed for instance by market (arms' length) transactions. Rival [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] schools of thought, such as [[institutional economics]], [[green economics]], [[Marxist economics]], and [[economic sociology]], make other grounding assumptions. For example, Marxist economics assumes that economics primarily deals with the investigation of [[exchange value]], of which human labour is the source.

The expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as [[economic imperialism (economics)|economic imperialism]].&lt;ref name="Imperialism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Becker|Becker, Gary S.]] (1976).

===Education===
{{Main|Education|Outline of education}}
[[File:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|thumb|right|A depiction of world's oldest university, the [[University of Bologna]], in Italy]]
Education [[List of education topics|encompasses]] teaching and learning specific skills, and also something less tangible but more profound: the imparting of knowledge, positive judgement and well-developed wisdom. Education has as one of its fundamental aspects the imparting of culture from generation to generation (see [[socialization]]). To educate means 'to draw out', from the [[Latin]] ''educare'', or to facilitate the realization of an individual's potential and talents. It is an application of [[pedagogy]], a body of theoretical and applied research relating to teaching and learning and draws on many disciplines such as [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[computer science]], [[linguistics]], [[neuroscience]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachersmind.com/education.htm An overview of education]&lt;/ref&gt;

The education of an individual human begins at birth and continues throughout life. (Some believe that education begins even before birth, as evidenced by some parents' playing music or reading to the baby in the womb in the hope it will influence the child's development.) For some, the struggles and triumphs of daily [[personal life|life]] provide far more instruction than does formal schooling (thus [[Mark Twain]]'s admonition to "never let school interfere with your education"). Family members may have a profound educational effect&amp;nbsp;— often more profound than they realize&amp;nbsp;— though family teaching may function very informally.

===Geography===
{{Main|Geography|Outline of geography}}
[[File:Physical world.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Earth]]
Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into two main sub fields: [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]]. The former focuses largely on the built environment and how space is created, viewed and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy. This may involve [[cultural geography]], [[Transportation geography|transportation]], [[Health geography|health]], [[Military geography|military operations]], and [[Urban geography|cities]]. The latter examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation and life, soil, [[Oceanography|oceans]], water and [[landforms]] are produced and interact.&lt;ref name="What is geography?"/&gt; [[Physical geography]] examines phenomena related to the [[Geodesy|measurement of earth]]. As a result of the two subfields using different approaches a third field has emerged, which is [[environmental geography]]. Environmental geography combines physical and human geography and looks at the interactions between the environment and humans.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Bohanan"/&gt; Other [[Geography#Branches|branches of geography]] include [[social geography]], [[regional geography]], and [[geomatics]].

Geographers attempt to understand the Earth in terms of physical and spatial relationships. The first geographers focused on the science of [[mapmaking]] and finding ways to precisely [[Map projection|project]] the surface of the earth. In this sense, geography bridges some gaps between the natural sciences and social sciences. [[Historical geography]] is often taught in a college in a unified Department of Geography.

Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline, closely related to [[Geographic Information Science|GISc]], that seeks to understand humanity and its natural environment. The fields of [[urban planning]], [[regional science]], and [[planetology]] are closely related to geography. Practitioners of geography use many technologies and methods to collect data such as [[Geographic Information Systems|GIS]], [[remote sensing]], [[aerial photography]], [[statistics]], and [[global positioning systems]] (GPS).

===History===
{{Main|History|Outline of history}}

History is the continuous, systematic narrative and research into past human events as interpreted through historiographical paradigms or theories.

History has a base in both the social sciences and the humanities. In the United States the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] includes history in its definition of [[humanities]] (as it does for applied linguistics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About NEH |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |url=http://www.neh.gov/about}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] classifies history as a social science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/readingroom/books/researchdoc/summary.html Research-Doctorate Programs in the United States: Continuity and Change]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]]. The [[Social Science History Association]], formed in 1976, brings together scholars from numerous disciplines interested in [[social history]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ssha.org/ the SSHA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
{{Main|Law|Outline of law}}
[[File:Old Bailey Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|right|A trial at a criminal court, the [[Old Bailey]] in London]]
The social science of law, [[jurisprudence]], in common parlance, means a rule that (unlike a rule of [[ethics]]) is capable of enforcement through institutions.&lt;ref name="Crimes Against Humanity"/&gt; However, many laws are based on [[norm (philosophy)|norms]] accepted by a community and thus have an ethical foundation. The study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects. Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context. It has been defined as a "system of rules",&lt;ref name="hhc"/&gt; as an "interpretive concept"&lt;ref name="rdl"/&gt; to achieve justice, as an "authority"&lt;ref name="jra"/&gt; to mediate people's interests, and even as "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction".&lt;ref name="jap"/&gt; However one likes to think of law, it is a completely central social institution. Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every social science and the humanities. Laws are politics, because politicians create them. Law is philosophy, because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas. Law tells many of history's stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. And law is economics, because any rule about [[contract]], [[tort]], [[property law]], [[labour law]], [[company law]] and many more can have long-lasting effects on the distribution of wealth. The noun ''law'' derives from the late [[Old English language|Old English]] ''lagu'', meaning something laid down or fixed&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=law&amp;searchmode=none Etymonline Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and the adjective ''legal'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''lex''.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/legal ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistics===
{{Main|Linguistics|Outline of linguistics}}
[[File:Ferdinand de Saussure.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], recognized as the father of modern [[linguistics]]]]
Linguistics investigates the cognitive and social aspects of human language. The field is divided into areas that focus on aspects of the linguistic signal, such as [[syntax]] (the study of the rules that govern the structure of sentences), [[semantics]] (the study of meaning), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the study of the structure of words), [[phonetics]] (the study of speech sounds) and [[phonology]] (the study of the abstract sound system of a particular language); however, work in areas like [[evolutionary linguistics]] (the study of the origins and evolution of language) and [[psycholinguistics]] (the study of psychological factors in human language) cut across these divisions.

The overwhelming majority of modern research in linguistics takes a predominantly [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] perspective (focusing on language at a particular point in time), and a great deal of it—partly owing to the influence of [[Noam Chomsky]]—aims at formulating theories of the cognitive processing of language. However, language does not exist in a vacuum, or only in the brain, and approaches like contact linguistics, [[Creole language|creole]] studies, [[discourse analysis]], social interactional linguistics, and [[sociolinguistics]] explore language in its social context. Sociolinguistics often makes use of traditional quantitative analysis and [[statistics]] in investigating the frequency of features, while some disciplines, like contact linguistics, focus on qualitative analysis. While certain areas of linguistics can thus be understood as clearly falling within the social sciences, other areas, like [[acoustic phonetics]] and [[neurolinguistics]], draw on the natural sciences. Linguistics draws only secondarily on the humanities, which played a rather greater role in linguistic inquiry in the 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Ferdinand Saussure]] is considered the father of modern linguistics.

===Political science===
{{Main|Political science|Outline of political science|Politics}}
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aristotle]] asserted that man is a political animal in his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein, Alan (2002). Introduction to Political Thinkers. Boston, Massachusetts: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Political science]] is an academic and research discipline that deals with the theory and practice of politics and the description and analysis of [[political system]]s and political behaviour. Fields and subfields of political science include [[political economy]], [[political philosophy|political theory and philosophy]], [[civics]] and [[comparative politics]], theory of [[direct democracy]], apolitical governance, participatory direct democracy, national systems, cross-national political analysis, political development, [[international relations]], [[foreign policy]], [[international law]], politics, [[public administration]], administrative behaviour, public law, judicial behaviour, and [[Policy|public policy]]. Political science also studies [[power in international relations]] and the theory of [[great powers]] and [[superpower]]s.

Political science is methodologically diverse, although recent years have witnessed an upsurge in the use of the scientific method,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn = 978-1403934222|title = Rational Choice|last1 = Hindmoor|first1 = Andrew|date = 2006-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2014}} that is, the proliferation of formal-deductive model building and quantitative hypothesis testing. Approaches to the discipline include [[rational choice]], classical political philosophy, [[Interpretivism (social science)|interpretivism]], [[structuralism]], and [[behavioralism|behaviouralism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], pluralism, and [[Institutionalism in political parties|institutionalism]]. Political science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents, interviews, and official records, as well as secondary sources such as [[scholarly article]]s are used in building and testing theories. Empirical methods include [[sample survey|survey]] research, [[statistical analysis]] [[econometrics|or econometrics]], [[case studies]], experiments, and model building. [[Herbert Baxter Adams]] is credited with coining the phrase "political science" while teaching history at [[Johns Hopkins University]].

===Psychology===
{{Main|Psychology|Outline of psychology}}
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt]] was the founder of [[experimental psychology]].]]
[[Psychology]] is an academic and applied field involving the study of behaviour and mental processes. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' [[everyday life|daily lives]] and the treatment of [[mental illness]]. The word ''psychology'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ψυχή ''[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'' ("soul", "mind") and ''[[-logy|logy]]'' ("study").

Psychology differs from [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]] in seeking to capture explanatory generalizations about the [[mental function]] and overt behaviour of individuals, while the other disciplines focus on creating descriptive generalizations about the functioning of social groups or situation-specific human behaviour. In practice, however, there is quite a lot of cross-fertilization that takes place among the various fields. Psychology differs from [[biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in that it is primarily concerned with the interaction of mental processes and behaviour, and of the overall processes of a system, and not simply the biological or neural processes themselves, though the subfield of [[neuropsychology]] combines the study of the actual neural processes with the study of the mental effects they have subjectively produced.
Many people associate psychology with clinical psychology, which focuses on assessment and treatment of problems in living and psychopathology. In reality, psychology has myriad specialties including social psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, [[educational psychology]], industrial-organizational psychology, [[mathematical psychology]], neuropsychology, and quantitative analysis of behaviour.

Psychology is a very broad science that is rarely tackled as a whole, major block. Although some subfields encompass a natural science base and a social science application, others can be clearly distinguished as having little to do with the social sciences or having a lot to do with the social sciences. For example, biological psychology is considered a natural science with a social scientific application (as is clinical [[medicine]]), social and occupational psychology are, generally speaking, purely social sciences, whereas neuropsychology is a natural science that lacks application out of the scientific tradition entirely. In British universities, emphasis on what tenet of psychology a student has studied and/or concentrated is communicated through the degree conferred: B.Psy. indicates a balance between natural and social sciences, B.Sc. indicates a strong (or entire) scientific concentration, whereas a B.A. underlines a majority of social science credits. This is not always necessarily the case however, and in many UK institutions students studying the B.Psy, B.Sc, and B.A. follow the same curriculum as outlined by The British Psychological Society and have the same options of specialism open to them regardless of whether they choose a balance, a heavy science basis, or heavy social science basis to their degree. If they applied to read the B.A. for example, but specialized in heavily science-based modules, then they will still generally be awarded the B.A.

===Sociology===
{{Main|Sociology|Outline of sociology}}
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|[[Émile Durkheim]] is considered one of the founding fathers of sociology.]]
[[Sociology]] is the systematic study of society, individuals' relationship to their societies, the consequences of difference, and other aspects of human [[social action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 218|last=Witt|first=Jon|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=9781259702723|location=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the word comes from the suffix "-logy", which means "study of", derived from [[Ancient Greek]], and the stem "soci-", which is from the [[Latin]] word ''socius'', meaning "companion", or society in general.

[[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) coined the term, Sociology, as a way to apply natural science principles and techniques to the social world in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Sociology'', Article: Comte, Auguste&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 2018|last=Witt|first=Jon|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=9781259702723|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology and economics through the descriptive understanding of the social realm. He proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological [[positivism]], an epistemological approach outlined in ''The Course in Positive Philosophy'' [1830–1842] and ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (1844). Though Comte is generally regarded as the "Father of Sociology", the discipline was formally established by another French thinker, [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), who developed positivism as a foundation to practical [[social research]]. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]''. In 1896, he established the journal ''[[Année Sociologique|L'Année Sociologique]]''. Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates among [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] rejected Comte's positivism but nevertheless aimed to establish a ''science of society'' based on [[historical materialism]], becoming recognized as a founding figure of sociology posthumously as the term gained broader meaning. Around the start of the 20th century, the first wave of German sociologists, including [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]], developed sociological [[antipositivism]]. The field may be broadly recognized as an amalgam of three modes of social thought in particular: Durkheimian [[positivism]] and [[structural functionalism]]; Marxist [[historical materialism]] and [[conflict theory]]; and Weberian [[antipositivism]] and [[verstehen]] analysis. American sociology broadly arose on a separate trajectory, with little Marxist influence, an emphasis on rigorous experimental methodology, and a closer association with [[pragmatism]] and [[social psychology]]. In the 1920s, the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] developed [[symbolic interactionism]]. Meanwhile, in the 1930s, the [[Frankfurt School]] pioneered the idea of [[critical theory]], an interdisciplinary form of [[Marxist sociology]] drawing upon thinkers as diverse as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Critical theory would take on something of a life of its own after World War II, influencing [[literary criticism]] and the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies|Birmingham School]] establishment of [[cultural studies]].

Sociology evolved as an academic response to the challenges of [[modernity]], such as [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], [[secularization]], and a perceived process of enveloping [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]].&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen, ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]: Modernity's Consciousness of Time'', Polity Press (1990), paperback, {{ISBN|0-7456-0830-2}}&amp;nbsp;[[Special:BookSources/0-7456-0830-2|0-7456-0830-2]], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The field generally concerns the [[social rule]]s and processes that bind and separate people not only as [[individual]]s, but as members of [[Voluntary association|associations]], [[Group (sociology)|groups]], [[Community|communities]] and [[social institution|institutions]], and includes the examination of the organization and development of human social life. The sociological field of interest ranges from the analysis of short [[Social relation|contacts]] between anonymous individuals on the street to the study of [[globalization|global social processes]]. In the terms of [[Sociology|sociologists]] [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]], social scientists seek an understanding of the ''[[Social Construction of Reality]]''. Most sociologists work in one or more [[Subfields of sociology|subfields]]. One useful way to describe the discipline is as a cluster of sub-fields that examine different dimensions of society. For example, [[social stratification]] studies inequality and class structure; [[demography]] studies changes in a population size or type; [[criminology]] examines criminal behaviour and deviance; and [[political sociology]] studies the interaction between society and state.

Since its inception, sociological epistemologies, methods, and frames of enquiry, have significantly expanded and diverged.&lt;ref name="Giddens Intro"/&gt; Sociologists use a diversity of research methods, collect both quantitative and qualitative data, draw upon empirical techniques, and engage [[critical theory]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Common modern methods include [[case studies]], [[historiography|historical research]], [[interviewing]], [[participant observation]], [[social network analysis]], [[statistical survey|survey]] research, [[statistical analysis]], and model building, among other approaches. Since the late 1970s, many sociologists have tried to make the discipline useful for purposes beyond the academy. The results of sociological research aid educators, lawmakers, administrators, developers, and others interested in resolving social problems and formulating public policy, through subdisciplinary areas such as [[evaluation research]], methodological assessment, and [[public sociology]].

In the early 1970s, women sociologists began to question sociological paradigms and the invisibility of women in sociological studies, analysis, and courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paradoxes of Gender|last=Lorber|first=Judith|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780300064971|location=New Haven, CT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, feminist sociologists challenged the discipline's [[androcentrism]] at the American Sociological Association's annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socwomen.org/sws-activism/|title=The Founding of SWS|last=Laube|first=Heather|last2=Hess|first2=Bess B.|date=2001|website=Sociologists for Women in Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the founding of the organization Sociologists for Women in Society, and, eventually, a new sociology journal, [[Gender &amp; Society]]. Today, the [[sociology of gender]] is considered to be one of the most prominent sub-fields in the discipline.

New sociological sub-fields continue to appear&amp;nbsp;— such as [[community studies]], [[computational sociology]], [[environmental sociology]], [[Social network analysis|network analysis]], [[actor-network theory]], gender studies, and a growing list, many of which are [[List of academic disciplines|cross-disciplinary]] in nature.

==Additional fields of study==
{{See also|Auxiliary sciences of history}}

==Methodology==

===Social research===
{{Main|Social research}}
The origin of the [[Statistical survey|survey]] can be traced back at least early as the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086,&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Halsey (2004), ''A history of sociology in Britain: science, literature, and society'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Duncan Mitchell (1970), ''A new dictionary of sociology'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; while some scholars pinpoint the origin of [[demography]] to 1663 with the publication of [[John Graunt]]'s ''Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality''.&lt;ref&gt;Willcox, Walter (1938) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400906 ''The Founder of Statistics''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Social research began most intentionally, however, with the [[positivist]] [[philosophy of science]] in the 19th century.

In contemporary usage, "social research" is a relatively autonomous term, encompassing the work of practitioners from various disciplines that share in its aims and methods. Social scientists employ a range of methods in order to analyse a vast breadth of social phenomena; from [[census]] survey data derived from millions of individuals, to the in-depth analysis of a single agent's social experiences; from monitoring what is happening on contemporary streets, to the investigation of ancient historical documents. The methods originally rooted in classical sociology and statistical mathematics have formed the basis for research in other disciplines, such as [[political science]], [[media studies]], and [[marketing]] and [[market research]].

Social research methods may be divided into two broad schools:
* [[Quantitative method|Quantitative designs]] approach social phenomena through quantifiable evidence, and often rely on statistical analysis of many cases (or across intentionally designed treatments in an experiment) to create valid and reliable general claims.
* [[Qualitative research|Qualitative designs]] emphasize understanding of social phenomena through direct observation, communication with participants, or analysis of texts, and may stress contextual and subjective accuracy over generality.

Social scientists will commonly combine quantitative and qualitative approaches as part of a multi-strategy design. Questionnaires, field-based data collection, archival database information and laboratory-based data collections are some of the measurement techniques used. It is noted the importance of measurement and analysis, focusing on the (difficult to achieve) goal of objective research or [[statistical hypothesis testing]]. A [[mathematical model]] uses mathematical language to describe a system. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed 'mathematical modelling' (also modeling). Eykhoff (1974) defined a ''mathematical model'' as 'a representation of the essential aspects of an existing [[system]] (or a system to be constructed) that presents knowledge of that system in usable form'.&lt;ref&gt;Eykhoff, Pieter ''System Identification: Parameter and State Estimation'', Wiley &amp; Sons, (1974). {{ISBN|0-471-24980-7}}&amp;nbsp;[[Special:BookSources/0-471-24980-7|0-471-24980-7]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical models can take many forms, including but not limited to [[dynamical systems]], [[statistical model]]s, [[differential equations]], or [[Game theory|game theoretic models]].

These and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures. The [[system]] is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole. The concept of an ''integrated whole'' can also be stated in terms of a system embodying a set of relationships that are differentiated from relationships of the set to other elements, and from relationships between an element of the set and elements not a part of the relational regime. A [[dynamical system]] modeled as a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[formal system|formalization]] has a fixed "rule" that describes the time dependence of a point's position in its [[ambient space]]. Small changes in the state of the system correspond to small changes in the numbers. The ''evolution rule'' of the dynamical system is a [[function (mathematics)|fixed rule]] that describes what future states follow from the current state. The rule is [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]]: for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state.

Social sciences are criticized for neglecting the moral element of human behavior. Economists tend to focus on self-interest. Clinical psychologists—on the effects of early socialization. Anthropologists tend to assume moral relativism. Sociologists often blame the System for immoral behavior. Socio-biologists tend to assume limited choice behavior. All this, critics hold, contrasts with the fact that life is a constant wrestle between people's moral commitments and urges that pull them to violate these commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Amitai Etzioni. 2017. "The Moral Wrestler: Ignored by Maslow." Society, Volume 54, Issue 6, pp 512–519&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory===
{{Main|Social theory}}
Other social scientists emphasize the subjective nature of research. These writers share social theory perspectives that include various types of the following:
* [[Critical theory]] is the examination and critique of society and culture, drawing from knowledge across social sciences and humanities disciplines.
* [[Dialectical materialism]] is the philosophy of Karl Marx, which he formulated by taking the dialectic of Hegel and joining it to the materialism of Feuerbach.
* [[Feminist theory]] is the extension of feminism into theoretical, or philosophical discourse; it aims to understand the nature of gender inequality.
* [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theories]], such as [[Proletarian revolution|revolutionary theory]] and [[Class conflict|class theory]], cover work in philosophy that is strongly influenced by Karl Marx's materialist approach to theory or is written by Marxists.
* [[Phronetic social science]] is a theory and methodology for doing social science focusing on ethics and political power, based on a contemporary interpretation of Aristotelian phronesis.
* [[Post-colonialism|Post-colonial theory]] is a reaction to the cultural legacy of colonialism.
* [[Postmodernism]] refers to a point of departure for works of literature, drama, architecture, cinema, and design, as well as in marketing and business and in the interpretation of history, law, culture and religion in the late 20th century.
* [[Rational choice theory]] is a framework for understanding and often formally modeling social and economic behaviour.
* [[Social constructionism]] considers how social phenomena develop in social contexts.
* [[Structuralism]] is an approach to the human sciences that attempts to analyze a specific field (for instance, mythology) as a complex system of interrelated parts.
* [[Structural functionalism]] is a sociological paradigm that addresses what social functions various elements of the social system perform in regard to the entire system.

Other fringe social scientists delve in alternative nature of research. These writers share social theory perspectives that include various types of the following:
* [[Anti-intellectualism|Intellectual critical-ism]] describes a sentiment of critique towards, or evaluation of, intellectuals and intellectual pursuits.
* [[Antiscience|Scientific criticalism]] is a position critical of science and the scientific method.

== Education and degrees ==
Most universities offer degrees in social science fields.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson's (Firm&amp;nbsp;: 2006– ). (2007). Peterson's graduate programs in the humanities, arts, &amp; social sciences, 2007. Lawrenceville, New Jersey: Peterson's.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bachelor of Social Science]] is a degree targeted at the social sciences in particular. It is often more flexible and in-depth than other degrees that include social science subjects.{{efn|A [[Bachelor of Social Science]] degree can be earned at the [[University of Adelaide]], [[University of Waikato]] ([[Hamilton, New Zealand]]), [[University of Sydney]], [[University of New South Wales]], [[University of Hong Kong]], [[University of Manchester]], [[Lincoln University, New Zealand]], [[National University of Malaysia]] and [[University of Queensland]].}}

In the United States, a university may offer a student who studies a social sciences field a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, particularly if the field is within one of the traditional [[liberal arts]] such as history, or a BSc: Bachelor of Science degree such as those given by the London School of Economics, as the social sciences constitute one of the two main branches of [[science]] (the other being the [[natural sciences]]). In addition, some institutions have degrees for a particular social science, such as the [[Bachelor of Economics]] degree, though such specialized degrees are relatively rare in the United States.

'''Software studies''' is an emerging [[interdisciplinary]] research field, which studies [[software systems]] and their social and cultural effects.

==Overview==
The implementation and use of software has been studied in recent fields such as [[cyberculture]], [[Internet studies]], [[new media studies]], and [[digital culture]], yet prior to software studies, software was rarely ever addressed as a distinct object of study.

Software studies is an interdisciplinary field. To study software as an artifact, it draws upon methods and theory from the [[digital humanities]] and from computational perspectives on software. Methodologically, software studies usually differs from the approaches of [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], which concern themselves primarily with software in information theory and in practical application; however, these fields all share an emphasis on computer literacy, particularly in the areas of programming and source code. This emphasis on analyzing software sources and processes (rather than interfaces) often distinguishes software studies from new media studies, which is usually restricted to discussions of interfaces and observable effects.

==History==
The conceptual origins of software studies include [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s focus on the role of media in themselves, rather than the content of media platforms, in shaping culture. Early references to the study of software as a cultural practice appear in [[Friedrich Kittler]]'s essay, "Es gibt keine Software,"&lt;ref name="Kittler, 1993"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Reclam| pages = 225–242| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = Draculas Vermächtnis: Technische Schriften| chapter = Es gibt keine Software| location = Leipzig| year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = There is no software| work = CTheory.net| accessdate = 2013-01-19| date = 1995| url = http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev Manovich]]'s ''Language of New Media'',&lt;ref name="Manovich, 2001"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-13374-1 | pages = xxxix, 354| last = Manovich| first = Lev| title = The language of new media| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Matthew Fuller's ''Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software''.&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2003"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Autonomedia| isbn = 1-57027-139-9 | page = 165| last = Fuller| first = Matthew| title = Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the impetus for the development of software studies has come from videogame studies, particularly platform studies, the study of videogames and other software artifacts in their hardware and software contexts. New media art, software art, motion graphics, and [[computer-aided design]] are also significant software-based cultural practices, as is the creation of new protocols and platforms.

The first conference events in the emerging field were Software Studies Workshop 2006 and SoftWhere 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100327185154/http://pzwart.wdka.hro.nl/mdr/Seminars2/softstudworkshop Software Studies Workshop] Rotterdam 2006 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://workshop.softwarestudies.com/ SoftWhere: Software Studies Workshop] San Diego 2008 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[MIT Press]] launched a ''Software Studies'' book series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Fuller |first=Matthew |author2=Lev Manovich |author3=Noah Wardrip-Fruin |title=Software Studies - Series |work=MIT Press |accessdate=2013-01-18 |date=2010 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803154024/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |archivedate=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an edited volume of essays (Matthew Fuller's "Software Studies: a Lexicon"),&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2008"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fuller | first = Matthew | title = Software Studies: a lexicon | year = 2008 | publisher = The MIT Press | url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717061342/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archivedate = 2010-07-17 | isbn = 0-262-06274-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first academic program was launched, ([[Lev Manovich]], [[Benjamin H. Bratton]] and [[Noah Wardrip-Fruin]]'s "Software Studies Initiative" at U. California San Diego).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lab.softwarestudies.com/ Software Studies Initiative @ UCSD] official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 2011, a number of mainly British researchers established ''Computational Culture'', an open-access peer-reviewed journal. The journal provides a platform for "inter-disciplinary enquiry into the nature of the culture of computational objects, practices, processes and structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/cultural-studies/calendar/?id=4870|title=Computational Culture: Double Book Launch and Launch of Computational Culture, a journal of software studies|work=Goldsmiths|date=December 2011|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==
Software studies is closely related to a number of other emerging fields in the [[digital humanities]] that explore functional components of technology from a social and cultural perspective.  Software studies' focus is at the level of the entire program, specifically the relationship between interface and code.  Notably related are [[critical code studies]], which is more closely attuned to the code rather than the program,&lt;ref&gt;http://criticalcodestudies.com/wordpress&lt;/ref&gt; and platform studies, which investigates the relationships between hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bogost | first = Ian |author2=Nick Montfort  | title = Platform Studies, a book series published by MIT Press | work = Platform Studies | accessdate = 2013-01-18 | url = http://platformstudies.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Kirschenbaum| first = Matthew| title = Where Computer Science and Cultural Studies Collide [paywalled]| journal = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2013-01-18| date = 2009-01-23| url = http://chronicle.com/article/Where-Computer-Science-and/14806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil quality reflects how well a soil performs the functions of maintaining [[biodiversity]] and productivity, partitioning water and solute flow, filtering and buffering, [[nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]], and providing support for plants and other structures. [[Soil management]] has a major impact on soil quality. 

Soil quality in agricultural terms is measured on a scale of [[soil value]] (''Bodenwertzahl'') in [[Germany]].

Soil quality is related to soil function. Unlike water or air, for which established standards have been set, soil quality is difficult to define or quantify. Soil quality can be evaluated using the Soil Management Assessment Framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cherubin|first=Maurício Roberto|last2=Tormena|first2=Cássio Antônio|last3=Karlen|first3=Douglas L.|last4=Cherubin|first4=Maurício Roberto|last5=Tormena|first5=Cássio Antônio|last6=Karlen|first6=Douglas L.|date=00/2017|title=Soil Quality Evaluation Using the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) in Brazilian Oxisols with Contrasting Texture|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0100-06832017000100503&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Revista Brasileira de Ciência do Solo|volume=41|doi=10.1590/18069657rbcs20160148|issn=0100-0683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3322">'''The Immanent Frame''' is a digital forum that publishes interdisciplinary perspectives on [[secularism]], [[religion]], and the [[public sphere]]. It was formed in conjunction with projects on [http://www.ssrc.org/programs/religion-and-the-public-sphere/ religion and the public sphere] at the [[Social Science Research Council]] (SSRC).  Initially conceived as an experimental blog that invited multiple contributions from a number of leading scholars in the humanities and social sciences, The Immanent Frame was launched in October 2007 by an SSRC team led by program director [http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/author/vanantwerpen/ Jonathan VanAntwerpen], who served for several years as editor-in-chief.

Among other topics, The Immanent Frame launched with an extensive discussion of [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]'s ''[[A Secular Age]]'' ([[Harvard University Press]], 2007). Sociologist [[Robert Bellah]] called ''A Secular Age'' "one of the most important books to be written in my lifetime."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssrc.org/blogs/immanent_frame/2007/10/19/secularism-of-a-new-kind/ The Immanent Frame: Secularism of a new kind]&lt;/ref&gt; The Immanent Frame's discussion of Taylor's book included original contributions by [[Robert Bellah]], [[Wendy Brown (political scientist)|Wendy Brown]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], and several others. The name of the digital forum itself alludes to a central concept in Taylor's book.

Additional contributors to The Immanent Frame have included: [[Arjun Appadurai]], [[Talal Asad]], [[Rajeev Bhargava]], [[Akeel Bilgrami]], José Casanova, [[Craig Calhoun]], [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]], [[William E. Connolly]], [[Veena Das]], [[Hent de Vries]], [[Wendy Doniger]], [[Simon During]], [[John Esposito]], [[Nilüfer Göle]], [[David Hollinger]], [[Mark Juergensmeyer]], [[Mark Lilla]], Kathryn Lofton, [[Tanya Luhrmann]], [[Saba Mahmood]], [[Martin E.

Taylor]], [[Peter van der Veer]], [[Michael Warner]], [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]], [[Molly Worthen]], and many others.

In 2016, The Immanent Frame established its first editorial board. Board members include sociologist Courtney Bender, political scientist Elizabeth Shakman Hurd, and anthropologist [[Saba Mahmood]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/2016/03/14/new-editorial-board/ The Immanent Frame: New editorial board]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Triad''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.triadcentral.org Triad Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] to decision-making for [[Hazardous waste|hazardous-waste]] [[waste dump|site]] cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;pp.91-111, Crumbling, Griffith, Powell&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1990s, technology advocates from the environmental sector in the United States developed the approach by combining innovations in management and technology with ideas from hazardous-waste site cleanup experience.

Their goal was to form a framework for real-time [[environmental sensor]]s and tools, to improve decision-making at contaminated sites. This resulted in a more formalized set of ideas in [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/article.cgi/esthag-a/0000/35/i19/html/19crumbling.html 2001] that soon became known as the Triad approach. The ideas spawned a [[Community of practice|Community of Practice]] by 2005.

The Triad Community of Practice&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/user/cop/&lt;/ref&gt; includes representatives of federal, state, and private sector organizations in the U.S. and abroad. By 2008, a European CoP had been formed &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cysense.com/index.asp?pageID=133 European CoP Info]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a technical conference led largely by the CoP and covering the Triad Approach was held at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, "Triad Investigations: New Approaches and Innovative Strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umass.edu/tei/conferences/platforms.html 2008 Triad Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314225529/http://www.umass.edu/tei/conferences/platforms.html |date=2011-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;"

The term Triad represents three elements: systematic project planning (SPP), dynamic work strategies, and innovative rapid sampling and analytical technologies. While elements of the Triad have long been used for site cleanup, Triad packages these [[best practices|best management practices]] together with the guiding principles:

# Use a planning process, which includes participation of all stakeholders (including a multidisciplinary project team, federal and state regulators, legal counsel, community members, and other environmental professionals), to determine the types of data required and to evaluate whether the site could benefit from real-time measurement technologies.
# Discussion of uncertainty management, data representativeness, and site closure strategies.
# Use of a site model that recognizes site characterization is an element used at all stages of remediation.   
# Use of sampling, measurement, and data management technologies to support [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/article.cgi/esthag-a/0000/35/i19/html/19crumbling.html uncertainty management strategies].  
# Project teams that have communication, trust, discussion of individual interests and goals, and expertise in the appropriate fields.

Triad is an open-marketplace idea that is not owned by one entity. There is considerable U.S. Multiagency support for Triad.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/multiagency/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2006, The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation expressed support of Triad by requesting the cooperation of its regional managers to expand the use of Triad at Superfund sites, where appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/ref/ref/documents/Triad_Policy_Memo.pdf EPA Memo OSWER-9200.1-55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of the Triad==
Although the following elements are the legs that gave the impetus for calling the process "Triad," the goal of the Triad approach is to infuse the concepts into hazardous-waste site cleanups, no matter what the lead organization calls the process. (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Technical Project Planning Process (TPP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-manuals/em200-1-2/entire.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715135918/http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-manuals/em200-1-2/entire.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for systematic planning, for example.)

===Systematic Project Planning===
Project planning identifies the problems and encourages stakeholders to negotiate the steps necessary to mediate the risks the environmental contamination pose to human health and ecology. The specific goals of a project (redevelopment, revitalization, etc.) may differ, but the specific objectives during the SPP process are:

*Frame the problem: identify project objectives, constraints, stakeholders, the regulatory framework, and primary/secondary decisions.
*Develop a site model: construct and maintain a site model that captures information pertinent to the primary/secondary decisions that must be made. The term CSM is updated by identifying data gaps, and developing a dynamic work strategy to fill in the data gaps.
*Evaluate and manage uncertainty: evaluate and manage the uncertainty associated with decision-making in the context of the CSM so that decisions can be made with acceptable levels of confidence.

===Dynamic work strategies===
Dynamic work strategies are strategies that can be adapted to site conditions as new information becomes available while work is underway. This adaptation may be in response to data collection activities designed to address CSM unknowns, or it may be in response to completely unexpected site conditions encountered during the course of work.

Dynamic work strategies as part of a Triad approach can be included in almost every activity associated with hazardous waste site characterization and remediation. This includes overall project strategies, dynamic sampling and analysis programs (DSP,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Robbat, Jr., 1997, A Guideline for Dynamic Workplans and Field Analytics: The Keys to Cost-Effective Site Characterization and Cleanup [http://ase.tufts.edu/chemistry/robbat/documents/DynamicWorkplans.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ASAP &lt;ref&gt;US-DOE, 2001. Adaptive Sampling and Analysis Programs (ASAPs). Report DOE/EM-0592 [https://frtr.gov/pdf/asap_2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;) for characterization purposes, remedial action design, implementation, and performance monitoring, long-term monitoring for sites that require it, closure plans, and quality assurance/quality control activities.

===Innovative rapid sampling===
Sometimes referred to as 'real-time' measurement systems, these are analytical or measurement technologies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cluin.org/char1_tech.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; capable of producing data quickly enough to direct the progress of field activities (characterization or remediation) while they are underway [http://www.triadcentral.org/mgmt/meas/key/index.cfm], analogous to [[Real time business intelligence|Real-time business intelligence]]. Example analytical methods include portable or handheld X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF [http://www.cluin.org/char/technologies/xrf.cfm XRF]), portable gas chromatograph and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technologies, and [[immunoassay]] [[test kit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cluin.org/char/technologies/immunoassay.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; New field analytical methods are fast developing. However, some have used standard laboratory approaches with quick turn-around results. The analysis enables in-field decision-making ''and'' ensures logical internal consistency among Triad concepts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/tio/download/char/epa542f07001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual site models==
At the core of each project is the conceptual site model (CSM).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/ref/ref/documents/CSM_checklist.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The term CSM is sometimes used to only describe pieces of the whole model. Geological, hydrogeological, contaminant fate and transport all may have computer models referred to as 'conceptual,' and a risk assessment may contain a CSM, but in a Triad sense, a CSM is the holistic model that can effectively portray site concerns significant to the decisions that must be made.

==History and Origin==
Originating in Ancient Greece, rhetoric has been widely discussed for thousands of years. Sophists first coined the idea as an abstract term to help label the concept while Aristotle more narrowly defined rhetoric as a message's potential to influence audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rhetorical tradition : readings from classical times to the present|last=|first=|date=1990|publisher=Bedford Books of St. Martin's Press|others=Bizzell, Patricia., Herzberg, Bruce.|isbn=9780312003487|location=Boston|pages=22|oclc=21325600}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Linguists and other researchers often define rhetoric through the well-known [[Rhetoric#Canons|five cannons of rhetoric]]. Over time, this definition has evolved, expanded, and raised serious debate as new digital mediums of communicating have developed.

Visual rhetoric's first mentioning (1977) brought to light a new way to evaluate other communication means, showing the relevance of traditional rhetorical theories to the still photographic medium.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Image, music, text|last=Roland.|first=Barthes,|date=1977|publisher=Hill and Wang|others=Heath, Stephen.|isbn=978-0374521363|location=New York|oclc=3414738}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barthes explained visual rhetoric generally as the implied and interpreted messages from the work, yet these bigger messages often extend beyond the initial superficial interpretation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Visual rhetoric uses a variety of tools to hook readers within its mediums (e.g. gifs).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140809020040-134901798-attraction-and-persuasion-in-advertising-a-beginner-s-guide-to-visual-rhetoric/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230000000/https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140809020040%2D134901798%2Dattraction%2Dand%2Dpersuasion%2Din%2Dadvertising%2Da%2Dbeginner%2Ds%2Dguide%2Dto%2Dvisual%2Drhetoric/|title=Attraction and Persuasion in Advertising - A Beginner's Guide to Visual Rhetoric|last=Ly-Le|first=Tuong-Minh|date=August 9, 2014|website=LinkedIn|archive-date=2016-12-30|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although similar in nature, one striking difference between visual and classical rhetoric is the newfound outlook on Aristotle's original cannons. Linda Scott created a newfound audience by constructing new cannons exclusive to visual rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Instead of closely monitoring the content, as with the initial five cannons, Scott's focused on the visual medium's ability to ''invent'' and argument, ''arrangement'' of the item, and all coupled with a meaningful ''delivery'' of presentation. Since its inception, popular studies have appeared in published works to discuss the role of visual rhetoric in many facets of human life, especially advertising.

The term emerged largely as an effort to set aside a certain area of study that would focus attention on specific rhetorical elements of visual mediums.&lt;ref name="Hill2004" /&gt; Historically, the study of rhetoric has been geared toward linguistics.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  Visual symbols were deemed trivial and subservient and thus, were largely ignored as part of a rhetorical argument. As a result, modern rhetorical theory developed with a significant exclusion of these visual symbols, ignoring the field of visual rhetoric as a separate area of study.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  Scholars of visual rhetoric analyze photographs, drawings, paintings, graphs and tables, interior design and architecture, sculpture, Internet images, and film.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  From a rhetorical perspective, the focus is on the contextual response rather than the aesthetic response.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  An aesthetic response is a viewer's direct perception with the sensory aspects of the visual, whereas with a rhetorical response, meaning is given to the visual.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  Every part of the artifact has significance in the message being conveyed; each line, each shading, each person has a purpose.&lt;ref name="10/21/13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/atkinsa/496/Framing%20the%20Study%20of%20Visual%20Rhetoric.pdf|title=Framing the Study of Visual Rhetoric: Toward a Transformation for Rhetorical Theory|last=Foss|first=Sonja|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As visual rhetoricians study images and symbols, their findings catalyze challenges to the linguistic meaning altogether, allowing a more holistic study of the rhetorical argument to emerge with the introduction of visual elements.

=== Composition ===
The field of [[composition studies]] has recently returned its attention to visual rhetoric. In an increasingly visual society, proponents of visual rhetoric in composition classes suggest that increased literacy requires writing and visual communication skills. Visual communication skills relate to an understanding of the mediated nature of all communication, especially to an awareness of the act of representation.&lt;ref name="Hill2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="George2002" /&gt; Visual rhetoric can be utilized in a composition classroom to assist with writing and rhetoric development.  {{Main|Visual rhetoric and composition}}
[[File:Canada Stop sign.svg|thumb|A stop sign is an example of semiotics in everyday life.  Drivers understand that the sign means they must stop. Stop signs exist in a larger context of road signs, all with different meanings, designed for traffic safety.]]

=== Semiotics ===
Visual rhetoric is closely related to the study of [[semiotics]], which is the study of the use of signs and symbols and their meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/semiotics|title=Definition of SEMIOTICS|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semiotic theory seeks to describe the rhetorical significance of sign-making. The central idea of the theory is that a sign does not exist outside of a contextual experience, but it only exists in relation to other signs, objects, and entities. Therefore, the sign belongs to a larger system, and when taken out of context of other signs, is rendered meaningless and uncommunicable. The parts of a semiotic are divided into two parts: the material part of the sign is known as the ''form of expression,'' the meaning of the form of expression is known as ''form of content''.&lt;ref name="Ehses, Lupton" /&gt; In semiotic theory, the expression only has meaningful content when existing in a larger contextual framework.

=== Areas of Focus ===
While studying visual objects, rhetorical scholars tend to have three areas of study: nature, function, or evaluation.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  Nature encompasses the literal components of the artifact.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  This is a primary focus of visual rhetoric because in order to understand the function of an image, it is necessary to understand the substantive and stylistic nature of the artifact itself.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  Function holds a somewhat literal definition—it represents the purpose an image serves for an audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/atkinsa/496/Framing%20the%20Study%20of%20Visual%20Rhetoric.pdf|title=Framing a Study of Visual Rhetoric: Toward a Transformation of Rhetorical Theory|last=Foss|first=Sonja|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The function, or purpose, of an image may be to evoke a certain emotion.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  The evaluation of an artifact determines if the image serves its function.

== Rhetorical Application ==
Visual rhetoric studies how humans use images to communicate.  Elements of images, such as size color, line, and shape, are used to convey messages.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Multimodality--a Social Semiotic Approach to Contemporary Communication|last=Kress|first=Gunther|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=9780415320610|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In images, meanings are created by the layout and spatial positions of these elements.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The entities that constitute an image are socially, politically, and culturally constructed. The same image may represent different rhetorical meanings depending on the audience. The choice and arrangement of the elements in an image should be used to achieve the desired rhetorical effects and convey messages accurately to specific audiences, societies, and cultures.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The use of images is a conscious, communicative decision as the colors, form, medium, and size are each chosen on purpose.&lt;ref name="10/21/132"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/atkinsa/496/Framing%20the%20Study%20of%20Visual%20Rhetoric.pdf|title=Framing the Study of Visual Rhetoric: Toward a Transformation for Rhetorical Theory|last=Foss|first=Sonja|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a person may come in contact with a sign, but if they have no relation to the sign, its message is arbitrary. Therefore, in order for artifacts or products to be conceptualized as visual rhetoric, they must be symbolic, involve human intervention, and be presented to an audience for the purpose of communicating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/atkinsa/496/Framing%20the%20Study%20of%20Visual%20Rhetoric.pdf|title=Framing the Study of Visual Rhetoric Toward a Transformation of Rhetorical Theory|last=Foss|first=Sonja|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Rhetoric of the Image," French theorist Roland Barthes examines the semiotic nature of images, and the ways that images function to communicate specific messages. Barthes points out that messages transmitted by visual images include coded iconic and non-coded iconic linguistic messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Theory--An Introduction|last=Borchers|first=Timothy|publisher=Waveland Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1577667315|location=Long Grove ILL|pages=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual rhetorical images can be categorized into two dimensions: meaning operation and visual structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meaning operation refers to the relations and connections between elements in visual images. Visual structure refers to the way that the elements are visually displayed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Barbara|last2=McQuarrie|first2=Edward|date=2004|title=Beyond Visual Metaphor: A New Typology of Visual Rhetoric in Advertising|journal=Marketing Theory|volume=4(1/2)|pages=113–136|doi=10.1177/1470593104044089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern Application ==
Visual images have always played a role in communication, however the recent advancements in technology have enabled users to produce and share images on a mass scale.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McComiskey|first=Bruce|date=1 Jan 2014|title=Visual Rhetoric and the New Public Discourse|url=|journal=JAC: A Journal of Rhetoric, Culture, &amp; Politics|volume=24|pages=187–206|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mass communication of images has made spread of news and information a much quicker process.  As a result, certain images may go "viral", meaning the image may have been shared and seen by a large number of audiences, and attracted mainstream media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-it-mean-to-go-viral-3486225|title=What Does 'Going Viral Online' Really Mean?|work=Lifewire|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Images are utilized in a variety of ways for a number of purposes. From business to art to entertainment, the versatility of images in popular culture have some scholars arguing words will eventually become outdated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Advertisements ===
Advertisers know that their consumers are able to associate one thing to another; therefore, when an ad shows two things that seemingly different, they know that the consumer will find a connection between the two.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Barbara|last2=McQuarrie|first2=Edward|date=2004|title=Beyond visual metaphor: A new typology of visual rhetoric in advertising|url=https://courses.helsinki.fi/sites/default/files/course-material/4482592/22.3_MT2004%20Phillips.pdf|journal=Marketing Theory|volume=4|pages=113–136|doi=10.1177/1470593104044089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers also find ways to make sure that the consumer creates a positive association between what they are selling and whatever they are associating their product with.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In advertising, there are nine main classifications for how ads incorporate visual rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These classifications vary in complexity with the least complex being when advertisers juxtapose their product with another image (listed as 1,2,3).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After juxtaposition, the complexity is increased with fusion, which is when an advertiser's product is combined with another image (listed as 4,5,6).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most complex is replacement, which replaces the product with another product (listed as 7,8,9). Each of these sections also include a variety of richness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most rich would be connection, which shows how one product is associated with another product (listed as 1,4,7).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The next rich would be similarity, which shows how a product is like another product or image (listed as 2,5,8,).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, the most rich would be opposition, which is when advertisers show how their product is not like another product or image (listed as 3,6,9).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
# Advertisers can put their product next to another image in order to have the consumer associate their product with the presented image.
# Advertisers can put their product next to another image to show the similarity between their product and the presented image.
# Advertisers can put their product next to another image in order to show the consumer that their product is nothing like what the image shows.
# Advertisers can combine their product with an image in order to have the consumer associate their product with the presented image.
# Advertisers can combine their product with an image to show the similarity between their product and the presented image.
# Advertisers can combine their product with another image in order to show the consumer that their product is nothing like what the image shows.
# Advertisers can replace their product with an image to have the consumer associate their product with the presented image.
# Advertisers can replace their product with an image to show the similarity between their product and the presented image.
# Advertisers can replace their product with another image to show the consumer that their product is nothing like what the image shows.
Each of these categories varies in complexity, where putting a product next to a chosen image is the simplest and replacing the product entirely is the most complex.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The reason why putting a product next to a chosen image is the most simple is because the consumer has already been shown that there is a connection between the two.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In other words, the consumer just has to figure out why there is the connection. However, when advertisers replace the product that they are selling with another image, then the consumer must first figure out the connection and figure out why the connection was made.

=== Visual Arts ===
Visual [[Trope (linguistics)|trope]]s and tropic thinking are a part of visual rhetoric. While the field of visual rhetoric isn't necessarily concerned with the aesthetic choices of a piece, the same principles of visual composition may be applied to the study and practice of [[visual art]]. For example, [[figures of speech]], such as [[personification]] or [[allusion]], may be implemented in the creation of an artwork. A painting may ''allude'' to peace with an olive branch or to Christianity with a cross; in the same way, an artwork may employ personification by attributing human qualities to a non-human entity. In general, however, visual art is a separate field of study than visual rhetoric.[[File:Grafiti corazón.jpg|thumb|This image portrays a young person holding a heart. Instead of looking at this image literally, rhetoricians will observe the keyhole in the heart's center and think critically about this image's significance.]]

=== Graffiti ===
[[Graffiti]] is a "pictorial or visual inscription on a {{sic|public|ally}} accessible surface."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanauer|first=David|date=2011|title=The discursive construction of the separation wall at Abu Dis: Graffiti as political discourse|url=|journal=Journal of Language and Politics|volume=10|pages=301–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hanauer, Graffiti achieves three functions; the first is to allow marginalized texts to participate in the public discourse, the second is that graffiti serves the purpose of expressing openly "controversial contents", and the third is to allow "marginal groups to the possibility of expressing themselves publicly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanauer|first=David|date=2004|title=Silence, voice and erasure: psychological embodiment  in graffiti at the site of Prime Minister Rabin's assassination|url=|journal=The Arts in Psychotherapy|volume=31|pages=29–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates and Martin note that this form of rhetoric has been around even in ancient Pompeii; with an example from 79 A.D. reading, "Oh wall, so many men have come here to scrawl, I wonder that your burdened sides don't fall".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=John|date=1980|title=The thematic content of graffiti as a nonreactive indicator of male and female attitudes|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=16|issue=4|pages=300–315|doi=10.1080/00224498009551087}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gross and Gross indicated that graffiti is capable of serving a rhetorical purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gross|first=Daniel D.|last2=Gross|first2=Timothy|date=1993|title=TAGGING:Changing Visual Patterns and the Rhetorical Implications of a New Form of Graffiti|url=|journal=Review of General Semantics|volume=50|pages=251– 264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a more modern context, Wiens' (2014) research showed that graffiti can be considered an alternative way of creating rhetorical meaning for issues such as homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=HOME IS WHERE THE SPRAY-PAINTED HEART IS: GRAFFITI AS RHETORICAL RESISTANCE ON SKID ROW|last=Wiens|first=Brianna I.|work=Master thesis|publisher=ProQuest|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Ley and Cybriwsky graffiti can be an expression of territory, especially within the context of gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ley|first=David|date=1974|title=Urban Graffiti as Territorial Markers|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/39166347/ley1974.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1518993322&amp;Signature=ci5e6vVAM1PDYr%2FBHksRpCNFbkQ%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DURBAN_GRAFFITI_AS_TERRITORIAL_MARKERS.pdf|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=64|pages=491}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This form of Visual Rhetoric is meant to communicate meaning to anyone who so happens to see it, and due to its long history and prevalence, several styles and techniques have emerged to capture the attention of an audience.

=== Visual Rhetoric of Text ===
While visual rhetoric is usually applied to denote the non-textual artifacts, the use and presentation of words is still critical to understanding the visual argument as a whole. Beyond how a message is conveyed, the presentation of that message encompasses the study and practice of [[typography]]. Professionals in fields from graphic design to book publishing make deliberate choices about how a typeface looks, including but not limited to concerns of functionality, emotional evocations, and cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bierut, "Now You See It and Other Essays on Design." Princeton Architectural Press. New York. November 7, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memes ===
Though a relatively new way of using images, [[Internet meme|memes]] are one of the more pervasive forms of visual rhetoric. Considered by scholars to be a subversive form of communication,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Heidi|date=2013|title=Subversive Memes: Internet Memes as a Form of Visual Rhetoric|url=https://spir.aoir.org/index.php/spir/article/view/785/pdf|journal=Selected Papers of Internet Research|volume=14|pages=|via=AOiR}}&lt;/ref&gt; memes are a style of rhetoric that "combines elements of the semiotic and discursive approaches to analyze the persuasive elements of visual texts." Furthermore, memes fit into this rhetorical category because of their persuasive nature and their ability "to draw viewers into the argument’s construction via the viewer’s cognitive role in completing “visual enthymemes” to fill in the unstated premise."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to a 2013 study by Bauckhage, et al., the temporal nature of most memes and their "hype cycles" of popularity are in line with the behavior of a typical [[fad]] and suggest that after they proliferate and become mainstream, memes quickly lose their appeal and popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauckhage|first=Christian|last2=Kersting|first2=Kristian|last3=Hadiji|first3=Fabian|date=2013-06-28|title=Mathematical Models of Fads Explain the Temporal Dynamics of Internet Memes|url=https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM13/paper/viewPaper/6022|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the intrinsic factors of memes that affect their potential rise to popularity is similarity. A 2014 study conducted by researcher Michele Coscia concluded that meme similarity has a negative correlation to meme popularity, and can therefore be used, along with factors like social network structure, to explain the popularity of various memes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coscia|first=Michele|date=2014-09-26|title=Average is Boring: How Similarity Kills a Meme's Success|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06477|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|pages=6477|doi=10.1038/srep06477|pmid=25257730|pmc=4175728|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study by Mazambani, et al. concluded that other factors of influence in meme spread within an online community include how relevant a meme is to the "topic focus" or theme of the online community as well as whether the posting user is in a position of power within an online setting.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazambani|first=Gideon|last2=Carlson|first2=Maria A.|last3=Reysen|first3=Stephen|last4=Hempelmann|first4=Christian F.|date=2015|title=Impact of Status and Meme Content on the Spread of Memes in Virtual Communities|url=https://jyx.jyu.fi/dspace/handle/123456789/47918|journal=Human Technology: An Interdisciplinary Journal on Humans in ICT Environments|volume=11|issue=2|pages=148–164|doi=10.17011/ht/urn.201511113638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memes that are consistent with a group's theme and memes that originate from lower-status members within the group spread faster than memes that are inconsistent and are created by members of a group that are in positions of power.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Scholars like Jakub Nowak propose the idea of popular driven media as well. Successful memes originate and proliferate by means of anonymous internet users, not entities like corporations or political parties that have an agenda. For this reason, anonymity is linked to meme popularity and credibility. Nowak asserts that meme authorship should remain anonymous, because this is the only way to let people make the statements that they want to freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nowak|first=Jakub|date=2016|title=Internet meme as meaningful discourse: towards a theory of multiparticipant popular online content|url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=458796|journal=Central European Journal of Communication|language=English|volume=9|issue=16|pages=73–89|issn=1899-5101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
