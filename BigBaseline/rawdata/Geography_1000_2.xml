The '''Age of Sail''' (usually dated as 1571–1862) was a period roughly corresponding to the [[early modern period]] in which [[international trade]] and [[naval warfare]] were dominated by [[sailing ship]]s, lasting from the 16th to the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hms-trincomalee.co.uk/history/the-age-of-sail |title=The Age of Sail |publisher=[[HMS Trincomalee|HMS ''Trincomalee'']] |accessdate=12 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316114603/http://www.hms-trincomalee.co.uk/history/the-age-of-sail |archive-date=2016-03-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition==
Like most [[History by period|periodic eras]] the definition is inexact but close enough to serve as a general description. The age of sail runs roughly from the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, the last significant engagement in which [[oar]]-propelled [[galley]]s played a major role, to the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] in 1862, in which the steam-powered [[ironclad]] [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] destroyed the sailing ships [[USS Cumberland (1842)|USS ''Cumberland'']] and [[USS Congress (1841)|USS ''Congress'']], demonstrating that the advance of [[steam power]] had rendered sail power in warfare obsolete.

The [[Suez Canal]], in the Middle-East, which opened in 1869, was impractical for sailing ships, and made steamboats faster on the [[European-Asian sea route]].

==Golden Age of Sail==
The period between 1850 and the early 20th century when sailing vessels reached their peak of size and complexity is sometimes referred to as the "Golden Age of Sail".&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/AtoZ/rigs.html "Sailing Ship Rigs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228161737/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/AtoZ/rigs.html |date=2010-12-28 }}. [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the efficiency and use of commercial sailing vessels was at its peak&amp;mdash;immediately before [[steamboat]]s started to take trade away from sail.

==Decline==
Sailing ships sometimes continued to be an economical way to transport bulk cargo on long voyages into the 1920s, even if steamships also were used for such transports and became more and more common. Sailing ships do not require fuel or complex engines to be powered; thus they tended to be more independent from requiring a dedicated support base on the mainland. Crucially though, steam-powered ships held a speed advantage and were rarely hindered by adverse winds, freeing steam-powered vessels from the necessity of following [[trade wind]]s. As a result, cargo and supplies could reach a foreign port in half the time it took a sailing ship. 

Sailing vessels were pushed into narrower and narrower economic niches and gradually disappeared from commercial trade. Today, sailing vessels are only economically viable for small scale coastal fishing, along with recreational uses such as [[yachting]] and passenger sail excursion ships.

'''Antichthones''', in [[geography]], are those peoples who inhabit the [[antipodes]], regions on opposite sides of the [[Earth]]. The word is compounded of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ὰντὶ'' ("opposed") and ''χθών'' ("earth").

[[Image:Climatic zones and antipodes.png|180px|right]]
[[Classical Europe|Classical]] and [[Medieval Europe]] considered the Earth to be divided by the [[equator]] into two [[Sphere|hemispheres]], the northern and southern; those who inhabited one of these hemispheres were said to be antichthones to those of the other. This idea was expounded by [[Pomponius Mela|Mela]] and other Classical authors, though Christian writers, who believed that all people on earth must be descended from Adam, denied the possibility that any southern land, if it existed, could be inhabited by humans. [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], arguing from a position of scriptural [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]], wrote in his ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' "it is too absurd to say, that some men might have taken ship and traversed the whole wide ocean, and crossed from this side of the world to the other, and that thus even the inhabitants of that distant region are descended from that one first man."&lt;ref name="CITYO'GOD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dods |first1=Marcus (translator) |authorlink1=Philip Schaff |last2=St. Augustine |authorlink2=Augustine of Hippo |title=St. Augustine's City of God and Christian Doctrine |chapter=Book XVI, Chapter 9.—Whether We are to Believe in the Antipodes. |volume=2 |editor1=Philip Schaff |work=A Select Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church |publisher=The Christian Literature Publishing Co. |year=1890 |location=New York, New York |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XVI.9.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030702022213/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XVI.9.html |archivedate=July 2, 2003 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=August 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''arpent''' ({{IPA-fr|aʁpɑ̃}}) is a unit of [[length]] and a unit of [[area]]. It is a pre-[[Metric system|metric]] [[French units of measurement|French unit]] based on the Roman [[Ancient Roman units of measurement#Length|''actus'']]. It is used in [[Quebec]], some areas of the [[United States customary units|United States]] that were part of [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]], and in [[Mauritius]] and the [[Seychelles]].

==Etymology==

The word ''arpent'' is believed to derive from the [[Late Latin]] ''arepennis'' (equal to half a ''[[jugerum]]''), which in turn comes from the [[Gaulish]] *''are-penno''- ("end, extremity of a field").

==Unit of length==

There were various standard arpents. The most common were the arpent used in North America, which was defined as 180 [[Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution#Length|French feet]] (''{{lang|fr|pied}}'', of approximately {{convert|32.48|cm|in|disp=or}}), and the arpent used in Paris, which was defined as 220 French feet.

* In North America, 1 arpent = 180 French feet = about 192 [[English foot|English feet]] = about 58.47 [[metre]]s
* In Paris, 1 arpent = 220 French feet = about 234 English feet = about 71.46 metres

==Unit of area==

Historically, in North America, 1 (square) arpent (''{{lang|fr|arpent carré}}''), also known as a French acre, was 180 French feet × 180 French feet = 32,400 French square feet = about 3419 [[square metre]]s = about 0.845 English [[acre]]s.  Certain U.S. states have official definitions of the arpent which vary slightly:
* In [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Florida]], the official conversion is 1 arpent = {{convert|0.84628|acre|m2|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;In Louisiana, an arpent is equal to approximately 0.84628 acre; see ''Derouen v. Poirier'', 136 So. 2d 131, footnote 1 (La. 3d Cir. Ct. App. 1961) (''dicta'').&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]], the official conversion is 1 arpent = {{convert|0.8507|acre|m2|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Glossary of Geology|editor1=Julia A. Jackson |editor2=James P. Mehl |editor3=Klaus K. E. Neuendorf |publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=9780922152766|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfnSesBc-RgC&amp;pg=PA37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, the square arpent was 220 French feet × 220 French feet = 48,400 French square feet, about {{convert|5107|m2|acre|disp=or}}.

In Mauritius and Seychelles, an arpent is about 4220.87 [[square metre]]s, 0.4221 hectares, 1.043 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mauritius: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix|publisher=International Monetary Fund|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wqUP-8z25CoC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=mauritius+arpent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q5ME0mHg9h&amp;sig=Q6Npl1Drm-w208E2RC_Y6jm6d_g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9uIKjvYPWAhUHz2MKHcw9ApYQ6AEIWTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=mauritius%20arpent&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Louisiana==
In Louisiana, parcels of land known as ''arpent'' sections or French ''arpent'' land grants also pre-date the [[Public Land Survey System]] (PLSS), but are treated as PLSS sections. An ''arpent'' is a French measurement of approximately {{convert|192|ft|m}}, and a square arpent (also referred to as an ''arpent'') is about {{convert|0.84|acre|m2}}.

French arpent land divisions are long narrow parcels of land, also called [[ribbon farm|ribbon farms]], usually found along the navigable streams of southern Louisiana, and also found along major waterways in other areas. This system of land subdivision was begun by French settlers in the 18th century, according to typical French practice at the time and was continued by both the Spanish and by the American government after the acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase. A typical French arpent land division is 2 to 4 arpents wide along the river by 40 to 60 arpents deep, while the Spanish arpent land divisions tend to be 6 to 8 arpents wide by 40 arpents deep.

This method of land division provided each land-owner with river frontage as well as land suitable for cultivation and habitation. These areas are given numbers just like standard sections, although the section numbers frequently exceed the normal upper limit of 36.&lt;ref name="natlatlas"&gt;[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_plss.html The Public Land Survey System (PLSS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511182116/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_plss.html |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Azimuth-Altitude schematic.svg|right|350px|thumb|The azimuth is the angle formed between a reference direction (in this example north) and a [[sightline|line]] from the observer to a point of interest projected on the same plane as the reference direction orthogonal to the [[zenith]].]]

An '''azimuth''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-azimuth.ogg|ˈ|æ|z|ɪ|m|ə|θ}}) (from the pl. form of the Arabic noun "السَّمْت" ''as-samt'', meaning "the direction") is an [[Angle#Measuring angles|angular measurement]] in a [[spherical coordinate system]]. The [[vector space|vector]] from an observer ([[origin (mathematics)|origin]]) to a point of interest is [[graphical projection|projected]] [[perpendicular]]ly onto a [[reference plane]]; the angle between the projected vector and a reference vector on the reference plane is called the azimuth.

When used as a [[horizontal coordinate system|celestial coordinate]], the azimuth is the [[horizon]]tal direction of a [[star]] or other [[astronomical object]] in the [[sky]]. The star is the point of interest, the reference plane is the local area (e.g. a circular area 5&amp;nbsp;km in radius at [[sea level]]) around an observer on [[planetary surface|Earth's surface]], and the reference vector points to [[true north]]. The azimuth is the angle between the north vector and the star's vector on the [[horizontal plane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/azimuth |title=Azimuth |work=[[Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azimuth is usually measured in [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (°). The concept is used in [[navigation]], [[astrometry|astronomy]], [[engineering]], [[map]]ping, mining, and [[ballistics]].

==Navigation==
[[File:True North Mount Allen.fw.png|thumb|left|Azimuth Marker, Mount Allen (Sandstone Peak), Southern California, USA.]] In land navigation, azimuth is usually denoted [[alpha]], ''α'', and defined as a horizontal angle measured [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise]] from a north base line or ''[[meridian (geography)|meridian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Map Reading and Land Navigation'', FM 21–26, Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, Washington, D.C. (7 May 1993), ch. 6, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Map Reading and Land Navigation'', FM 21–26, Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, Washington, D.C. (28 March 1956), ch. 3, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; ''Azimuth'' has also been more generally defined as a horizontal angle measured clockwise from any fixed reference plane or easily established base direction line.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ch. 6 p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Advanced Map and Aerial Photograph Reading'', Headquarters, War Department, Washington, D.C. (17 September 1941), pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Advanced Map and Aerial Photograph Reading'', Headquarters, War Department, Washington, D.C. (23 December 1944), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the reference plane for an azimuth is typically [[true north]], measured as a 0° azimuth, though other angular units ([[grad (angle)|grad]], [[Angular mil|mil]]) can be used. Moving clockwise on a 360 degree circle, east has azimuth 90°, south 180°, and west 270°. There are exceptions: some navigation systems use south as the reference vector. Any direction can be the reference vector, as long as it is clearly defined.

Quite commonly, azimuths or compass bearings are stated in a system in which either north or south can be the zero, and the angle may be measured clockwise or anticlockwise from the zero. For example, a bearing might be described as "(from) south, (turn) thirty degrees (toward the) east" (the words in brackets are usually omitted), abbreviated "S30°E", which is the bearing 30 degrees in the eastward direction from south, i.e. the bearing 150 degrees clockwise from north. The reference direction, stated first, is always north or south, and the turning direction, stated last, is east or west. The directions are chosen so that the angle, stated between them, is positive, between zero and 90 degrees. If the bearing happens to be exactly in the direction of one of the [[cardinal point]]s, a different notation, e.g. "due east", is used instead.

==Cartographical azimuth==
The cartographical azimuth (in decimal degrees) can be calculated when the coordinates of 2 points are known in a flat plane ([[Spatial reference system|cartographical coordinates]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{180}{\pi} \operatorname{atan2}(X_2 - X_1, Y_2 - Y_1)&lt;/math&gt;

Remark that the reference axes are swapped relative to the (counterclockwise) mathematical [[polar coordinate system]] and that the azimuth is clockwise relative to the north.
This is the reason why the X and Y axis in the above formula are swapped.
If the azimuth becomes negative, one can always add 360°.

The formula in [[radian]]s would be slightly easier:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \operatorname{atan2}(X_2 - X_1, Y_2 - Y_1)&lt;/math&gt;

::'''Caveat:''' Most computer libraries (C/C++, Python, Java, ...) reverse the order of the [[atan2]] parameters.

===Calculating coordinates===
When the coordinates (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) of one point, the distance ''L'', and the azimuth ''α'' to another point (''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are known, one can calculate its coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  X_2 &amp;= X_1 + L \sin\alpha \\
  Y_2 &amp;= Y_1 + L \cos\alpha
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This is typically used in [[triangulation]].

==Calculating azimuth==
[[File:Bearing and azimuth along the geodesic.png|thumb|The azimuth between [[Cape Town]] and [[Melbourne]] along the [[geodesic]] (the shortest route) changes from 141° to 42°. [[Orthographic projection in cartography|Azimuthal orthographic projection]] and [[Miller cylindrical projection]].]]
We are standing at latitude &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1&lt;/math&gt;, longitude zero; we want to find the azimuth from our viewpoint to Point 2 at latitude &lt;math&gt;\varphi_2&lt;/math&gt;, longitude ''L'' (positive eastward). We can get a fair approximation by assuming the Earth is a sphere, in which case the azimuth ''α'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\tan\alpha = \frac{\sin L}{\cos\varphi_1 \tan\varphi_2 - \sin\varphi_1 \cos L}&lt;/math&gt;

A better approximation assumes the Earth is a slightly-squashed sphere (an ''[[oblate spheroid]]''); ''azimuth'' then has at least two very slightly different meanings. ''Normal-section azimuth'' is the angle measured at our viewpoint by a theodolite whose axis is perpendicular to the surface of the spheroid; ''geodetic azimuth'' is the angle between north and the ''geodesic''; that is, the shortest path on the surface of the spheroid from our viewpoint to Point 2. The difference is usually immeasurably small; if Point 2 is not more than 100&amp;nbsp;km away, the difference will not exceed 0.03 arc second.

Various websites will calculate geodetic azimuth; e.g., [http://www.ga.gov.au/geodesy/datums/vincenty_inverse.jsp GeoScience Australia site]. Formulas for calculating geodetic azimuth are linked in the [[Geographical distance#Ellipsoidal-surface formulae|distance article]].

Normal-section azimuth is simpler to calculate; Bomford says Cunningham's formula is exact for any distance {{citation needed|reason=No mention of (Guy) Bomford or Cunningham anywhere else on this page|date=September 2015}}. If ''f'' is the flattening for the chosen spheroid (e.g., {{frac|{{val|298.257223563}}}} for [[World Geodetic System|WGS84]]) then

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
         e^2 &amp;= f(2 - f) \\
     1 - e^2 &amp;= (1 - f)^2 \\
     \Lambda &amp;= \left(1 - e^2\right) \frac{\tan \varphi_2}{ \tan \varphi_1} + e^2 \sqrt{\cfrac {1 + \left(1 - e^2\right)\left(\tan \varphi_2\right)^2}{1 + \left(1 - e^2\right)\left(\tan \varphi_1\right)^2}} \\
  \tan\alpha &amp;= \frac{\sin L}{(\Lambda - \cos L)\sin\varphi_1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 then

: &lt;math&gt;\tan\alpha = \frac{\sin L}{\left(1 - e^2\right)\tan\varphi_2}&lt;/math&gt;

To calculate the azimuth of the sun or a star given its declination and hour angle at our location, we modify the formula for a spherical earth. Replace ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with declination and longitude difference with hour angle, and change the sign (since the hour angle is positive westward instead of east).

==Mapping==
There is a wide variety of [[Map projection#Azimuthal .28projections onto a plane.29|azimuthal map projections]]. They all have the property that directions (the azimuths) from a central point are preserved. Some navigation systems use south as the reference plane. However, any direction can serve as the plane of reference, as long as it is clearly defined for everyone using that system.

==Astronomy==
Used in celestial navigation, an ''azimuth'' is the direction of a celestial body from the observer.&lt;ref&gt;Rutstrum, Carl, The Wilderness Route Finder, University of Minnesota Press (2000), {{ISBN|0-8166-3661-3}}, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; In astronomy, an ''azimuth'' is sometimes referred to as a [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]]. In modern [[astronomy]] azimuth is nearly always measured from the north.
(The article on [[Celestial coordinate system|coordinate systems]], for example, uses a convention measuring from the south.) In former times, it was common to refer to azimuth from the south, as it was then zero at the same time that the [[hour angle]] of a [[star]] was zero. This assumes, however, that the star [[culmination|(upper) culminates]] in the south, which is only true if the star's [[declination]] is less than (i.e. further south than) the observer's [[latitude]].

==Other systems==

===Right ascension===
If, instead of measuring from and along the horizon, the angles are measured from and along the [[celestial equator]], the angles are called [[right ascension]] if referenced to the Vernal Equinox, or hour angle if referenced to the [[celestial meridian]].

===Horizontal coordinate===
In the [[horizontal coordinate system]], used in [[celestial navigation]] and [[satellite dish]] installation, azimuth is one of the two [[coordinate system|coordinates]]. The other is [[Altitude (astronomy)|altitude]], sometimes called elevation above the horizon. See also: [[Sat finder]].

===Polar coordinate===
In mathematics, the azimuth angle of a point in [[cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]] or [[spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] is the anticlockwise [[angle]] between the positive ''x''-axis and the projection of the [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] onto the ''xy''-[[plane (mathematics)|plane]]. The angle is the same as an angle in [[polar coordinates]] of the component of the vector in the ''xy''-plane and is normally measured in [[radian]]s rather than degrees. As well as measuring the angle differently, in mathematical applications [[theta]], ''θ'', is very often used to represent the azimuth rather than the representation of symbol  [[phi (letter)|phi]] ''φ''.

==Other uses of the word==
For [[tape drive|magnetic tape drives]], ''azimuth'' refers to the angle between the tape head(s) and tape.

In [[sound localization]] experiments and literature, the ''azimuth'' refers to the angle the sound source makes compared to the imaginary straight line that is drawn from within the head through the area between the eyes.

An [[azimuth thruster]] in [[shipbuilding]] is a [[propeller]] that can be rotated horizontally.

==Etymology of the word==
The word azimuth is in all European languages today. It originates from medieval Arabic ''al-sumūt'', pronounced ''as-sumūt'' in Arabic, meaning "the directions" (plural of Arabic ''al-samt'' = "the direction"). The Arabic word entered late medieval Latin in an astronomy context and in particular in the use of the Arabic version of the [[Astrolabe]] astronomy instrument. The word's first record in English is in the 1390s in ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. The first known record in any Western language is in Spanish in the 1270s in an astronomy book that was largely derived from Arabic sources, the ''[[Libros del saber de astronomía]]'' commissioned by [[King Alfonso X]] of Castile.&lt;ref&gt;"Azimuth" at [https://archive.org/stream/oed01arch#page/602/mode/1up ''New English Dictionary on Historical Principles'']; "azimut" at [http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/azimut ''Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales'']; "al-Samt" at [http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-samt-SIM_6591 ''Brill's Encyclopedia of Islam'']; "azimuth" at [http://englishwordsofarabicancestry.wordpress.com/#cite_note-39 EnglishWordsOfArabicAncestry.wordpress.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102020035/http://englishwordsofarabicancestry.wordpress.com/#cite_note-39 |date=January 2, 2014 }}. In Arabic the written ''al-sumūt'' is always pronounced ''as-sumūt'' (see [[Sun and moon letters|pronunciation of "al-" in Arabic]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marine sextant.svg|thumb|right|300px|A diagram of a nautical [[sextant]], a tool used in celestial navigation]]

'''Celestial navigation''', also known as '''astronavigation''', is the ancient and modern practice of [[position fixing]] that enables a navigator to transition through a space without having to rely on estimated calculations, or [[dead reckoning]], to know their position. Celestial [[navigation]] uses "sights", or angular measurements taken between a [[celestial body]] (e.g. the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], a [[planet]], or a [[star]]) and the visible [[horizon]]. The Sun is most commonly used, but navigators can also use the Moon, a planet, [[Polaris]], or one of 57 other [[navigational stars]] whose coordinates are tabulated in the [[nautical almanac]] and air [[almanac]]s.

Celestial navigation is the use of angular measurements (sights) between celestial bodies and the visible horizon to locate one's position in the [[Earth|world]], on land as well as at sea. At a given time, any celestial body is located directly over one point on the Earth's surface. The [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of that point is known as the celestial body's [[apparent place|geographic position]] (GP), the location of which can be determined from tables in the nautical or air almanac for that year.

The measured angle between the celestial body and the visible horizon is directly related to the distance between the celestial body's GP and the observer's position. After some computations, referred to as [[sight reduction]], this measurement is used to plot a [[position line|line of position]] (LOP) on a [[nautical chart|navigational chart]] or plotting work sheet, the observer's position being somewhere on that line. (The LOP is actually a short [[radius|segment]] of a very large circle on Earth that surrounds the GP of the observed celestial body. An observer located anywhere on the circumference of this circle on Earth, measuring the angle of the same celestial body above the horizon at that instant of time, would observe that body to be at the same angle above the horizon.) Sights on two celestial bodies give two such lines on the chart, intersecting at the observer's position (actually, the two circles would result in two points of intersection arising from sights on two stars described above, but one can be discarded since it will be far from the estimated position—see the figure at [[Celestial navigation#Example|example]] below).  Most navigators will use sights of three to five stars, if available, since that will result in only one common intersection and minimizes the chance of error. That premise is the basis for the most commonly used method of celestial navigation, referred to as the 'altitude-intercept method'.

There are several other methods of celestial navigation that will also provide position-finding using [[sextant]] observations, such as the noon sight, and the more archaic [[lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance method]]. [[Joshua Slocum]] used the lunar distance method during the first recorded single-handed circumnavigation of the world. Unlike the altitude-intercept method, the noon sight and lunar distance methods do not require accurate knowledge of time. The altitude-intercept method of celestial navigation requires that the observer know exact Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) at the moment of his observation of the celestial body, to the second—since for every four seconds that the time source (commonly a chronometer or, in aircraft, an accurate "[[hack watch]]") is in error, the position will be off by approximately one nautical mile.

==Example==
[[Image:Sun Moon (annotated).gif|right|thumb|300px]]
An example illustrating the concept behind the [[intercept method]] for determining one’s position is shown to the right. (Two other common methods for determining one’s position using celestial navigation are the [[longitude by chronometer]] and [[ex-meridian]] methods.) In the adjacent image, the two circles on the map represent lines of position for the Sun and Moon at 1200 [[GMT]] on October 29, 2005. At this time, a navigator on a ship at sea measured the Moon to be 56 degrees above the horizon using a [[sextant]]. Ten minutes later, the Sun was observed to be 40 degrees above the horizon. Lines of position were then calculated and plotted for each of these observations. Since both the Sun and Moon were observed at their respective angles from the same location, the navigator would have to be located at one of the two locations where the circles cross.

In this case the navigator is either located on the Atlantic Ocean, about {{convert|350|nmi|km}} west of Madeira, or in South America, about {{convert|90|nmi|km}} southwest of Asunción, Paraguay. In most cases, determining which of the two intersections is the correct one is obvious to the observer because they are often thousands of miles apart. As it is unlikely that the ship is sailing across South America, the position in the Atlantic is the correct one. Note that the lines of position in the figure are distorted because of the map’s projection; they would be circular if plotted on a globe.

An observer in the [[Gran Chaco]] point would see the Moon at the left of the Sun, and an observer in the Madeira point would see the  Moon at the right of the Sun.

==Angular measurement==
[[Image:Using sextant swing.gif|thumb|right|300px|Using a marine sextant to measure the altitude of the sun above the horizon]]
Accurate angle measurement evolved over the years. One simple method is to hold the hand above the horizon with one's arm stretched out. The width of the little finger is an angle just over 1.5 degrees elevation at extended arm's length and can be used to estimate the elevation of the sun from the horizon plane and therefore estimate the time until sunset. The need for more accurate measurements led to the development of a number of increasingly accurate instruments, including the [[Kamal (navigation)|kamal]], [[Mariner's astrolabe|astrolabe]], [[octant (instrument)|octant]] and [[sextant]]. The sextant and octant are most accurate because they measure angles from the horizon, eliminating errors caused by the placement of an instrument's pointers, and because their dual mirror system cancels relative motions of the instrument, showing a steady view of the object and horizon.

Navigators measure distance on the globe in [[degree (angle)|degree]]s, [[arcminute]]s and [[arcsecond]]s. A [[nautical mile]] is defined as 1852 meters, but is also (not accidentally) one minute of angle along a meridian on the Earth. Sextants can be read accurately to within 0.2 arcminutes, so the observer's position can be determined within (theoretically) 0.2 miles, about 400 yards (370 m). Most ocean navigators, shooting from a moving platform, can achieve a practical accuracy of 1.5 miles (2.8&amp;nbsp;km), enough to navigate safely when out of sight of land.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Practical navigation==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2011}}

Practical celestial navigation usually requires a [[marine chronometer]] to measure time, a [[sextant]] to measure the angles, an [[Nautical almanac|almanac]] giving schedules of the coordinates of celestial objects, a set of sight reduction tables to help perform the height and [[azimuth]] computations, and a chart of the region. [[File:Two ship's officers 'shoot' in one morning with the sextant, the sun altitude.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;Two nautical ship officers "shoot" in one morning with the sextant, the sun altitude]]&lt;/small&gt; With sight reduction tables, the only calculations required are addition and subtraction. Small handheld computers, laptops and even scientific calculators enable modern navigators to "reduce" sextant sights in minutes, by automating all the calculation and/or data lookup steps. Most people can master simpler celestial navigation procedures after a day or two of instruction and practice, even using manual calculation methods.

Modern practical navigators usually use celestial navigation in combination with [[satellite navigation]] to correct a [[dead reckoning]] track, that is, a course estimated from a vessel's position, course and speed. Using multiple methods helps the navigator detect errors, and simplifies procedures. When used this way, a navigator will from time to time measure the sun's altitude with a sextant, then compare that with a precalculated altitude based on the exact time and estimated position of the observation. On the chart, one will use the straight edge of a plotter to mark each position line. If the position line indicates a location more than a few miles from the estimated position, more observations can be taken to restart the dead-reckoning track.

In the event of equipment or electrical failure, taking sun lines a few times a day and advancing them by dead reckoning allows a vessel to get a crude running fix sufficient to return to port. One can also use the Moon, a planet, [[Polaris]], or one of 57 other [[navigational stars]] to track celestial positioning.

===Latitude===
[[Latitude]] was measured in the past either by measuring the altitude of the Sun at noon (the "noon sight"), or by measuring the altitudes of any other celestial body when crossing the meridian (reaching its maximum altitude when due north or south), and frequently by measuring the altitude of [[Polaris]], the north star (assuming it is sufficiently visible above the horizon, which it is not in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]). Polaris always stays within 1 degree of the [[celestial north pole]]. If a navigator measures the angle to Polaris and finds it to be 10 degrees from the horizon, then he is about 10 degrees north of the equator. This approximate latitude is then corrected using simple tables or almanac corrections to determine a latitude theoretically accurate to within a fraction of a mile. Angles are measured from the horizon because locating the point directly overhead, the [[zenith]], is not normally possible. When haze obscures the horizon, navigators use artificial horizons, which are horizontal mirrors of pans of reflective fluid, especially mercury historically. In the latter case, the angle between the reflected image in the mirror and the actual image of the object in the sky is exactly twice the required altitude.

===Longitude===
[[Longitude]] can be measured in the same way. If the angle to Polaris can be accurately measured, a similar measurement to a star near the eastern or western horizons will provide the longitude. The problem is that the Earth turns 15 degrees per hour, making such measurements dependent on time. A measure a few minutes before or after the same measure the day before creates serious navigation errors. Before good [[marine chronometer|chronometers]] were available, longitude measurements were based on the transit of the moon, or the positions of the moons of Jupiter. For the most part, these were too difficult to be used by anyone except professional astronomers. The invention of the modern chronometer by [[John Harrison]] in 1761 vastly simplified longitudinal calculation.

The longitude problem took centuries to solve and was dependent on the construction of a non-pendulum clock (as pendulum clocks cannot function accurately on a tilting ship, or indeed a moving vehicle of any kind). Two useful methods evolved during the 18th century and are still practised today: [[lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]], which does not involve the use of a chronometer, and use of an accurate timepiece or chronometer.

Presently, lay-person calculations of longitude can be made by noting the exact local time (leaving out any reference for Daylight Saving Time) when the sun is at its highest point in the sky.  The calculation of noon can be made more easily and accurately with a small, exactly vertical rod driven into level ground—take the time reading when the shadow is pointing due north (in the northern hemisphere).  Then take your local time reading and subtract it from GMT ([[Greenwich Mean Time]]) or the time in London, England.  For example, a noon reading (1200 hours) near central Canada or the US would occur at approximately 6 pm (1800 hours) in London.  The six-hour differential is one quarter of a 24-hour day, or 90 degrees of a 360-degree circle (the Earth).  The calculation can also be made by taking the number of hours (use decimals for fractions of an hour) multiplied by 15, the number of degrees in one hour.  Either way, it can be demonstrated that much of central North America is at or near 90 degrees west longitude.  Eastern longitudes can be determined by adding the local time to GMT, with similar calculations.

====Lunar distance====
{{Main|lunar distance (navigation)|l1=Lunar distance}}
The older method, called "'''lunar distances'''", was refined in the 18th century and employed with decreasing regularity at sea through the middle of the 19th century. It is only used today by sextant hobbyists and historians, but the method is theoretically sound, and can be used when a timepiece is not available or its accuracy is suspect during a long sea voyage. The navigator precisely measures the angle between the moon and the sun, or between the moon and one of several stars near the [[ecliptic]]. The observed angle must be corrected for the effects of refraction and parallax, like any celestial sight. To make this correction the navigator would measure the altitudes of the moon and sun (or star) at about the same time as the lunar distance angle. Only rough values for the altitudes were required. Then a calculation with logarithms or graphical tables requiring ten to fifteen minutes' work would convert the observed angle to a geocentric lunar distance. The navigator would compare the corrected angle against those listed in the almanac for every three hours of Greenwich time, and interpolate between those values to get the actual Greenwich time aboard ship. Knowing Greenwich time and comparing against local time from a common altitude sight, the navigator can work out his longitude.

====Use of time====
{{Main|Marine chronometer#Today|l1= Marine chronometer Today}}
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
The considerably more popular method was (and still is) to use an accurate timepiece to directly measure the time of a sextant sight. The need for accurate navigation led to the development of progressively more accurate chronometers in the 18th century (see [[John Harrison]]). Today, time is measured with a chronometer, a [[quartz clock|quartz watch]], a [[Time signal#Radio time signals|shortwave radio time signal]] broadcast from an [[atomic clock]], or the time displayed on a [[GPS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpsinformation.net/main/gpstime.htm|title=How accurate is the TIME DISPLAY on my GPS?|first=Joe|last=Mehaffey|date=|website=gpsinformation.net|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804120341/http://gpsinformation.net/main/gpstime.htm|archivedate=4 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Watch#Electronic movements|quartz wristwatch]] normally keeps time within a half-second per day. If it is worn constantly, keeping it near body heat, its rate of drift can be measured with the radio and, by compensating for this drift, a navigator can keep time to better than a second per month. Traditionally, a navigator checked his chronometer from his sextant, at a geographic marker surveyed by a professional astronomer. This is now a rare skill, and most [[harbourmaster]]s cannot locate their harbour's marker.

Traditionally, three chronometers were kept in [[gimbals]] in a dry room near the centre of the ship. They were used to set a [[hack watch]] for the actual sight, so that no chronometers were ever exposed to the wind and salt water on deck. Winding and comparing the chronometers was a crucial duty of the navigator. Even today, it is still logged daily in the ship's deck log and reported to the Captain before [[Ship's bell|eight bells]] on the forenoon watch (shipboard noon). Navigators also set the ship's clocks and calendar.

==Modern celestial navigation==
The celestial line of position concept was discovered in 1837 by [[Thomas Hubbard Sumner]] when, after one observation, he computed and plotted his longitude at more than one trial latitude in his vicinity – and noticed that the positions lay along a line. Using this method with two bodies, navigators were finally able to cross two position lines and obtain their position – in effect determining both latitude and longitude. Later in the 19th century came the development of the modern (Marcq St. Hilaire) [[intercept method]]; with this method the body height and azimuth are calculated for a convenient trial position, and compared with the observed height. The difference in arcminutes is the nautical mile "intercept" distance that the position line needs to be shifted toward or away from the direction of the body's subpoint. (The intercept method uses the concept illustrated in the example in the “How it works” section above.) Two other methods of reducing sights are the [[longitude by chronometer]] and the [[ex-meridian]] method.

While celestial navigation is becoming increasingly redundant with the advent of inexpensive and highly accurate satellite navigation receivers ([[GPS]]), it was used extensively in aviation until the 1960s, and [[marine navigation]] until quite recently. However; since a prudent mariner never relies on any sole means of fixing his position, many national maritime authorities still require deck officers to show knowledge of celestial navigation in examinations, primarily as a backup for electronic/satellite navigation. One of the most common current usages of celestial navigation aboard large merchant vessels is for compass calibration and error checking at sea when no terrestrial references are available.

The [[U.S. Air Force]] and [[U.S. Navy]] continued instructing military aviators on celestial navigation use until 1997, because:
* celestial navigation can be used independently of ground aids
* celestial navigation has global coverage
* celestial navigation can not be jammed (although it can be obscured by clouds)
* celestial navigation does not give off any signals that could be detected by an enemy &lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Air Force]] Pamphlet (AFPAM) 11-216, Chapters 8–13&lt;/ref&gt;

At another federal service academy, the US Merchant Marine Academy, there was no break in instruction in celestial navigation as it is required to pass the US Coast Guard License Exam to enter the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]]. It is also taught at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], most recently as Astronomy 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.harvard.edu/psadler/classes/astronomy-2-celestial-navigation – ''Astronomy 2 Celestial Navigation'' by Philip Sadler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122121834/http://scholar.harvard.edu/psadler/classes/astronomy-2-celestial-navigation |date=2015-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celestial navigation continues to be used by private yachtsmen, and particularly by long-distance cruising yachts around the world. For small cruising boat crews, celestial navigation is generally considered an essential skill when venturing beyond visual range of land. Although GPS (Global Positioning System) technology is reliable, offshore yachtsmen use celestial navigation as either a primary navigational tool or as a backup.

Celestial navigation was used in commercial aviation up until the early part of the jet age; early [[Boeing 747]]s had a "sextant port" in the roof of the cockpit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Pilita|title=The future of flying|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/dbd7f5d4-e3ad-11e4-9a82-00144feab7de.html#slide0|accessdate=19 April 2015|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=17 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614034443/http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/dbd7f5d4-e3ad-11e4-9a82-00144feab7de.html#slide0|archivedate=14 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was only phased out in the 1960s with the advent of [[inertial navigation]] and doppler navigation systems, and today's satellite-based systems which can locate the aircraft's position accurate to a 3-meter sphere with several updates per second.

A variation on terrestrial celestial navigation was used to help orient the [[Apollo spacecraft]] en route to and from the Moon. To this day, space missions such as the [[Mars Exploration Rover#Cruise stage navigation components|Mars Exploration Rover]] use [[star tracker]]s to determine the [[Attitude control (spacecraft)|attitude]] of the spacecraft.

As early as the mid-1960s, advanced electronic and computer systems had evolved enabling navigators to obtain automated celestial sight fixes. These systems were used aboard both ships and US Air Force aircraft, and were highly accurate, able to lock onto up to 11 stars (even in daytime) and resolve the craft's position to less than {{convert|300|ft|m}}. The [[SR-71]] high-speed [[reconnaissance aircraft]] was one example of an aircraft that used a combination of [[Astro-inertial navigation system|automated celestial and inertial navigation]]. These rare systems were expensive, however, and the few that remain in use today are regarded as backups to more reliable satellite positioning systems.

[[Intercontinental ballistic missile]]s use celestial navigation to check and correct their course (initially set using internal gyroscopes) while flying outside the Earth's [[atmosphere]]. The immunity to jamming signals is the main driver behind this seemingly archaic technique.

[[X-ray pulsar-based navigation|X-ray pulsar-based navigation and timing]] (XNAV) is an experimental navigation technique whereby the periodic [[X-ray]] signals emitted from [[X-ray pulsar|pulsars]] are used to determine the location of a vehicle, such as a spacecraft in deep space. A vehicle using XNAV would compare received X-ray signals with a database of known pulsar frequencies and locations. Similar to GPS, this comparison would allow the vehicle to triangulate its position accurately (±5&amp;nbsp;km). The advantage of using X-ray signals over [[radio waves]] is that [[X-ray telescopes]] can be made smaller and lighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/jun/04/pulsars-map-the-way-for-space-missions |title=Pulsars map the way for space missions |date=4 June 2014 |first=Tushna |last=Commissariat |publisher=[[Physics World]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018145025/http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/jun/04/pulsars-map-the-way-for-space-missions |archivedate=18 October 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/515321/an-interplanetary-gps-using-pulsar-signals |title=An Interplanetary GPS Using Pulsar Signals|date=23 May 2013 |publisher=[[MIT Technology Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Becker |first1=Werner |last2=Bernhardt |first2=Mike G. |last3=Jessner |first3=Axel |arxiv=1305.4842 |title=Autonomous Spacecraft Navigation With Pulsars |date=2013-05-21 |doi=10.2420/AF07.2013.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 November 2016 the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] launched an experimental pulsar navigation satellite called [[XPNAV 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/xpnav-1.htm |title=XPNAV 1 |work=Gunter's Space Page |first=Gunter |last=Krebs |access-date=2016-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101165228/http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/xpnav-1.htm |archivedate=2016-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-11-launches-xpnav-1-satellite/|title=Chinese Long March 11 launches first Pulsar Navigation Satellite into Orbit|date=10 November 2016|publisher=Spaceflight101.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824052232/http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-11-launches-xpnav-1-satellite/|archivedate=24 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEXTANT (Station Explorer for X-ray Timing and Navigation Technology) is a [[NASA]]-funded project developed at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] that is testing XNAV on-orbit on board the [[International Space Station]] in connection with the [[Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer|NICER]] project, launched on 3 June 2017 on the [[SpaceX CRS-11]] ISS resupply mission.&lt;ref name="nasa-nicer-manifest"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/news/nicer_whatsnew.html |title=NICER Manifested on SpaceX-11 ISS Resupply Flight |series=NICER News |publisher=NASA |date=December 1, 2015 |accessdate=June 14, 2017 |quote=Previously scheduled for a December 2016 launch on SpaceX-12, NICER will now fly to the International Space Station with two other payloads on SpaceX Commercial Resupply Services (CRS)-11, in the Dragon vehicle's unpressurized Trunk. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324025933/https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/news/nicer_whatsnew.html |archivedate=March 24, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celestial navigation trainer==
Celestial navigation trainers for aircraft crews combine a simple [[flight simulator]] with a [[planetarium]].

An early example is the [[Link Trainer|Link Celestial Navigation Trainer]], used in the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World War II|work=A Brief History of Aircraft Flight Simulation|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/bleep/SimHist4.html|accessdate=January 27, 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041209093839/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/bleep/SimHist4.html|archivedate=December 9, 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporal Tomisita "Tommye" Flemming-Kelly-U.S.M.C.-Celestial Navigation Trainer −1943/45|work=World War II Memories|url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Runway/9601/kelly.html|accessdate=January 27, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050119104703/http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Runway/9601/kelly.html|archivedate=2005-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Housed in a {{convert|45|ft|m}} high building, it featured a [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]] accommodating a whole [[bomber]] crew (pilot, navigator and bombardier). The cockpit offered a full array of [[measuring instrument|instruments]] which the [[aviator|pilot]] used to fly the simulated aeroplane. Fixed to a [[Astrodome (aviation)|dome]] above the cockpit was an arrangement of lights, some [[collimated]], simulating [[constellation]]s from which the navigator determined the plane's position. The dome's movement simulated the changing positions of the stars with the passage of time and the movement of the plane around the earth. The navigator also received simulated radio signals from various positions on the ground. Below the cockpit moved "terrain plates" – large, movable aerial photographs of the land below – which gave the crew the impression of flight and enabled the bomber to practise lining up bombing targets. A team of operators sat at a control booth on the ground below the machine, from which they could simulate [[weather]] conditions such as wind or cloud. This team also tracked the aeroplane's position by moving a "crab" (a marker) on a paper map.

The Link Celestial Navigation Trainer was developed in response to a request made by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in 1939. The RAF ordered 60 of these machines, and the first one was built in 1941. The RAF used only a few of these, leasing the rest back to the US, where eventually hundreds were in use.

'''Chorography''' (from [[wikt:χῶρος|χῶρος]] ''khōros'', "place" and [[wikt:γράφω|γράφειν]] ''graphein'', "to write") is the art of describing or mapping a region or district,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chorography|volume=6|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by extension such a description or map.&lt;ref name=Merriam-Webster&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chorography Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; This term derives from the writings of the ancient geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] and  [[Ptolemy]], where it meant the geographical description of regions. However, its resonances of meaning have varied at different times. Richard Helgerson states that "chorography defines itself by opposition to [[chronicle]]. It is the genre devoted to place, and chronicle is the genre devoted to time".&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson 1992, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Darrell Rohl prefers a broad definition of "the representation of space or place".&lt;ref&gt;Rohl 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ptolemy 16century.jpg|thumb|Ptolemy as imagined by a 16th-century artist]]

==Ptolemy's definition==
In his text of the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' (2nd century CE), Ptolemy defined [[geography]] as the study of the entire world, but chorography as the study of its smaller parts—provinces, regions, cities, or ports. Its goal was "an impression of a part, as when one makes an image of just an ear or an eye"; and it dealt with "the qualities rather than the quantities of the things that it sets down". Ptolemy implied that it was a ''graphic'' technique, comprising the making of views (not simply maps), since he claimed that it required the skills of a draftsman or landscape artist, rather than the more technical skills of recording "proportional placements". Ptolemy's most recent English translators, however, render the term as "regional cartography".&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Berggren and Alexander Jones (eds), ''Ptolemy's Geography'' (Princeton, 2000), pp. 57-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance revival==
Ptolemy's text was rediscovered in the west at the beginning of the fifteenth century, and the term "chorography" was revived by [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See Lucia Nuti, 'Mapping Places: Chorography and Vision in the Renaissance', in Denis Cosgrove (ed.), ''Mappings'' (London, 1999), pp. 90-108.&lt;/ref&gt; An early instance is a small-scale map of [[Great Britain|Britain]] in an early fifteenth-century manuscript, which is labelled a ''tabula chorographica''.&lt;ref&gt;British Library Harleian MS 1808, fol. 9v; reproduced in Catherine Delano-Smith and R.J.P Kain, ''English Maps: a History'' (London, 1999), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dee]] in 1570 regarded the practice as "an underling, and a twig of ''Geographie''", by which the "plat" [plan or drawing] of a particular place would be exhibited to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;John Dee, 'Mathematicall Praeface', in Euclid, ''The Elements of Geometrie'', trans. H. Billingsley (London, 1570), sig. A4r.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Camden by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William Camden]]
The term also came to be used, however, for ''written'' descriptions of regions.  These regions were extensively visited by the writer, who then combined local topographical description, summaries of the historical sources, and local knowledge and stories, into a text. The most influential example (at least in Britain) was probably [[William Camden]]'s ''Britannia'' (first edition 1586), which described itself on its title page as a ''Chorographica descriptio''. [[William Harrison (priest)|William Harrison]] in 1587 similarly described his own "Description of Britaine" as an exercise in chorography, distinguishing it from the historical/chronological text of Holinshed's [[Holinshed's Chronicles|''Chronicles'']] (to which the "Description" formed an introductory section).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Harrison |authorlink=William Harrison (priest) |chapter=An Historicall Description of the Iland of Britaine |editor-first=Raphael |editor-last=Holinshed |editor-link=Raphael Holinshed |title=The First and Second Volumes of Chronicles |edition=2nd |place=London |year=1587 |page=sig. [A2]v |url=http://english.nsms.ox.ac.uk/holinshed/texts.php?text1=1587_0002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Heylin]] in 1652 defined chorography as "the exact description of some Kingdom, Countrey, or particular Province of the same", and gave as examples [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]'s ''Description of Greece'' (2nd century AD); Camden's ''Britannia'' (1586); [[Lodovico Guicciardini]]'s ''Descrittione di  tutti i Paesi Bassi'' (1567) (on the [[Low Countries]]); and [[Leandro Alberti]]'s ''Descrizione d'Italia'' (1550).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Heylyn |authorlink=Peter Heylin |title=Cosmographie |location=London |year=1652 |page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camden's ''Britannia'' was predominantly concerned with the history and antiquities of Britain, and, probably as a result, the term chorography in English came to be particularly associated with [[antiquarian]] texts. [[William Lambarde]], [[John Stow]], [[John Hooker (English constitutionalist)|John Hooker]], [[Michael Drayton]], [[Tristram Risdon]], [[John Aubrey]] and many others used it in this way, arising from a gentlemanly [[topophilia]] and a sense of service to one's county or city, until it was eventually often applied to the genre of [[English county histories|county history]]. A late example was William Grey's ''Chorographia'' (1649), a survey of the antiquities of the city of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Even before Camden's work appeared, [[Andrew Melville]] in 1574 had referred to chorography and [[chronology]] as the "twa lights" [two lights] of [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=G. R. |editor-last=Kinloch |editor-link=George Ritchie Kinloch |title=The Diary of Mr James Melvill, 1556–1601 |publisher=Bannatyne Club |location=Edinburgh |year=1829 |pages=38–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saxton pamberforest.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Example of [[Christopher Saxton]]'s cartography]]
However, the term also continued to be used for maps and map-making, particularly of sub-national or [[Counties of England|county]] areas. William Camden praised the county mapmakers [[Christopher Saxton]] and [[John Norden]] as "most skilfull Chorographers";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Camden |translator-first=Philemon |translator-last=Holland |translator-link=Philemon Holland |title=Britain, or a Chorographicall Description of the most flourishing Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Ilands adjoyning, out of the depth of Antiquitie |chapter=The Author to the Reader |place=London |year=1610 |page=sig. [*5]v |url=http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/fronteng.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Plot]] in 1677&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Plot |authorlink=Robert Plot |title=The Natural History of Oxford-shire |location=Oxford |year=1677 |page=299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer)|Christopher Packe]] in 1743&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Packe |authorlink=Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer) |title=A New Philosophico-Chorographical Chart of East-Kent |location=[Canterbury] |year=1743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both referred to their county maps as chorographies.

By the beginning of the eighteenth century the term had largely fallen out of use in all these contexts, being superseded for most purposes by either "[[topography]]" or "[[cartography]]". [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary]]'' (1755) made a distinction between geography, chorography and topography, arguing that geography dealt with large areas, topography with small areas, but chorography with intermediary areas, being "less in its object than geography, and greater than topography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Samuel |last=Johnson |authorlink=Samuel Johnson |title=A Dictionary of the English Language |location=London |year=1755 |chapter=chorography |page=373 |url=https://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/page-view/?i=373 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, the term is only rarely found in English by this date.

[[File:Ferdinand von Richthofen.jpg|thumb|upright|Ferdinand von Richthofen]]

==Modern usages==
In more technical geographical literature, the term had been abandoned as city views and [[city map]]s became more and more sophisticated and demanded a set of skills that required not only skilled draftsmanship but also some knowledge of scientific [[surveying]]. However, its use was revived for a second time in the late nineteenth century by the geographer [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]]. He regarded chorography as a specialization within geography, comprising the description through field observation of the particular traits of a given area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html GEO 466/566: The Profession of Geography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211150811/http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html |date=2012-02-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also now widely used by historians and literary scholars to refer to the [[Early modern period|early modern]] genre of topographical and antiquarian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Particularly influential in reviving the term has been Helgerson 1992, esp. pp. 105-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''doldrums''' is a [[colloquial]] expression derived from historical [[maritime history|maritime]] usage, which refers to those parts of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] affected by a low-pressure area around the [[equator]] where the [[prevailing winds]] are calm.  The doldrums are also noted for calm periods when the winds disappear altogether, trapping [[sailing ship]]s for periods of days or weeks.  The term appears to have arisen in the eighteenth century, when trans-equator sailing voyages became more common.  Since this zone is where two [[trade winds]] meet, it is also called the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]].  They roughly lie between latitudes five degree north and south.

==Maritime usage==
In maritime usage, the low pressure characteristics of the doldrums are caused by the expanding atmosphere due to heating at the equator, which makes the air rise and travel north and south high in the atmosphere, until it subsides again in the [[horse latitudes]].  Some of that air returns to the doldrums through the [[trade winds]].  This process can lead to light or variable winds and more severe weather, in the form of [[squall]]s, thunderstorms, and hurricanes.  The doldrums are also noted for calm periods when the winds disappear altogether, trapping sail-powered boats for periods of days or weeks.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Colloquial usage==
Colloquially, the "doldrums" are a state of inactivity, mild depression, listlessness, or stagnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/doldrums |title=Doldrums|work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word may be derived from ''dold,'' an archaic term meaning "stupid", and ''-rum(s)'', a noun suffix found in such words as "[[tantrum]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/doldrums|work=Random House Dictionary|publisher= Random House, Inc.|date= 2011|title=Doldrums}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature and writing==
The doldrums are notably described in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' (1798), in [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s novel ''[[Desolation Island (novel)|Desolation Island]]'' (1978), and in [[Laura Hillenbrand]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption]]'' (2010). Additionally, the Doldrums are a fictional place in [[Norton Juster]]'s novel ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'' (1961).

[[Noel Gallagher]] used the term to describe a woman stuck in the decade of the [[1960s]] in the song [[Holy Mountain (song)|Holy Mountain]] “get out of the doldrums, baby now!”

The '''draft''' or '''draught''' of a ship's [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] is the vertical distance between the [[waterline]] and the bottom of the hull ([[keel]]), with the thickness of the hull included; in the case of not being included the draft outline would be obtained.  Draft determines the minimum depth of water a ship or boat can safely navigate. The draft can also be used to determine the weight of the cargo on board by calculating the total displacement of water and then using [[Archimedes' principle]]. A table made by the shipyard shows the water displacement for each draft. The density of the water (salt or fresh) and the content of the ship's [[Bunkering|bunkers]] has to be taken into account.  The closely related term "trim" is defined as the difference between the forward and aft drafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/nomenclature-of-naval-vessels/glossary-of-shipbuilding-terms-s-z.html|title=Glossary of Shipbuilding Terms S-Z|publisher=US Navy Naval History and Heritage Command|accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The draft aft ([[stern]]) is measured in the [[Length between perpendiculars|perpendicular of the stern]].
* The draft forward ([[bow (ship)|bow]]) is measured in the perpendicular of the bow.
* The mean draft is obtained by calculating from the averaging of the stern and bow drafts, with correction for water level variation and value of the position of F{{what|date=October 2016}} with respect to the average perpendicular.{{fact|date=October 2016}}
* The trim of a ship is the difference between the forward and aft draft. When the aft draft is greater the vessel is deemed to have a negative trim, and it has a positive trim when the forward draft is the greater.&lt;ref name="derrett-1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Derrett|first=Captain D R|title=Ship Stability for Masters and Mates|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier|location=Sixth|pages=143–144|chapter=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a case it is often referred to as being ''down-by-the-head''.

In commercial ship operations, the ship will usually quote the mean draft as the vessel's draft. However in navigational situations, the maximum draft, usually the aft draft, will be known on the bridge and will be shared with the [[maritime pilot|pilot]]. 

=== Variations ===
The draft of a ship can be affected by multiple factors, not considering the rise and fall of the ship by displacement:
* Variation by trim
* Variation by [[list (watercraft)|list]]
* Variation by [[sea level|water level]] change{{Clarify|date=March 2010}}
* Allowance of fresh water draft variation by passage from fresh to sea water or vice versa
* Heat variation in navigating shallow waters{{fact|date=October 2016}}
* Variation as a result of a ship moving in shallow waters, or [[squat effect|squat]]

== Draft scale ==
The drafts are measured with a "banded" scale, from bow and to stern, and for some ships, the average perpendicular measurement is  also used.  The scale may use traditional English units or metric units.  If the English system ([[Imperial units]]) is used, the bottom of each marking is the draft in feet and markings are 6 inches high.  In metric marking schemes, the bottom of each draft mark is the draft in [[decimeters]] and each mark is one decimeter high.

==Implications==

=== Large ships ===
Larger ships try to maintain an average water draft when they are light (without [[cargo]]), in order to make a better sea crossing and reduce the effects of the wind (high center of velic force). In order to achieve this they use [[sailing ballast]]s to stabilize the ship, following the unloading of cargo.

The water draft of a large ship has little direct link with its stability because stability depends solely on the respective positions of the [[metacenter]] of the hull and the center of gravity. It is also true, however, that a "light" ship has quite high stability which can lead to implying too much rolling of the ship (due to memory). A fully laden ship (with a large draft) can have either a strong or weak stability, depending upon the manner by which the ship is loaded (height of the [[center of gravity]]).

The draft of ships can be increased when the ship is in motion in shallow water, a phenomenon known as [[squat (shipping term)|squat]] (nautical term for the hydrodynamic effect of lower pressure pulling the ship down as it moves).

Draft is a significant factor limiting navigable waterways, especially for large vessels. This includes many shallow coastal waters and reefs, but also some major shipping lanes. [[Panamax]] class ships—the largest ships able to transit the [[Panama Canal]]—do have a draft limit (and an "air draft" limit for passing under bridges) but are usually limited by [[beam (nautical)|beam]], or sometimes [[length overall]],  for fitting into [[lock (water transport)|lock]]s. However, ships can be longer, wider and higher in the [[Suez Canal]], the limiting factor for [[Suezmax]] ships is draft. Some [[supertanker]]s are able to transit the Suez Canal when unladen or partially laden, but not when fully laden.

Canals are not the only draft-limited shipping lanes. A [[Malaccamax]] ship, is the deepest draft able to transit the very busy but relatively shallow [[Strait of Malacca]]. The Strait  only allows ships to have {{convert|.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} more draft than the Suez Canal. [[Capesize]], [[Ultra Large Crude Carrier]]s and a few [[Chinamax]] carriers, are some of the ships that have too deep a draft when laden, for either the Strait of Malacca or the Suez Canal.

=== Pleasure boats ===
A ''small draft'' allows [[pleasure boat]]s to navigate through shallower water. This makes it possible for these boats to access smaller ports, to travel along rivers and even to 'beach' the boat.

A ''large draft'' ensures a good level of stability in strong wind, as the center of gravity is lower (ballast over the keel of the boat). For example: Ballasts placed very low in the keel of a boat such as a [[dragon boat]] with a draft of 1.20 m for a length of 8.90 m.

A boat like a [[catamaran]] can mitigate the problem by retrieving good stability in a small draft, but the width of the boat increases.

=== Submarines ===
For [[submarines]], which can submerge to different depths at sea, a term called [[keel depth]] is used, specifying the current distance from the water surface to the bottom of the submarine's keel.  It is used in navigation to avoid underwater obstacles and hitting the ocean floor, and as a standard point on the submarine for depth measurements.

Submarines usually also have a specified draft used while operating on the surface, for navigating in harbors and at docks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2910">The terms '''easting''' and '''northing''' are [[Geography|geographic]] [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] for a point. Easting refers to the [[east]]ward-measured distance (or the ''x''-[[coordinate]]), while northing refers to the [[north]]ward-measured distance (or the ''y''-coordinate). When using common projections such as the [[transverse Mercator projection]], these are distances [[Map projection|projected]] on an imaginary surface similar to a bent sheet of paper, and are not the same as distances measured on the [[Figure of the Earth|curved surface of the Earth]].
[[File:Utm-zones.jpg|thumb|UTM-zones]]

Easting and northing coordinates are commonly measured in metres from the axes of some [[datum (geodesy)#Horizontal datum|horizontal datum]]. However, other units (e.g., [[survey feet]]) are also used. The coordinates are most commonly associated with the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system#Locating a position using UTM coordinates|Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system]] (UTM), which has unique zones that cover the Earth to provide detailed referencing.

==Notation and conventions==
Locations can be found using easting/northing (or '' x'', ''y'') pairs. The pair is usually represented conventionally with easting first, northing second.

For example, the peak of [[Mount Assiniboine]] (at {{coord|50|52|10|N|115|39|03|W}}) in UTM Zone 11 is represented by &lt;code&gt;11U 594934 5636174&lt;/code&gt;. Other conventions can also be used, such as a truncated grid reference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bivouac.com/PgxPg.asp?PgxId=155 |title=Truncated Grid References |publisher=Bivouac.com - Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia|date=2006-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would shorten the example coordinates to &lt;code&gt;949-361&lt;/code&gt;.

Negative northing and easting values indicate a position due south and west of the origin, respectively.

{{anchor|False origin}}{{anchor|Natural origin}}Usually associated with a map projection is a ''natural origin'', e.g., at which the ellipsoid and flat map surfaces coincide.&lt;ref name=OGP7_2&gt;{{cite web|title=Geomatics  Guidance Note Number 7, part 2    Coordinate Conversions and Transformations including Formulas|url=http://info.ogp.org.uk/geodesy/guides/docs/G7-2.pdf|publisher=International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP)|accessdate=5 March 2014|pages=9–10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306005736/http://info.ogp.org.uk/geodesy/guides/docs/G7-2.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that the northing and easting coordinates on a map are not negative, map projections may set up a ''false origin'', specified in terms of ''false northing'' and ''false easting'' values, that offset the true origin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5588">An '''extreme environment''' contains conditions that are hard to survive for most known [[life form]]s. These conditions may be extremely high or low [[temperature]] or [[pressure]]; high or low content of [[oxygen]] or [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[atmosphere]]; high levels of [[radiation]], [[acidity]], or [[alkalinity]]; absence of water; water containing a high concentration of salt or sugar; presence of [[sulphur]], [[petroleum]], and other [[toxic]] substances.

Examples of extreme environments include the [[geographical pole]]s, very arid [[deserts]], [[volcano]]es, deep [[ocean trench]]es, [[upper atmosphere]], [[Mt Everest]], [[outer space]], and the environments of every [[planet]] in the [[Solar System]] except the [[Earth]]. Any organisms living in these conditions are often very well adapted to their living circumstances, which is usually a result of long-term evolution. Physiologists have long known that organisms living in extreme environments are especially likely to exhibit clear examples of evolutionary adaptation because of the presumably intense past natural selection they have experienced.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, Jr., T., and P. A. Carter. 1994. Evolutionary physiology. Annual Review of Physiology 56:579–621.&lt;/ref&gt;

==On Earth==
The distribution of extreme environments on [[Earth]] has varied through [[geological time]]. Humans generally do not inhabit extreme environments. There are organisms referred to as [[extremophile]]s that do live in such conditions and are so well-adapted that they readily grow and multiply.

==Beyond Earth==
Most of the moons and planets in the [[Solar System]] are also extreme environments. [[Astrobiology|Astrobiologists]] have not yet found life in any environments beyond Earth, though experiments have shown that [[tardigrades]] can survive the harsh vacuum and intense radiation of outer space. The conceptual modification of  conditions in locations beyond Earth, to make them more habitable by humans and other terrestrial organisms, is known as [[terraforming]].

==Types==
Among extreme environments are [[alkaline]], [[acidic]], extremely cold, extremely hot, [[hyper-saline]], places without water or [[oxygen]], and places altered by humans, such as mine [[tailings]] or oil impacted habitats.

* Alkaline: broadly conceived as natural [[habitats]] above pH 9 whether persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time.
* Acidic: broadly conceived as natural habitats below pH 5 whether persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time.
* Extremely cold: broadly conceived habitats periodically or consistently below -17&amp;nbsp;°C either persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time. Includes montane sites, polar sites, and deep ocean habitats.
* Extremely hot: broadly conceived habitats periodically or consistently in excess of 40&amp;nbsp;°C either persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time. Includes sites with [[geological thermal]] influences such as Yellowstone and comparable locations worldwide or deep-sea vents.
* Hypersaline: (high salt) environments with salt concentrations greater than that of seawater, that is, &gt;3.5%. Includes salt lakes.
* Under pressure: broadly conceived as habitats under extreme hydrostatic pressure — i.e. aquatic habitats deeper than 2000 meters and enclosed habitats under pressure. Includes habitats in oceans and deep lakes.
* Radiation: broadly conceived as habitats exposed to abnormally high [[radiation]] or of radiation outside the normal range of light. Includes habitats exposed to high UV and IR radiation.
* Without water: broadly conceived as habitats without free water whether persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time. Includes hot and cold desert environments, and some endolithic habitats.
* Without oxygen: broadly conceived as habitats without free oxygen - whether persistently, or with regular frequency, or for protracted periods of time. Includes habitats in deeper sediments.
* Altered by humans, i.e. anthropogenically impacted habitats. Includes mine tailings, oil impacted habitats, and pollution by [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s or [[organic compound]]s.

[[File:Visual-fix-by-three-bearings.png|thumb|right|Visual fix by three bearings plotted on a nautical chart]]In [[position fixing]] [[navigation]], a '''position fix''' (PF) or simply a '''fix''' is a position derived from measuring in relation to external reference points.

In nautical applications, the term is generally used with manual or visual techniques such as the use of intersecting visual or radio [[position line]]s rather than the use of more automated and accurate electronic methods such as [[GPS]]; in aviation, use of electronic navigation aids is more common. A visual fix can be made by using any sighting device with a [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] indicator. Two or more objects of known position are sighted, and the bearings recorded. Bearing lines are then plotted on a chart through the locations of the sighted items. The intersection of these lines is the current position of the vessel.

Usually, a fix is where two or more position lines intersect at any given time. If three position lines can be obtained, the resulting "cocked hat", where the three lines do not intersect at the same point, but create a triangle, gives the navigator an indication of the accuracy.

The most accurate fixes occur when the position lines are at right angles to each other.

Fixes are a necessary part of navigation by [[dead reckoning]] because dead reckoning relies on estimates of [[speed]] and [[course (navigation)|course]]. The fix confirms the actual position during a journey. The fix itself can introduce inaccuracies if the reference point is not correctly identified or is inaccurately measured.

'''Frederick Albert Cook''' (June 10, 1865&amp;nbsp;– August 5, 1940) was an American explorer, physician, and [[ethnographer]], noted for his claim of having reached the [[North Pole]] on April 21, 1908. This was nearly a year before [[Robert Peary]], who reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909. Both men's accounts were disputed for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 2009, pp. 58–69.&lt;/ref&gt; His expedition did discover [[Meighen Island]], the only discovery of an island in the [[North American Arctic|American Arctic]] by a United States expedition.

In December 1909, after reviewing Cook's limited records, a commission of the [[University of Copenhagen]] ruled his claim unproven. In 1911, Cook published a memoir of his expedition, continuing his claim. His account of reaching [[Denali|Mount McKinley]]'s summit has also been discredited.

== Biography ==
Cook's birthplace is often listed as [[Callicoon, New York]], but he was actually born in [[Hortonville, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryce 1997, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were recent German immigrants who anglicized their name by adopting the phonetic version of their surname. He attended [[Columbia University]] and received his doctorate from [[New York University Medical School]] in 1890. Cook married Libby Forbes in 1889. She died two years later. In 1902, on his 37th birthday, he married Marie Fidele Hunt. They had two daughters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/frederick-albert-cook-explorer-and-physician-usa-his-news-photo/501373901|title=Ruth and Helene Cook|work=Haeckel Collection|publisher=Getty Images|accessdate=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and divorced in 1923.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Early expeditions ===
Cook was the surgeon on [[Robert Peary]]'s Arctic expedition of 1891–1892, and on the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] of 1897–1899. He contributed to saving the lives of its crew members when their ship—the {{RV|Belgica|1884|2}}—was ice-bound during the winter, as they had not prepared for such an event. It became the first expedition to winter in the Antarctic region. To prevent [[scurvy]], Cook went hunting to keep the crew supplied with fresh meat.

In 1897, Cook twice visited [[Tierra del Fuego]], where he met Anglican missionary [[Thomas Bridges (Anglican missionary)|Thomas Bridges]]. They studied the [[Ona people|Ona]] and [[Yahgan]], with whom Bridges had worked for two decades, during which time he had prepared a manuscript on their language's grammar and a dictionary of more than 30,000 words. Cook borrowed the manuscript for reference but failed to return it before Bridges' death in 1898. Several years later, he tried to publish the dictionary as his own.&lt;ref name="parson"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/05/21/104935739.pdf "Cook Tried to Steal Parson's Life Work"]. ''New York Times'', May 21, 1910. Accessed October 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mount McKinley summit ===
[[File:Fakepeak.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Alleged photo of McKinley's summit, now known as [[Fake Peak]]]]
In 1903, he led an expedition to [[Mount McKinley]] during which he circumnavigated the Denali range. He made a second journey in 1906, after which he claimed to have achieved the first summit of its peak with one other expedition crew member. Other members, including Belmore Browne, whom Cook had left on the lower mountain, immediately but privately expressed doubt. Cook's claims were not publicly challenged until 1909 when the dispute with Peary over the North Pole claim erupted, with Peary's supporters claiming Cook's McKinley ascent was also fraudulent.

Contrary to [[Hudson Stuck]] in 1913, Cook had not taken photographs from atop McKinley. His alleged photo of the summit was found to have been taken on [[Fake Peak|a small outcrop on a ridge beside the Ruth Glacier]], 19 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf "An aerial photograph by Bradford Washburn"]. ''DIO''. '''7''' (2). p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1909, [[Ed Barrill]], Cook's sole companion during the 1906 climb, signed an affidavit denying that they had reached the summit. In the late 20th century, historians found that he was paid by Peary supporters to do so. (Henderson writes that this fact was covered up at the time, but Bryce says that it was never a secret.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/vols/w93.pdf ''DIO'']. '''9''' (3). p. 129. note 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Up until a month before, Barrill had consistently asserted that he and Cook had reached the summit. His 1909 affidavit included a map correctly locating what became called [[Fake Peak]], featured in Cook's "summit" photo, and showing that he and Cook had turned back at the Gateway.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf ''DIO'']. '''7''' (2). p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Climber [[Bradford Washburn]] has gathered data, repeated the climbs, and taken new photos to evaluate Cook's 1906 claim. Between 1956 and 1995, Washburn and Brian Okonek identified the locations of most of the photographs Cook took during his 1906 Denali foray and took new photos at the same spots. In 1997 Bryce identified the locations of the remaining photographs, including Cook's "summit" photograph;&lt;ref&gt;Compare rock-by-rock the left side of Cook's 1906 "summit" photo to the corresponding parts of the 1957 photo by Adams Carter and Bradford Washburn. Photos juxtaposed in Bryce, R. (1999). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w93.pdf ''DIO'']. '''9''' (3). p. 116. Compare also the background features in Cook's "summit" photo versus those in his own photo taken a few minutes later (towards the same direction) from the top of Fake Peak: Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf ''DIO'']. '''7''' (2). figure 4 versus figure 18; detailed-blowup comparisons in figures 6 and 8.&lt;/ref&gt; none were taken anywhere near the summit. Washburn showed that none of Cook's 1906 photos were taken past the "Gateway" (north end of the Great Gorge), 12 horizontal bee-line miles from Denali and 3 miles below its top.

An expedition by the Mazama Club in 1910 reported that Cook's map departed abruptly from the landscape at a point when the summit was still 10 miles distant. Critics of Cook's claims have compared Cook's map of his alleged 1906 route with the landscape of the last 10 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf ''DIO'']. '''7''' (3). pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Cook's descriptions of the summit ridge are variously claimed to bear no resemblance to the mountain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Dishonorable Dr. Cook: Debunking the Notorious Mount McKinley Hoax | first = Bradford | last = Washburn | authorlink = Bradford Washburn |author2=Peter Cherici | year = 2001 | location = Seattle | publisher = Mountaineers Books | oclc = 47054650}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to have been verified by many subsequent climbers.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson (2005) p.282&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1970s, climber [[Hans Waale]] found a route which fit Cook's narrative and descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf Bryce (1997) ''DIO''] p.73&lt;/ref&gt; Three decades later, in 2005 and 2006, this route was successfully climbed by a group of Russian mountaineers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shparo.com/Cook/Cook_main.htm "Following the traces of Dr. Frederick Cook"], SH Paro&lt;/ref&gt;

No evidence of Cook's purported journey between the "Gateway" and the summit has been found. His claim to have reached the summit is not supported by his photos' vistas, his two sketch maps' markers, and peak-numberings for points attained,&lt;ref&gt;Bryce. (1997). ''DIO'' pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; nor by his compass bearings, barometer readings, route-map or camp trash. However, samples of all such evidence have been found short of the Gateway.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, R. (1999). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w93.pdf ''DIO'']. '''9''' (3). pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Pole ===
[[File:Frederick Cook's 1909 arctic expedition.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Photo allegedly taken at, or near, the North Pole]]
After the Mount Denali expedition, Cook returned to the [[Arctic]] in 1907. He planned to attempt to reach the [[North Pole]], although he did not announce his intention until August 1907, when he was already in the Arctic. He left [[Annoatok]], a small settlement in the north of [[Greenland]], in February 1908. Cook claimed that he reached the pole on April 22, 1908, after traveling north from [[Axel Heiberg Island]], taking with him only two Inuit men, Ahpellah and Etukishook. On the journey south, he claimed to have been cut off from his intended route to Annoatok by open water. Living off local game, his party was forced to push south to [[Jones Sound]], spending the open water season and part of the winter on [[Devon Island]]. From there they traveled north, eventually crossing [[Nares Strait]] to Annoatok on the Greenland side in the spring of 1909. They said they almost died of starvation during the journey.

Cook and his two companions were gone from Annoatok for 14 months, and their whereabouts in that period is a matter of intense controversy. In the view of Canadian historian [[Pierre Berton]] (Berton, 2001), Cook's story of his trek around the Arctic islands is probably legitimate. Other writers have relied on later accounts told by Cook's companions to investigators, who seemed to present another view.

There are striking similarities between Ahpellah and Etukishook's sketched route of their journey south, and the route taken by the fictional shipwrecked explorers in [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[The Adventures of Captain Hatteras]]''. For example, the route the two Inuit traced on a map goes over both the Pole of Cold and the wintering site of the fictional expedition. Both expeditions went to the same area of [[Jones Sound]] in hopes of finding a whaling ship to take them to civilization. For details, see Osczevski (2003).

Cook's claim was initially widely believed, but it was disputed by Cook's rival polar explorer [[Robert Peary]], who claimed to have reached the North Pole in April 1909. Cook initially congratulated Peary for his achievement, but Peary and his supporters launched a campaign to discredit Cook. They enlisted the aid of socially prominent persons outside the field of science, such as [[American football|football]] [[Coach (sport)|coach]] [[Fielding H. Yost]] (as related in [[Fred Russell]]'s 1943 book, ''I'll Go Quietly'').

[[File:Picture of Frederick Cook.jpg|thumb|Cook in arctic gear]]
Cook never produced detailed original navigational records to substantiate his claim to have reached the North Pole. He said that his detailed records were part of his belongings, contained in three boxes, which he left at Annoatok in April 1909. He had left them with [[Harry Whitney]], an American hunter who had traveled to Greenland with Peary the previous year due to the lack of manpower for a second sledge-journey 700 miles south to [[Upernavik]]. When Whitney tried to bring Cook's boxes with him on his return to the USA on Peary's ship ''Roosevelt'' in 1909, Peary refused to allow them on board. As a result, Whitney left Cook's boxes in a cache in Greenland. They were never found.

On December 21, 1909, a commission at the [[University of Copenhagen]], after having examined evidence submitted by Cook, ruled that his records did not contain proof that the explorer reached the Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/12/22/101752152.pdf | title=University Finds That Cook's Papers Contain no Proof That He Reached the North Pole | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 22, 1909 | format=PDF | accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Peary refused to submit his records for review by such a third party, and for decades the [[National Geographic Society]], which held his papers, refused researchers access to them.)

Cook intermittently claimed he had kept copies of his sextant navigational data, and in 1911 published some.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, F. (1911). ''My Attainment of the Pole''. pp. 258, 274. Cook's first account of what he left with Whitney did not mention data, and Whitney knew of no data in what was left with him. See Rawlins, 1973, pp. 87, 166, 301–302.&lt;/ref&gt; These have an incorrect solar diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlins (1972). ''[[Norwegian Journal of Geography]]''. Oslo University. '''26'''. pp. 135–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahwelah and Etukishook, Cook's Inuit companions, gave seemingly conflicting details about where they had gone with him. The major conflicts have been resolved in the light of improved geographical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Osczevski, R. J. (2003). ''Arctic''. '''56''' (4).&lt;/ref&gt; Whitney was convinced that they had reached the North Pole with Cook, but was reluctant to be drawn into the controversy.

The Peary expedition's people (primarily [[Matthew Henson]], who had a working knowledge of Inuit, and George Borup, who did not) claimed that Ahwelah and Etukishook told them they had only traveled a few days from land. A map allegedly was drawn by Ahwelaw and Etukishook correctly located and accurately depicted then-unknown [[Meighen Island]], which strongly suggests that they visited it as they claimed.&lt;ref&gt;Osczevski, R. J. (2003). "Frederick Cook and the Forgotten Pole". ''Arctic''. '''56''' (2). pp. 207–217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rawlins, 1973, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A genuine Cook discovery, Meighen Island, is the only island discovered by a United States expedition in the American arctic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#mvmn Discoveries: "Meighen Island"], DIOI&lt;/ref&gt; For more detail see Bryce (1997) and Henderson (2005).

The conflicting claims of Cook and Peary prompted [[Roald Amundsen]] to take extensive precautions in navigation during his [[South Pole]] expedition so there could be no doubt concerning attainment of the pole if successful. Amundsen also had the advantage of traveling over a continent. He left unmistakable evidence of his presence at the South Pole, whereas any ice on which Cook might or might not have camped would have drifted many miles in the year between the competing claims.

At the end of his 1911 memoir, Cook wrote: "I have stated my case, presented my proofs. As to the relative merits of my claim, and Mr. Peary's, place the two records side by side. Compare them. I shall be satisfied with your decision."

== Reputation ==
Cook's reputation never recovered. While Peary's North Pole claim was widely accepted for most of the 20th century, it has been discredited by a variety of reviewers, including the National Geographic Society, which long supported him. Cook spent the next few years defending his claim and threatening to sue writers who said that he had faked the trip. Researching the complicated story of the conflicting claims, the writer Robert Bryce began to see how the men's personalities and goals were in contrast, and set them against the period of the [[Gilded Age]].&lt;ref name="ringle"/&gt; He believes that Cook, as a physician and ethnographer, cared about the people on his expedition and admired the Inuit. Bryce writes that Cook "genuinely loved and hungered for the real meat of exploration-mapping new routes and shorelines, learning and adapting to the survival techniques of the Eskimos, advancing his own knowledge-and that of the world-for its own sake."&lt;ref name="ringle"&gt;[http://www.surveyhistory.org/the_polar_controversy_resolved1.htm Ken Ringle, review: "''Cook &amp; Peary - The Polar Controversy Resolved''"], ''Backsights'', 1997, published by Surveyors Historical Society, accessed 3 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, he could not find supporters to help finance the expeditions without a goal that was more flashy. There was tremendous pressure on each man to be the first to reach the Pole, in order to gain support for continued expeditions.

=== Fraud trial ===
In 1919, Cook started promoting startup oil companies in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. In April 1923, Cook and 24 other Fort Worth oil promoters were indicted in a federal crackdown on fraudulent oil company promotions. Three of Cook's employees pleaded guilty, but Cook insisted on his innocence and was put on trial. Joining him in the trial was his head advertising copywriter, S. E. J. Cox, who had been previously convicted of mail fraud in connection with his own oil company promotions.

Among other deceptive practices, Cook was charged with paying dividends from stock sales, rather than from profits. Cook's attorney was former politician [[Joseph Weldon Bailey]], who clashed frequently with the judge. The jury found Cook guilty on 14 counts of fraud, and, in November 1923, Judge Killits sentenced Cook and 13 other oil company promoters to prison terms. Cook drew the longest sentence, 14 years 9 months. His attorney appealed the verdict, but the conviction was upheld.&lt;ref&gt;Olien, R. (1989). "Doctor Frederick A. Cook and the Petroleum Producers' Association". ''Journal of the West''. '''28''' (4). pp. 33–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
Cook was imprisoned until 1930. [[Roald Amundsen]], who believed he owed his life to Cook's extrication of the ''Belgica'', visited him several times.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Cook was [[pardon]]ed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1940, ten years after his release and shortly before his death of a cerebral hemorrhage on August 5. He was interred at the Chapel of [[Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8620">'''GPS/INS''' is the use of [[GPS]] satellite signals to correct or calibrate a solution from an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS). The method is applicable for any GNSS/INS system.

== Overview ==
=== Problem ===
Inertial navigation systems usually can provide an accurate solution only for a short period of time. The INS accelerometers produce an unknown bias signal that appears as a genuine specific force. This is acceleration integrated twice against time and thus produces an error in position. Additionally, the INS software must use an estimate of the angular position of the accelerometers when conducting this integration. Typically, the angular position is tracked through an integration of the angular rate from the gyro sensors. These also produce unknown biases that affect the integration to get the position of the unit. 

=== GPS/INS method ===
The GPS gives an absolute drift-free position value that can be used to reset the INS solution or can be blended with it by use of a mathematical algorithm, such as a [[Kalman filter]]. The angular orientation of the unit can be inferred from the series of position updates from the GPS. The change in the error in position relative to the GPS can be used to estimate the unknown angle error.

The benefits of using GPS with an INS are that the INS may be calibrated by the GPS signals and that the INS can provide position and angle updates at a quicker rate than GPS. For high dynamic vehicles, such as missiles and aircraft, INS fills in the gaps between GPS positions. Additionally, GPS may lose its signal and the INS can continue to compute the position and angle during the period of lost GPS signal. The two systems are complementary and are often employed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grewal|first=M. S.|title=Global Positioning, Inertial Navigation &amp; Integration|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|author2=L. R. Weill |author3=A. P. Andrew }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
GPS/INS is commonly used on aircraft for navigation purposes. Using GPS/INS allows for smoother position and velocity estimates that can be provided at a sampling rate faster than the GPS receiver.  This also allows for accurate estimation of the aircraft attitude (roll, pitch, and yaw) {{citation needed|reason=GPS wont provide attitude that easily, only position/velocity|date=May 2016}} angles.  In general, GPS/INS sensor fusion is a nonlinear filtering problem, which is commonly approached using the [[extended Kalman filter]] (EKF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalman|first=R. E.|author2=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7461">A '''GPS watch''' is a device with integrated [[GPS navigation device|GPS receiver]] that is worn as a single unit strapped onto a wrist, in the manner of a [[bracelet]]. The watch can have other features and capabilities depending on its intended purpose and be a [[smartwatch]]. [[GPS]] watches are most often used for sports and fitness purposes. Many can connect to external sensors by the wireless [[ANT+]] protocol, and/or to a computer by [[USB]] to transfer data and configuration. Common sensors used are heart rate monitors and footpods (running cadence and speed sensor). A [[Inertial footpod|footpod]] can be used to supplement or replace GPS data, such as providing treadmill speed and distance for the watch to log and share. [[USB charger|Recharging by USB]] is commonplace.

==[[Inertial footpod|Accelerometer]]-only==
These devices offer similar functions to GPS watches,
but measure speed and distance using a motion sensor (built-in, or a [[Inertial footpod|footpod]] attached to a shoe), instead of GPS.
Since they do not rely on GPS, they can work indoors, but do not track location data for mapping. Certain models include [[heart rate monitor]]ing, either built-in or through a chest-worn sensor. There are also a wide variety of watches that measure only [[Heart rate monitor|heart rate]] and time.

'''GSHHG''' ('''Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database'''; formerly ''Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Shoreline Database'' (''GSHHS'')) is a high-resolution shoreline data set amalgamated from two data bases (the CIA world database WDBII, and the World Vector Shoreline database) in the public domain. The data have undergone extensive processing and are free of internal inconsistencies such as [[erratic point]]s and crossing segments. The shorelines are constructed entirely from hierarchically arranged closed polygons. The four-level hierarchy is as follows: seashore, lakes, islands within lakes, ponds within islands within lakes.

The data can be used to simplify data searches and data selections, or to study the statistical characteristics of shorelines and land-masses. It comes with access software and routines to facilitate decimation based on a standard line-reduction algorithm.

GSHHS is developed and maintained by [[Paul Wessel (geophysicist)|Dr. Paul Wessel]] at the [[University of Hawai'i]], and Dr. Walter H. F. Smith at the [[NOAA Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2006">'''Geosophy''' is a concept introduced to [[geography]] by [[John Kirtland Wright|J.K. Wright]] in 1947. The word is a compound of ‘geo’ (Greek for earth) and ‘sophia’ (Greek for wisdom). Wright defined it thus:

:Geosophy ... is the study of geographical knowledge from any or all points of view. It is to geography what historiography is to history; it deals with the nature and expression of geographical knowledge both past and present&amp;mdash;with what Whittlesey has called ‘man’s sense of [terrestrial] space’. Thus it extends far beyond the core area of scientific geographical knowledge or of geographical knowledge as otherwise systematized by geographers. Taking into account the whole peripheral realm, it covers the geographical ideas, both true and false, of all manner of people&amp;mdash;not only geographers, but farmers and fishermen, business executives and poets, novelists and painters, Bedouins and Hottentots&amp;mdash;and for this reason it necessarily has to do in large degree with subjective conceptions.

:(Wright 1947)

This has been summarised as:

:the study of the world as people conceive of and imagine it

:(McGreevy 1987)

Belief systems as they relate to human interaction with the Earth's environments.

: (attributed to Professor Innes Park 1995)

==Superstition==
'''Geosophy''' is sometimes used as a synonym for the study of [[earth mysteries]].

'''Geotagging''' or '''GeoTagging''', is the process of adding geographical identification [[metadata]] to various media such as a [[geotagged photograph]] or video, websites, SMS messages, QR Codes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://qrd.by |title=Geo Tagged QR Codes |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feeds and is a form of [[geospatial metadata]]. This data usually consists of [[geographic coordinate system|latitude and longitude coordinates]], though they can also include [[altitude]], [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]], distance, accuracy data, and place names, and perhaps a [[time stamp]].

Geotagging can help users find a wide variety of location-specific information from a device. For instance, someone can find images taken near a given location by entering latitude and longitude coordinates into a suitable image [[search engine]]. Geotagging-enabled information services can also potentially be used to find location-based news, websites, or other resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mywire.com/pubs/AP/2008/01/18/5437214?extID=10051 |title= GPS adds dimension to online photos |author=Anick Jesdanun, AP |date=2008-01-18 |accessdate=2008-01-19}}&lt;!-- this has a dead URL --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Geotagging can tell users the location of the content of a given picture or other media or the [[Perspective (visual)|point of view]], and conversely on some media platforms show media relevant to a given location.

The related term [[geocoding]] refers to the process of taking non-coordinate based geographical identifiers, such as a street address, and finding associated [[geographic coordinates]] (or vice versa for [[reverse geocoding]]).  Such techniques can be used together with geotagging to provide alternative search techniques.

==Popular examples==
Geotagging has become a popular feature on several social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram.

[[Facebook]] users can geotag photos that can be added to the  page of the location they are tagging. Users may also use a feature that allows them to find nearby Facebook friends, by generating a list of people according to the location tracker in their mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/24/friendshake-facebooks-new-mobile-feature-for-finding-people-nearby-and-a-highlight-killer/ |title= Facebook’s New Mobile Feature For Finding People Around You |accessdate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Instagram]] uses a map feature that allows users to geotag photos. The map layout pin points specific photos that the user has taken on a world map.

==Geotagging techniques==
The geographical location data used in geotagging will, in almost every case, be derived from the [[global positioning system]], and based on a [[latitude]]/[[longitude]]-coordinate system that presents each location on the earth from 180° west through 180° east along the [[Equator]] and 90° north through 90° south along the [[prime meridian]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Geotagging photos===
{{main|Geotagged photograph}}
There are two main options for geotagging photos; capturing GPS information at the time the photo is taken or "attaching" the photograph to a map after the picture is taken.

In order to capture GPS data at the time the photograph is captured, the user must have a camera with built in GPS or a standalone GPS along with a digital camera. Because of the requirement for wireless service providers in United States to supply more precise location information for 911 calls by September 11, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/wireless911srvc.html |title=Wireless 911 Services |accessdate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; more and more cell phones have built-in GPS chips.  Most smart phones already use a GPS chip along with built-in cameras to allow users to automatically geotag photos. Others may have the GPS chip and camera but do not have internal software needed to embed the GPS information within the picture. A few digital cameras also have built-on or built-in GPS that allow for automatic geotagging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fireflyarticles.com/photography/photographers-have-several-camera-options-for-geotagging-pictures-with-gps-points-22.html|title=Photographers Have Several Camera Options for Geotagging Pictures with GPS Points}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Devices use GPS, A-GPS or both. [[Assisted GPS|A-GPS]] can be faster getting an initial fix if within range of a cell phone tower, and may work better inside buildings. Traditional GPS does not need cell phone towers and uses standard GPS signals outside of urban areas. Traditional GPS tends to use more battery power. Almost any digital camera can be coupled with a stand-alone GPS and post processed with photo mapping software, to write the location information to the image's [[exif]] header.

===GPS formats===
GPS coordinates may be represented in text in a number of ways, with more or fewer [[decimal]]s:

==Geotagging standards in electronic file formats==

===Photographs===
With photos stored in [[JPEG]], [[TIFF]] and many other file formats, the geotag information, storing camera location and sometimes heading, is typically embedded in the [[metadata]], stored in [[Exchangeable image file format]] (Exif) or [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) format. These data are not visible in the picture itself but are read and written by special programs and most [[digital camera]]s and modern [[Image scanner|scanners]].  Latitude and longitude are stored in units of degrees with decimals.&lt;ref&gt;In this format, a positively signed coordinate indicates Northern or Eastern hemisphere, while negative sign indicates Southern or Western hemisphere.&lt;/ref&gt;  This geotag information can be read by many programs, such as the [[cross-platform]] [[open source]] [[ExifTool]]. An example readout for a photo might look like:

 &lt;code&gt;GPS Latitude                    : 57 deg 38' 56.83" N&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;GPS Longitude                   : 10 deg 24' 26.79" E&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;GPS Position                    : 57 deg 38' 56.83" N, 10 deg 24' 26.79" E&lt;/code&gt;

or the same coordinates could also be presented as decimal degrees:

 &lt;code&gt;GPS&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;GPS Longitude                   : 10.40744&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;GPS Position                    : 57.64911 10.40744&lt;/code&gt;

When stored in Exif, the coordinates are represented as a series of rational numbers in the GPS sub-IFD.  Here is a hexadecimal dump of the relevant section of the Exif metadata (with [[Endianness|big-endian]] byte order):

 &lt;code&gt;+ [GPS directory with 5 entries]&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;| 0)  GPSVersionID = 2 2 0 0&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|     - Tag 0x0000 (4 bytes, int8u[4]):&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|         dump: 02 02 00 00&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;| 1)  GPSLatitudeRef = N&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|     - Tag 0x0001 (2 bytes, string[2]):&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|         dump: 4e 00  [ASCII "N\0"]&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;| 2)  GPSLatitude = 57 38 56.83 (57/1 38/1 5683/100)&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|     - Tag 0x0002 (24 bytes, rational64u[3]):&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|         dump: 00 00 00 39 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 26 00 00 00 01&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|         dump: 00 00 16 33 00 00 00 64&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;| 3)  GPSLongitudeRef = W&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|     - Tag 0x0003 (2 bytes, string[2]):&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|         dump: 57 00  [ASCII "W\0"]&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;| 4)  GPSLongitude = 10 24 26.79 (10/1 24/1 2679/100)&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|     - Tag 0x0004 (24 bytes, rational64u[3]):&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|         dump: 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 18 00 00 00 01&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;|         dump: 00 00 0a 77 00 00 00 64&lt;/code&gt;

=== Remote sensing data ===
In the field of [[remote sensing]] the geotagging goal is to store coordinates of every pixel in the image. One approach is used with the [[orthophoto]]s where we store coordinates of four corners and all the other pixels can be georeferenced by [[interpolation]]. The four corners are stored using [[GeoTIFF]] or [[World file]] standards. [[Hyperspectral imaging|Hyperspectral images]] take a different approach defining a separate file of the same spatial dimensions as the image where [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of each pixel are stored as two 2D layers in so called ''Input geometry data'' (IGM) files,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ENVI Classic Tutorial: Georeferencing Images Using Input Geometry|url=http://www.exelisvis.com/portals/0/pdfs/envi/Georef_Input_Geometry.pdf|publisher=[[Exelis]]|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as GEO files.

===Audio/video files===
Audio/video files can be geotagged via: metadata, audio encoding, overlay, or with companion files.  Metadata records the geospatial data in the encoded video file to be decoded for later analysis. One of the standards used with [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] is '''[[:File:MISB_Standard_0601.pdf|MISB Standard 0601]]''' which allows geocoding of corner points and horizon lines in individual video frames.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:MISB Standard 0601.pdf|MISB Standard 0601]]&lt;/ref&gt; Audio encoding involves a process of converting gps data into audio data such as modem squawk. Overlay involves overlaying GPS data as text on the recorded video.  Companion files are separate data files which correspond to respective audio/video files.  Companion files are typically found in the .KML and .GPX data formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruggedvid.com/geospatial/|title=Airborne Geospatial Video Recorders, Cameras, and Systems|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For audio and video files which use the [[Vorbis comment|vorbiscomment]] metadata format (including [[Opus (audio codec)|Opus]], [[Ogg Vorbis]], [[FLAC]], [[Speex]], and [[Ogg Theora]]), there is a proposed GEO LOCATION&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.xiph.org/VorbisComment#Geo_Location_fields|title=VorbisComment – XiphWiki|website=wiki.xiph.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; field which can be used. Like all vorbiscomments, it is plain text, and it takes the form:

&lt;code&gt;GEO_LOCATION=(decimal latitude);(decimal longitude);([optional]elevation in meters)&lt;/code&gt;

for example:

&lt;code&gt;GEO_LOCATION=35.1592;-98.4422;410&lt;/code&gt;

===SMS messages===
The [[GeoSMS]] standard works by embedding one or more [[Geo URI|'geo' URI]]s in the body of an SMS, for example:

:&lt;code&gt;I'm at the pub geo:-37.801631,144.980294;u=16&lt;/code&gt;

===DNS entries===
{{main|LOC record}}
RFC 1876 defines a means for expressing location information in the [[Domain Name System]]. LOC resources records can specify the latitude, longitude, altitude, precision of the location, and the physical size of on entity attached to an IP address. However, in practice not all IP addresses have such a record, so it is more common to use [[geolocation]] services to find the physical location of an IP address.

===HTML pages===

====ICBM method====
{{main|ICBM address}}
The GeoURL&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geourl.org/add.html |title=Adding yourself to GeoURL |accessdate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515145826/http://geourl.org/add.html |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; method requires the [[ICBM address|ICBM]] tag&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-daviel-html-geo-tag-08.txt| title=Geographic registration of HTML documents |author=The Internet Engineering Task Force |accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (plus optional [[Dublin Core]] metadata), which is used to geotag standard web pages in [[HTML]] format:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html"&gt;
 &lt;meta name="ICBM" content="50.167958, -97.133185"&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The similar Geo Tag format allows the addition of placename and region tags:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html"&gt;
 &lt;meta name="geo.position" content="50.167958;-97.133185"&gt;
 &lt;meta name="geo.placename" content="Rockwood Rural Municipality, Manitoba, Canada"&gt;
 &lt;meta name="geo.region" content="ca-mb"&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====RDF feeds====
The [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] method is defined by W3 Group and presents the information in RDF tags:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/ |title=Basic Geo (WGS84 lat/long) Vocabulary |author=W3C Semantic Web Interest Group |accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
         xmlns:geo="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#"&gt;
  &lt;geo:Point&gt;
  &lt;geo:lat&gt;55.701&lt;/geo:lat&gt;
  &lt;geo:long&gt;12.552&lt;/geo:long&gt;
  &lt;/geo:Point&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Microformat====
The [[Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]] allows coordinates within HyperText Markup Language pages to be marked up in such a way that they can be "discovered" by software tools. Example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html"&gt;
 &lt;span class="geo"&gt;
    &lt;span class="latitude"&gt;50.167958&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span class="longitude"&gt;-97.133185&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A proposal has been developed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Geo Extension Straw-Man Proposal | url=http://microformats.org/wiki/geo-extension-strawman | accessdate=2007-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to extend Geo to cover other bodies, such as [[Mars]] and the [[Moon]].

An example is the [[Flickr]] photo-sharing Web site, which provides geographic data for any [[geotagged photo]] in all of the above-mentioned formats.

===Geotagging in tag-based systems===
No industry standards exist, however there are a variety of techniques for adding geographical identification metadata to an information resource. One convention, established by the website [[Geobloggers]] and used by more and more sites, e.g. photo sharing sites [[Panoramio]] and [[Flickr]], and the social bookmarking site [[del.icio.us]], enables content to be found via a location search. Such sites allow users to add metadata to an information resource via a set of so-called ''machine tags'' (see [[folksonomy]]).

 &lt;code&gt;geotagged&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;geo:lat=57.64911&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;geo:lon=10.40744&lt;/code&gt;

This describes the geographic coordinates of a particular location in terms of [[latitude]] (geo:lat) and [[longitude]] (geo:lon). These are expressed in decimal degrees in the [[WGS84]] [[datum (geodesy)|datum]], which has become something of a default geodetic datum with the advent of [[GPS]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Using three tags works within the constraint of having tags that can only be single 'words'. Identifying geotagged information resources on sites like [[Flickr]] and [[del.icio.us]] is done by searching for the 'geotagged' tag, since the tags beginning 'geo:lat=' and 'geo:lon=' are necessarily very variable.

Another option is to tag with a [[Geohash]]:

 &lt;code&gt;geo:hash=u4pruydqqvj&lt;/code&gt;

A further convention proposed by [[FlickrFly]] adds tags to specify the suggested viewing angle and range when the geotagged location is viewed in [[Google Earth]]:

 &lt;code&gt;ge:head=225.00&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;ge:tilt=45.00&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;ge:range=560.00&lt;/code&gt;

These three tags would indicate that the camera is pointed heading 225° (south west), has a 45° tilt and is 560 metres from the subject.

Where the above methods are in use, their coordinates may differ from those specified by the photo's internal Exif data, for example because of a correction or a difference between the camera's location and the subject's.

In order to integrate geotags in social media and enhance text readability or oral use, the concept of 'meetag' or tag-to-meet has been proposed. Differing from hashtag construction, meetag includes the geolocation information after an underscore. A meetag is therefore a word or an unspaced phrase prefixed with an underscore ("_"). Words in messages on microblogging and social networking services may be tagged by putting "_" before them, either as they appear in a sentence, (e.g. "There is a concert going _montreuxjazzfestival", "the world wide web was invented _cern _geneve", ...) or appended to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://meet.ag |title=Web page for the 'meetag standard' proposition |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714201304/http://meet.ag/ |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geoblogging===
Geoblogging attaches specific geographic location information to [[blog]] entries via ''geotags''. Searching a list of blogs and pictures tagged using geotag technology allows users to select areas of specific interest to them on interactive maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=294109 |title=Example of pictures with geotag, using mobile phone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The progression of [[GPS]] technology, along with the development of various online applications, has fueled the popularity of such tagged blogging, {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} and the combination of [[GPS Phone]]s and [[GSM localization]], has led to the [[moblog]]ging, where blog posts are tagged with exact position of the user.  [[Real-time geotagging]] relays automatically geotagged media such as photos or video to be published and shared immediately.

For better integration and readability of geotags into blog texts, the [[meetag]] syntax has been proposed, which transforms any word, sentence, or precise geolocalization coordinates prefixed with an underscore into a 'meetag'. It not only lets one express a precise location but also takes in account dynamically changing geolocations.

===Wikipedia article geosearching apps===
{{Cleanup|date=July 2011}}
One of the first attempts to initiate the geotagging aspect of searching and locating articles seems to be the now-inoperative site Wikinear.com, launched in 2008, which showed the user Wikipedia pages that are geographically closest to one's current location.&lt;ref&gt;Willison, Simon. (2008). "[http://simonwillison.net/2008/Mar/22/wikinear/ Wininear.com, OAuth and Fire Eagle]", SimonWillison.net, Mar 22 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 app [[Cyclopedia (iPhone application)|Cyclopedia]] works relatively well showing geotagged Wikipedia articles located within several miles of ones location, integrated with a street-view mode, and 360-degree mode.

The app Respotter Wiki, launched in 2009, claims to feature Wikipedia searching via a map, also allowing users to interact with people around them, via messaging and reviews, etc. The app, in its current function, however, seems to give only geotagged photo results.

As of 2017, the [[:de:Wikipedia:WikiProjekt_Georeferenzierung/Hauptseite/Wikipedia-World/en|Wikipedia-World Project]] provides a [https://tools.wmflabs.org/wp-world/karte.php?la=en simple map search tool] which can display tagged articles near to a particular location, as well as a variety of more sophisticated tools integrated with external mapping services.

==Dangers of geotagging==
Following a scientific study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usenix.org/events/hotsec10/tech/full_papers/Friedland.pdf |title=G. Friedland, R. Sommer: "Cybercasing the Joint: On the Privacy Implications of Geo-Tagging", 5th Usenix Hot Topics in Security Workshop (HotSec2010), Washington DC, August 2010. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several demonstrative websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pleaserobme.com|title=Please Rob Me|website=www.pleaserobme.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icanstalku.com |title=icanstalku.com |publisher=icanstalku.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a discussion on the privacy implications of geotagging has raised public attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|N2vARzvWxwY|NBC Action News Smartphone pictures pose privacy risk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heussner, Ki Mae, [http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/celebrity-stalking-online-photos-give-location/story?id=11162352 "Celebrities' Photos, Videos May Reveal Location"], ''ABC News'', July 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19160-geotags-reveals-celeb-secrets.html Geo-tags reveal celeb secrets], 12 July 2010, by Jim Giles, New Scientist&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/technology/personaltech/12basics.html?_r=2 |title=Web Photos That Reveal Secrets Such As Where You Live / "MythBusters" host inadvertently reveals his home address on Twitter |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the automatic embedding of geotags in pictures taken with smartphones is often ignored by cell-phone users. As a result, people are often not aware that the photos they publish on the Internet have been geotagged. Many celebrities reportedly gave away their home location without knowing it. According to the study, a significant number of for-sale advertisements on [[Craigslist]], that were otherwise anonymized, contained geotags, thereby revealing the location of high-valued goods—sometimes in combination with clear hints to the absence of the offerer at certain times. Publishing photos and other media tagged with exact geolocation on the Internet allows random people to track an individual's location and correlate it with other information. Therefore, criminals could find out when homes are empty because their inhabitants posted geotagged and timestamped information both about their home address and their vacation residence. These dangers can be avoided by removing geotags with a [[metadata removal tool]] for photos before publishing them on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [http://www.superutils.com/products/exifcleaner/ ExifCleaner] and [http://www.steelbytes.com/?mid=30 JPEG &amp; PNG Stripper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;iPhone-App [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imetaphoto/id549115463 iMetaPhoto]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, four [[United States Army]] [[AH-64 Apache#United States Army|Apache helicopters]] were destroyed on the ground by Iraqi insurgent mortar fire; the insurgents had made use of embedded coordinates in web-published photographs (geotagging) taken of the helicopters by soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/75165/Geotagging_poses_security_risks |title=Geotagging poses security risks |publisher=Army.mil |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another newly realised danger of geotagging is the location information provided to criminal gangs and poachers on the whereabouts of often endangered animals. This can effectively make tourists scouts for these poachers, so geotagging should be turned off when photographing these animals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3641">{{For|another Swiss theodolite inventor with a similar name|Heinrich von Wild}}
[[File:Wild Heinrich und Liliy.jpg|thumb|Heinrich and Lilly Wild (1900)]]
'''Heinrich Wild''' ([[Mitlödi]], [[Canton of Glarus]], November 15, 1877 – [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]], [[Switzerland]], December 26, 1951) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[inventor]], [[designer]] and [[Entrepreneur|founder]] of [[Wild Heerbrugg]].

==Biography==
[[File:Survey Instrument designs by H.Wild.jpg|thumb]]
At 15 years of age, Wild became an apprentice with the engineer Legler in [[Glarus]] ([[hydraulic engineer]] for the [[Linth]] River). He bought a small [[theodolite]], and after a short time independently made expanded measurements of the flow of the river Linth. Later Wild joined the Geometerschule (geometer school) at [[Winterthur]] and came in 1899 as a trainee to the Landestopographie ([[Swisstopo]] is a popular designation for the Swiss Federal Office of [[Topography]]) in [[Bern]]. 
Due to his bad experiences with the high mountain triangulation with a theodolite of conventional design, he tried in 1905 to design a new theodolite with rotable circle with coincidence circle-readings.

In 1907 he left the Landestopographie and moved to [[Jena]], [[Germany]], where he joined the company [[Carl Zeiss]] to build up a new department for producing geodetic instruments. 
He began with the development of [[levelling instrument]]s and designed later also a new theodolite, the Th I.

In 1921 Wild returned to [[Switzerland]] and founded with Dr. R. Helbling, who operated a measurement office, and with the politician Jacob Schmidheiny, the company Heinrich Wild, Werkstätte für Feinmechanik und Optik (later known as [[Wild Heerbrugg]], Wild-Leitz AG,&lt;ref&gt;"Wild Heerbrugg und Leitz Wetzlar mit gemeinsamem Namen." New name Wild-Leitz AG from 1989. Neue Zürcher Zeitung, December 28, 1988, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leica Geosystems]], [[Leica Microsystems]], [[Leica Camera]]).

At this time he developed the first versions of the famous universal theodolite Wild T series and also the stereo autograph Wild A1 for aerial [[photo interpretation]],&lt;ref&gt;K. Hildebrand and R. Schlienger: "Scharfer Blick von oben." [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]], April 24, 1984, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; besides a number of other measurement instruments.

It may be perhaps typical for the inventors like Wild that he worried little about the financial condition of his company{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, and this ended finally with the consequence that Wild separated in 1932 from the company he founded, in order to be able to work as a freelance technical designer and inventor. He continued designing up until his death in 1951.  Among his designs were the legendary{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} DK1, DKM1, DM2, DKM2, and DKM3, for Kern &amp; Co, Aarau, besides other things.

The [[ETH Zurich]] honored him with the title Dr. honoris causa in 1930.

His biography was published in the [[Historical Dictionary of Switzerland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D31162.php Wolfgang Göldi: "Heinrich Wild". Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz, Biography (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the ETHZ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgc.ethz.ch/sgc-volumes/sgk-31.pdf Biography of Heinrich Wild, Swiss Geodetic Commission, published by ETHZ (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hellenic Military Geographical Service''' or '''HMGS''' ({{lang-el|Γεωγραφική Υπηρεσία Στρατού}} or Γ.Υ.Σ.), is the [[Hellenic Army|Greek military]] mapping agency.

==History==
Established in 1889 as the “Geodetic Mission” with the purpose of compiling the “Topographic and Cadastral Map of the Country”, the service acquired its current name in 1926. Today it supports both the [[Greek Army]] and the general public with cartographic products.&lt;ref&gt;a brief history of GYS can be found in the Service's website (in Greek/English), http://web.gys.gr/portal/page?_pageid=33,36335&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1966 until the 1980s, the service housed the [[Armed Forces Information Service]], Greece's second state-run broadcaster alongside the [[National Radio Foundation]].

==Maps==

===City plans===

HMGS supplies City Plans of scales 1:5.000, 1:10.000 and 1:25.000 in Greek and Latin series

*1:5.000 scale: covers 20 cities in [[Greece]]
*1:10.000 scale: covers 16 cities in [[Greece]]

===Topographic maps===

HMGS produces and supplies topographic maps of various scales that cover the whole country and occasionally parts of neighbouring countries. It should be emphasised that not all maps noted below are available to public, since part of them is confidential and available only upon approval of HMGS. Although not a state monopoly and not very famous among hikers, certainly HMGS maps have a much wider coverage in small scales than commercial leisure maps. The maps used the [[Hellenic Geodetic Reference System 1987]] (HGRS87 or ΕΓΣΑ'87) which specifies a Transverse Mercatorial Projection mapping Greece in one zone. 

*1:25.000 scale - 26 maps available for regions near [[Athens]]
*1:50.000 scale - approximately 385 maps
*1:100.000 scale - around 130 maps available
*1:250.000 scale - 32 maps available
*1:500.000 scale - 10 maps available
*1:1.000.000 scale - 5 maps available

==Availability==
The products and services of HMGS are not available in the market. They can either be purchased using the e-shop of the service or collected from the offices of the service upon submitting the relevant request form.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.gys.gr/portal/page?_pageid=33,36288&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Leif Erikson Awards''', sometimes referred to as the '''Exploration Awards''',&lt;ref name="exp1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorationmuseum.com/awards/ |title=The Exploration Awards|author=Giuditta Gubbi &amp; Francesco Perini |publisher=The Exploration Museum |date=11 November 2015 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are awarded annually by the [[The Exploration Museum|Exploration Museum]] in Húsavík, Iceland, for achievements in exploration and for work in the field of exploration history.&lt;ref name="Ice1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icelandreview.com/de/news/2015/11/24/leifur-eirikson-entdeckerpreise-verliehen |title=Leifur-Eirikson-Entdeckerpreise verliehen |language=German |author=Gabriele Schneider |publisher=Iceland Review |date=24 November 2015 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are awarded in three categories; to an explorer for a lifetime achievement in exploration; to a young explorer under the age of 35 for achievements in exploration; and to a person or an organization that has worked to promote and preserve exploration history. 

The awards ceremony takes place annually in [[Húsavík]]. The Leif Erikson Awards are the main and final event of the annual ''Húsavík Explorers Festival''. They were first awarded in 2015 and will be awarded next in September 2018.&lt;ref name="Anc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anconatoday.it/cronaca/leif-erikson-awards-francesco-perini-giuditta-gubbi-2015.html |title=Esplorazione spaziale, due jesini nella commissione dei "Leif Erikson Awards"|language=Italian |author=Francesco Benigni |publisher=Ancona Today |date=16 November 2015 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards are named for Icelandic explorer [[Leif Erikson]], considered as the first European to land in North America&lt;ref name="vis1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visindavefur.hi.is/svar.asp?id=1790 |title=Vísindavefurinn: Var Leifur Eiríksson ekki Grænlendingur sem átti rætur að rekja til Íslands og Noregs? |language=Icelandic |author=Sverrir Jakobsson |publisher=Visindavefur.hi.is |date=14 July 2001 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who, according to the [[Sagas of Icelanders]], established the first Norse settlement at Vinland, tentatively identified with the Norse L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland in modern-day Canada.

The President of Iceland, [[Guðni Th.

This is a list of places below mean [[sea level]] that are on land.

Places in tunnels, mines, basements, dug holes (also with open sky), under water, under ice, or existing temporarily as a result of ebbing of sea tide etc. are not included. Places where seawater and rainwater is pumped away are included. Fully natural places below sea level require a dry climate; otherwise, rain would exceed [[evaporation]] and fill the area.

All figures are in meters below sea level, arranged by depth, lowest first:

==Historic and ice-covered areas==
Deeper and larger than any of the trenches in the list above is the [[Bentley Subglacial Trench]] in Antarctica, at a depth of {{convert|2,540|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It is subglacial, meaning that it is permanently covered by the largest ice cap in the world. Therefore, it is not included in any list on the page. If the ice melted it would be covered by sea.

The biggest dry land area below sea level that has been known to exist in the geological past, as measured by continuous volume of atmospheric air below sea level, was the dry bed of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the late [[Miocene period]] during the [[Messinian salinity crisis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2978">The '''lowest bridging point''' is the location on a river which is crossed by a bridge at its closest point to the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geographyfieldwork.com/urban_geography_glossary.htm  Barcelona Field Studies Centre: Urban Geography Glossary]. Retrieved 24 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically - that is, before the development of engineering technology that allowed the construction of tunnels and high-level road bridges - the lowest bridging point of a river was frequently the point at which an important town or city grew up, and particularly where trade and commerce took place.  The place could be served by roads on either side of the river, allowing access from a wide [[hinterland]]; had river transport available upstream; and often was at a location that allowed seagoing traffic to approach it from a downstream direction.

Examples of lowest bridging points in Britain include [[London]], the lowest bridging point on the [[Thames]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RKuWgcPPUJIC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=%22lowest+bridging+point%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g6kLU7-uG8P17AappICgBA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lowest%20bridging%20point%22&amp;f=false   Neil Anthony Punnett, ''The New Wider World'', Nelson Thornes, 2003, p.42]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], the lowest bridging point on the [[River Lune|Lune]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xm4KAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22lowest+bridging+point%22&amp;dq=%22lowest+bridging+point%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g6kLU7-uG8P17AappICgBA&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBw  Andrew White, ''Lancaster: a history'', Phillimore, 2003, p.125]&lt;/ref&gt; [[York]], the lowest bridging point on the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|Ouse]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SnNmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT46&amp;dq=%22lowest+bridging+point%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZaoLU7jPIOPd7QaC9YHAAw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lowest%20bridging%20point%22&amp;f=false  D.

The '''Natural Area Code''' (or Universal Address) is a proprietary [[geocode]] system for identifying an area anywhere on the [[Earth]], or a volume of space anywhere around the Earth.  The use of thirty alphanumeric characters instead of only ten digits makes a NAC shorter than its numerical [[latitude]]/[[longitude]] equivalent. 

== Two-dimensional system ==
Instead of numerical longitudes and latitudes, a grid with 30 rows and 30 columns - each cell denoted by the numbers 0-9 and the twenty consonants of the [[Latin alphabet]] - is laid over the flattened globe.  A NAC cell (or block) can be subdivided repeatedly into smaller NAC grids to yield an arbitrarily small area, subject to the ±1&amp;nbsp;m limitations of the [[World Geodetic System]] (WGS) data of 1984.  

A NAC represents an area on the earth—the longer the NAC, the smaller the area (and thereby, location) represented.  A ten-character NAC can uniquely specify any [[building]], [[house]], or fixed object in the world.  An eight-character NAC specifies an area no larger than 25 metres by 50 metres, while a ten-character NAC cell is no larger than 0.8 metres by 1.6 metres.

Using a [[base 30]] positional numeral system, NAC uses an alternate method which excludes vowels and avoids potential confusion between "0" (zero) and "O" (capital "o"), and "1" (one) and "I" (capital "i"):

|}
For example, the ten-character NAC for the centre of the city of [[Brussels]] is HBV6R&amp;nbsp;RG77T.

== Extension to three dimensions ==
The full NAC system provides a third coordinate: altitude.  This coordinate is the [[arctangent]] of the altitude, relative to the Earth's radius, and scaled so that the zero point (000...) is at the centre of the Earth, the midpoint (H00...) is the local radius of the geoid, i.e. the Earth's surface, and the endpoint (ZZZ...) is at infinity.

For example, the three-dimensional NAC for the centre of Brussels, at ground level, is HBV6R&amp;nbsp;RG77T&amp;nbsp;H0000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2303">A '''navigation system''' is a (usually electronic) system that aids in [[navigation]]. Navigation systems may be entirely on board a vehicle or vessel (on the ships) [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]], or they may be located elsewhere and communicate via radio or other signals with a vehicle or vessel, or they may use a combination of these methods.

Navigation systems may be capable of:

* containing maps, which may be displayed in human readable format via text or in a graphical format
* determining a vehicle or vessel's location via sensors, maps, or information from external sources
* providing suggested directions to a human in charge of a vehicle or vessel via text or speech
* providing directions directly to an [[autonomous vehicle]] such as a robotic probe or guided missile
* providing information on nearby vehicles or vessels, or other hazards or obstacles
* providing information on traffic conditions and suggesting alternative directions

==Types of navigation systems==
* [[Automotive navigation system]]
* [[Marine navigation system]]
* [[satellite navigation system]]
** [[Global Positioning System]], a group of satellites and computers that can provide information on any person, vessel, or vehicle's location via a GPS receiver
*** [[GPS navigation device]], a device that can receive GPS signals for the purpose of determining the device's location and possibly to suggest or give directions
** [[GLONASS]], satellite navigation system run by Russia
** [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] global navigation satellite system
* [[Computer-assisted surgery|Surgical navigation system]], a system which determines the position of surgical instruments in relation to patient images such as CT or MRI scans.

'''Orienteering''' is a group of [[sport]]s that requires [[navigation]]al skills using a [[map]] and [[compass]] to navigate from point to point in diverse and usually unfamiliar terrain whilst moving at speed. Participants are given a topographical map, usually a specially prepared [[orienteering map]], which they use to find [[Control point (orienteering)|control points]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a training exercise in [[Land navigation (military)|land navigation for military officers]], orienteering has developed many variations. Among these, the oldest and the most popular is [[foot orienteering]].  For the purposes of this article, foot orienteering serves as a point of departure for discussion of all other variations, but almost any sport that involves racing against a clock and requires navigation with a map is a type of orienteering.

&lt;!-- expand this paragraph and/or consider segregating info by sport (foot-O, mtb-O, etc) --&gt;

==Orienteering sports==
Orienteering sports combine significant [[navigation]] with a specific method of travel.  Because the method of travel determines the needed equipment and tactics, each sport requires specific rules for competition and guidelines for orienteering event logistics and [[Course (orienteering)|course]] design.

[[International Orienteering Federation]], the governing body of the sport, currently sanctions the following four disciplines as official disciplines in the sport of orienteering:
* [[Foot orienteering]] (FootO)
* [[Mountain bike orienteering]] (MTBO)
* [[Ski orienteering]] (SkiO)
* [[Trail orienteering]] (TrailO)

Moreover, [[International Amateur Radio Union]] (IARU) sanctions the following orienteering sport:
* [[Amateur radio direction finding]] (Radio orienteering or ARDF) [including variants [[Fox Oring]] and [[Radio Orienteering in a Compact Area]] (ROCA)]

Other orienteering disciplines include, but are not limited to:
* [[Canoe orienteering]]
* [[Car orienteering]]
* [[Mountain marathon]]ing
* [[Mounted orienteering]]
* [[Rogaining]]
* SportLabyrinth – micro orienteering

[[Adventure racing]] is a combination of two or more disciplines, and usually includes orienteering as part of the [[Racing|race]].

===National===
&lt;!--Country/nation. Note UK is one nation comprising four countries--&gt;
{{See also|Category:International Orienteering Federation members|l1=International Orienteering Federation members}}

There are governing bodies for most of the individual nations that are represented in the sport of orienteering. These national bodies are the rule-making body for that nation. For example, the [[British Orienteering Federation]] is the national governing body for the [[United Kingdom]]. The federation was founded in 1967 and it is made up of 13 constituent associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/about/index.php|title=About British Orienteering|accessdate=2008-05-25|publisher=British Orienteering Federation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127105559/http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/about/index.php|archivedate=2008-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[United States]], the national governing body is [[Orienteering USA]].

===Regional===
Most nations have some form of regional governing bodies. These are not rule-making bodies but are there to assist in coordinating clubs within that region, e.g., they may allocate dates so that clubs do not clash with their events.

===Local===
{{See also|Category:Orienteering clubs|l1=Orienteering clubs}}
Clubs are usually formed at a local level and affiliated to their national governing body. It is clubs who put on events usually open to all-comers. Clubs may also put on practice, training, and social events.
Open clubs are open to anyone and there is usually no restriction on joining them.
Closed clubs restrict their membership to specific groups. For example, BAOC (British Army Orienteering Club)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baoc.org.uk/ |title= BAOC Online |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher=baoc.org.uk |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has restrictions on who may join, principally British Army personnel.

==History==
{{main|History of orienteering}}

The history of orienteering begins in the late 19th century in [[Sweden]], the actual term "orientering" (the original Swedish name for orienteering, lit. "orientation") was first used in 1886 and meant the crossing of unknown land with the aid of a map and a compass.&lt;ref name=iof_past_present&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?/iof2006/iof/past_present|title=Past &amp; present|publisher=International Orienteering Federation|accessdate=2008-09-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802131200/http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?%2Fiof2006%2Fiof%2Fpast_present|archivedate=2008-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden, orienteering grew from [[Military education and training|military training]] in [[land navigation (military)|land navigation]] into a competitive sport for military officers, then for civilians. The name is derived from a word root meaning to find the direction or location. The first orienteering competition open to the public was held in [[Norway]] in 1897.&lt;ref name=iof_past_present/&gt;

From the beginning, locations selected for orienteering have been chosen in part for their beauty, natural or man-made. For the first public orienteering competition in Sweden, in 1901, control points included two historic churches, [[Spånga Church|Spånga kyrka]] and [[Bromma Church|Bromma kyrka]] (a [[round church]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orientering.se/t2.asp?p=3398 |title=Milstolpar i utvecklingen |publisher=Svenska Orienteringsförbundet |language=Swedish |accessdate=2008-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233231/http://www.orientering.se/t2.asp?p=3398 |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World Orienteering Championships 2007 - middle distance 04.jpg|thumb|right|World Orienteering Championships 2007 in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]. Winners of middle-distance event: [[Simone Niggli-Luder]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Thierry Gueorgiou]], [[France]]]]
With the invention of inexpensive yet reliable compasses, the sport gained popularity during the 1930s. By 1934, over a quarter million Swedes were participants, and orienteering had spread to [[Finland]], [[Switzerland]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Hungary]]. Following [[World War II]], orienteering spread throughout Europe and to Asia, North America and Oceania. In Sweden in 1959, an international orienteering conference was held. Representatives from 12 countries ([[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]], [[Hungary]], Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, [[Yugoslavia]]) participated.&lt;ref name=iof_past_present/&gt;  In 1961, orienteering organizations representing 10 European nations&lt;!-- 10 national federations? --&gt; founded the [[International Orienteering Federation]] (IOF). Since then, IOF has supported the founding of many national orienteering federations. By 2010, 71 national orienteering federations were member societies of the [[International Orienteering Federation]].&lt;ref name=iof_nations&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?/iof2006|title=National Federations|publisher=International Orienteering Federation|accessdate=2006-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061227191403/http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?%2Fiof2006|archive-date=2006-12-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These federations enabled the development of national and world championships. World championships were held every two years until 2003, then every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.asn.au/promotion/facts/History/|title=Orienteering: A Brief History|publisher=Orienteering Australia|accessdate=2008-11-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719230326/http://www.orienteering.asn.au/promotion/facts/History/|archivedate=2008-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this time, orienteering has remained most popular in [[Scandinavia]]. There, the two oldest recurring orienteering meets have been held since the 1940s ([[Jukola relay]] and [[Tiomila]]), and the single largest orienteering meet has been held every year since 1965 and attracts around 15,000 competitors ([[O-Ringen]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/The+Jukola+Relay+is+about+much+more+than+orienteering+/1135228145846|title=The Jukola Relay is about much more than orienteering|last=Pulkkinen|first=Sanna|publisher=Helsingin Sanomat|accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, orienteering is run in wild terrain. In its Scandinavian origins, this typically meant in the [[forest]], but orienteering in open [[fell]], [[heathland]], [[moorland]] and other mixed terrain is also common. Orienteering in [[town]]s has been common for many years. Street-O has typically been a low-key affair; score events, often at night, normally as informal training events. The [[Venice]] street-O is notable for attracting a large international participation. With Park World Tour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwt.org|title=Park World Tour|accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; races and other (e.g. World championships) elite sprint races often being held in urban areas, and the development of a map specification for urban areas (ISSOM), from the mid-2000s, Street-O has been rebranded as urban orienteering, and has taken itself rather more seriously, with full colour maps and electronic punching, and may now be regarded as a serious competition with inclusion in national ranking lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/page/rankings|title=British Orienteering Rankings|accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such urban races are often much longer than the sprint distance.

==Competition and results==
===Basics===
[[File:Tajfuto.jpg|thumb|left|An orienteer at a control point]]

The competition, or race, is intended to test the navigational skill, concentration, and running ability of the competitors. High levels of [[physical fitness|fitness]] and running speed are required to compete successfully at an international or elite level. To ensure fairness between competitors the map is not usually provided until the start, and starts are normally staggered with competitors starting at not less than one-minute intervals.&lt;ref name=nutshell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orienteer.com/nutshell.htm |title=Your first orienteering event |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher=orienteer.com |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516084924/http://www.orienteer.com/nutshell.htm |archive-date=2008-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective on each leg is to follow the fastest route between controls. The fastest is not always the shortest route, and can depend heavily on [[Route choice (orienteering)|route choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oq.asn.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=85|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224192329/http://www.oq.asn.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=85|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-02-24|title=Foot Orienteering|publisher=[[Orienteering Queensland]]|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Map===
[[File:Orienteringskort bygholm 2005.PNG|thumb|left|An orienteering map]]
Orienteering competitions use specially prepared [[orienteering map]]s. They are topographic maps although much more detailed than general-purpose maps. The ISOM map scales are 1:15,000 or 1:10,000, with grids aligned to [[Magnetic declination|magnetic]] [[north]]. Map symbols are standardized by the IOF,&lt;ref name=iof-map-2000&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orienteering.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/International-Specification-for-Orienteering-Maps-2000.pdf |format=PDF|title=International Specification for Orienteering Maps|accessdate=2011-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designed to be readable by any competitor regardless of background or native tongue.

===Courses===
[[File:Orienteering map control points.svg|thumb|right|An example of how control points are shown on an orienteering map]]
Orienteering events offer a range of courses, of varying physical and technical difficulty, to meet the needs of competitors. The orienteering [[course (orienteering)|course]] is marked in purple or red on a map.&lt;ref name=themap&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williams.edu/Biology/Faculty_Staff/hwilliams/Orienteering/map.html |title=The Map |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher=www.williams.edu |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[triangle]] is used to indicate the start and a double [[circle]] indicates the finish. Circles are used to show the control points.&lt;ref name=ounlimited&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orienteeringunlimited.com/ODetails.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010412133640/http://orienteeringunlimited.com/ODetails.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-04-12 |title=Details of the sport of orienteering |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Age-related classes====
At international, national, and the larger events, courses are classified by age, e.g., M35 for men 35 years of age and older. Classes requiring similar distances and difficulties are usually combined into a smaller number of courses, e.g., M60 will normally share a course with W50, and often with M65 and W55. The results are normally arranged by class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyprus-orienteering.com/htmldocs/pdf/ColourCodedexplained.pdf|title=Courses and classes - cutting through the confusion.|year=1997|publisher=Cyprus Orienteers|accessdate=2015-02-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904010428/http://www.cyprus-orienteering.com/htmldocs/pdf/ColourCodedexplained.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ability-based courses====
In the smaller events courses are provided by ability. The United States&lt;ref name=ounlimited/&gt;&lt;ref name=ClueSymbols&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williams.edu/Biology/Faculty_Staff/hwilliams/Orienteering/clues.html |title=Orienteering Clue Symbols |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher=www.williams.edu |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Kingdom]] use colour coding to define the difficulty of the courses. Short, easy courses are provided for beginners and younger competitors, with technically and physically demanding courses being provided for experienced orienteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.runningforfun.co.uk/orienteering.html|title=Orienteering |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher= www.runningforfun.co.uk |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permanent courses and other events====
Some orienteering clubs have set up permanent courses, which can be used for personal, or club, training. Non-standard permanent markers are used as control kites, and maps of the courses are usually available publicly for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.orienteering.org/new-o/resources/permanent-courses|title=Permanent Courses|publisher=US Orienteering Federation|accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courses are usually set up in public areas and there may be some restrictions on access, e.g., daylight hours only. Clubs also organise informal events for practice and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sloweb.org.uk/poc/pocinfo.htm |title=Permanent orienteering courses |publisher=South London Orienteers and Wayfarers |accessdate=2008-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828191654/http://www.sloweb.org.uk/poc/pocinfo.htm |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controls and control description sheet===
[[File:Control description.svg|thumb|right|Control description sheet (pictorial). `Opisy punktów' stands for 'Description of points'.]]
[[Control point (orienteering)|Control points]] are placed on features on the map that can be clearly identified on the ground. Control points are marked in the terrain by white and orange "flags".&lt;!--(or white and red) needs to be in history--&gt;

Competitors receive a "control description sheet" or "clue sheet" which gives a precise description of the feature and the location of the kite, e.g., boulder, 5m, north side. For experienced orienteers the descriptions use symbols (pictorial), in accordance with the ''IOF Control descriptions''.&lt;ref name=iof-controls-2004&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orienteering.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IOF-Control-Descriptions-2004.pdf|format=PDF|title=IOF Control descriptions|publisher=International Orienteering Federation|accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control card and punching===
Each competitor is required to carry an electronic or paper control card, and to present it at the Start and hand it in at the Finish.  The control card is marked by some means at each control point to show that the competitor has completed the course correctly. Most events now use electronic punching, although cards and needle punches are still widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orienteer.com/nutshell.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221055013/http://orienteer.com/nutshell.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-12-21|title=Your first orienteering event|publisher=orienteer.com|accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Results===
The winner is normally the competitor with the fastest time, but other scoring systems can be used, e.g., score events and Trail-O. Most events produce provisional results 'on the day', with draft results on the Internet that night; the final results being confirmed a few days later. With electronic punching&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/downloads/documents/Appendices_IElectronicPunching.pdf |format=PDF |title=Appendix I : Electronic Punching |accessdate=2008-10-23 |work= |publisher=www.britishorienteering.org.uk |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807175505/http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/downloads/documents/Appendices_IElectronicPunching.pdf |archive-date=2008-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the results can include ''split times'' for competitors. These show the times between controls and aggregate times to each control. With suitable computer software these times can be displayed in a graphical form (Progressograph).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/event/organisers.php#responsibilities|title=Organisers are responsible for|publisher=British Orienteering Federation |accessdate=2008-11-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080804112125/http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/event/organisers.php#responsibilities &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
Each competitor is responsible for his or her own safety. There are no rules, but there are guidelines, which should be followed. The basic safety check was the ''stub check''. The competitor hands in his stub at the start and his control card at the finish. Event officials match the two and any unmatched stubs represent a missing competitor. This has been superseded with electronic punching in that event officials can now request a ‘still to finish’ report listing all those competitors who punched at the start but have not yet downloaded their electronic card. All competitors must report to the finish whether they have completed the course or not.&lt;ref name=nutshell/&gt;&lt;ref name=ounlimited/&gt;

===Personal clothing===
IOF rule 21.1 is that the specification for clothing is delegated to the national organising body, and no specific clothing is required.&lt;ref name=iof-rules2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?/iof2006/document_library/rules_and_guidelines/foot_orienteering|title=IOF Foot-O Rules|accessdate=2008-11-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614090613/http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?%2Fiof2006%2Fdocument_library%2Frules_and_guidelines%2Ffoot_orienteering|archivedate=2008-06-14|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK rule 7.1.1 requires ''full body cover'': the torso and legs must be covered.&lt;ref name=bof-rules&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/downloads/documents/2007Rules_Jan07.pdf|format=PDF|title=BOF Event Rules|accessdate=2008-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704171146/http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/downloads/documents/2007Rules_Jan07.pdf|archive-date=2008-07-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organiser may allow shorts, e.g., in park or street orienteering.  In the United States, rule A.34.1 states that competitors are free to choose clothing that they are most comfortable in (full leg cover is ''not'' required), unless specifically stated in the meet announcement.

The early competitors used standard athletic clothing, i.e., shorts and an athletic vest, which provided little protection for racing through [[undergrowth]]. Purpose-made lightweight [[nylon]] full-body suits were later adopted. The early ''O-suits'' were made in muted colours but modern suits are generally multi-coloured. Clubs often organise the bulk purchase of clothing, which are then made in the club colours with the club’s name prominently displayed. Some competitors prefer [[Spandex|lycra]] [[tights]] or leggings. [[Gaiters]] are also often worn. Lightweight studded (and often cleated) orienteering shoes are commonly used.

===Personal equipment===
[[File:Compasses orienteering.jpg|thumb|Thumb compass and protractor compass]]
The basic equipment required for orienteering is usually listed as a compass and appropriate [[wilderness|outdoor]] clothing. Most national bodies recommend that a [[whistle]] be carried for [[Whistle#Safety|safety]].

Competitive orienteers usually use specialized equipment:
* A [[thumb compass]], or [[protractor compass]] on a short wrist cord.
* A clear map case to protect the map. May be provided by organizers in competitions.
* A clear plastic sleeve, worn on the forearm, to hold control descriptions.
* A map board, fixed to the handlebars or worn on the arm or strapped to the torso  (MTB-O, Ski-o and [[Amateur radio direction finding|ARDF]] only).
* IOF rules forbid the use of artificial aids that competitors can refer to during a race, so [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and other electronic navigation devices are not used. ([[Amateur radio direction finding|ARDF]] may allow them at some events).  [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] logging devices that track and record position, without allowing competitors to refer to the data during the race, are permitted, and are increasingly being used for post-race route-choice analysis and live tracking for event spectators.

==Competition types==
[[File:Gold Relay UK WOC 2008-crop.jpg|thumb|left|Foot-O relay, the winner crosses the line – joined by the rest of his team]]

Orienteering events can be classified in many different aspects:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orienteering.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IOF-Rules-2018-v1.14final.pdf |title=IOF rules |date=2018 |website=orienteering.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* By method of travel: [[FootO]], [[SkiO]], [[Mountain bike orienteering|MTBO]], etc.
* By the length: sprint, middle, long
* By the time the competition was held: day, night
* By the number of competitors: individual, team, relay
* By the visiting order of controls: cross-country (in a specific order), score (free to decide order)

===Long===
Classic orienteering involves a race between controls in a preset order.  The winner is the person who completes the course in the shortest time. This is called a "cross-country" course as distinct from a score course (see below). Courses are normally designed so that the fastest route is not straightforward to find on the map, or to follow on the ground. The classic race has a typical winning time of 75–90 minutes. As of 2007, the IOF have dictated that the "classic" course should be redesignated the "long".

===Middle===
The middle distance is a shorter cross-country race than the classic (or long), with a winning time in the region of 30 minutes and with an emphasis more on fine navigation than route-choice. When races of this distance were run in the mid-late 1990s, they were called "short" races, or "sprint-O". The short distance was introduced as a world championship discipline in 1991. More recently, though the IOF have renamed this distance as "middle".

===Relay===
A [[relay race]] is run by a team of competitors each running a course, and the result is based on the team's total time. Relays usually employ a mass start instead of a staggered start. Relays are part of [[World Orienteering Championships]] both as sprint relays and as cross-country relays. Additionally, there are popular mass club races out of which [[Jukola relay]] has the highest number of participating clubs 1,787 (in 2015), while [[25-manna]] has the highest number of legs 25.  To reduce competitors following each other, various spreading methods might be used. This is called "gaffling", which is a Swedish word meaning "forking". The key principle is that every team must run every leg (between each pair of two controls), but not necessarily in the same order. The IOF have introduced the nomenclature to try to clarify the usage of the word "leg". In orienteering usage, leg normally refers to the part of a race between two control points. In relay (non-orienteering) usage, leg refers to the part of a race run by a single team member. The IOF prefer "lap" for this latter term, but despite this, in common parlance, "leg" is used for both terms.

===Score===
Competitors visit as many controls as possible within a time limit. There is usually a mass start (rather than staggered), with a time limit. Controls may have different point values depending on difficulty, and there is a point penalty for each minute late. The competitor with the most points is the winner.
The large-scale, endurance-style version of a Score-O is known as a [[Rogaining|rogaine]], competed by teams in events lasting (often) 24 hours. A very large area is used for competition, and the map scale is smaller. The format originated in Australia. The term ROGAINE is often said to stand for Rugged Outdoor Group Activity Involving Navigation and Endurance; this is essentially a [[backronym]], as the name actually originates from the names of Rod, Gail and Neil Phillips, who were among Australian Rogaining's first participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ptoc.org/begin_guide/htdocs/courses.html|title= Point-to-point orienteering (also called Cross-country orienteering)|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sprint===
Very short races, with winning times in the region of 12–15 minutes, often held in city [[park]]s and other more urban settings. Map scales are usually 1:5,000 or 1:4,000. Control sites can include benches, litterbins, sculptures, and other objects common to urban parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lazarus.elte.hu/mc/specs/issom2005.pdf|format=PDF|title=International Specification for Sprint Orienteering Maps|date=April 15, 2008|publisher=International Orienteering Federation|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sprint distance may also be held in the forest, when it would be called a "forest sprint" as opposed to an "urban sprint". This distance was pioneered in the late 1990s as an elite event by the Park World Tour organisation who organised an independent "world cup" in park sprint orienteering. In 2001 in Tampere, the IOF included a sprint distance in the orienteering world championships.

===Ultrasprint===
[[File:BDHX.jpg|thumb| 300 px|A setting for indoor ultrasprint orienteering]]
Ultrasprint events are held in a specially constructed labyrinth. Due to the limited area of the labyrinth, ultrasprint is a more spectator-friendly form of orienteering. Also, as the course is artificial, identical courses can be set in different geographical locations for simultaneous local competitions as parts of a larger tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nopesport.com/news/1139-sheffield-ultrasprint Sheffield Ultrasprint]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportlabyrinth.com/index/0-10 Sport Labyrinth]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Night===
[[File:Start.jpg|thumb|Studying the map at the start of a night orienteering competition, or "night-o"]]
Competitors use a [[Headlamp (outdoor)|headlamp]] to navigate in the dark. Reflective markers often are used on control point flags, which shifts the tactics from precision navigation to searching.  Competitors can travel at high speed to the vicinity of the control point, then sweep the area with the light to catch a reflection off the control flag.  If a night event starts before dark, a mass start must be used so all competitors have equal time in the light and dark. The two classic club relays, Tiomila and [[Jukola]], both include night legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.4orienteering.com/terrain_association/56/
|title=Night Navigation
|accessdate=2008-05-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Full length (24-hour) rogaines and many adventure races run through the night, without a light period, and competitors may choose not to rest.

===String===
Competitors follow a string around a short course, noting down things that they find on the way. This is generally used by young children and people new to the sport who want to find out what it is like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orienteeringusa.org/youth-leaders/materials/o-young |title=The String Course |accessdate=2012-05-04 |publisher=Orienteering USA}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precision===
Precision orienteering generally is not a speed event, but rather a test of the competitors' ability to precisely match map and terrain.  Examples include [[trail orienteering|trail-O]] (untimed), TREC style [[mounted orienteering]], and [[Radio Orienteering in a Compact Area]] (ROCA).  Both trail-O and ROCA use decoys in the vicinity of the control point.

==The Olympics==
Efforts begun in 1996 to promote the inclusion of orienteering in the [[Olympic Games]] have so far been unsuccessful, although orienteering became a sport in the [[World Games]] in 2001, and is a sport in the Summer [[Deaflympics]].  Supporters recognize that the sport is neither television- nor spectator-friendly, the venue of competition is often necessarily remote from major cities, and the duration of the event is longer than most other individual competitions.&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brady|first=Gerry|title=The Olympics, Orienteering and Ireland|publisher=The Irish Orienteer|year=2008|edition=94|url=http://orienteering.ie/tio/94/OLYMPICS.htm|accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Efforts to develop a format suitable for Olympic competitions have focused on park orienteering, micro-orienteering, and short-distance relays. Sprint Orienteering on foot as a format of the sport is most likely to be included in Olympic Games, as this discipline is becoming more and more popular worldwide and can have a significant spectator interest. According to the website of a Chicago Orienteering club, "the International Orienteering Federation is committed to entering the Olympic World."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicago-orienteering.org/newsletter/article0303f.htm|title=Current Status of Orienteering in the Olympics|publisher=Chicago Area Orienteering Club|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not an official [[demonstration sport]], an international [[ski-orienteering]] event was held in [[Sugadaira Kōgen]], [[Japan]], as part of the International Cultural Festival held in conjunction with the [[1998 Winter Olympics|XVIII Winter Olympic Games]] in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="IOF_Council"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/press/ccil0197.htm |title=Extensive discussion on the Olympic item |publisher=International Orienteering Federation |accessdate=2008-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201155503/http://www.orienteering.org/press/ccil0197.htm |archivedate=December 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The International Orienteering Federation petitioned the International Olympic Committee in 2002 to include ski orienteering in the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Winter Olympic Games]], noting that it could share the venue with the [[biathlon]] competitions.&lt;ref name="Rönnberg_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/ozine0203.htm |title=Ski Orienteering's Olympic Bid |last=Rönnberg |first=Barbro |date=March 2002 |work=O-zine |publisher=International Orienteering Federation |accessdate=2008-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209145610/http://www.orienteering.org/ozine0203.htm |archivedate=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its formal recommendation that ski orienteering not be included in those games, the Olympic Programme Commission focused on a lack of participation in the sport outside [[Nordic countries]], "the challenges for broadcasters and spectators to easily follow the competition", and the costs associated with new technology and a new results system.&lt;ref name="olympic_programme_commission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/common/asp/download_report.asp?file=en_report_520.pdf&amp;id=520|title=Review of the Olympic Programme and the Recommendations on the Programme of the XX Olympic Winter Games, Turin 2006|last=Cararro|first=Franco|year=2002|publisher=Olympic Programme Commission|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[International Olympic Committee]] confirmed that ski orienteering was under consideration for inclusion in the review process of the Olympic sport program for the [[2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name="Rönnberg_2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/ozine0512.pdf |format=PDF |title=Green light for continued Olympic campaign |last=Barbrod |first=Rönnberg |date=December 2005 |work=O-Zine |publisher=International Orienteering Federation |accessdate=2008-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209144914/http://www.orienteering.org/ozine0512.pdf |archivedate=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 28 November 2006, the Executive Board of the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] decided not to include any new sports in this review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/olympic_news/full_story_uk.asp?id=1972|title=Olympic programme updates|publisher=International Olympic Federation|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Permanent European Conference for the Study of the Rural Landscape (PECSRL)''' is an international network of [[landscape]] researchers whose interest focus on the past, present and future of European landscapes, and serves as an international platform for new initiatives, meetings and publications about European rural landscapes. It meets every two years in a different European country for lectures, discussions, working groups and landscape excursions. It has several working groups that focus on actual problems in European landscape management and landscape research. The unifying concept of PECSRL is the past, present and future of European landscapes, relating to landscape research as well as landscape policy and landscape management.

==Objectives==
The objectives of PECSRL are:
* to facilitate personal contacts and information exchange between European landscape researchers;
* to improve interdisciplinary cooperation between landscape researchers from various scientific and human landscape disciplines;
* to improve cooperation between landscape researchers and landscape managers;
* to function as a platform for new initiatives in European landscape research and landscape management.

==History and scope==
The Permanent European Conference for the Study of the Rural Landscape is one of the most stable European networks of landscape researchers. It was established in 1957 at an inaugural conference held in Nancy, France. Initially, it consisted mainly of [[Historical geography|(historical)]] [[geography|geographers]], but during the last few decades its membership has diversified to include ecologists, social scientists, rural planners, landscape architects, historians, archaeologists, landscape managers, as well as other scholars and practitioners interested in European landscapes. Members undertake both fundamental and applied research on all aspects of the rural landscape or have a position in landscape management or heritage management. PECSRL covers Pan-Europe which means that it connects researchers from Northern, Eastern, Southern, Central and Western Europe. All together more than thirty European countries take part in PECSRL.

'''Population density''' (in [[agriculture]]: [[Stock (disambiguation)|standing stock]] and [[standing crop]]) is a measurement of [[population]] per unit area or unit volume; it is a quantity of type [[number density]]. It is frequently applied to [[living organisms]], and most of the time to [[human]]s. It is a key geographical term.&lt;ref name=about&gt;Matt Rosenberg [http://geography.about.com/od/populationgeography/a/popdensity.htm Population Density]. Geography.about.com. March 2, 2011. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In simple terms population density refers to the number of people living in an area per kilometer square.

== Biological population densities ==
Population density is population divided by total land area or water volume, as appropriate.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

Low densities may cause an [[extinction vortex]] and lead to further reduced fertility. This is called the [[Allee effect]] after the scientist who identified it. Examples of the causes in low population densities include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Minimum_viable_population_size Minimum viable population size]. Eoearth.org (March 6, 2010).

{{main|List of countries and territories by population density}}
For [[human]]s, population density is the number of people per unit of area, usually quoted per square kilometer or square mile (which may include or exclude, for example, areas of water or glaciers). Commonly this may be calculated for a [[county]], [[list of cities by population density|city]], [[country]], another [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] or the [[Earth|entire world]].

The [[world's population]] is around 7,500,000,000&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html U.S. &amp; World Population Clocks]. Census.gov. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Earth]]'s total area (including land and water) is 510,000,000 square kilometers (197,000,000 sq. mi.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html World]. CIA World Handbook&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the worldwide human population density is around 7,500,000,000 ÷ 510,000,000 = 14.7 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (38 per sq. mi). If only the Earth's land area of 150,000,000  km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (58,000,000 sq. mi.) is taken into account, then human population density is 50 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (129 per sq. mile). This includes all continental and island land area, including [[Antarctica]]. If Antarctica is also excluded, then population density rises to over 55 people per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (over 142 per sq. mile).&lt;ref name=about/&gt; However, over half{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} of the Earth's land mass consists of areas inhospitable to human habitation, such as deserts and high mountains, and population tends to cluster around seaports and fresh-water sources. Thus, this number by itself does not give any helpful measurement of human population density.

Several of the most densely populated territories in the world are [[city-state]]s, [[microstate]]s and [[Dependent territory|dependencies]].&lt;ref name=unpop&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_text_tables.pdf | title=World Population Prospects, Table A.1| version=2008 revision | format=PDF | publisher=United Nations | author=Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division | year=2009 | accessdate= March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Monaco government uses a smaller surface area figure resulting in a population density of 18,078 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These territories have a relatively small area and a high [[urbanization]] level, with an economically specialized [[city]] population drawing also on rural resources outside the area, illustrating the difference between high population density and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]

The potential to maintain the agricultural aspects of deserts is extremely limited as there is not enough precipitation to support a sustainable land. The population in these areas are extremely low. Therefore cities in the Middle East, such as Dubai, have been increasing in population and infrastructure growth at a fast pace. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/41320143|title=Desert regions : population, migration, and environment|last=1923-2009.|first=Portnov, B. A. (Boris Adolʹfovich) Hare, A. Paul (Alexander Paul),|date=1999|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=3540657800|location=|pages=|oclc=41320143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities with high population densities are, by some, considered to be overpopulated, though this will depend on factors like quality of housing and infrastructure and access to resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalissues.org/issue/198/human-population Human Population]. Global Issues. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the most densely populated cities are in [[Southeast Asia]], though [[Cairo]] and [[Lagos]] in [[Africa]] also fall into this category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/largest-cities-density-125.html The largest cities in the world by land area, population and density]. Citymayors.com. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

City population and especially area are, however, heavily dependent on the definition of "urban area" used: densities are almost invariably higher for the central city area than when suburban settlements and the intervening rural areas are included, as in the areas of [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] or [[metropolitan area]], the latter sometimes including neighboring cities. For instance, [[Milwaukee]] has a greater population density when just the inner city is measured, and the surrounding suburbs excluded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconline.com/greenmap/milwaukee/population.html The Population of Milwaukee County]. Wisconline.com. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, based on a world population of seven billion, the world's inhabitants, as a loose crowd taking up ten square feet (one square metre) per person ([[Jacobs Method]]), would occupy a space a little larger than [[Delaware]]'s land area.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Other methods of measurement ===

Although arithmetic density is the most common way of measuring population density, several other methods have been developed to provide a more accurate measure of population density over a specific area.
* '''Arithmetic density''': The total number of people / area of land (measured in square miles or square kilometers)
* '''[[Physiological density]]''': The total population / area of [[arable land]]
* '''Agricultural density''': The total ''rural'' population / area of [[arable land]]
* '''Residential density''': The number of people living in an urban area / area of residential land
* '''[[Urban density]]''': The number of people inhabiting an urban area / total area of urban land
* '''Ecological optimum''': The density of population that can be supported by the natural resources

[[File:PocketComparator2.JPG|thumb|300px|Reticle of [[Bell &amp; Howell]] Pocket Comparator]]
A '''reticle''', or '''reticule''' ({{ety|la|reticulum|net}}), also known as a '''graticule''' ({{ety|la|craticula|[[Gridiron (cooking)|gridiron]]}}), is a pattern of fine lines or markings built into the eyepiece of a sighting device, such as a [[telescopic sight]] in a telescope, a microscope, or the screen of an oscilloscope, to provide measurement references during visual examination. Today, engraved lines or embedded fibers may be replaced by a computer-generated image superimposed on a screen or eyepiece. Both terms may be used to describe any set of lines used for optical measurement, but in modern use ''reticle'' is most commonly used for gunsights and such, while ''graticule'' is more widely used for the [[oscilloscope#Graticule|oscilloscope display]], [[microscope slide]]s, and similar roles.
[[File:ПД-8 (ПД-8А).jpg|thumb| Reticle accessory (PD-8) used in sniper rifles]]
There are many variations of reticles; this article concerns itself mainly with a simple reticle: '''crosshairs'''. Crosshairs are most commonly represented as intersecting lines in the shape of a cross,  "+", though many variations exist, including dots, [[Vertical bar|posts]], [[Concentric|circles]], scales, [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]], or a combination of these. Most commonly associated with telescopic sights for aiming [[firearm]]s, crosshairs are also common in optical instruments used for astronomy and surveying, and are also popular in [[graphical user interface]]s as a precision [[cursor (computers)|pointer]]. The reticle is said to have been invented by [[Robert Hooke]], and dates to the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;

==Use==

===Firearms===

Telescopic sights for firearms, generally just called ''scopes'', are probably the device most often associated with crosshairs. [[Motion picture]]s and the media often use a view through crosshairs as a dramatic device, which has given crosshairs wide cultural exposure.

====Reticle shape====
While the traditional thin crossing lines are the original and still the most familiar cross-hair shape, they are really best suited for precision aiming at high contrast targets, as the thin lines are easily lost in complex backgrounds, such as those encountered while hunting. Thicker bars are much easier to discern against a complex background, but lack the precision of thin bars. The most popular types of cross-hair in modern scopes are variants on the ''duplex'' cross-hair, with bars that are thick on the perimeter and thin out in the middle.  The thick bars allow the eye to quickly locate the center of the reticle, and the thin lines in the center allow for precision aiming. The thin bars in a duplex reticle may also be designed to be used as a measure. Called a 30/30 reticle, the thin bars on such a reticle span 30 minutes of arc (0.5º), which is approximately equal to 30 inches at 100 yards. This enables an experienced shooter to deduce, on the basis of the known size of an object in view, (as opposed to guess or estimate) the range within an acceptable error limit.

====Wire crosshairs====
[[File:Findot reticle 2.png|thumb|right|Etched "FinnDot" reticle (a regular [[milliradian|mil]]-dot reticle with the addition of 400 m – 1200 m holdover [[stadiametric rangefinding|(stadiametric) rangefinding]] brackets for 1 meter high or 0.5 meter wide targets at 400, 600, 800, 1000 and 1200 m). Reticle illumination is provided by a tritium ampoule embedded in the elevation turret.]]

Originally crosshairs were constructed out of hair or spiderweb, these materials being sufficiently thin and strong. Many modern scopes use wire crosshairs, which can be flattened to various degrees to change the width. These wires are usually silver in color, but appear black when backlit by the image passing through the scope's optics. Wire reticles are by nature fairly simple, as they require lines that pass all the way across the reticle, and the shapes are limited to the variations in thickness allowed by flattening the wire; duplex crosshairs, and crosshairs with dots are possible, and multiple horizontal or vertical lines may be used. The advantage of wire crosshairs is that they are fairly tough and durable, and provide no obstruction to light passing through the scope.

====Etched reticles====
[[Image:USGsight01.jpg|thumb |alt=The day and low-light reticles of the USG reflex sight used on the FN P90 / PS90 USG models |The day and low-light reticles of the integral [[reflex sight]] used on the [[FN P90]] / PS90 USG models]] 

The first suggestion for etched glass reticles was made by [[Philippe de La Hire]] in 1700.&lt;ref name="daumas"&gt;Maurice Daumas, ''Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers'', Portman Books, London 1989  {{ISBN|978-0-7134-0727-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His method was based on engraving the lines on a glass plate with a [[diamond]] point. Many modern crosshairs are actually [[Industrial etching|etch]]ed onto a thin plate of [[glass]], which allows a far greater latitude in shapes. Etched glass reticles can have ''floating'' elements, which do not cross the reticle; circles and dots are common, and some types of glass reticles have complex sections designed for use in [[Stadiametric rangefinding|range estimation]] and bullet drop and drift compensation (see [[external ballistics]]). A potential disadvantage of glass reticles is that they are less durable than wire crosshairs, and the surface of the glass reflects some light (about 4% per surface on uncoated glass&lt;ref&gt;Richard Feynman, the red books&lt;/ref&gt;) lessening transmission through the scope, although this light loss is near zero if the glass is multicoated (coating being the norm for all modern high quality optical products).

====Illuminated reticles====
Reticles may be illuminated, either by a plastic or [[fiber optic]] [[light pipe]] collecting ambient light or, in low light conditions, by a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] powered [[LED]]. Some sights also use the radioactive decay of [[tritium]] for illumination that can work for 11 years without using a battery, used in the British [[SUSAT]] sight for the [[SA80]] (L85) assault rifle and in the American [[Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight|ACOG (Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight)]]. Red is the most common color used, as it is the least destructive to the shooter's [[night vision]], but some products use green or yellow illumination, either as a single colour or changeable via user selection.

====Graticule====
A graticule is another term for reticle, frequently encountered in British and British military technical manuals, and came into common use during World War One.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofappl00glazmiss#page/120/mode/2up  Glazebrook, Sir Richard, A Dictionary of Applied Physics, Macmillan and Co., London, 1923.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reticle focal plane===
The reticle may be located at the front or rear focal plane (First Focal Plane (FFP) or Second Focal Plane (SFP)) of the telescopic sight. On fixed power telescopic sights there is no significant difference, but on variable power telescopic sights the front plane reticle remains at a constant size compared to the target, while rear plane reticles remain a constant size to the user as the target image grows and shrinks. Front focal plane reticles are slightly more durable, but most American users prefer that the reticle remains constant as the image changes size, so nearly all modern American variable power telescopic sights are rear focal plane designs. American and European high end optics manufacturers often leave the customer the choice between a FFP or SFP mounted reticle.

====Collimated reticles====
[[File:Reflector reflex sight diagram 3.png|thumb|right|Diagram of three types of reflector sights that produce collimated reticles. The top uses a collimating lens (CL) and a beam splitter (B) to create a  [[virtual image]] at infinity (V) of a reticle (R). The bottom two use half silvered curved mirrors (CM) as the collimating optics with the reticle off-set or between the mirror and the observer.]]
{{main|Reflector sight}}
Collimated reticles are produced by non-magnifying optical devices such as [[reflector sight]]s (often called ''reflex sights'') that give the viewer an image of the reticle superimposed over the field of view, and blind [[collimator sight]]s that are used with both eyes. Collimated reticles are created using [[refraction|refractive]] or [[reflection (physics)|reflective]] [[Collimator#Optical collimators|optical collimators]] to generate a [[Collimated light|collimated]] image of an illuminated or reflective reticle. These types of sights are used on surveying/triangulating equipment, to aid celestial telescope aiming, and as [[gunsights|sight]]s on [[firearm]]s.  Historically they were used on larger military weapon systems that could supply an electrical source to illuminate them and where the operator needed a wide field of view to track and range a moving target visually (i.e. weapons from the pre [[laser]]/[[radar]]/[[computer]] era). More recently sights using low power consumption durable [[light emitting diode]]s as the reticle (called ''[[red dot sight]]''s) have become common on small arms with versions like the [[Aimpoint CompM2]] being widely fielded by the U.S. Military.

====Holographic reticles====
[[Holographic weapon sight]]s use a [[hologram|holographic]] image of a reticle at finite set range built into the viewing window and a [[collimated light|collimated]] [[laser diode]] to illuminate it.  An advantage to holographic sights is that they eliminate a type of [[parallax]] problem found  in some optical collimator based sights (such as the [[red dot sight]]) where the spherical mirror used induces [[spherical aberration]] that can cause the reticle to skew off the sight's [[optical axis]]. The use of a hologram also eliminates the need for image dimming narrow band reflective coatings and allows for reticles of almost any shape or [[milliradian|mil]] size. A downside to the holographic weapon sight can be the weight and shorter battery life. As with red dot sights, holographic weapon sights have also become common on small arms with versions like the [[EOTech|Eotech]] 512.A65 and similar models fielded by the U.S. Military&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/Holographic-Sights-for-SOCOM-M4s-06416/ |title=Holographic Sights for SOCOM M4s |deadurl=no |accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and various law enforcement agencies.

===Surveying and astronomy===
In older instruments, reticle crosshairs and stadia marks were made using threads taken from the [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]] of the [[brown recluse spider]]. This very fine, strong spider silk makes for an excellent crosshair.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Davis, Francis Foote, Joe Kelly, ''Surveying, Theory and Practice'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1966 LC 64-66263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berenbaum, May R., ''Field Notes - Spin Control'', The Sciences, The New York Academy Of Sciences, September/October 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

====Surveying====
In surveying, reticles are designed for specific uses. [[Dumpy level|Level]]s and [[theodolite]]s would have slightly different reticles. However, both may have features such as [[stadia mark]]s to allow distance measurements.

====Astronomy====
For astronomical uses, reticles could be simple crosshair designs or more elaborate designs for special purposes. Telescopes used for [[polar alignment]] could have a reticle that indicates the position of [[Polaris]] relative to the north celestial pole. Telescopes that are used for very precise measurements would have a [[filar micrometer]] as a reticle; this could be adjusted by the operator to measure angular distances between stars.

For aiming telescopes, [[reflex sight]]s are popular, often in conjunction with a small telescope with a crosshair reticle. They make aiming the telescope at an [[astronomical object]] easier.

The constellation [[Reticulum]] was designated to recognize the reticle and its contributions to astronomy.

The '''rule of marteloio''' is a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] technique of [[navigation]]al computation that uses [[compass]] direction, [[distance]] and a simple [[Trigonometry|trigonometric]] table known as the '''''toleta de marteloio'''''. The rule told [[mariner]]s how to plot the traverse between two different navigation [[Course (navigation)|courses]] by means of resolving [[triangle]]s with the help of the ''Toleta'' and basic [[arithmetic]].

Those uncomfortable with manipulating numbers could resort to the visual '''''tondo e quadro''''' (circle-and-square) and achieve their answer with [[dividers]].  The rule of marteloio was commonly used by [[Mediterranean]] navigators during the 14th and 15th centuries, before the development of [[celestial navigation|astronomical navigation]].

== Etymology ==
The [[etymology]] comes from the [[Venetian language]].  In his 1436 atlas, [[Venice|Venetian]] captain and cartographer [[Andrea Bianco]] introduced a table of numbers which he called the ''toleta de marteloio'' ("table of marteloio"), and the method of using it as the ''raxon de marteloio'' ("reason of marteloio").

The meaning of ''marteloio'' itself is uncertain.  The most widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld|A.E. Nordenskiöld]], is that ''marteloio'' relates to "[[hammer]]" ("martelo" in Venetian), referring to the small hammer that was used to hit the on-board [[ship's bell]] to mark the passage of time.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenskiöld (1897: p.51ff); Ruge (1900: [https://books.google.com/books?id=S6o9wHoZVZEC&amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.177]).&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that the -''oio'' suffix implies that ''marteloio'' meant not quite the hammer itself nor the hammerer, but rather "the hammering", intending to indicate "the hammering, the din, the racket" from the [[watch system|change of the watch]] every four hours.  As there were many hands on deck during a change of the watch, it would be an opportune moment for the ship's [[maritime pilot|pilot]] to order a change in [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] (if necessary).&lt;ref&gt;Kelley (1995: p. 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative hypotheses (not nearly as accepted) are that "marteloio" is a corruption of ''mari logio'' (meaning "rule of the sea"),&lt;ref&gt;This was forwarded by Giuseppe Toaldo (1782: [https://books.google.com/books?id=OWErAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 44])&lt;/ref&gt; or from ''mare tela'' (meaning "sea network"),&lt;ref&gt;This was proposed by Desimoni (1888: p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt; or that it derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''homartologium'' (''όμαρτόλογίον'', meaning "companion piece"),&lt;ref&gt;Morelli (1810: [https://books.google.com/books?id=4ls6AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.42]).  Morelli's interpretation is cited already by Formaleoni (1783: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zso9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.28]).&lt;/ref&gt; or from the Greek ''imeralogium'' (''ήμερόλογίον'', meaning "daily calculation")&lt;ref&gt;This was proposed by Fincati, as reported by Albertis (1893)&lt;/ref&gt; or that it might be from the northern [[French language|French]] ''matelot'', which in turn comes from [[Breton language|Breton]] ''martolod'' (meaning "sailors").&lt;ref&gt;This is proposed by Breusing (1881: [https://books.google.com/books?id=vnA9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 130])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==

[[image:Medieval ship and compass (Mandeville).jpg|thumb|300px|15th-century mariner consulting a compass aboard ship (from [[John Mandeville]]'s ''Travels'', 1403)]]
The "rule of marteloio" was used in European navigation in the [[Middle Ages]], most notably in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] between the 14th and 16th centuries, although it may have older roots.  It was an integral part of navigation by "compass and chart", before the advent of [[geographical coordinates]] and the development of [[celestial navigation]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1956); Parry (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval navigation relied on two parameters, direction and distance.  On board ship, direction was determined by the [[mariner's compass]] (which emerged around 1300).&lt;ref&gt;Aczel (2001: p.76)&lt;/ref&gt;  Distance was measured by [[dead reckoning]], (''i.e.'', distance = speed &amp;times; time), where time was measured by a half-[[hour-glass]], and speed readings were taken with by some form of a [[chip log]] (the archaic method, used in the 14th and 15th centuries, involved heaving a piece of wood or flotsam overboard; the crew engaged in a rhythmic chant to mark the time it took for the chip to float past the length of the ship).&lt;ref&gt;Kelley (1995: p.12). This is slightly different from the later chip log, where the wood was tied to a rope with regularly spaced knots; the rope was allowed to unspool freely until a sandglass ran out, and the "[[knot (unit)|knots]]" counted up in the aftermath. The chip log was first mentioned by [[William Bourne (mathematician)|William Bourne]] in 1574.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:Mediterranean chart fourteenth century2.jpg|thumb|300px|Anonymous Genoese [[portolan chart]] from c. 1325 to c. 1350. ([[Library of Congress]], Washington DC)]]
Plotting a course required knowing the compass direction and distance between point A and point B.  Knowledge of where ports lay relative to each other was acquired by navigators by long experience at sea.  This information was sometimes collected and written down in a pilot's handbook, known as a ''[[portolano]]'' ("port book", in Italian, equivalent to the Greek ''[[periplus]]'', the Portuguese ''roteiro'' and the English ''[[rutter (nautical)|rutter]]'').  These handbooks were used to construct a class of nautical maps known as [[portolan charts]].  Portolan charts began being produced in [[Genoa]] in the late 13th century, and soon spread to [[Venice]] and [[Majorca]].  Portolan charts were not gridded by longitude and latitude lines, but rather by a web of [[compass rose|compass]] [[rhumb lines]], giving mariners an idea of only the distance and direction between places.

[[File:32-point compass (traditional winds).svg|thumb|300px|32-wind [[compass rose]] with traditional names (and traditional color code).]]
By a handbook or a portolan chart, a navigator could see immediately that, for example, [[Pisa]] lay 85 miles southeast ("Scirocco" in the traditional [[compass rose]] nomenclature) of [[Genoa]], and so a ship that set out from Genoa to Pisa would simply maintain that bearing for that distance. However, most sailing courses were not nearly that neat.  A mariner wishing to sail from [[Majorca]] to [[Naples]] could tell the latter was due east ("Levante") by some 600 miles – but the island of [[Sardinia]] lies in the way, therefore the ship's bearing must be changed along the route.  This is easier said than done, as [[geographical coordinates]] did not exist during this era.  The only way to determine the exact position of the ship at sea would be to calculate via past bearing and distance travelled.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1956: p.123, 159, 167); Parry (1974: p.37)&lt;/ref&gt;

Islands were a predictable obstacle – circumventing Sardinia would be simply a matter of sailing southeast for a set distance then changing the bearing to northeast ("Greco") for the remainder.  More problematic is if the ship were blown off its intended route by fitful winds, or had to engage in [[Tacking (sailing)|tacking]], changing bearing repeatedly. How does it return to its intended course?  This is where the rule of marteloio came in.

== The traverse problem ==

The rule of marteloio addressed the problem of changing bearing at sea. More specifically, it helped a navigator plot the traverse from one navigational [[Course (navigation)|course]] to another.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1956: p.116ff.) Taylor (1960: p.10)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, suppose a ship was to sail from [[Corsica]] to [[Genoa]], a course bearing straight north ("Tramontana") for some 130 miles. But the winds are not cooperative, and the ship was forced to sail northwest ("Maestro") for some 70 miles.  How does it return to its original route?  Re-setting its bearing to northeast ("Greco") seems sensible enough, but how long should it sail on that bearing?  How would a navigator know when the ship had reached its old route and should turn north again?   How to avoid overshooting or undershooting the old course?

[[image:Marteloio on chart.jpg|thumb|150px|The traverse problem: intended course ''AB'' (bearing N), actual course ''AC'' (bearing NW). Calculating the ''ritorno'' (distance on return course ''CD'', bearing NE) and ''avanzo'' (distance made good on intended course) is a matter of solving the triangle ''ACD'']]
This is a mathematical problem of [[solution of triangles|solving a triangle]].  If a navigator knows how long the ship has sailed on the erroneous course, he can calculate its current distance from its intended course, and estimate how long it must sail back on a new bearing until it recovers its old course.  In the Corsica-to-Genoa example, there is an implied [[triangle]] ''ACD'', with one side given (''AC'' = 70 miles on actual NW course), a 45° angle at ''A'' (angle of difference between actual course NW and intended course N) and another angle of 90° at ''C'' (angle of difference between actual course NW and return course NE).  The challenge to the navigator is to find how long one must sail on the NE return course (the length of side ''CD'', what is called the ''ritorno'') and how far one has advanced on the intended course by the time one straightens out (the length of the hypotenuse ''AD'', or what is called the total ''avanzo'').

This is elementary [[trigonometry]], solving for two sides given one side (70) and two angles (45° and 90°). This is quickly done by applying the [[law of sines]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {70 \text{ miles}}{\sin D} = \frac {\text{ritorno}}{\sin 45} = \frac {\text{avanzo}}{\sin 90}  &lt;/math&gt;

yielding up the solutions ''ritorno'' = 70 miles and total ''avanzo'' = 98.99 miles.  This means that if the ship bears NE from its current position (''C''), it will reach its original intended course after 70 miles of sailing on the NE bearing. By the time it reaches its junction point (''D''), it will have covered 98.99 miles of its original intended course.  There it can straighten its bearing N and sail the remaining 30 miles or so to Genoa.

Unfortunately, Medieval sailors with the rudimentary educational levels of the 14th and 15th centuries, were not likely to know the Law of Sines or manipulate it with ease.&lt;ref&gt;Van Brunnelen (2010, p.67)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Medieval navigators needed simpler and more accessible method of calculation.

== Rules ==

=== Ramon Llull's "miliaria" ===

The scholar-cleric [[Ramon Llull]] of [[Majorca]], was the first writer to refer to a rule to solve the traverse problem of navigation. In his ''Arbor Scientiae'' (1295), in the section of questions on geometry, Llul writes:

{{Cquote|How do mariners measure miles at sea (''miliaria in mari'')?  Mariners consider the four general winds, that is to say the eastern, western, northern and southern, and also another four winds that lie between them, ''grec'' (NE),''exaloch'' (SE), ''lebeg'' (SW) and ''maestre'' (NW).   And they look carefully at the center of the circle in which the winds (rhumbs) meet at angles; they consider when a ship travels by the East wind (''levant'')  100 miles from the center, how many miles it would make on the southeast (''exaloch'') wind; and for 200 miles, they double the number by multiplying and then they know how many miles there are from the end of each 100 miles in an easterly direction to the corresponding point in a southeasterly direction.  And for this they have this instrument [a mathematical table?] and a chart, rutter, needle and the pole star."&lt;ref&gt;Llull ''Arbor Scientiae'' (1295, (1635 Latin ed.):[https://books.google.com/books?id=v1zSAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA570#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.570] See also Edson (2007: p.51) and Cotter (1978:p.5)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

What Llull seems to be trying to explain is that a ship actually sailing E, but intending to sail SE, it can figure out how much of its intended southeastward distance it has already made good – what Italians called the "''avanzar''", but Lull seems to call the "''miliaria in mari''".  Llull does not explain exactly how, but refers only to an "instrument", presumably some sort of trigonometric table. Lull is implying that mariners can calculate the ''miliaria'' on the intended course by multiplying the distance actually sailed on the erroneous course by the [[cosine]] of the angle between the two routes.&lt;ref&gt;This interpretation is originally due to Taylor (1956: pp. 117–19).  See also Cortesão (1969: v. 1, pp. 206–7), Cotter (1978: pp. 6–7) and Campbell (1987: pp. 441–42).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[image:Marteloio of Ramon Llull.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ramon Lull]]'s ''miliaria in mari'', from his 1295 example.]]

: ''Miliaria in mari'' = distance sailed &amp;times; cos(''θ'')

where ''θ'' is the angle of difference between the two routes.

Using Lull's example, a ship that intended to sail southeast ("Exaloch" is [[Catalan language|Catalan]] for "Scirocco") but was instead forced to sail east ("Levant"), then the angle of difference is ''θ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;45°.  After 100 miles on the erroneous route, the ''miliaria'' on the intended route is 100&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;45° = 70.71.  Doubling the sailing on the erroneous route to 200 miles will double the ''miliaria'' on the intended route to 141.42 miles (=&amp;nbsp;200&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;45°).

(Diagramatically, Lull's ''miliaria in mari'' is measured by constructing a [[right-angled triangle]] by running a cord from the distance sailed on the actual course to the intended course, meeting the latter at a 90° angle).

Llull is a little more explicit in his ''Ars magna generalis et ultima'' (written c. 1305).&lt;ref&gt;Ramom Llull, 1517 ed., Part 10, "De Navigatione", [https://books.google.com/books?id=rG_yINh8V1gC&amp;pg=PT213#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false fo. 93, p. 213].  See also Cotter (1978: p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt;  Reversing his example, with a ship actually sailing Southeast but intending to sail East, Llull notes that for every four miles on the southeast bearing, it "gains three miles" (2.83 actually) on the intended eastward route.  Thus, Lull notes, the ship "loses 25 miles" (29 actually) of its intended course for every 100 miles it sails on the current course.

Notice that in his passages, Ramon Lull is not recommending the rule, but reporting it, insinuating that this rule was already known and used by contemporary sailors in practice.&lt;ref&gt;"To a mathematician familiar with contemporary mathematical knowledge and practice, it is quite clear that Lull did not fully understand what he was writing about.  He used his shipboard observations during his travels to support transcendental ideas about the circle, triangle and square.  His value is as a witness to late-thirteenth century mariners doing vector navigations with chart or plotting board." (Kelley, 1995: p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;  This is perhaps unsurprising – although [[History of trigonometry|trigonometry]] was only in its infancy in Christian Europe, sine and cosine tables were already known in [[History of trigonometry#Islamic mathematics|Arab mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1960: p. 10)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Kingdom of Majorca]], under Muslim rule until the 1230s, remained a multicultural center in Lull's time, with flourishing [[Majorcan Jews|Jewish communities]], many of whom dabbled in mathematics and astronomy, and whose seafarers had extensive contact across the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1956: p. 114); Kelley (1995: p. 3); Vernet (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  That Majorcan navigators had some sort of trigonometric table at hand is not improbable.  Nonetheless, the exact content and layout of this table implied by Ramon Llull in 1295 is uncertain.

=== Andrea Bianco's "toleta" ===
[[image:Toleta de marteloio (Bianco, 1436).jpg|thumb|300px|The ''toleta de marteloio'' from [[Andrea Bianco]]'s 1436 atlas]]
We get our first glimpse of a mariner's trigonometric table more than a century after Llull. In the first folio of his 1436 [[portolan chart|portolan atlas]], the [[Venice|Venetian]] captain [[Andrea Bianco]] explains the ''raxon de marteloio'', how to calculate the traverse and recover the course.  He lays out a simple trigonometric table he calls the ''toleta de marteloio'' and recommends that mariners commit the table to memory.&lt;ref&gt;For a transcription of Bianco's  1436 instructions, see Formaleoni (1783: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zso9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.30]) or Gelgich (1892: [https://books.google.com/books?id=E6mtAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.73])&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''toleta de marteloio'' is set out as follows:&lt;ref&gt;The ''Toleta'' we replicate here is the version of [[Michael of Rhodes]] (McGee et al., [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/manuscript/page_48b.html p.48b]).  Bianco's original table contains some small errors – specifically in the ''ritorno'' column, Bianco mistakenly inserts 14 rather than 12 in the fifth row (q = 5); in the ''avanzo di ritorno'' column, Bianco gives 5{{frac|1|10}} instead of 2{{frac|1|5}} in the seventh row and 8 instead of 10 in the eighth row. Gelgich (1892: [https://books.google.com/books?id=E6mtAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.74]).  It is possible that by the "5{{frac|1|10}}" entry, Bianco meant to write "1/5th of 10" = 2 (the number often given in modern reproductions of the toleta, e.g. Vernet, 2008)).  The 2{{frac|1|5}} is given only in the toleta version of Michael of Rhodes. The version in the Foscarini letter, that entry is given as 1{{frac|9|10}} 9/10 (Toaldo, 1782: [https://books.google.com/books?id=OWErAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.43]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers in the ''Toleta'' can be approximated by the modern formulas:&lt;ref&gt;Vernet (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Alargar = {{math|100 &amp;times; sin (&lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; &amp;times; 11.15)}}
* Avanzar = {{math|100 &amp;times; cos (&lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; &amp;times; 11.15)}}
* Ritorno = {{math|10 / sin (&lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; &amp;times; 11.15)}}
* Avanzo di ritorno = {{math|10 / tan (&lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; &amp;times; 11.15)}}

where ''q'' = number of [[quarter wind]]s (angle of difference expressed in number of quarter winds).  (notice that the numbers work with quarter-winds set at 11.15° intervals, rather than 11.25°, the usual definition of a quarter wind).

The ''Toleta'' is a simple table with several columns of numbers.  In the first column is the angle of difference between the actual and intended courses, expressed by number of [[quarter-winds]].  Once that difference is determined, the second column gives the ''Alargar'' (the "Widening", the current distance the ship is from the intended course) while the third column tells the ''Avanzar'' (the "Advance", how much of the distance on the intended course has already been covered by sailing on the current bearing – this is equivalent of Ramon Llull's ''miliaria di mari'').  The Alargar and Avanzar numbers are shown on the Bianco's table for 100 miles of sailing on the current course.

[[image:Marteloio alargar.jpg|thumb|400px|Calculating ''alargar'' and ''avanzar'' from Bianco's ''Toleta''.]]
'''Example''':  suppose a ship intended to sail bearing east ("Levante") from point A to point B. But suppose that winds forced it to sail on a southeast-by-east course (SEbE, "Quarto di Scirocco verso Levante").  Southeast-by-east is three quarter winds (or 33.75°) away from east (on a 32-point [[compass rose|compass]], in order of quarter-winds away from east, 1 quarter is east-by-south, 2 quarters is East-southeast, 3 quarters is southeast-by-east).  That means that the navigator should consult the third row,&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, on the toleta.

Suppose the ship sailed 100 miles on the SE-by-E bearing. To check his distance from the intended eastward course, the mariner will read the corresponding entry on the ''alargar'' column and immediately see he is 55 miles away from the intended course.   The ''avanzar'' column informs him that having sailed 100 miles on the current SEbE course, he has covered 83 miles of the intended E course.

The next step is to determine how to return to the intended course.  Continuing the example, to get back to the intended Eastward course, our mariner has to re-orient the ship's bearing in a northeasterly direction. But there are various northeasterly angles – NbE, NNE, NE, ENE, etc.  The mariner has a choose the bearing – if he returns by a sharp angle (e.g. North by east), he will return to the intended course faster than at a more gentle gradient (e.g. East by north).  Whichever angle he chooses, he must deduce exactly how long he must sail on that bearing in order to reach his old course. If he sails too long, he risks overshooting it.

[[File:Marteloio ritorno.jpg|thumb|400px|Calculating the ''ritorno'' and ''avanzo di ritorno'']]This is what the third column of the toleta is for.  The return angles are expressed as quarters from the ''intended'' course bearing (''not'' the current course bearing).  In our example, the mariner intended to go east, but has been sailing southeast-by-east for 100 miles.  Given the winds, he decides it is best to return to the original course by re-orienting the ship east-northeast (ENE, "Greco-Levante").  ENE is two quarter-winds above the ''intended'' bearing, East, so now he looks at second row ("quarters = 2") on the table.  In the third column, the ''ritorno'', shows the number 26.  This represents the required number of miles he must travel on ENE bearing for every 10 miles of alargar.  Remember, his alargar (distance from intended course) was 55 miles.  So in order to return to his intended course he must travel 5.5 &amp;times; 26 = 143 miles on ENE.  In other words, he needs to hold his ENE bearing for 143 miles; once that distance is travelled, he should straighten his ship East, and he will be exactly on the intended course.

The final column (''avanzo di ritorno'') gives the length on the intended course he has made good by his return travel.  This is also expressed in terms per 10 miles alargar. His alargar was 55, and his angle of return was ENE (thus q = 2), that means his avanzo di ritorno is 5.5 &amp;times; 24 = 132.  In other words, if everything goes right, and our mariner holds his ENE bearing for 143 miles (''ritorno''), then during that return, he will have covered an additional 132 miles on his intended eastward course (''avanzo di ritorno'').

Finally, the total avanzo on the eastward bearing is the avanzar during the deviation (83 miles) plus the avanzo di ritorno (132 miles), thus on the whole, he has covered 83 + 132 = 215 miles on the intended course.  Measuring that distance on the map from the starting point (''A''), the mariner can figure out his exact current position.

This is the simplest use of the toleta de marteloio.  It is, at root, a trigonometric table. However, it does not tackle the traverse problem in one go, like the Law of Sines, but rather splits the problem into two [[right-angled triangle]]s which it proceeds to solve successively.  Modern [[trigonometry]] would dispense with the step of calculating the alargar, and calculate the ritorno directly – but for that, one needs to be armed with a full [[trigonometric tables|sine table]]. The toleta is a rather simple table, easy to consult and perform calculations with, and sufficiently compact to be memorized by navigators (as Bianco recommends).

=== Rule of three ===

The ''toleta de marteloio'' is expressed for nice round numbers, 100 and 10.  But, in practice, a ship would not usually sail 100 miles before trying to return, but some other distance, say 65 miles.  To calculate this is a simple problem of solving [[ratio]]s.  For example, if the ship had sailed 65 miles on southeast-by-east, then calculating the alargar from the intended Eastward course is simply a matter of solving the following for {{math|&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;}}:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac {26}{100} = \frac {x}{65} &lt;/math&gt;

where 26 is the alargar for 100 miles (as given in the second column of the table).  This is easily done by the simple "[[Rule of three (mathematics)|Rule of Three]]", a method of cross-multiplication, using three numbers to solve for the fourth by successive multiplication and division:

: {{math|&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 65 × 26 ÷ 100}}

So, sailing for 65 miles on SE by E implies alargar = {{math|&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;}} =  16.9 miles.  The avanzar, etc. can be figured out analogously.

While the "rule of three" was already known in the 14th century, skill in executing [[multiplication]] and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] could be elusive for Medieval sailors drawn from what was a largely illiterate society. Nonetheless, it was not inaccessible.  As Andrea Bianco urged, navigators should "know how to multiply well and divide well" ("saver ben moltiplichar e ben partir")&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Gelgich (1892: p.73)&lt;/ref&gt;   It is here where we see the important interface of [[commerce]] and navigation.   The mathematics of commerce – [[Arabic numerals]], multiplication, division, [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], the tools needed to calculate purchases and sales of goods and other commercial transactions – was essentially the same as the mathematics of navigation.&lt;ref&gt;This is clearly shown in the book of Michael of Rhodes, where commercial and navigational calculations follow one another.  See the [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/math.html Michael of Rhodes website].&lt;/ref&gt;  And this kind of mathematics was taught at the [[abacus school]]s which were set up in the 13th century in the commercial centers of northern Italy to train the sons of merchants, the very same class where Italian navigators were drawn from.  As historian E.G.R. Taylor notes, "sailors were the first professional group to use mathematics in their everyday work"&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1960: p.12)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Circle and square ===

[[image:Tondo e quadro (basic features).jpg|thumb|300px|Reproduction of the basic features of the ''tondo e quadro'']]
For those troubled by the high art of manipulating numbers, there was an alternative. This was the visual device known as the "circle and square" (''tondo e quadro''), also supplied by [[Andrea Bianco]] in his 1436 atlas.&lt;ref&gt;Formaleoni (1783: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zso9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.35]), Cotter (1978: ([https://books.google.com/books?id=5fAnNGk1xXwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.10])&lt;/ref&gt;

The circle was a 32-wind [[compass rose]] (or gathering of rhumb-lines).  The circle was inscribed with an 8 &amp;times; 8 square grid.

The compass rose in the center can be overlooked – indeed, the circle itself can be ignored, as it is seems to have no other purpose than the construction of the rays that run across the grid.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  The rose of interest is in the upper left corner of the square grid. From that corner, emanate a series of compass [[rhumb lines]].  In his original 1436 ''tondo e quadro'', Bianco has sixteen emanating rays – that is, Bianco includes half-quarter winds, or eighth-winds (''otava''), so that the emanating rays are at intervals of 5.625 degrees.  Other constructions of the circle-and-square, e.g. the [[Cornaro Atlas]], use only eight rays emanating at quarter-wind distances (11.25 degrees).  Visually, these rays replicate the bottom right quarter of a 32-wind [[compass rose]]: East (0q), E by S (1q), ESE (2q), SE by E (3q), SE (4q), SE by S (5q), SSE (6q), S by E (7q) and South (8q).

[[image:Marteloio grid scale.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Reproduction of the bar scale of Bianco's ''tondo e quadro'']]
Above the grid is a distance [[Linear scale|bar scale]], notched with sub-units. There are two sets of numbers on the scale, one for measuring each grid square by 20 miles, another for measuring each grid square by 100 miles (see diagram).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1956: p.116; 1960: p.14)&lt;/ref&gt;  The top bar is the 20m-per-square scale, with every black dot denoting one mile.  The bottom bar is the 100m-per-square scale, where the length of a unit square is divided into two equal 50m sub-squares, and a set of dots and red lines break it down further into lengths of 10 miles.  So depending on which scale one chooses, the length of the side of the entire grid (eight squares) could be measured up to 160 miles (using the 20m-per-square scale) or up to 800 miles (using the 100m-per-square scale).

[[image:Tondo e quadro detail (Bianco, 1436).jpg|thumb|200px|Detail of Bianco's ''tondo e quadro'']]
The cherub with the [[dividers]] suggests how a navigator is supposed to use the grid to calculate alargar and avanzar by visual measurement rather than manipulating numbers.

[[image:Tondo e quadro (calculation).jpg|thumb|300px|Solving a triangle with the ''tondo e quadro'']]
'''Example''': suppose the ship has travelled 120 miles at two quarter-winds below the intended course (e.g. traveled at ESE, when the intended course is East).   Using the dividers and the 20m scale, the navigator can measure out 120 miles with his dividers.  Then setting one end at the top left corner (''A''), he lays out the dividers along the ESE ray (= two quarter-winds below the East ray, or horizontal top of the grid) and marks the spot (point ''B'' on the diagram). Then using a [[straightedge]] ruler draws a line up to the East ray, and marks the corresponding spot ''C''.

It is easy to see immediately that a [[right-angled triangle]] ''ABC'' has been created. The length ''BC'' is the ''alargar'' (distance from intended course), which can be measured as 46 miles (this can be visually seen as two grid squares plus a bit, that is 20m + 20m and a little bit which can be assessed as 6m by using the dividers and the 20m bar scale).  The length ''AC'' is the ''avanzar'' (distance made good), which is 111 miles – visually, five grid squares and a bit, or (20 &amp;times; 5) + 11, measured by dividers and scale again.

This is how the "circle and square" dispenses manipulating numbers by multiplication and division or the rule of three.  The navigator can assess the avanzar and alargar visually, by measurement alone.

This method can be used for any intended bearing and deviation, as the only purpose is to solve the triangle by dividers and scale.  e.g. using our first Corsica-to-Genoa example, where intended bearing was North but the ship actually sailed Northwest, the navigator would set the dividers at length 70 miles and lay it along the fourth quarter wind (= SE ray in the ''tondo e quadro'', as NW is four quarter winds away from North).  He would calculate the alargar and avanzar in exactly the same way – draw a line to the horizontal top of the grid, measure the squares, etc.

The ''tondo e quadro'' device is very similar to the Arab [[sine quadrant]] (''Rubul mujayyab''), with the corner rays replicating the role of the adjustable [[plumb line]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelley (1995: p.3)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other applications ==

While the ''toleta de marteloio'' (and its visual counterpart, the ''tondo e quadro'') are designed for the explicit task of recovering an intended course, they can be used in more ways, for many classes of navigational problems, e.g. plotting out a course with multiple-bearing changes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/navigate_toolkit.html Michael of Rhodes website] shows various sort of problems Michael considered.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Triangulation ===

One of the interesting applications of the rule of marteloio is for [[triangulation]], e.g. determining the distance of the ship from shore landmark. (This was the final exercise attempted in the notebook of the Venetian navigator [[Michael of Rhodes]], which we replicate here.)&lt;ref&gt;See Michael of Rhodes [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/manuscript/page_48a.html p.48a] and [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/manuscript/page_48b.html 48b]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Example''': Suppose a ship sailing NW ("Maestro") spots a landmark due West ("Ponente") one evening, but distance unknown.  Suppose the ship continues sailing on the NW route overnight, and the next morning, 40 miles later, it notices that landmark is now west-southwest (WSW, "Ponente-Libeccio") of its current position.  Finding the distance of the landmark from the ship is just an application of the rule of marteloio.

[[Image:Marteloio landmark triangulation.gif|thumb|401px|Application of the rule of marteloio to estimate the distance between the ship and a shore landmark.]]
To solve the problem, start from the evening position (''A'' on the map) and treat the distance between the ship and the landmark (length ''AB'') as the intended course, and the actual route of the ship (NW) as a deviation. To figure out the distance of the landmark from the ship's position in the morning (''C'') is a matter of treating the distance ''BC'' as the calculated ritorno. Since we need to know the alargar to calculate the ritorno, this is a two-step procedure.

First, notice that NW is four quarter-winds above W, so looking up on the ''toleta'', in the q = 4 row, the ''alargar'' is 71 miles for every 100 miles on the NW course.  But the ship only sailed 40 miles overnight, so we have to solve the ratio 71/100 = ''x''/40, which by the rule of three means ''x'' = alargar = 28.4 miles.  In other words, by the overnight  sailing NW by 40 miles from A to C, the ship is now 28.4 miles away from its "intended" Westward course.

Now for the ritorno.  The landmark, as noted, is WSW of the ship's morning position (''C'').  So to "return" to the landmark, the ship must change its bearing from its current NW bearing to a WSW bearing – that is, 6 quarter-winds below NW.  However, the toleta specifies quarter winds in terms of "intended" direction (in this case, West), and WSW is two quarter winds below West, so we need to look at the q = 2 row. This means the ritorno is 26 miles for every 10 miles alargar.  Since the alargar is 28.4, that means the ritorno is 26 &amp;times; 2.84 = 73.84.  And there we have it.  The landmark is 73.84 miles away from the ship's morning position.

(To complete the story, we might wish to find out the distance that landmark was the evening before (i.e. from point A to landmark B). That is simply a matter of adding the avanzar and the avanzo in ritorno. Quick calculations show the avanzar (@ q = 4, for 40 miles) is 28.4 miles (= 71 × 40/100) and the avanzo di ritorno (@ q = 2 for 28.4 miles alargar), is 2.84 × 24 = 68.16. So total avanzo = 28.4 + 68.16 = 96.56 miles. That was the distance between the landmark and the ship the evening before.)

=== Finding locations ===

The rule of marteloio can also be used with the ''avanzar'' as a target, e.g. suppose a ship sets out with the intention of finding the [[Tordesillas Line]], the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] legally set in a 1494 treaty at 370 leagues west of [[Cape Verde]].  The ship need not set out from Cape Verde and set sail constantly at West bearing to find it.  Rather, it can sail out at a more convenient bearing (e.g. SW), and treat West as an "intended" course.  So using the marteloio rule, it can sail on until the ''avanzar'' on the "intended" West course reaches 370 leagues.

Indeed, it need not even set out from Cape Verde, but can set out from another place, say, [[Seville]], and use the known distance and bearing of Cape Verde (viz. Seville) and the rule of marteloio to calculate when it has finally reached the Tordesillas meridian.  This takes a couple of steps.  Suppose Cape Verde (''B'' on map) is 400 leagues Southwest of Seville (''A'' on map), but the ship intends to go straight West from Seville to reach the Tordesillas meridian in the open sea.  How long does it need to sail?

[[image:Marteloio tordesillas.gif|thumb|300px|Finding the [[Tordesillas Line]] via the rule of marteloio]]
The way to solve this by the rule of marteloio is to pose the problem in reverse: treat West as intended bearing and SW as the actual course.  SW is four quarter-winds below W, so looking up the toleta for q = 4, the ''avanzar'' is 71 for every 100 miles sailed.  So if a ship sailed 400 leagues on the "actual" SW course to Cape Verde, it would achieve an ''avanzar'' of 284 leagues (= 71 &amp;times; 4) on the "intended" Westward course.  Of course, the ship is not actually sailing SW to Cape Verde, but sailing W into the open sea. In other words, when the ship sets sail West from Seville, it knows it needs to sail 284 leagues on the West bearing before it reaches the implied Cape Verde [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] (point ''C'' on map), and should only start counting the 370 leagues to the Tordesillas line thereafter. In other words, it needs to sail a total of 284 + 370 = 654 leagues West of Seville to reach the Tordesillas line (point ''D'' on map).

While this particular example shows the flexibility of the rule of marteloio, it also shows one of its principal drawbacks: the result completely ignores the [[curvature of the earth]], i.e. the fact that the [[longitude]] meridian lines converge on the [[North Pole]], and thus narrow at higher latitudes.  Contrary to what the marteloio suggests, 370 leagues West of Cape Verde is ''not'' on the same longitude meridian as 654 leagues West of Seville.  Because Seville is well north of Cape Verde, the meridians are clustered closer together at Seville's latitude than at Cape Verde's latitude.  A ship sailing west of Seville will, in fact, reach the real Tordesillas meridian (point ''T'' on map) well before 654 leagues are sailed (point ''D'').

The rule of marteloio has sailors plot routes by drawing [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] triangles on a chart, as if the world's surface were flat.  While this might be practical enough for sailing confined to the compact latitudes of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], it is quite misleading on a grander scale.

== Relation to later rules ==

=== Relation to the "regiment of the leagues" ===

In the late 15th and 16th centuries, the improvement of [[celestial navigation|nautical astronomy]] and the introduction of [[latitude]] parallels allowed navigators to determine their position at sea by celestial readings, rather than relying on estimation of distance sailed.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1956), Albuquerque (1970), Parry (1974), Randles (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  The successor of the rule of marteloio was the "Regiment of the Leagues" (''regimento das léguas''),  that was used by Portuguese navigators sailing in the Atlantic Ocean.  Or, to use the term introduced by [[William Bourne (mathematician)|William Bourne]] (1571), the "Rule to Raise or Lay a Degree", also known as the "Table of Leagues" or the "Rule for Raising the Pole".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1956: pp. 163–4); Cotter (1978: p.11)&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first written down in the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] navigation manual ''Regimento do astrolabio e do quadrante'' (published in Lisbon c. 1509, but written c. 1480)&lt;ref&gt;Diffie and Winius (1977: p.141); Parry (1974: [https://books.google.com/books?id=kCREcRCFD0QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.149])&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularized by [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]] in his 1551 ''Breve compendio la esfera y del arte de navegar''.

The "Regiment of the Leagues" is not very different from the rule of marteloio. The Regiment of the Leagues always considers the west-east bearing as the "intended course" and measures set deviations from it.  More specifically, the league table considers a fixed value of ''alargar'' – set at 1 [[Latitude#Degree length|latitude degree]] (or, in the measurements of the time, 17.5 (Portuguese) [[League (unit)|leagues]], or equivalently 70 (Italian) [[nautical mile|miles]]).&lt;ref&gt;Parry (pp. 149–50). One Portuguese league was four Italian miles. In modern nautical measures, one degree is 20 leagues, and one league is three nautical miles, thus 60 nautical miles to the degree.&lt;/ref&gt;  It then gives for every different [[quarter wind]] of sailing direction (always designated as quarters away from the north-south axis, rather than away from the intended course), the ''relevar'' and the ''afastar''.  The ''relevar'' is the number of leagues on the actual course that a ship must sail in order to cover the pre-set 1 degree of latitude (17.5 leagues of ''alargar'' from the starting parallel). The ''afastar'' is merely the corresponding ''avanzar'' on the west-east bearing.

[[image:Regiment of the leagues.gif|thumb|400px|Illustration of the "Regiment of the Leagues"]]
'''Example''':  Suppose a ship sets out on an East-southeast (ESE) bearing.  That is six quarter-winds above South (remember: unlike the marteloio, the Regiment of the Leagues always measures quarter-winds away from the north–south meridian).  Looking at any regiment of the leagues table (e.g. [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]], 1551),&lt;ref&gt;See Cotter (1978: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5fAnNGk1xXwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.13])&lt;/ref&gt; for ''q'' = 6, the table gives the ''relevar'' as 45{{frac|11|15}} leagues and the ''afastar'' as 42{{frac|1|4}} leagues.  This means that a ship sailing on the ESE bearing will have to sail 45.73 leagues to cover one degree of latitude (17.5 leagues of ''alargar'' from the east bearing, to use the marteloio language), and the corresponding ''afastar'' (''avanzar'' in marteloio terms) will be 42.25 leagues.

If, instead, the ship had set out on a SE bearing, that is four quarter-winds above South, the corresponding values of the Regiment of the Leagues table at ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 are ''relevar'' = 24{{frac|3|4}} and the ''afastar'' = 17 {{frac|1|2}}.

Notice that the SE bearing reaches the 1 degree alargar faster (i.e. smaller ''relevar'') than that the ESE bearing, and will have less ''afastar'' (closer to the N–S meridian).

Mathematically,

:''relevar'' = 17.5/cos θ
:''afastar'' = 17.5 &amp;times; tan θ

where θ = 11.25 &amp;times; number of quarters-winds away from the north-south axis.

Despite the difference in terminology, notably the use of latitude degrees, the rule of marteloio and the Regiment of the Leagues are very similar – they are both about solving triangles on a plane chart.  The advantage of the regiment over the marteloio is the introduction of latitude parallels in the table, so that the position can be checked by astronomical observation (via [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], [[astrolabe]], etc.), and not have to rely wholly on sailor estimations of distance and direction.

With the regiment, geographical coordinates can also be used to guide navigation.  For instance, the search for the Todesillas line (meridian 370 leagues west of Cape Verde) is much simplified by reference to a precise latitude.  For instance, suppose two ships depart from Cape Verde (17° N), one on a West by North bearing (WbN, that is one quarter above West, or ''q'' = 7 from North axis), the other by a west-northwest bearing (WNW, two quarters above west, or ''q'' = 6 from the North axis). Using the Regiment of the Leagues, it is possible to calculate the precise latitudes when they will cross the Tordesillas meridian – simply divide 370 leagues west by the implied ''afastar'' at the different bearings. The WbN ship will reach the meridian when it achieves latitude 21° 21' N, while the WNW ship will reach it when it achieves latitude 29° N.&lt;ref&gt;Albuquerque (1973:[https://books.google.com/books?id=vOrDjQgDzQ8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA231#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 231])&lt;/ref&gt; So rather than counting leagues with hourglass and speed readings, the ships can just maintain bearing, and take periodic astronomical observations to assess their latitude.

=== Relation to "traverse sailing" ===

The toleta de marteloio is ancestral to the modern "[[traverse table]]" used in more modern navigation.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of a traverse table, see Gunmere (1822) ''Mathematical Tables'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=dAg1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online].&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern nomenclature, the ''traverse'' is the "crooked path made by a ship when she sails in several successive directions" and ''resolving the traverse'' is "the method of finding a single course and distance which would bring a ship to the same place as two or more courses and distances".&lt;ref&gt;Merrifield (1883: [https://books.google.com/books?id=DUYDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 58])&lt;/ref&gt;  In marteloio language, when "resolving the traverse", the known information given is the "actual course" and the "ritorno", while the unknowns are the "intended bearing" and "total avanzo".

Traverse tables use three values for each of the crooked course segments – the ''Distance'' (Dist.), ''Difference of Latitude'' (D.Lat., movement along N–S axis) and the ''Departure'' (Dep., movement along E–W axis), the latter two calculated by the formulas:

: ''Difference of latitude'' = distance × cos ''θ'' 
: ''Departure'' =  distance × sin ''θ''

where ''θ'' is the angular difference of the course from the N–S axis if the values of ''θ'' are less than 45°; if, however, the angle exceeds 45°, then ''θ'' is expressed as the angle of difference from the E–W axis, and the formulas are flipped, i.e. the Difference of Latitude formula becomes the Departure, and the Departure formula is the Difference of Latitude).  Or, even more simply, calculate  ''θ'' as the angle of difference from the nearest principal wind (N, S, E, W), run the formulas and then place the larger number in the appropriate column (D.Lat. or Dep.).

For each course segment, the navigator inserts the relevant trio (Dist., D.Lat., Dep.) and can calculate the implied bearing from the beginning to the endpoint and the distance made good on that bearing. He then combines, by addition and subtraction, all the differences of latitude and departure, to get the overall difference of latitude and departure, and converts that back to overall bearing and distance made good.&lt;ref&gt;For applications, see Merrifield (1883: p. 61)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manuscript sources ==

[[Ramon Llull]]'s suggestive 1295 remarks aside, the earliest known reference to ''marteloio'' is dated 1390, in the inventory of the estate of the mother of a certain Oberto Foglieto of Genoa, where an entry reads  ''unum martelogium....item carta una pro navegando''.&lt;ref&gt;This is reproduced in Albertis (1893: p. 118).  See also Cortesão (1969: p.209&lt;/ref&gt;  The first clear appearance and explanation is the 1436 atlas of Venetian captain [[Andrea Bianco]].  Other early manuscripts have since been found relating the rule of marteloio, include:&lt;ref&gt;This list is based on Rossi (2009: p.11)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[image:Toleta de marteloio (Cornaro Atlas).jpg|thumb|150px|''Toleta de marteloio'' and an eight-wind ''tondo e quadro'', from p. 47 of the [[Cornaro Atlas]] (c. 1489)]]
* an anonymous 15th-century Venetian codex, post-1428, once part of the collection of Doge [[Marco Foscarini]], now lost.&lt;ref&gt;It is described by Abbot [[Giuseppe Toaldo]] (1782: [https://books.google.com/books?id=OWErAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.44]); the date is definitely after 1428, since it contains a tract by Venetian captain-general [[Andrea Mocenigo]] from that time. Toaldo (p.60) tentatively speculates it may have been introduced as late as 1463 by [[Regiomontanus]], but that is inconsistent with all other earlier manuscript dates.  However, Toaldo, writing in 1782, would not have been aware of them (although he does make a note that an "interesting" 1436 atlas (Andrea Bianco's) was just discovered that year by Formaleoni).&lt;/ref&gt;
* the ''Liber'' of Venetian mariner [[Michael of Rhodes]] (c. 1434–36) (Ms. in private collection)&lt;ref&gt;The manuscript is reproduced in Long, P.I., D. McGee and A.M. Stahl (2009).  It can also be found online at the [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/index.html Michael of Rhodes website] hosted by the Museo Galileo.  Rossi (2009: p.xxxii–iii) suggests 1434–6 as the dating of the writing of the mathematical section, which includes the marteloio, although the rest of the book would continue to be written through the 1440s.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Russian Geographical Society''' (Russian: Ру́сское географи́ческое о́бщество «РГО») (RGO) is a [[learned society]] based in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. It promotes exploration and geography with research programs in fields including [[oceanography]] and [[ethnography]].

==History==

===Imperial Geographical Society===

The society was founded on 6 (18) August 1845 in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. Prior to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], it was known as the '''Imperial Russian Geographical Society'''.

===Founding members===
The founding members of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society included:&lt;ref&gt;Pyotr Semyonov-Tyan-Shansky, vol. 1, p. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society's official presidents were [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia]] in 1845-92 and [[Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich of Russia]] in 1892-1917, but actually it was run by the Vice-Presidents: Fyodor Litke (1845–50, 1855–57), [[Count]] [[Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov-Vilensky|Mikhail Muravyov]] (1850–57), [[Pyotr Semyonov-Tyan-Shansky]] (1873–1914), and [[Yuly Shokalsky]] (1914–31).

The filial societies were established at the Caucasus (1850), Irkutsk (1851), Vilnius (1867), Orenburg (1868), Kiev (1873), Omsk (1877), and other cities.

The Society organized and funded the expeditions of [[Richard Maack]], [[Pyotr Kropotkin]], Semyonov-Tyan-Shansky, [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]], [[Nikolai Miklukho-Maklai]], [[Pyotr Kozlov]], [[Vladimir Obruchev]], and [[Lev Berg]]. It helped set up the first [[polar station]]s in [[Russia]] and was one of the first to publish detailed studies of the [[Russian folklore]] and Ukrainian fairs. 

The Society pioneered the systematic exploration of the Northern [[Urals]] in 1847-50, of the farthest reaches of the [[Amur River]] in 1854-63, of the vast areas of [[Kashgaria]], [[Dzungaria]], and [[Mongolia]] from the 1870s onward.

By 1917 the RGO was composed of eleven subdivisions and 1,000 members.

===Constantine Medal===
The Constantine Medal was a gold medal worth 200 silver roubles and was the highest award of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society. It was established and named after the Society’s first chairman, Great Duke Constantine and was awarded from 1849 to 1929 to explorers who had made a significant geographical discovery or to authors of outstanding publications in geography, ethnography or Russian statistics. From 1924 to 1929 the Medal was referred to as “The highest award of the Russian Geographical Society”. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url= http://www.rgo.ru/en/society/awards/constantine-medal-irgs|title= Constantine Medal of the IRGS|publisher= Russian Geographical Society|accessdate = 25 August 2015}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Recipients of the medal included:
*1849  [[Ernst Reinhold Hofmann]], for his excellent work during the first expedition of the Russian Geographical Society to the Northern Urals (first award)
*1858  [[Ivan Aksakov]], for his research into trade fairs in Ukraine
*1859  [[Peter Carl Ludwig Schwarz|Ludwig Schwarz]]
*1863  [[Vladimir Dahl]], for the Explanatory Dictionary of the Russian Language

*1907  [[Fridtjof Nansen]], for his remarkable feats, which constitute a whole era in the Arctic Ocean exploration
*1914  [[Boris Vilkitsky]], for hydrographic expeditions in the Arctic Sea.

===All-Union Geographical Society===
[[Image:Rgolibrary.jpg|thumb|Library of the Russian Geographical Society in 1916.]]
The Society changed its name to the State Geographical Society in 1926 and to the Geographical Society of the USSR in 1938. After Shokalsky its presidents were [[geneticist]] [[Nikolai Vavilov]] (1931–40), [[zoologist]] [[Lev Berg]] (1940–1950), [[parasitology|parasitologist]] [[Evgeny Pavlovsky]] (1952–64), [[glaciologist]] [[Stanislav Kalesnik]] (1964–77), [[polar explorer]] [[Aleksei Treshnikov]] (1977–91). The Society has convened numerous congresses and has awarded four types of medals, Big Gold Medal (tri-annual) and three, named after Litke, Semyonov, Przhevalsky (bi-annual),&lt;ref&gt;http://pegion.ru/58df61cf841a.htm "Earth and people" magazine about RGO medals&lt;/ref&gt; and also [[Semen Dezhnev]] prize (bi-annual). By 1970, it had published more than 2,000 volumes of geographical literature, including the annual ''Zapiski'' (since 1846) and ''Izvestiya'' (since 1865).

===Post-Soviet era===
The society reverted to its original name upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The main offices of the Society are in St. Petersburg.

In September 2010, [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]] was made an honorary member of the Society.

Since 2002 the society has sponsored an annual seasonal ice base in the Arctic, [[Barneo|Camp Barneo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barneo.ru/ Ice camp Барнео]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==
The Imperial Society comprised four departments:

===Department of Physical Geography===

Nikolai Nadezhdin was involved in the foundation of this department, when the RGO was originally set up. During the 1850s and 1860s the  [[ethnography|ethnographic]] division gathered and published material such as works of folklore and the ''byt'' or "way of life" which they regarded as reflecting the "essence" of the indigenous people of the Russian Empire.
In 1909 [[Dmitry Nikolayevich Anuchin]], [[Vladimir Bogdanov]] and [[Vsevolod Miller]] convened the ethnographic sub-section of the [[Twelfth Congress of Russian Natural Scientists and Physicians]] held in Moscow. Here they pushed for more professionalism to distinguish ethnographers from missionaries and amateurs.

In 1917 [[David Zolotarev]] and [[Nikolai Mogilyansky]] of the RGO participated in the [[Commission for the Study of the Tribal Composition of the Population of the Borderlands of Russia]].

A '''Saxon milepost''' ({{lang-de|kursächsische Postmeilensäule}}, colloquially ''sächsische Postmeilensäule'' or ''Postsäule'') was a [[milepost]] in the former [[Electorate of Saxony]] that gave distances expressed as journey times to the nearest eighth of an hour. With one hour being the equivalent of one [[League (unit)#Comparison table|league]], this corresponds to a distance of about 566&amp;nbsp;m. The design of the mileposts varied according to the distance at which they were placed. They were hewn from natural stone into the shape of an [[obelisk]], an ancient [[herma]] or a [[stele]]. Their prototype was the [[Miliarium|Roman milepost]]. From its German name ''römische Meilensäule'' the rather inaccurate German description of ''Säule'' (lit.: "column") was derived. The Saxon head postal director (''Oberpostdirektor''), Paul Vermehren, brought about their inception based on official distance surveys, whose results were given in [[league (unit)|league]]s on the post mileposts. A league in Saxony at that time (1722 to 1840) was meant to be an hour's journey, equivalent to half a mile or 4.531 kilometres.

Saxon postal mileposts were set up during the reign of [[Augustus II of Poland|August the Strong]] and his successor along all important postal and trading routes and in almost all towns in the [[Electorate of Saxony]] to indicate the official distances. This was intended to be the basis for the creation of a unified calculation of postal charges. Because the territory of the Electorate of Saxony was larger than that of the present-day German state of [[Saxony]], these mileposts are nowadays also found in the states of [[Thuringia]], [[Brandenburg]] and [[Saxony-Anhalt]], as well as in [[Poland]].

The locations and images of surviving or replaced Saxon mileposts may be seen in the [[:de:Galerie der kursächsischen Postmeilensäulen|Gallery of Saxon postal mileposts]].

In 1695, the head of the Saxon post office, ''Oberpostmeister'' Ludwig Wilhelm, proposed a systematic survey of the road from [[Leipzig]] to [[Dresden]] with wooden, roadside posts at regular intervals. This prompted [[prince elector]] Augustus the Strong, on 18 June 1695, to order ''"that certain mileposts are to be erected"''. He charged the ''Kondukteur'' (building supervisor) Heinrich Niedhart with this task. The Electoral Saxon forestry superintendents were instructed to provide the wood, and the administrators of the electoral Saxon districts were to ensure that the posts were erected.

Furthermore, before 1700 wooden [[fingerpost]]s withs distance markings (so-called ''Arm(en)säulen'' or "arm columns") were commonplace on the roads of Saxony. These consisted of a wooden post, at the upper end of which were direction indicators in the shape of human arms and hands. Because the wood rotted rapidly as a result of its constant exposure to moisture, many of these fingerposts collapsed a few years after they had been erected and became unusable.

The establishment of postal mileposts in electoral Saxony was not an isolated phenomenon. Similar posts or stones with distances marked on them were erected along the roads in a number of countries.

== State survey by Zürner ==
[[File:Lauenstein Museum Schloss (2) 2005.jpg|thumb|left|Working replica of a surveying cart (''Messkarre'') for road surveying in the Eastern Ore Mountain Museum at [[Lauenstein (Altenberg)|Lauenstein Castle]]]]
The basis for the introduction of Saxon mileposts was the [[cartographic]] work of the pastor, [[Adam Friedrich Zürner]], from [[Großenhain|Skassa]]. Zürner had prepared a map of [[Großenhain]], which attracted the attention of Augustus the Strong. After further cartographic work, the prince elector gave him the task on 12&amp;nbsp;April 1713 of: "''recording districts, including the lordships, manor estates, towns, villages and the like, on geographic maps''" (original: "''Aemter samt denen darinnen befindlichen Herrschaften, Rittergütern, Städten, Dörfern und dergleichen mehr in mappas geographicas bringen''"). This entailed the [[topographic]] survey of Electoral Saxony. In addition to the heartland, it covered the electoral Saxon parts of the counties of [[County of Henneberg|Henneberg]] and [[Mansfelder Land (district)|Mansfeld]], the [[House of Schönburg|Schönburg]] estates, the estates of the [[Ernestine and Albertine Wettins|Albertine]] branches of [[Saxe-Merseburg]], [[Saxe-Weissenfels]] and [[Saxe-Zeitz]] as well as the two [[Lusatia]]s.

The resulting cartographic material remained largely secret for several decades for [[military]] reasons. The prince elector only had an improved [[Mail|post]]al map published which was the result of an extension to the contract that followed a few weeks later. This "''Chur-Sächsische Post-Charte''", first published in 1718, and its subsequent editions, remained in use until the 19th century.

Because the distances stated at that time were frequently based on imprecise estimates, Zürner had to survey the distances afresh or verify existing data. To achieve that he designed a survey vehicle in the shape of an electoral Saxon baggage coach. Each revolution of the rear wheel of the coach with a circumference of one Dresden [[rod (unit)|rod]] (''Dresdner Rute''), i.e. 4.531&amp;nbsp;metres, was transmitted to a mechanical [[Counter (digital)|counter]] in the coach by means of a chain. Zürner's assistants used a measuring cart in the shape of a wheelbarrow for those tracks unsuitable for a coach, which likewise measured the distances by the turning of a wheel and which was carried as the so-called "fifth wheel on the wagon" (''fünftes Rad am Wagen'') in a case on the surveying coach. Both methods enabled a very accurate survey of roads.

[[File:Uebersicht Postmeilensaeulen.svg|thumb|Known locations of postal mileposts on a map of the Kingdom of Saxony before the [[Vienna Congress]], whose area of interest coincided largely with that of Electoral Saxony in 1814/15]]
Another problem was the lack of standard units of measurement. At that time there were [[mile]]s (''Meilen'') of various length even within the Electorate. To achieve standardization, the Electoral [[Saxon post mile]] was therefore introduced  on 17&amp;nbsp;March 1722, whereby 1&amp;nbsp;mile = 2&amp;nbsp;leagues = 2,000&amp;nbsp;Dresden&amp;nbsp;rods = 9.062&amp;nbsp;kilometres. To indicate distances on the mileposts, Zürner used the league (''Wegstunde''), which equalled a half mile.&lt;ref name = "Postmeilensaeulen"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.poststrassen-erleben.de/geschichten/historie-der-postsaeulen.html | title = Historie der Postsäulen | publisher = Forschungsgruppe Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen e.V. und 1. Sächsischer Postkutschenverein e.V. | language = de | accessdate = 5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey journeys usually began in [[Leipzig]] or [[Dresden]], the counter being set to zero at the [[Post house (historical building)|posthouse]] in each city. As a result, a Leipzig or a Dresden distance is quoted. During such a journey, the assistant to the surveyor had to drive a numbered wooden stake into the ground every quarter of a mile and dig a hole next to it. The excavated material was then used to help fix the wooden post securely. The landowner was responsibility for looking after the survey stake.

In several cases the surveys were also conducted outside the territory of the electorate. Everywhere where Saxon land was interrupted by other territories, roads that were used by the Saxon post office were surveyed, with the permission of the territorial owner.

Surveying was especially difficult in [[Upper Lusatia]] because there the landowners of the [[estates of the realm]] tried to impede Zürner's activity. Zürner was able to begin surveying Upper and [[Lower Lusatia]] only on 29 June 1723. The survey work on the most important roads in the state was completed by 1733.

== Erection of the columns ==
[[File:Canaletto (I) 010.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bernardo Bellotto]]: view of Dresden (detail); the moats and bridge between the Wilschem Gate and the template post milepost (without coat of arms) by [[Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann]], ca. 1750]]
On 19&amp;nbsp;September 1721, an Electoral order was issued to the districts (''[[Ämter]]'') of Dresden, [[Meißen]] and [[Amt Hayn (Großenhain)|Großenhain]], to erect stone columns as mileposts. On 1&amp;nbsp;November 1721, this order was extended to the entire state. On the same day the state authorities in charge issued the general ordinance for the "Establishment of Stone Postal Columns" (''Setzung der steinernen Post-Säulen'') and the instruction that the costs of erecting them were to be borne by the landowner of the locations affected. For Upper Lusatia, a separate instruction followed on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1721.

Zürner, who had been tasked by Augustus the Strong on 14 December 1721, worked out himself the details of which mileposts were to be erected. Zürner set forth that a large distance column (''Distanzsäule'') was to be erected immediately in front of the gates of a town. Similarly there were to be quarter-mile, half-mile and whole-mile stones at the corresponding intervals. In the Saxon part of the [[County of Henneberg]] cast iron posts were erected instead of the usual stone columns, and in the [[County of Mansfeld]] there were no mileposts at all.

Originally about 300 distance mileposts and around 1,200 other roadside mileposts were erected. About 200 of them have at least partly survived or have been faithfully reconstructed. Replicas were increasingly made after 1990.

Today the Saxon section of the [[Old Dresden to Teplitz Post Road]] is considered the historic transport link with the most surviving postal mileposts.

The material used for the mileposts in Saxony varies widely. They were usually made from the prevailing building stone of the local area, which is also reflected in the building materials used in Saxony's architecture in general. [[Elbe sandstone]] from several quarries in [[Saxon Switzerland]] and the area of the [[Tharandt Forest]] was used for most of the stones. Other frequently used materials were [[Rhyolite tuff|Rochlitz porphyry]] in Central Saxony and [[Lusatian granite]] in eastern Saxony. In the Chemnitz area, Hilbersdorf [[Tuff|porphyritic tuff]] quarried at [[Chemnitz-Hilbersdorf|Hilbersdorf]] and [[Flöha]] was used as a milepost material In the upper [[Ore Mountains]] and the [[Vogtland]] mileposts were made of local [[granite]], for example, [[Thermalbad Wiesenbad|Wiesenbad]] Granite, granite of the [[Greifensteine]] area, [[Rockelmann|Schwarzenberg]] Granite, [[Kirchberg (Saxony)#Geology|Kirchberg]] Granite or [[Kapellenberg (Vogtland)|Bad Brambach]] Granite of the "[[Fichtelgebirge]] type". The different weathering properties of these diverse types of stone proves to be a challenge for the conservation of these monuments in many cases. This is also the reason why numerous mileposts no longer exist.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, pp. 115–117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Herrmann: ''Steinbruchindustrie und Steinbruchgeologie''. 1st ed., Berlin, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition ==
[[File:BGH PM-Säule (7) 2006-07-24.jpg|thumb|upright|Coat of arms and inscription block of the distance milespost in [[Berggießhübel]]]]
Both the costs and the responsibility for erecting the mileposts had to be borne by the authorities of the respective towns and villages. As a result, the measures did not gain universal approval throughout the land. Because the means of the towns varied considerably depending on their size and industrial structure, the financial impact on them was very variable. Regardless of their size, they often had a similar number of town gates and therefore a comparable number of milestone columns to put up. Frequently there were three to five gates. In 1722, the [[Landtag of Saxony|Saxon ''Landtag'']] asked the prince elector to cancel the expensive project that had invoked the opposition of many town councils and landowners. Many towns tried to ignore the edict or delay its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, pp. 99, 100, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to enforce the implementation of his instructions, the elector had resort to harsh measures and threatened negligence, tardiness or damage to the mileposts with disciplinary action in an order of 24 July 1722; and in another edict of 7 September 1724, fines of 20 talers were imposed against every official guilty of missing deadlines and in each individual case of neglect. Especially on the roads of Central Saxony, in the towns of  [[Colditz]], [[Grimma]], [[Oschatz]], [[Rochlitz]] and [[Waldheim, Saxony|Waldheim]], as well as the routes from these towns to Leipzig and thence [[Zeitz]] the gaps were particularly noticeable and were, in a decree of 7 September, subject to public reprimand by the prince elector.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of this dispute, many places strove to erect one milepost column only. Zürner knew the location of many small towns and villages very precisely. During the course of his project, he proceeded to support the towns in their requests and advocated the elector's consent. In many cases their requests were granted. On the national roads, therefore, only wooden mileposts were erected or existing ones repaired.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1727 the practice of erecting one column per town was carried out in many cases.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the order dated 19 September 1721 incorporated a comprehensive memorandum of 24 items and was accompanied by a list of the benefits of the regulation, it appears that problems had been anticipated from the outset. For example, as advantages of the national survey, the memorandum called pointed out that the payment of ''"delivery men, relay services, postal items and other goods"'' would be verifiable and the prices could no longer be fixed arbitrarily, that there would be fewer complaints from travellers about high fees that had hitherto taken up the time of courts and higher authorities, and that journey times and delivery times would be precisely defined by the survey. Another argument was that the roads would be more easily recognisable in the winter and at night.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the postal mileposts was especially strong in [[Upper Lusatia]]. In 1723, the [[town council]]s of [[Bautzen]] and [[Görlitz]] refused to entertain Zürner in this matter. Not until 31&amp;nbsp;March 1724 did the estates of Upper Lusatia declare themselves ready to carry out the instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because mileposts were occasionally damaged or even knocked down, an order was issued in 1724 that such crimes would be punished by imprisonment and other "hard and exemplary punishments".&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to persistent opposition the Saxon Landtage was finally able to issue a decree on 12&amp;nbsp;April 1728 that - contrary to the Elector's wishes - the mileposts need only be erected on main and postal roads.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[File:PMS-Arten.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the types of milepost, 1747]]
To what extent Augustus the Strong was personally involved in the development of the designs for the mileposts is not clear. Their final appearance, which was based on [[baroque (architecture)|baroque]] and [[classical antiquity|classical]] prototypes, was linked to the senior state architect (''Oberlandesbaumeister''), [[Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kursaechsische-postmeilensaeulen.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=68 vgl. Forschungsgruppe Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen e.&amp;nbsp;V.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107095553/http://www.kursaechsische-postmeilensaeulen.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=68 |date=2016-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distance mileposts ===
The large distance mileposts (''Distanzsäule'') comprised seven elements.  The [[pedestal]] was formed by the [[plinth]], [[dado (architecture)|dado]] and [[cornice]] (or cap). The column consists of the base (''Zwischenplatte'' or ''Schaftfuß''), the shaft, a block sowing the coat of arms (''Wappenstück''), and the finial (''Aufsatz'' or ''Spitze''). The columns have an average height of 8&amp;nbsp;ells (4.53&amp;nbsp;metres) and rest on a pedestal half an ell high. The individual elements were held together by means of iron pegs cast in lead. On the shaft of the column the names of the destinations were inscribed at Zürner's direction in a [[Fraktur]] font and based on the distance tables that had been worked out for each town. Several routes crossed state borders, and this was indicated by the letters ''gr'' (for ''Grenze'' or "border") or a horizontal line. Part of the inscription on all columns was a [[post horn]] on all four sides, which was the emblem of the state's postal sovereignty. The arms of the Electorate of Saxony with a gilded crown and the Polish royal crown with the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|royal Polish-Lithuanian]] coat of arms were shown on the superstructure.

The mileposts originally erected in front of the town gates usually had the distances marked on two sides and the names of the destination towns on the other two sides. Later columns, erected in the market squares, had the distances marked on all four sides.

=== Full mile stone ===
The full mile stone (''Ganzmeilensäule'') was to mark every full mile along the post road. It is about 3.75 metres high and resembles the large distance milepost in shape. They are however more slender and have no section showing the coat of arms. The information was inscribed on two sides so that travellers in both directions could read them. On the road side was the so-called serial number (''Reihennummer'') with which all roadside columns and mileposts were numbered in sequence. Because a number was assigned every quarter of a mile, each full-milepost had a serial number divisible by four.

=== Half mile stone ===
The half mile stone (''Halbmeilensäule''), also called the league post (''Stundensäule'') because the league corresponded to half a mile, had a lower pedestal surmounted by a shaft that tapered from top to bottom. A roof-shaped, chamfered finial formed the uppermost element. Its total height is about 3 metres. It bore the same inscriptions as the full mile stone. The [[herm]]-like design of this column is a reason why only a few stones of this type have survived until today.&lt;!-- need to find out why --&gt; The serial number is even, but not divisible by four.

=== Quarter mile stone ===
The quarter mile stone (''Viertelmeilenstein'') rests on a low pedestal and consists of a rectangular column or stele. Its total height is about 1.7 metres. There are no inscriptions on these mileposts other than the monogram "AR", a [[post horn]] symbol, the year of manufacture and, on the narrow side facing the road, the serial number which was an odd number.

[[Old weights and measures (Saxony)|Preparations]] for the introduction of the [[metric system]] in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] were made as part of the work of the Standardization Commission (''Normalaichungscommission''), led by Albert Christian Weinlig and Julius Ambrosius Hülße. These two men envisaged a transition phase from the old units. Almost simultaneously, similar efforts were being made at the level of the [[German Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Domsch: ''Albert Christian Weinlig. Ein Lebensbild nach Familienpapieren und Akten.'' Chemnitz 1912 (Abhandlungen und Berichte der Technischen Staatslehranstalten in Chemnitz, Heft 2), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gesetz- und Verordnungsblatt für das Königreich Saxony, 1858, 12 March 1858 ''No. 18, Gesetz, die Einführung eines allgemeinen Landesgewichts und einige Bestimmungen über das Maaß- und Gewichtswesen im Allgemeinen betreffend''.&lt;/ref&gt; A new survey was carried out in 1858, and between 1859 and 1865 a new system of milestones – the [[:de:Galerie der königlich-sächsischen Meilensteine|Royal Saxon milestones]] were made in the shape of station milestones (''Stationssteine''), full mile, half mile, junction (''Abzweig-'') and border crossing stones (''Grenzübergangssteine''), noting that, from 1840, 1 mile = 7.5&amp;nbsp;km. Upon the full introduction of the metric system around 1900, some of these were converted to kilometer, [[chaussee]], boundary (''Flurgrenz'') and roadkeeper stones (''Straßenwärtersteine'').

{{More citations needed|date=June 2018}} 

The term “'''set and drift'''” is used to describe external forces that affect a boat and keep it from following an intended course. To understand and calculate set and drift, one needs to first understand currents. [[Ocean current|Ocean currents]] are the horizontal movements of water from one location to another. The movement of water is impacted by: meteorological effects, wind, temperature differences and gravity and on occasion [[Earthquake|earthquakes]]. Set is referred to as the current’s direction, expressed in true degrees, and the drift is referred to as the current’s speed, which is usually measured in [[Knot (unit)|knots]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Practical Navigator|last=Bowditch|first=Nathaniel|publisher=Bethesda, Maryland: NATIONAL IMAGERY AND MAPPING AGENCY|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ignoring set and drift can cause a mariner to get off their desired course, sometimes by hundreds of miles. A mariner needs to be able to steer the ship and compensate for the effects of set and drift upon their vessel while underway. A vessel’s actual course that is travels is referred to as the course over the ground and the current of the ocean alters this course whether pushing it away from its desired course of in the same direction. The vessel’s speed through the water is also referred to as the speed over the ground and the current can affect how fast or slow the vessel moves through the water.

== How to Calculate ==
In order to utilize set and drift in [[navigation]], navigators much first set the course using Dead Reckoning.

A [[Dead reckoning|Dead Reckoning]], DR, is calculated by using a previously determined position on a chart, and advancing that position based on known or estimated speed over a set amount of time. This can be calculated by using the formula Speed = Distance / Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.decklicenseprep.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/NS-140-Chapter-10-Set-Drift-and-Leeway.pdf|title=Set &amp; Drift and Leeway|last=Deck License Prep|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=8 February 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an advance position has been plotted, then set and drift can be factored in. If there is a known set and drift, then the corrections can be applied to the Dead Reckoning position to then get an Estimated Position on a chart.

The Course Made Good is the direction in which a ship or vessel has traveled with the effects of current, wind, and helmsman ship. If a current is flowing in the same direction as the ships heading, then the Course Made Good remains the same, but the current speed and ship speed are added together. If the speeds are in opposite directions, then the smaller speed is subtracted from the larger speed. If a vessel runs directly against a current or directly with a current, the speed of the vessel and speed of the current can be added or subtracted from each other. Such as, a vessel has a speed of 8 knots through the water and the vessel is traveling with the current, which is at 2 knots, then the speed over ground is 8+2 and the vessel’s true speed is 10 knots. 

Set and Drift can be calculated by using a vector diagram and can be drawn and measured on a chart, [[maneuvering board]] or even a plain piece of paper.

== Example Calculation ==
[[File:Set-Drift Problems.jpg|thumb|Set and Drift Example]]
You are underway on course 150 degrees true at 8 knots. Your vessel is making good a course of 166 degrees true and a speed made good of 8.8 knots. What is your set and drift? 

Step 1. Plot out course of 150 degrees true on Radar Plotting Sheet

Step 2. Measure length of course by using speed of 8 knots and converting into nautical miles via the time, speed, and distance scale

Step 3. Plot the length of speed on Radar Plotting sheet

Step 4. Plot out desired course of 166 degrees true on Radar Plotting Sheet

Step 5. Measure length of course by using speed of 8.8 knots and converting into nautical miles via the time, speed, and distance scale

Step 6. Connect the two ends of the vectors from the current course to the course made good. Thus creating your set and drift vector

Step 7. Using the navigational triangle, place on set and drift vector. Then drag to center crosshairs keeping the same angle and find the degrees on the outer circle

Step 8. Measure the length of the set and drift vector with the compass.  Convert from nautical miles into knots using the time, speed, and distance scale.

Step 9. Your set is 230 degrees true at a drift of 2.5 knots

== Tools used to calculate ==
To use Navigation Triangles, a navigator need two of them to be able to navigate correctly. Navigation Triangles can be used to find [[Position line|Lines of Positions]], Dead Reckoning, [[Ranges-Navigation Aids|ranges]], Estimated Positions, Running Fixes and so on. They are also used to connect all the types of fixes to be able to determine a [[course (navigation)|course]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sydneem/sandbox#cite_note-2|title=A Short Course on Nautical Charts and Basic Plotting For the Recreational Boater|last=Kessler|first=Gary|date=4 March 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}}

Dividers can be used for the measurement of lengths of lines on a chart and approximating the lengths of non-linear lines on a chart. Dividers can also be turned into a [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|compass]] by replacing the metal leg of the divider with a piece of lead. A compass can measure and draw arc and circles on charts and maneuvering boards.

A '''social space''' is physical or virtual space such as a [[social center]], [[social media|online social media]], or other [[gathering place]] where people gather and interact. Some social spaces such as [[town square]]s or [[park]]s are [[public places]]; others such as [[pub]]s, [[website]]s. or [[shopping mall]]s are privately owned and regulated.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 12, 23, 24, 34, and 78 in ''Watch this Space: Designing, Defending, and Sharing Public Space'', by Hadley Dyer and Marc Ngui, Kids Can Press (2010), hardcover, 80 pages, {{ISBN|978-1-55453-293-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henri Lefebvre]] emphasised that in human society all 'space is social: it involves assigning more or less appropriated places to social relations....social space has thus always been a social product'.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Lefebvre, ''State, Space, World'' (London 2009) p. 186-7&lt;/ref&gt; 
Social space becomes thereby a metaphor for the very experience of social life - 'society experienced alternatively as a deterministic environment or force (''milieu'') and as our very element or beneficent shell (''ambience'')'.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense 'social space spans the dichotomy between "public" and "private" space...is also linked to subjective and [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] space'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Smethurst, ''The Postmodern Chronotype'' (2000) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==As metaphor==

As metaphor, 'social space contributes a relational rather than an abstract dimension...has received a large variety of attributes, interpretations, and metaphors'.&lt;ref&gt;Aharon Kellerman, ''The Internet on Earth'' (2002) p. 31-2&lt;/ref&gt; Such 'social space...i[s] an intricate space of obligations, duties, entitlements, prohibitions, debts, affections, insults, allies, contracts, enemies, infatuations, compromises, mutual love, legitimate expectations, and collective ideals'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. Churchland, ''The Engine of Reason, the Seat of the Soul'' (2007) p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

For Lefebvre, 'the family, the school, the workplace, the church, and so on - each possesses an "appropriate" space...for a use specified within the social division of labor'.&lt;ref name="Lefebvre225"&gt;Lefebvre, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Within such social spaces 'a system of "adapted" expectations and responses - rarely articulated as such because they seem obvious - acquire a quasi-natural self-evidence in everyday life and common sense': thus everybody [[Consensus|consensually]] 'knows what he is talking about when he refers to the town hall, the post office, the police station, the grocery store, the bus and the train, train stations, and bistros' - all underlying aspects of 'a ''social space'' as such. an (artificial) edifice of hierarchically ordered institutions, of laws and conventions'.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, p. 224-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==

Defining a stratified morphology as a series of 'discrete units embedded within one another in a definite order', one can see that a distinct 'morphology exists in social space - from the "room" or hut to the house and the building; from the building to the group of houses, to the village and the neighbourhood; from the neighbourhood to the city, the region, the nation, and the State...continent [&amp;] planet'.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, p. 235-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The interaction of different levels may be symbiotic or it may be conflictual: as a Michigan cabinet member put it to two Southern colleagues shortly before the [[American Civil War]], '"I see how it is; you are a Virginian and you are a South Carolinian; I am not a Michigander, I am an American"'.&lt;ref&gt;H. G. Nicholas, ''The American Union'' (1950) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

For the individual, as well as the social institution, different levels of social space come to the fore at different times. To a Britisher, for example, '"we" sometimes narrows to southern England, sometimes broadens to refer to "Britain and America" or "Europe" or "the west"'.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Fowler, ''Language in the News'' (London 1994) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; In precisely the same way, 'a resident of Rome may define himself with varying degrees of intensity as a Roman, an Italian, a Catholic, a Christian, a European, a Westerner'&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Huntington, ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'' (1996) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; - a sequence of stratified social spaces.

==Pre/postmodern space==

'In premodern societies, space and place largely coincided....[[Modernity]] increasingly tears space away from place'.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Giddens, quoted in Kellerman, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in the premodern 'every thing has its assigned place in social space',&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (London 1971) p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; [[postmodernists]] would proudly proclaim that 'we need to substitute for the magisterial space of the past...a less upright, less Euclidean space where no one would ever be ''in his final place'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Barthes, in E. D. Ermath, ''Sequel to History'' (Oxford 1992) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The way 'migration, seen as a metaphor, is everywhere' in postmodernity - 'we are migrants and perhaps hybrids, in but not of any situation in which we find ourselves'&lt;ref&gt;Edward Said, ''After the Last Sky Palestinian Lives'' New York: Pantheon, 1986. p. 164. Later quoted by Salman Rushdie, ''Imaginary Homelands'' (London 1991) p. 278 and p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; - is rooted in the postmodern forms of production of social space.

Lefebvre considered [[globalization]] as the creation, and superimposition on nature, of 'worldwide-social space...with strong points (the centers) and weaker and dominated bases (the [[Periphery countries|peripheries]])'.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, p. 199 and p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

==The insanity of place==

Education, formal and informal, might be described as in large part a process whereby the new recruit to the human race 'must learn to represent the many dimensions of the local social space...through the veil of degraded inputs, chronic ambiguity, and the occasional deliberate deception'.&lt;ref&gt;Churchland, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with such intricacies, [[R. D. Laing]] concluded that 'it is just as well that man is a social animal, since the sheer complexity and contradiction of the social field in which he has to live is so formidable'.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''The Politics of Experience'' (Penguin 1984) p. 81-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The madman, by contrast, is not 'someone to be counted on to know his place': in many ways, 'mental symptoms are wilful situational improprieties'.&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p. 407 and p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in 'public and semi-public places - streets, shops, neighbourhoods, public transportation, and the like -...a fine mesh of obligations obtains which ensures the orderly traffic and co-mingling of participants...many classic symptoms of [[psychosis]] are precise and pointed violations of these territorial arrangements'.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] considered that 'it would be worthwhile mapping the places in social space that our culture has assigned to these [psychotic] subjects', and saw their difficulties as in part 'the effects of the breakdown produced by the symbolic discordances that characterize the complex structures of civilization':&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; what [[Goffman]] termed '"The Insanity of Place"'.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==

* In ''Pride and Prejudice'', Darcy is initially riven with 'uncertainty as to whether he can bring himself to cross the great social space which, as he sees it (he is still proud), separates Elizabeth from himself'.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Tanner, "Introduction", ''Jane Austen: Pride and Prejudice'' (Penguin 1972) p. 33-4&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 'postmodern art...a [[cubist]] painting presents multiple perspectives simultaneously,fracturing "space" and literally requiring any single spectator to be in several different places at once...this postmodern crisis of subjectivity'.&lt;ref&gt;Ermath p. 107-8&lt;/ref&gt;
* 'Lefebvre suggests that art may come to be defined "less as a code of space than as a code of representational spaces"'&lt;ref&gt;Smethurst, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; - 'the space of representations and the representation of space...a ''mental space'' '&lt;ref name="Lefebvre225"/&gt; which both reflects and interacts with social space.

Subsea markers are passive identification markers used under water to identify equipment. As sub sea equipment may be covered in underwater growth like seaweed, kelp and algae, special non-fouling materials are necessary for equipment marking to ensure these are readable even after prolonged periods of submergence.

== How it works ==

Subsea markers are made from a durable rubber which has been manufactured to include synthetic oils. The oil is evenly distributed through the material and gives the material excellent [[hydrophobic]] properties. The [[hydrophobic]] properties of the material prevent marine growth from attaching to the surface of the marker making it readable even after several years of submersion under water.

== Applications ==

Subsea markers are typically used to identify the following equipment and
the equipment placed on them:
* valves
* [[Christmas tree (oil well)|Christmas trees]]
* manifolds
* pipelines
* caps and connectors
* chemical injection/distribution units
* pressure caps and connectors

Alternative uses are for marking fish like sharks and whales. Subsea markers could also be used in sewage systems or to mark shipwrecks for divers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">Temporary adjustments are set of operations which are performed on a [[theodolite]] to make it ready for taking observations. These include its initial setting up on a tripod or other stand, centering, levelling up and focusing of eyepiece.

==Initial setting==
[[File:theodolite vermeer.svg|thumb|The measurement axes and scales of a theodolite]]
&lt;div&gt;The initial setting operation includes fixing the theodolite on a [[tripod]], along with approximate levelling and centering over the station mark. For setting up the instrument, the tripod is placed over the station with its legs widely spread so that the centre of the tripod head lies above the station point and its head approximately level (by eye estimation). The instrument is then fixed with the tripod by screwing through the trivet.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The height of the instrument should be such that observer can see through [[telescope]] conveniently. After this, a [[plumb bob]] is suspended from the bottom of the instrument and it should approximately align with the station mark.&lt;/div&gt;

==Centering==
[[image:Tribrach for surveying instruments.JPG|right|thumb|A tribrach with an optical plummet (the black cylinder pointing to the left lower corner of the image).]]
&lt;div&gt;Centering means bringing the [[vertical axis]] of the theodolite exactly over the station mark.&lt;ref&gt;Text book on surveying by prof. C.L Kochher, page no. 341. Retrieved on 16 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; Exact centering is done by using the shifting head of the instrument. During this, first the screw-clamping ring of the sliding head is loosened and the upper plate of the shifting head is slid over the lower one until the plumb bob is exactly over the station mark. After the exact centering, the screw clamping ring is tightened. This can be done by means of a forced centering plate or [[tribrach (instrument)|tribrach]]. An optical or laser plummet is normally used for the most accurate setting. The centering and levelling of the instrument is interactive and iterative; a re-levelling may change the centering, so error each is eliminated in successively until negligible.

==Levelling==
[[File:Green bull's eye level (level).jpg|thumb|Bull's eye level with alignment rings]]
[[File:Theodolite in use.JPG|thumb|Theodolite in use with cones to protect tripod positioning]]
Leveling of an instrument is done to make it vertical axis with respect to the apparent force of gravity at the station.

For two spirit vials at right angles;

# Bring one of the level tubes parallel to any two of the foot screws, by rotating the upper part of the instrument.
# The bubble is brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating both the foot screws either inward or outward. The bubble moves in the same direction as the left thumb.
# The bubble of the other level tube is then brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating the third foot screw either inward or outward. [In step 1 itself, the other plate level will be parallel to the line joining the third foot screw and the centre of the line joining the previous two foot screws.]
# Repeat Step 2 and step 3 in the same quadrant till both the bubble remain central.
# By rotating the upper part of the instrument through 180°, the level tube is brought parallel to first two-foot screws in reverse order. The bubble will remain in the centre if the instrument is in permanent adjustment.
Otherwise, repeat the whole process starting from step 1 to step 5.

The same principle applies for a bulls-eye level:

# Bring the level parallel to any two of the foot screws, by rotating the upper part of the instrument.
# The bubble is brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating both the foot screws either inward or outward.
# Rotate the upper part of the instrument through 180°, so the level is over the remaining foot screw. The bubble will remain in the centre if the instrument is in permanent adjustment. If not adjust this screw to halve the error. Then rotate back through 180 degrees and check the error. Adjust those screws to halve the residual error.  Continue until the bubble is always central on the ring.

==Focusing==
To obtain an accurate clear sighting, the cross hairs should be in focus; adjust the eyepiece to do this.

* '''Focusing of eyepiece lens'''.
For focusing of the eye piece, point the telescope to the [[sky]] or hold a piece of white paper in front of telescope. Move the eye-piece in and out until a distinct sharp black image of the cross-hairs is seen. This confirms proper focusing.&lt;ref&gt;Text book on surveying by prof. C.L Kochher on Page no. 342. Retrieved on 16 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
To Clearly view the object being sighted Focus the objective lens.

* '''Focusing of objective lens'''.
It is done for each independent observation to bring the image of the object in the plane of cross hairs. It includes following steps of operation: First, direct the [[telescope]] towards the object for observation. Next, turn the focusing screw until the image of the object appears clear and sharp as the observer looks through properly focused eye-piece. If focusing has been done properly, there will be no parallax i.e., there will be no apparent movement of the image relative to the cross hairs if the observer moves his eye from one side to the other or from top to bottom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1556">'''Topocide''' is the deliberate culling of a [[Location (geography)|place]] through industrial expansion and change, so that its earlier [[landscape]] and character are destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swanson|first=Kelly|title=AP Human Geography 2009|year=2009|publisher=Kaplan|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An alternative term is [[domicide]], the destruction of home; the two may be viewed as synonyms or they may be opposed, with topocide referring to destruction from the point of view of the destroyers (generally outsiders) and domicide from the point of view of the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Porteous|first=Douglas|title=Domicide: The Global Destruction Of Home|year=2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOwb3IXYfoEC&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=topocide&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q=topocide&amp;f=false|author2=Sandra E. Smith }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Topocide can be the result of deliberate industrial expansion. When industries form, then the people's center of life revolve around that industry. New jobs are formed and the environmental and cultural landscape is forever changed.

Arguable examples include the destruction of [[Dresden]] at the end of World War II and the [[Khmer Rouge]]'s destruction in [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Andrew E|title=Disaster and Development|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|page=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BDfqfikFDmsC&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=topocide&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q=topocide&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Urban Geography''''' ({{ISSN|0272-3638}}) is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] that was first published in 1980. It appears semi-quarterly and covers topics concerning [[urban policy and planning]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[poverty]], [[ethnicity]] in [[urban areas]], [[House|housing]], and provision of [[Public services|services]] and urban [[economic activity]].

''Urban Geography'' was published by Bellwether Publishing Ltd. until 2013, when it was acquired by [[Taylor &amp; Francis|Taylor &amp; Francis Group]]. It is available online and in print.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2580">'''World Meteorological Organization squares''' or '''WMO squares''' is a system of [[geocode]]s that divides a chart of the world with latitude-longitude gridlines (e.g. [[plate carrée projection]], [[Mercator Projection|Mercator]] or other) into grid cells of 10° [[latitude]] by 10° [[longitude]], each with a unique, 4-digit numeric identifier (refer chart at NODC [http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOD05/data05geo.html World Ocean Database 2005] page). On the plate carrée projection the grid cells appear square, however if the Mercator projection is used, the grid cells appear 'stretched' vertically nearer the tops and bottoms of the map. On the actual surface of the [[Globe]], the cells are approximately "square" only adjacent to the equator, and become progressively narrower and tapered (also with curved northern and southern boundaries) as they approach the poles, and cells adjoining the poles are unique in possessing three faces rather than four.

Each 10°x10° square is allocated a number between 1000 and 7817. The numbering system is based first on "global quadrant" numbers where 1=NE, 3=SE, 5=SW, 7=NW which gives the initial digit of any square code (1xxx, 3xxx, 5xxx, 7xxx). The second digit (x0xx through x8xx) indicates the number of tens of degrees latitude (north in global quadrants 1 and 7, south in global quadrants 3 and 5) of the 'minimum' square boundary (nearest to the [[Equator]]), i.e. a cell extending between 10°N and 20°N (or 10°S and 20°S) has this digit = 1, a cell extending between 20°N and 30°N has this digit = 2, etc. The third and fourth digits (xx00 through xx17) similarly indicate the number of tens of degrees of longitude of the 'minimum' square boundary, nearest to the [[Prime Meridian]]. By way of illustration, the square 1000 thus extends from 0°N to 10°N, 0°E to 10°E, and the square 7817 from 80°N to 90°N, 170°W to 180°W, adjacent to the major portion of the [[International Date Line]]. In this manner, reverse-engineering (decoding) the relevant square boundaries from any particular WMO Square identifier is straightforward, in contrast to some other similar systems e.g. [[Marsden square]]s.

WMO squares are also used as the basis for the [[c-squares]] spatial indexing system, which further divides 10°x10° WMO squares into smaller units of 5°x5°, 1°x1°, 0.5°x0.5°, 0.1°x0.1°, and so on.
