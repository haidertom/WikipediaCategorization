      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1727">A '''56 kbit/s line''' is a digital connection capable of carrying 56 [[kilobit]]s per second ([[kbit/s]]), or 56,000 [[bit/s]], the [[data]] rate of a classical single channel [[digital telephone]] line in [[North America]]. In many urban areas, which have seen wide deployment of faster, cheaper technologies, 56 kbit/s lines are generally considered to be an [[obsolete]] technology.

==Speed derivation==
The figure of 56 kbit/s is derived from its implementation using the same digital infrastructure used since the 1960s for [[digital telephony]] in the [[public switched telephone network]], which uses a [[sampling rate]] of 8,000&amp;nbsp;Hz for [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] audio with 8-bit [[audio bit depth]] to encode [[analogue signal]]s into a digital stream of 64,000 bit/s. However, in the [[T-carrier]] systems used in the US and Canada, a technique called [[bit-robbing]] uses, in every sixth [[frame (telecommunications)|frame]], the [[least significant bit]] for [[Channel Associated Signaling]] (CAS). This effectively renders the lowest bit of the 8 speech bits unusable for data transmission, and so a 56 kbit/s line usees only 7 of the 8 data bits in each sample period to send data, thus giving a data rate of {{nowrap|8 kHz ×}} {{nowrap|7 bits {{=}}}} {{nowrap|56 kbit/s}}.

The '''Alvey''' Programme was a [[British government]] sponsored research program in [[information technology]] that ran from 1983 to 1987. The program was a reaction to the Japanese [[Fifth generation computer]] project.

The project was named after John Alvey, a technology director at BT who led the enquiry that proposed the creation of the program. John Alvey was not involved in the program itself &lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/yourbusiness/7258984/One-small-step-forward-is-one-giant-leap-backwards-for-government.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Focus areas for the Alvey Programme included:

* VLSI ([[Very-large-scale integration|very large scale integration]]) technology for microelectronics
* [[Knowledge-based systems|Intelligent Knowledge Based Systems]] (IKBS) or [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]] (AI)
* [[Software Engineering]]
* [[Man-Machine Interface]] (included [[Natural language processing|Natural Language Processing]])
* [[Systems architecture|Systems Architecture]] (for [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">The '''Barsanti-Matteucci engine''' was the first [[internal combustion engine]]. In late 1851 or early 1852 [[Eugenio Barsanti]], a professor of [[mathematics]], and [[Felice Matteucci]], an [[engineer]] and expert in [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], joined forces on a project to exploit the [[explosion]] and [[Thermal expansion|expansion]] of a gaseous mix of [[hydrogen]] and atmospheric air to transform part of the energy of such explosions into [[mechanical energy]].

==Origin==
The idea originated almost ten years earlier with Barsanti when, as a young man, he was teaching at St. Michael's College in [[Volterra]], Italy. An engineer from [[Milan]] Italy, Luigi de Cristoforis, described in a paper published in the acts of the Lombard Royal Institute of Science, Literature and Art, a pneumatic machine (later built and shown to work) that ran on [[naphtha]] and an air mixture, and which constituted the first liquid fuel engine.

==Prototypes==
During the twelve years of collaboration between Barsanti and Matteucci several prototypes of [[internal combustion engine]]s were realized. It was the first real internal combustion engine,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.barsantiematteucci.it/inglese/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt; constituted in its simplest realization by a vertical cylinder in which an explosion of a mixture of [[air]] and [[hydrogen]] or an [[illuminating gas]] shot a [[piston]] upwards thereby creating a [[vacuum]] in the space underneath. When the piston returned to its original position, due to the action of the [[atmospheric pressure]], it turned a toothed rod connected to a [[sprocket]] wheel and transmitted movement to the driving shaft.
  
==Patents==
Numerous [[patent]]s were obtained by the two [[inventor]]s: the 1854 English&lt;ref&gt;http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=GB&amp;NR=185701655A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=18571201&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP&lt;/ref&gt; and Piedmont patents, the 1861 Piedmont patent of Barsanti, Matteucci and Babacci which was then used as a base to construct the engine of the [[Escher Wyss &amp; Cie.|Escher Wyss]] company of [[Zurich]] and put on exhibit during the first National Expo of Florence in 1861, and the 1861 English patent.

'''Coding it Forward''' is an American 501c3 non-profit organization building a talent pipeline into [[civic tech]], primarily through creating and marketing data science and technology internships in [[List of federal agencies in the United States|United States federal government agencies]] for undergraduate and graduate students at colleges and universities across the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chappellet-Lanier |first1=Tajha |title=The Civic Digital Fellowship is coming back much bigger than before |url=https://www.fedscoop.com/civic-digital-fellowship-coming-back-much-bigger/ |website=fedscoop |accessdate=30 August 2018 |date=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Several [[Harvard University]] students were inspired by former [[Chief Technology Officer of the United States]] [[Megan Smith]]'s appeal for technologists to work in public service at the annual [[Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing]]. They started a blog highlighting how students were contributing to [[civic tech]] which quickly grew to 800 members within two months. Two of the students took a course with the former Deputy Chief Technology Officer of the United States [[Nick Sinai]] where they had the opportunity to work on tech projects in government. That experience led to the idea of organizing tech focused student internships in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kelman |first1=Steve |title=Students recruiting students into federal tech |url=https://fcw.com/blogs/lectern/2018/03/kelman-coding-it-forward.aspx |website=FCW |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civic Digital Fellowship==
The primary program of Coding it Forward is their ''Civic Digital Fellowship'', a competitive 10-week data science and technology internship program for undergraduate and graduate students in [[List of federal agencies in the United States|United States federal agencies]]. To date, they have received more than 1,100 applications from students from more than 175 colleges and universities for 50 fellowship positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chappellet-Lanier |first1=Tajha |title=Demand for the first edition of Coding it Forward’s Civic Digital Fellowship surprises even the founders |url=https://www.fedscoop.com/civic-digital-fellowship-talent-first-year/ |website=fedscoop |accessdate=29 August 2018 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Collaborative journalism''' is a mode of [[journalism]] where multiple [[reporters]] or news organizations, without affiliation to a common parent organization, report on and contribute [[news]] items to a news story together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novin|first=Alamir|date=17 August 2013|title=DEBATECITED: An empirical experiment into the value of open-source research methods and peer collaboration to science journalism|url=http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/977526/4/DEBATECITED_A1b.pdf|journal=Spectrum. Masters thesis, Concordia University.|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is practiced by both professional and amateur reporters. It is not to be mixed up with [[citizen journalism]].

==Further definition==

Collaborative journalism involves the aggregation of information from numerous individuals or organizations into a single news story.  Information is gathered through research or reporting, or added when readers examine, comment and build upon existing stories.  Stories from the [[mainstream]] media are often built upon.  Depending on the system of collaboration, individuals may also provide [[feedback]] or [[vote]] on whether an article is newsworthy.  A single collaborative news story, therefore, may encompass multiple authors, varying articles, and ranged perspectives.&lt;ref name=CCJ&gt;Whatis.com "[http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid26_gci1090596,00.html What is collaborative citizen journalism?]" 2006, ''TechTarget''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professional]] and [[amateur]] reporters may work together to develop collaborative news articles, or mainstream media sites may gather amateur blog posts to complement reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Instablogs "[http://www.instablogs.com/tour/ Instablogs Tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307204057/http://www.instablogs.com/tour/ |date=2009-03-07 }}" 2007, ''Instablogs''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative journalists either contribute directly to stories, sometimes through a wiki-style collaboration platform, or build upon the story externally, often through personal blogs.  Collaborative journalists develop or examine a story one piece at a time.  This contrasts the [[time limit|deadline]] and completion-centered nature of [[traditional media]].  A story is built upon continually, and a popular story may receive daily updates.&lt;ref name=CCJ/&gt;  Through combined authorship, collaborative journalism is thought by some to offer an increased independence of thought and experience unavailable to traditional media.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Stelter, Brian. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/business/media/13reach.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Mainstream%20News%20Outlets%20Start%20Linking%20to%20Other%20Sites&amp;st=cse Mainstream News Outlets Start Linking to Other Sites]" 12 October 2008, ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful collaborative journalism projects require a participatory community with respect for content.  Ross Mayfield, CEO of SocialText, has commented on wiki-style collaborative journalism:&lt;ref name="Glaser"&gt;Glaser, Mark.  "[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/glaser/1094678265.php Collaborative Conundrum: Do Wikis Have a Place in the Newsroom?]" 2004, ''USC Annenberg: Online Journalism Review''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Most user-generated content isn't content, but conversation.  Cultivating community is a decided practice. It boils down to the social contract you make with your readers-turned-writers. If they trust that their effort and words will be appropriated appropriately, while providing social incentives for participation, it can very well work."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

Collaborative journalism emerged through the [[internet]] in the early 2000s, and developed gradually through various online outlets.  As examples, [[Wikinews]] was founded in 2003, and [[NewsVine]] in 2005.

===Panama Papers===
The [[Panama Papers]] project may be the largest example of a journalistic consortium to date. It began sometime in 2015 (date?) when [[Bastian Obermayer]], an investigative reporter with the south German newspaper [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]], was contacted by an anonymous source&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/business/media/how-a-cryptic-message-interested-in-data-led-to-the-panama-papers.html|title=How a Cryptic Message, ‘Interested in Data?,’ Led to the Panama Papers|last=Clark|first=Nicola|date=2016-04-05|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offered the trove of 11.5 million electronic documents from [[Mossack Fonseca]], the world’s fourth biggest offshore law firm detailing a web of secret offshore deals and loans worth billions of dollars, and details of tax avoidance designs in numerous countries. The newspaper's editors decided they could not handle the massive volume of information alone and initiated a collaborative journalistic consortium including more than 140 journalists and the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]], a project of the [[nonprofit]] [[Center for Public Integrity]].

==Football Leaks (2016/2017)==
{{main|Football Leaks}}
The [[European Investigative Collaborations]] (EIC) working with "over 60 journalists in 14 countries" published a "series of articles called ''Football Leaks''—the "largest leak in sports history".&lt;ref name="theblacksea_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://theblacksea.eu/?idT=3&amp;idC=3 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |location=Bucharest, Romania |year=2017 |publisher=The Black Sea |title=Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Football Leaks'' "led to the prosecution of football superstar [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and coach [[Jose Mourinho]]."&lt;ref name="horizont_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.horizont.net/medien/nachrichten/Investigativjournalismus-Spiegel-schafft-ressortuebegreifendes-Recherchenetzwerk-160100 |title=Spiegel schafft multimediales Recherchenetzwerk |first=von Hein |last=David Hein |location=Freitag |date=August 4, 2017 |access-date=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; EIC was established in the fall of 2015 with founding members that include ''Der Spiegel'', ''El Mundo'', ''Médiapart'', the Romanian Centre for Investigative Journalism (CRJI), and ''Le Soir''.&lt;ref name="EU_gov_Rengers_EIC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/127803/5%20-%2001%20On%20Football%20Leaks%20-%20speaking%20notes%20Merijn%20Rengers.pdf |format=PDF |title=On Football Leaks Speaking notes |first=Merijn |last=Rengers |agency=European Parliament |series=Speaking notes}}NRC Handelsblad, Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="journalismfund_2016_EIC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journalismfund.eu/news/%E2%80%9Csome-stories-can-get-killed-without-right-network%E2%80%9D |title=Some stories can get killed without the right network |date=March 30, 2016 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |publisher=Journalism Fund formerly Fonds Pascal Decroos voor Bijzondere Journalistiek vzw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theblacksea_2016_EU"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1230&amp;recType=multimedia |title=EU’s freedom of goods policy opened door to Paris terror attacks |date=March 18, 2016 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |publisher=The Black Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differentiation from other styles of journalism==

*Collaborative journalism should not be confused with [[citizen journalism]], which is practiced only by amateur reporters who develop stories by actively reporting, collecting, analyzing and disseminating news and information, often through [[blog]]s on the internet.
*It is not [[community journalism]] or [[Civic Journalism|civic journalism]], which are practiced only by professionals:
**In [[community journalism]], professional reporters focus their coverage on smaller communities, such as neighborhoods, suburbs, or small towns (rather than national or international coverage.)
**[[Civic Journalism|Civic journalism]] is the philosophy and practice of professional journalists and newspapers acting as participants within a community, rather than detached spectators.
*Collaborative journalism is similar, but not identical, to [[interactive journalism]], in which consumers contribute to a professional news story through commenting and conversing with the reporter.
*[[Wiki journalism]]  is a type of collaborative journalism.

==Link journalism==

"[[Link journalism]]", a phrase coined by Scott Karp in 2008, is "a form of collaborative journalism in which a news story's writer provides external [[hyperlink|links]] within the story to reporting or other sources on the web."&lt;ref name="Karp"&gt;Karp, Brian. "[http://publishing2.com/2008/02/25/how-link-journalism-could-have-transformed-the-new-york-times-reporting-on-mccain-ethics/ How Link Journalism Could Have Transformed the New York Times Reporting on McCain Ethics]" 2008, ''Publish 2.0 Blog''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Link Journalism"&gt;Publish2 "[http://www.publish2.com/about/what-is-link-journalism What is link journalism?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312060206/http://www.publish2.com/about/what-is-link-journalism |date=2009-03-12 }}" 2009, ''Publish2''.&lt;/ref&gt;    These links are meant to complement, enhance, or add context to the original reporting.  [[Jeff Jarvis]], from the Graduate School of Journalism's new media program at the [[City University of New York]], has said that link journalism creates a "new architecture of news."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Implementation==

Collaborative journalism has been implemented in several different ways.  [[Wikinews]], the "free-content online news source," lets any user edit or create a news story, similar in style to [[Wikipedia]].  Several mainstream news sites have adopted a collaborative journalism approach toward news, through use of news aggregation.  [[The Washington Post]] has developed a political site which links to related content from other news sites.  [[NBC]] links to local newspapers, radio broadcasts, online videos, and blogs on its local television stations' sites.  The sites do not separate articles written by NBC staff and links to outside sources.
[[The New York Times]] has introduced a ''Times Extra'' website feature which acts posts links to outside news sites.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;   Commenting on the launch of ''Times Extra'', [[Marc Frons]], CTO for Digital Operations at the New York Times, said:&lt;ref name="Frons"&gt;Frons, Marc. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/28/business/media/28askthetimes.html?adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1217599487-JcYF6S4d34UK1ZlCsX04OA Talk to the Times: Chief Technology Officer, Digital Operations]" 2008, ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“In the past, I think many news organizations were afraid to link to other Web sites out of fear that they might be sending people to an unreliable source or that their readers would never return. But those fears were largely misplaced and we’ve seen a much more open policy when it comes to pointing readers at useful content elsewhere on the Web."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other sites exhibit collaborative journalism through aggregation.  On the site [[NewsVine]], for example, wire stories from the Associated Press complement user-generated stories and blog posts.  [[Reddit]] and other news aggregation sites may also act as collaborative journalism sites, depending on where content originates.

== Awards for collaborative journalism ==
Due to the increase in collaborative journalism, several organizations have begun to offer grants or awards for these types of projects. For example, Online Journalism Awards (launched in May 2000) added a new award category for collaborations and partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://awards.journalists.org/2018/05/02/2018-online-journalism-awards-introduce-new-collaboration-category-among-changes/|title="2018 OJAs introduce new Collaboration category, among other changes"|last=|first=|date=|website=Online Journalism Awards|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clean Energy Wire offers grants for collaborative journalism projects on the topic of energy or the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cleanenergywire.org/grant-collaborative-journalism-for-global-energy-transition|title="Go collaborate! Grant for energy &amp; climate journalism."|last=|first=|date=|website=Clean Energy Wire|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual Hostwriter Prize awards money to support pitches and published collaborative projects by journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hostwriter.org/sites/prize/|title="Hostwriter Prize: Together for better journalism"|last=|first=|date=|website=Hostwriter|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Collaborative journalism has received some criticism:
*Some news stories require secrecy as they develop.  Often sources cannot know that they are being investigated or reported on. When a single reporter investigates a person or organization, this secrecy is more likely to be kept.  When news stories are developed collaboratively by multiple journalists, however, secrecy is more likely to be lost and the story jeopardized.&lt;ref name=DigiDave&gt;"[http://www.digidave.org/2009/03/collaboration-is-queen.html Collaboration is Queen] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090817232727/http://www.digidave.org/2009/03/collaboration-is-queen.html |date=2009-08-17 }}" 2009, ''DigiDave.org''&lt;/ref&gt;
*Quality of collaborative projects may be difficult to assess.  Fact-checking may be difficult, as facts come from many different sources.  Quality of writing and reporting may also differ among contributors.&lt;ref name=Haber&gt;Haber, Marlan Wynne "[http://connection.ebscohost.com/content/article/1026359737.html%3Bjsessionid=E02C44EA6326406DD8BB63E7C014ABC7.ehctc1 Strategies of Collaborative Writing and Intellectual Enrichment.]" 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Row colors are the only thing distinguishing real from in-development &amp; retired engines...
probably need to either (1) break the table up into three tables, or (2) add a column with
the engine status.

'''Critical technical practice''' is [[critical theory]] based approach towards technological design proposed by [[Phil Agre]] where [[critical theory|critical]] and [[cultural studies|cultural]] theories are brought to bear in the work of designers and [[engineer]]s. One of the goals of critical technical practice is to increase awareness and critical reflection on the hidden assumptions, ideologies and values underlying technology design.

== Pedagogy of Critical Technical Practice ==
 
A different fork of Critical Technical Practice from Agre’s root (Agre, 1997) was initiated at the former Centre for Cultural Studies between 2007-2017, Goldsmiths, University of London as a way to examine, the live techno-social aspects of contemporary digital culture. This stream of Critical Technical Practice (CTP) at its most broad use can be described as the formation of thought and action that incorporates art as a method of enquiry. This is a compacted intellectual form, that makes the space between the technical, theory and practice ambiguous. A typical digital culture class would make/explore things, attempting to explain the phenomena caught in the lens of a project or proposition. 
 
An example of a class may clarify this approach. We might propose that the class create a simple (DOS) denial of service attack on a test remote server by learning to code computers for the first time. It is empowering for students to find out how quickly they can code. The class would learn how to do this from T.J. Connor’s book Violent Python. After the group had reached a self-satisfied tingle of radicalism the group would be asked to look up the author and would find that Connor is a top grade US Military expert. The group would then look at the books distribution and market penetration and be encouraged to question the affective logics, politics and culture of the book, reflect on why the workshop had been constructed the way it was, and their own learning in different registers of technicality, politics of information and personal critic and empowerment was achieved. 
 
Critical Technical Practice then is not necessarily a reduction of phenomena to literature or a system of logics, but can instead be thought of as knowledge incorporated into a thing that the class created, look at or pointed too, through revealing a certain type of gaze.  A prerequisite of Critical Practice is that incorporates this form of gaze is thinking through the formation of oneself as a thinker, actor in the world. Enquiring into one's pre-existence helps understand the structuring of potential that has informed what one has become, what one could easily recognise, and what one could easily achieve. This is not a summation of limit but an acknowledgement of the hard work needed to escape a pre-existence, as it may relate to the four pillars of repression, class, gender, sexuality and race. The situated knowledge of family and friends, their relation to making things, to popular culture, to oral histories, to struggles with money or law, reading, writing and speaking, all inform this process. 
 
To this end, CTP is partially related to a schizoanalysis of Foucault's question  “What are we today?” (Foucault 1984: pp. 42ff.) The class is always encouraged to unfold what conditions, constrain, control, resist, govern, determine this moment and not another? What patterns of recognition are we privileging and why does it blind us to others? How does language restrict us at the very moment we are able to say something? How can this engagement be born anew in every instance?

'''Crowdfunding''' is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people, typically via the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Crowdfunding|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/crowdfunding|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=2017-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowdfunding is a form of [[crowdsourcing]] and [[Alternative Finance|alternative finance]]. In 2015, a worldwide estimate totaling over {{USD|34 billion}} was raised by crowdfunding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/ |title=Cambridge Judge Business School: Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance |publisher=Jbs.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Barnett | first=Chance | title=Trends Show Crowdfunding To Surpass VC In 2016 | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chancebarnett/2015/06/09/trends-show-crowdfunding-to-surpass-vc-in-2016 | publisher=''[[Forbes]]'' | date=June 9, 2015 | access-date=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although similar concepts can also be executed through mail-order subscriptions, benefit events, and other methods, the term crowdfunding refers to [[Internet]]-mediated registries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/crowdfunding|title=Oxford Dictionary Definition of Crowdfunding|accessdate=July 23, 2014}}; The ''[[Merriam Webster Dictionary]]'' defines crowdfunding as "the practice of soliciting financial contributions from a large number of people especially from the online community" {{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/crowdfunding|title=Merriam Webster Dictionary Definition of Crowdfunding|accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This modern crowdfunding model is generally based on three types of actors: the project initiator who proposes the idea or project to be funded, individuals or groups who support the idea, and a moderating organization (the "platform") that brings the parties together to launch the idea.&lt;ref name="unibocconi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://didattica.unibocconi.it/mypage/upload/49036_20110414_125339_JOSM_CROWD_FINAL.PDF |title=Crowdfunding: Transforming Customers Into Investors Through Innovative Service Platforms|accessdate=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowdfunding has been used to fund a wide range of for-profit, [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial ventures]] such as artistic and creative projects, medical expenses, travel, or community-oriented [[social entrepreneurship]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;Gleasure, R., &amp; Feller, J. (2016). Emerging technologies and the democratisation of financial services: A metatriangulation of crowdfunding research. Information and Organization, 26(4), 101-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Auguste Comte, Souscription 1850.jpg|thumb|A printed receipt 135 x 97 mm issued between 1850 and 1857 to support the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://positivists.org/blog/archives/5959 |title=Crowdsourcing Comte |author=Olaf Simons |publisher=positivists.org |date=2016-03-10 |accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=March 2016}}]]
Crowdfunding has a long history with several roots. Books have been crowdfunded for centuries: authors and publishers would advertise book projects in [[praenumeration]] or [[Subscription (finance)|subscription]] schemes. The book would be written and published if enough subscribers signaled their readiness to buy the book once it was out. The [[subscription business model]] is not exactly crowdfunding, since the actual flow of money only begins with the arrival of the product. The list of subscribers has, though, the power to create the necessary confidence among investors that is needed to risk the publication.&lt;ref name=statue&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21932675|title=The Statue of Liberty and America's crowdfunding pioneer|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=April 28, 2013|date=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[War bonds]] are theoretically a form of crowdfunding military conflicts. London's mercantile community saved the [[Bank of England]] in the 1730s when customers demanded their pounds to be converted into gold - they supported the currency until confidence in the pound was restored, thus crowdfunded their own money. A clearer case of modern crowdfunding is [[Auguste Comte]]'s scheme to issue notes for the public support of his further work as a philosopher. The "Première Circulaire Annuelle adressée par l'auteur du ''Système de Philosophie Positive''" was published on 14 March 1850, and several of these notes, blank and with sums have survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://positivists.org/blog/archives/5959 |title=Crowdfunding Comte |author=Olaf Simons |publisher=positivists.org |date=2016-03-11 |accessdate=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cooperative movement]] of the 19th and 20th centuries is a broader precursor. It generated collective groups, such as community or interest-based groups, pooling subscribed funds to develop new concepts, products, and means of distribution and production, particularly in rural areas of Western Europe and North America. In 1885, when government sources failed to provide funding to build a monumental base for the [[Statue of Liberty]], a newspaper-led campaign attracted small donations from 160,000 donors.&lt;ref name=statue/&gt;

Crowdfunding on the internet first gained popular and mainstream use in the arts and music communities.&lt;ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Agrawal |first=Ajay |first2=Christian |last2=Catalini |first3=Avi |last3=Goldfarb |title=Some Simple Economics of Crowdfunding |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 19133 |date=June 2013 |doi=10.3386/w19133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first noteworthy instance of online crowdfunding in the music industry was in 1997, when fans underwrote an entire U.S. tour for the British rock band [[Marillion]], raising US$60,000 in donations by means of a fan-based Internet campaign. They subsequently used this method to fund their studio albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-09-23/features/9709230071_1_music-fans-newsgroup-marillion/ |title=British Band's U.s.

By early 1999, he had raised more than US$125,000 on the Internet from at least 25 fans, providing him with the funds to complete his film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Rodgers |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-06-11/features/9906110076_1_kines-investing-film |title=Filmmaker Uses Web To Help Finance, Cast Movie |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=June 11, 1999|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the "Free Blender" campaign was an early [[software]] crowdfunding precursor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/2002072201226OSBZCY Blender Foundation Launches Campaign to Open Blender Source] on linuxtoday (July 22, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021010045558/http://www.blender3d.com/campaign.html 'Free Blender Fund' campaign] archived 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign aimed for [[Open-source software|open-sourcing]] the [[Blender (software)|Blender]] [[3D computer graphics software]] by collecting $100,000 from the community while offering additional benefits for donating members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021010174347/http://www.blender3d.com/members.html Membership] ''People can subscribe to become Foundation Member. Members who subscribe during the campaign period, get additional benefits for their support. During campaign: - Costs: minimum one time fee of  50 euros (or US$50)'' (archived 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowdfunding started to gain mainstream traction with the launch of [[ArtistShare]] (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.freedman-chicago.com/ec4i/History-of-Crowdfunding.pdf|title=A Brief History Of Crowdfunding}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the model matured, more crowdfunding sites started to appear on the web such as [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]] (2005), [[IndieGoGo]] (2008), [[Kickstarter]] (2009), [[GoFundMe]] (2010), [[Microventures]] (2010), and [[YouCaring]] (2011).&lt;ref name="Wharton"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2647|title=Can You Spare a Quarter?

The phenomenon of crowdfunding is older than the term "crowdfunding".  According to wordspy.com, the earliest recorded use of the word was in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/crowdfunding.asp | title= Crowdfundings earliest citation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Crowdfunding by HQ.png|thumb|Four out of six types of crowdfunding.]]
The Crowdfunding Centre's May 2014 report identified two primary types of crowdfunding:
 
# Rewards crowdfunding: entrepreneurs presell a product or service to launch a business concept without incurring debt or sacrificing equity/shares. 
# [[Equity crowdfunding]]: the backer receives shares of a company, usually in its early stages, in exchange for the money pledged.&lt;ref name="Cat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Crowdfunding Generates More Than $60,000 an Hour (Infographic)|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234051?newsletter=true|work=Entrepreneur|publisher=Entrepreneur Media, Inc|accessdate=May 25, 2014|author=Catherine Clifford|date=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reward-based===
Reward-based crowdfunding has been used for a wide range of purposes, including motion picture promotion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Crowd funding: An emerging trend in Bollywood |url=http://www.indiatimes.com/bollywood/crowd-funding-an-emerging-trend-in-bollywood-15652.html |accessdate=August 12, 2012 |work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[free software]] development, inventions development, scientific research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.scienceexchange.com/2012/05/crowdfunding-as-the-future-of-science-funding/ |title=Crowdfunding as the future of science funding? &amp;#124; The Science Exchange Blog |publisher=Blog.scienceexchange.com |date=May 27, 2012 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and civic projects.&lt;ref name="Open Citizenship Journal"&gt;{{cite web |title=Crowdfunding and Civic Society in Europe: A Profitable Partnership? |url=https://www.academia.edu/3415172/Crowdfunding_and_Civic_Society_in_Europe_A_Profitable_Partnership |publisher=Open Citizenship Journal |accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many characteristics of rewards-based crowdfunding, also called non-equity crowdfunding, have been identified by research studies. In rewards-based crowdfunding, funding does not rely on location. The distance between creators and investors on Sellaband was about 3,000 miles when the platform introduced royalty sharing. The funding for these projects is distributed unevenly, with a few projects accounting for the majority of overall funding. Additionally, funding increases as a project nears its goal, encouraging what is called "herding behavior". Research also shows that friends and family account for a large, or even majority, portion of early fundraising. This capital may encourage subsequent funders to invest in the project. While funding does not depend on location, observation shows that funding is largely tied to the locations of traditional financing options. In reward-based crowdfunding, funders are often too hopeful about project returns and must revise expectations when returns are not met.&lt;ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"/&gt;

===Equity===
[[Equity crowdfunding]] is the collective effort of individuals to support efforts initiated by other people or organizations through the provision of finance in the form of equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ordanini | first1 = A. | last2 = Miceli | first2 = L. | last3 = Pizzetti | first3 = M. | last4 = Parasuraman | first4 = A. | title = Crowd-funding: Transforming customers into investors through innovative service platforms | doi = 10.1108/09564231111155079 | journal = Journal of Service Management | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 443 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }} (also available as [https://www.scribd.com/doc/59656556/Crowdfunding-Transforming-Customers-into-Investors-through-Innovative-Service-Platforms Scribd document])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes1127&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaprive/2012/11/27/what-is-crowdfunding-and-how-does-it-benefit-the-economy/|title=What IS Crowdfunding And How Does IT Benefit The Economy|accessdate=November 27, 2012 | work=Forbes|first=Tanya|last=Prive|date=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, legislation that is mentioned in the 2012 [[JOBS Act]] will allow for a wider pool of small investors with fewer restrictions following the implementation of the act.&lt;ref name= Forbes1106&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaprive/2012/11/06/inside-the-jobs-act-equity-crowdfunding-2/  |title= Inside the JOBS Act: Equity Crowdfunding | accessdate=November 6, 2012 | work=Forbes |first=Tanya |last=Prive |date=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agrawal|first=Ajay|last2=Catalini|first2=Christian|last3=Goldfarb|first3=Avi|date=2014-01-01|title=Some Simple Economics of Crowdfunding|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/674021|journal=Innovation Policy and the Economy|volume=14|issue=1|pages=63–97|doi=10.1086/674021|issn=1531-3468}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike nonequity crowdfunding, equity crowdfunding contains heightened "information asymmetries". The creator must not only produce the product for which they are raising capital, but also create equity through the construction of a company.&lt;ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"/&gt; Equity crowdfunding, unlike donation and rewards-based crowdfunding, involves the offer of securities which include the potential for a return on investment. Syndicates, which involve many investors following the strategy of a single lead investor, can be effective in reducing information asymmetry and in avoiding the outcome of market failure associated with equity crowdfunding.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agrawal|first=Ajay|last2=Catalini|first2=Christian|last3=Goldfarb|first3=Avi|date=2015-02-25|title=Are Syndicates the Killer App of Equity Crowdfunding?|ssrn=2569988|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2569988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software value token===
Another kind of crowdfunding is to raise funds for a project where a digital or software-based value token is offered as a reward to funders which is known as [[Initial coin offering]] (abbreviated to ICO). Value tokens are [[endogenous]]ly created by particular&lt;!-- not all open decentralized networks will have these value tokens; only some. --&gt; open decentralized networks that are used to [[incentivize]] [[Peer-to-peer computing|client computers]] of the network to expend scarce computer resources on maintaining the protocol network.&lt;ref name="williams2016"&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Dominic |url=https://medium.com/@dominic_w/on-protocol-tokens-and-securities-law-8e54d2237eee#.hbpox9xly |title=On Protocol Tokens and Securities Law |work=[[Medium (website)|Medium]] |date=2016-08-16 |accessdate=2016-08-17 |quote=''Protocol tokens with value: Open decentralized networks depend upon endogenously produced virtual tokens with value (or at least, so far this is the case). These tokens are needed to incentivize owners of client computers to perform expensive ... computation that supports the network.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These value tokens may or may not exist at the time of the crowdsale, and may require substantial development effort and eventual software release before the token is live and establishes a market value.  Although funds may be raised simply for the value token itself, funds raised on [[blockchain (database)|blockchain]]-based crowdfunding can also represent [[Equity (finance)|equity]], [[bond (finance)|bonds]], or even "[[market maker|market-maker seats]] of [[governance]]" for the entity being funded.&lt;ref name="tapscott201605"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business, and the World|last=Tapscott|first1=Don|last2=Tapscott|first2=Alex|date=May 2016|isbn=978-0670069972|pages=82–83, 128, 181, 245–246|authorlink=Don Tapscott}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2016-05-31 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Tapscott refers to this concept/type of crowdfund as a "blockchain IPO"; not yet sure if that should be mentioned in the article.

{{See also|Peer-to-peer lending}}
Debt-based crowdfunding (also known as "peer to peer", "P2P", "marketplace lending", or "crowdlending") arose with the founding of [[Zopa]] in the UK in 2005&lt;ref name=Fraser2015&gt;Ian Fraser for Unquoted. May 1, 2015 [https://www.unquoted.co.uk/crowdfunding-part-three-the-p2p-lenders/ Crowdfunding Part 3: The P2P lenders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720120908/http://www.unquoted.co.uk/crowdfunding-part-three-the-p2p-lenders/ |date=July 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the US in 2006, with the launches of [[Lending Club]] and [[Prosper.com]].&lt;ref name="F&amp;N2015"&gt;David M. Freedman and Matthew R. Nutting. [http://www.freedman-chicago.com/ec4i/History-of-Crowdfunding.pdf A Brief History of Crowdfunding]. Updated June 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Borrowers apply online, generally for free, and their application is reviewed and verified by an automated system, which also determines the borrower's credit risk and interest rate.  Investors buy securities in a fund which makes the loans to individual borrowers or bundles of borrowers.  Investors make money from interest on the unsecured loans; the system operators make money by taking a percentage of the loan and a loan servicing fee.&lt;ref name="F&amp;N2015"/&gt; In 2009, [[institutional investors]] entered the P2P lending arena; for example in 2013, Google invested $125 million in Lending Club.&lt;ref name="F&amp;N2015"/&gt; In 2014 in the US, P2P lending totalled about $5 billion.&lt;ref name=Payne&gt;Bill Payne for Gust. May 4th, 2015 [http://blog.gust.com/us-crowdfunding-in-2014/ US Crowdfunding in 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 in the UK, P2P platforms lent businesses £749 million, a growth of 250% from 2012 to 2014, and lent retail customers £547 million, a growth of 108% from 2012 to 2014.&lt;ref name=NestaAN2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/nesta_annual_report_2015.pdf|title=Nesta Annual Review 2014-2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}}  In both countries in 2014, about 75% of all the money transferred through crowdfunding went through P2P platforms.&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt;  Lending Club went public in December 2014 at a valuation around $9 billion.&lt;ref name="F&amp;N2015"/&gt;
Debt crowdfunding in the U.S. further evolved with the 2016 enactment of Title III of the JOBS Act, which allows unaccredited investors to invest directly in private businesses through regulated Funding Portals or Broker-Dealers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robb|first1=Alicia|title=The Potentials and Perils of Title III Crowdfunding|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kauffman/2016/09/20/the-potential-and-perils-of-title-iii-crowdfunding/|website=Forbes.com|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation===
Litigation crowdfunding allows plaintiffs or defendants to reach out to hundreds of their peers simultaneously in a semiprivate and confidential manner to obtain funding, either seeking donations or providing a reward in return for funding. It also allows investors to purchase a stake in a claim they have funded, which may allow them to get back more than their investment if the case succeeds (the reward is based on the compensation received by the litigant at the end of his or her case, known as a [[contingent fee]] in the United States, a success fee in the United Kingdom, or a ''pactum de quota litis'' in many civil law systems).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.invest4justice.com/how-to-succeed-in-crowdfunding-your-legal-claim/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121144155/https://www.invest4justice.com/how-to-succeed-in-crowdfunding-your-legal-claim/ |archivedate=November 21, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[LexShares]] is a platform that allows accredited investors to invest in lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/litigation-funding-moves-into-mainstream-1470338402|title=Litigation Funding Moves Into Mainstream|last=Randazzo|first=Sara|date=2016-08-04|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donation-based===
Running alongside reward-based crowdfunding, donation-based is second as the most commonly used form of crowdfunding. Charity donation-based crowdfunding is the collective effort of individuals to help charitable causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.times-standard.com/business/20141219/qa-rizikitotos-suraya-shivji-17-crowd-funds-for-african-orphans|title=Q&amp;: Rizikitoto's Suraya Shivji, 17, crowd-funds for African orphans|work=times-standard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In charity crowdfunding, funds are raised for pro-social or pro-environmental purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Choy | first1 = Katherine | last2 = Schlagwein| first2 = Daniel | title = Crowdsourcing for a better world: On the relation between IT affordances and donor motivations in charitable crowdfunding | journal = Information Technology &amp; People | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | year = 2016 | url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/ITP-09-2014-0215 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donors come together to create an online community around a common cause to help fund services and programs to combat issues. The major aspect of donor-based is that there is no reward for donating, rather it is based on the donor's [[Altruism|altruistic]] reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Belleflamme|first1= P.|last2= Omrani|first2= N.|last3= Peitz|first3= M. |date= March 2015|title=The Economics of Crowdfunding Platforms|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f6be/80e69747c5db162d44fa8f22d3cbac973f07.pdf|website=pdfs.semanticscholar.org|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role  ==
The inputs of the individuals in the crowd trigger the crowdfunding process and influence the ultimate value of the offerings or outcomes of the process. Each individual acts as an agent of the offering, selecting and promoting the projects in which they believe. They sometimes play a donor role oriented towards providing help on social projects. In some cases, they become shareholders and contribute to the development and growth of the offering. Individuals disseminate information about projects they support in their online communities, generating further support (promoters). Motivation for consumer participation stems from the feeling of being at least partly responsible for the success of others' initiatives (desire for patronage), striving to be a part of a communal social initiative (desire for social participation), and seeking a payoff from monetary contributions (desire for investment).&lt;ref name="unibocconi"/&gt; Additionally, individuals participate in crowdfunding to see new and innovative products before the public. Early access often allows funders to participate more directly in the development of the product. Crowdfunding is also particularly attractive to funders who are family and friends of a creator. It helps to mediate the terms of their financial agreement and manage each group's expectations for the project.&lt;ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"/&gt;

An individual who takes part in crowdfunding initiatives tends to reveal several distinct traits: innovative orientation, which stimulates the desire to try new modes of interacting with firms and other consumers; social identification with the content, cause or project selected for funding, which sparks the desire to be a part of the initiative; (monetary) exploitation, which motivates the individual to participate by expecting a payoff.&lt;ref name="unibocconi"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Forbes11" &gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaprive/2012/11/06/inside-the-jobs-act-equity-crowdfunding-2/ |title= Navigating The Sea Of Crowdfunding | accessdate=November 13, 2012 | work=Forbes |first=Tanya |last=Prive |date=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowdfunding platforms are motivated to generate income by drawing worthwhile projects and generous funders. These sites also seek widespread public attention for their projects and platform.&lt;ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"/&gt;

Crowdfunding websites helped companies and individuals worldwide raise US$89 million from members of the public in 2010, $1.47 billion in 2011, and $2.66 billion in 2012 — $1.6 billion of the 2012 amount was raised in North America.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com_2013-09-07"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/08/global-crowdfunding-rises-81-percent_n_3036368.html Global Crowdfunding Volumes Rise 81% In 2012], August 4, 2013, ''The Huffington Post'', Retrieved at September 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, more than one million individual campaigns were established globally&lt;ref name="f2013-10-30"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/chancebarnett/2013/05/08/top-10-crowdfunding-sites-for-fundraising/ Top 10 Crowdfunding Sites For Fundraising], May 8, 2013, Chance Barnett, ''Forbes''&lt;/ref&gt; and the industry was projected to grow to US$5.1 billion in 2013.&lt;ref name="f2013-10-30" /&gt; and to reach US$1 trillion in 2025.&lt;ref name="f2015-10-29"&gt;[http://www.myprivatebanking.com/article/report-crowdfunding-and-wealth-management-2015/ The Rise of Crowdfunding] October 28, 2015, MyPrivateBanking Research&lt;/ref&gt; A May 2014 report, released by the United Kingdom-based The Crowdfunding Centre and titled "The State of the Crowdfunding Nation", presented data showing that during March 2014, more than US$60,000 were raised on an hourly basis via global crowdfunding initiatives. Also during this period, 442 crowdfunding campaigns were launched globally on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Cat" /&gt;

== Platforms ==
{{Further|Comparison of crowd funding services}}
In 2012, there were over 450 crowdfunding platforms operating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 crowdfunding Platforms|accessdate=February 9, 2013|year=2012|url=http://www.triplepundit.com//07/emerging-next-generation-crowdfunding-platform-roundup/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 it was predicted that there would be over 2,000 crowdfunding sites to choose from in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2,000 Global Crowdfunding Sites to Choose from by 2016|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-drake/2000-global-crowdfunding-_b_8365266.html|publisher=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Project creators need to exercise their own due diligence to understand which platform is the best to use depending on the type of project that they want to launch.&lt;ref name=Forbes11/&gt;
Fundamental differences exist in the services provided by many crowdfunding platforms.&lt;ref name="unibocconi"/&gt; For instance, [[CrowdCube]] and [[Seedrs]] are Internet platforms which enable small companies to issue shares over the Internet and receive small investments from registered users in return. While CrowdCube is meant for users to invest small amounts and acquire shares directly in start-up companies, Seedrs pools the funds to invest in new businesses, as a nominated agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roy |first=Ritobaan |url=http://www.cfo-insight.com/financing-liquidity/alternative-finance/crowdfunding-sideshow-or-headline-act |title=Crowdfunding: Sideshow or Headline Act? – CFO Insight |publisher=Cfo-insight.com |date=September 3, 2012 |accessdate=September 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426053445/http://www.cfo-insight.com/financing-liquidity/alternative-finance/crowdfunding-sideshow-or-headline-act |archivedate=April 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curated crowdfunding platforms serve as "network orchestrators" by curating the offerings that are allowed on the platform. They create the necessary organizational systems and conditions for resource integration among other players to take place.&lt;ref name="unibocconi"/&gt; Relational mediators act as an intermediary between supply and demand. They replace traditional intermediaries (such as traditional record companies, venture capitalists). These platforms link new artists, designers, project initiators with committed supporters who believe in the persons behind the projects strongly enough to provide monetary support.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Growth engines focus on the strong inclusion of investors. They "disintermediate" by eliminating the activity of a service provider previously involved in the network. The platforms that use crowdfunding to seek stakes from a community of high net-worth private investors and match them directly with project initiators.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Significant campaigns==

===Early campaigns===
The [[Professional Contractors Group]], a trade body representing freelancers in the UK, raised £100,000 over a two-week period in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ipse.co.uk/news/ir35-and-pcg-crowdfund|title=IR35 and the PCG crowdfund|work=IPSE|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; from some 2000 freelancers threatened by a Government measure known as [[IR35]]. In 2004, [[Electric Eel Shock]], a Japanese rock band, raised £10,000 from 100 fans (the Samurai 100) by offering them a lifetime membership on the band's guestlist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drownedinsound.com/news/10764-wanna-go-vip-electric-eel-shock-ll-show-you-the-way |title=Drownedinsound.com "Wanna Go VIP?

[[Franny Armstrong]] later created a donation system for her feature film ''[[The Age of Stupid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kate Bulkley |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sheffield-doc-fest/funding-models-for-film-making |title=funding models for film making &amp;#124; Sheffield Doc/Fest 2010 &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=November 24, 2012 |accessdate=December 13, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over five years, from June 2004 to June 2009 (release date), she raised [[Pound sterling|£]]1,500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spannerfilms.net/node/1253 |title=Crowd-Funding FAQ |publisher=Spanner Films |date=July 13, 2009 |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2004, French entrepreneurs and producers [[:fr:Benjamin Pommeraud|Benjamin Pommeraud]] and [[:fr:Guillaume Colboc|Guillaume Colboc]], launched a public Internet donation campaign &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christina Warren |url=http://mashable.com/2011/01/17/kickstarter-crowd-funding-infographic/ |title=A Guide to Kickstarter &amp; Crowd Funding [INFOGRAPHIC&amp;#93; |publisher=Mashable.com |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to fund their short science fiction film, ''Demain la Veille (Waiting for Yesterday)''.

===Kickstarter campaigns ===
On April 17, 2014, the ''Guardian'' media outlet published a list of "20 of the most significant projects" launched on the Kickstarter platform prior to the date of publication:

*Musician [[Amanda Palmer]] raised US$1.2 million from 24,883 backers in June 2012 to make a new album and art book.&lt;ref name="techdirt.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/blog/casestudies/articles/20120601/01173819160/amanda-palmer-raises-12-million-kickstarter-crowd-goes-wild.shtml |title=Amanda Palmer Raises $1.2 Million On Kickstarter, And The Crowd Goes Wild |work=techdirt.com |date=June 1, 2012 |accessdate=May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Zack Brown raised $55,000 from over 6900 backers in September 2014 to make a bowl of potato salad.

=== Philanthropy and Civic Projects ===
A variety of crowdfunding platforms have emerged to allow ordinary web users to support specific [[philanthropic]] projects without the need for large amounts of money.&lt;ref name="Open Citizenship Journal"/&gt; [[GlobalGiving]] allows individuals to browse through a selection of small projects proposed by nonprofit organizations worldwide, donating funds to projects of their choice.  Microcredit crowdfunding platforms such as [[Kiva (organization)]] facilitate crowdfunding of loans managed by microcredit organizations in developing countries. The US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] applies a direct [[person-to-person lending]] model to microcredit lending for low-income small business owners in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secondact.com/2012/04/is-microfinance-for-you/ "Is Microfinance for You?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514044410/http://www.secondact.com/2012/04/is-microfinance-for-you/ |date=May 14, 2012 }}, SecondAct, April 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DonorsChoose|DonorsChoose.org]], founded in 2000, allows [[Public school (government funded)#United States|public school]] teachers in the United States to request materials for their classrooms. Individuals can lend money to teacher-proposed projects, and the organization fulfills and delivers supplies to schools. There are also a number of own-branded [[University and College Crowdfunding Platforms|university crowdfunding websites]], which enable students and staff to create projects and receive funding from alumni of the university or the general public. Several dedicated civic crowdfunding platforms have emerged in the US and the UK, some of which have led to the first direct involvement of governments in crowdfunding. In the UK, [[Spacehive]] is used by the [[Mayor of London]] and [[Manchester City Council]] to co-fund civic projects created by citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-hails-the-rise-of-civic-crowdfunding|title=Prime Minister hails the rise of 'civic crowdfunding'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, dedicated [[Humanitarian Crowdfunding|humanitarian crowdfunding]] initiatives are emerging, involving humanitarian organizations, volunteers and supports in solving and modeling how to build innovative crowdfunding solutions for the humanitarian community. Likewise, international organizations like the [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA) have been researching and publishing about the topic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unocha.org/node/190276 Crowdfunding for Emergencies], by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;

One crowdfunding project, iCancer, was used to support a Phase 1 trial of AdVince, an anti-cancer drug in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mosaicscience.com/story/plutocratic-proposal|title=A plutocratic proposal|last=Masters|first=Alexander|date=2014-10-14|website=Mosaic|publisher=The Wellcome Trust|access-date=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/health/can-crowdfunding-really-cure-cancer-alexander-masters-investigat/|title=Can crowdfunding really cure cancer?

===Real estate ===
Real estate crowdfunding is the online pooling of capital from investors to fund mortgages secured by real estate, such as "[[Flipping|fix and flip]]" redevelopment of distressed or abandoned properties, equity for commercial and residential projects, acquisition of pools of distressed mortgages, home buyer downpayments and similar real estate related outlets. Investment, via specialised online platforms in the US, is generally completed under Title II of the [[JOBS Act]] and is limited to accredited investors. The platforms offer low minimum investments, often $100 – $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell, Jonathan (June 9, 2013) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-it/fundrise-faces-off-with-skeptical-financial-services-industry-over-crowd-funded-real-estate/2013/06/07/78ba818a-cdeb-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html "Fundrise faces off with skeptical financial services industry over crowd-funded real estate"].

During 2014 and 2015, more than 150 platforms have been created throughout the world, such as in China, the Middle East, or France. In Europe, some compare this growing industry to that of e-commerce ten years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.canberra-immo.fr/actu-crowdfunding-immobilier-le-crowdfunding-va-devenir-un-secteur-de-poids-a-l-image-du-e-commerce-4052.html|title = Le crowdfunding va devenir un secteur de poids, à l'image du e-commerce|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe the requirements towards investors are not as high as in the United States, lowering the entry barrier into the real estate investments in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emerging Trends   in Real Estate: New market realities|url=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/asset-management/emerging-trends-real-estate/europe/emerging-trends-in-real-estate-2017.pdf|website=pwc.com|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real estate crowdfunding can include various project types from commercial to residential developments, planning gain opportunities, build to hold (such as social housing) and many more. The report from Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance addresses both real estate crowdfunding and ''peer 2 peer'' lending (property) in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/centres/alternative-finance/downloads/2017-12-ccaf-entrenching-innov.pdf Entrenching Innovation]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual property exposure===
One of the challenges of posting new ideas on crowdfunding sites is there may be little or no [[intellectual property]] (IP) protection provided by the sites themselves.  Once an idea is posted, it can be copied.  As Slava Rubin, founder of IndieGoGo, said: "We get asked that all the time, 'How do you protect me from someone stealing my idea?' We're not liable for any of that stuff."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inventorsdigest.com/archives/7037 Mike Drummond, "Making it Rain: Seeking Seed Money from the Crowd"], [[Inventors Digest]], August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Inventor advocates, such as Simon Brown, founder of the UK-based United Innovation Association, counsel that ideas can be protected on crowdfunding sites through early filing of [[patent applications]], use of [[copyright]] and [[trademark]] protection as well as a new form of idea protection supported by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] called [[Creative Barcode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon Brown |url=http://www.ipworld.com/ipwo/doc/view.htm?id=270623&amp;sectionID=features&amp;searchCode=SEC |title=Simon Brown, "Follow the Crowd", Intellectual Property Magazine, July 2011 |publisher=Ipworld.com |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science  ===
A number of platforms have also emerged that specialize in the crowdfunding of scientific projects, such as [[experiment.com]], and The Open Source Science Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gorbis|first1=Marina|title=The Nature of the Future: Dispatches from the Socialstructed World|date=2013|publisher=Simon &amp; Shuster|isbn=978-1-4516-4118-9|pages=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8HOOMDPuCQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the scientific community, these new options for research funding are seen ambivalently. Advocates of crowdfunding for science emphasize that it allows early-career scientists to apply for their own projects early on, that it forces scientists to communicate clearly and comprehensively to a broader public, that it may alleviate problems of the established funding systems which are seen to fund conventional, mainstream projects, and that it gives the public a say in science funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Neel V. Patel |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/04/crowdfunded-science-legit-science/ |title=Neel V. Patel, "Crowdfunded Science is here", Wired Magazine, April 24, 2015 |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, critics are worried about quality control on crowdfunding platforms. If non-scientists were allowed to make funding decisions, it would be more likely that "panda bear science" is funded, i.e. research with broad appeal but lacking scientific substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nayanah Siva |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)61661-5/abstract |title=Nayanah Siva, "Crowdfunding medical research picks up the pace", The Lancet, September 20, 2014 |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial studies found that crowdfunding is used within science, mostly by young researchers to fund small parts of their projects, and with high success rates. At the same time, funding success seems to be strongly influenced by non-scientific factors like humor, visualizations, or the ease and security of payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike S. Schaefer et al. |url=http://pus.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/08/23/0963662516668771.abstract |title=Mike S.

=== Journalism  ===
In order to fund online and print publications, journalists are enlisting the help of crowdfunding. Crowdfunding allows for small start-ups and individual journalists to fund their work without the institutional help of major public broadcasters. Stories are publicly pitched using crowdfunding platforms such as [[Kickstarter]], [[Indiegogo]], or [[Spot.us]]. The funds collected from crowdsourcing may be put toward travel expenses or purchasing equipment. Crowdfunding in journalism may also be viewed as a way to allow audiences to participate in news production and in creating a [[participatory culture]].&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 2015|title=Crowdfunding independent and freelance journalism: Negotiating journalistic norms of autonomy and objectivity|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=17|issue=2|pages=272–288|doi=10.1177/1461444814558915|last1=Hunter|first1=Andrea}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though deciding which stories are published is a role that traditionally belongs to editors at more established publications, crowdfunding can give the public an opportunity to provide input in deciding which stories are reported. This is done by funding certain reporters and their pitches. Donating can be seen as an act that "bonds" reporters and their readers. This is because readers are expressing interest for their work, which can be "personally motivating" or "gratifying" for reporters.&lt;ref name="Aitamuro"&gt;{{cite journal|date=August 2011|title=THE IMPACT OF CROWDFUNDING ON JOURNALISM|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=5|issue=4|pages=429–445|doi=10.1080/17512786.2010.551018|last1=Aitamurto|first1=Tanja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spot.us]], which was closed in February 2015, was a crowdfunding platform that was specifically meant for journalism.&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.publicinsightnetwork.org/2015/02/11/spot-us-is-going-away-but-its-legacy-inspires-new-chapters-of-crowdfunding-playbook/|title=Spot.us is going away, but its legacy inspires new chapters of crowdfunding playbook|website=Public Insight Network|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website allowed for readers, individual donors, registered [[Spot.us]] reporters, or news organizations to fund or donate talent toward a pitch of their choosing. While funders are not normally involved in editorial control, [[Spot.us]] allowed for donors or "community members" to become involved with the co-creation of a story. This gave them the ability to edit articles, submit photographs, or share leads and information.&lt;ref name="Aitamuro" /&gt; According to an analysis by [[Public Insight Network]], [[Spot.us]] was not sustainable for various reasons. Many contributors were not returning donors and often, projects were funded by family and friends. The overall market for crowdfunding journalism may also be a factor; donations for journalism projects accounted for .13 percent of the $2.8 billion that was raised in 2013.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.publicinsightnetwork.org/2015/02/11/spot-us-is-going-away-but-its-legacy-inspires-new-chapters-of-crowdfunding-playbook/|title=Spot.us is going away, but its legacy inspires new chapters of crowdfunding playbook|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger crowdfunding platforms such as [[Indiegogo]] or [[Kickstarter]], both of which are not journalism-specific, may garner more success for projects. This is because these large-scale platforms can allow journalists to reach new audiences. In 2017, 2.3 million out of [[Kickstarter]]'s 7.9 million users had donated toward more than one project.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Traditionally, journalists are not involved in advertising and marketing. Crowdfunding means that journalists are attracting funders while trying to remain independent, which may pose a conflict. Therefore, being directly involved with financial aspects can call [[journalistic integrity]] and [[journalistic objectivity]] into question. This is also due to the fact that journalists may feel some pressure or "a sense of responsibility" toward funders who support a particular project.&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt; Crowdfunding can also allow for a blurred line between professional and non-professional journalism because if enough interest is generated, anyone may have their work published.&lt;ref name="Jian"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jian|first1=Lian|last2=Usher|first2=Nikki|title=Crowd-Funded Journalism|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date=January 2014|volume=19|issue=2|pages=155–170|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International development ===
There is some hope that crowdfunding has potential as a tool open for use by groups of people traditionally more marginalized.  The World Bank published a report titled "Crowdfunding's potential for the Developing World" which states that "While crowdfunding is still largely a developed world phenomenon, with the support of governments and development organizations it could become a useful tool in the developing world as well. Substantial reservoirs of entrepreneurial talent, activity, and capital lay dormant in many emerging economies...Crowdfunding and crowdfund investing have several important roles to play in the developing world's entrepreneurial and venture finance ecosystem."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=World|date=2013|title=Crowdfunding's Potential for the Developing World|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/17626|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal developments ===
As the popularity of crowdfunding expanded, the SEC, state governments, and Congress responded by enacting and refining many capital-raising exemptions to allow easier access to alternative funding sources. Initially, the Securities Act of 1933 banned companies from soliciting capital from the general public for private offerings. However, "President Obama signed the Jumpstart Our Small Businesses Act ("JOBS Act") into law on April 5, 2012, which removed the ban on general solicitation activities for issuers qualifying under a new exemption called 'Rule 506(c).'" A company can now broadly solicit and generally advertise an offering and still be compliant with the exemption's requirements if:
* The investors in the offering are all accredited investors; and
* The company takes reasonable steps to verify that the investors are accredited investors, which could include reviewing documentation, such as W-2s, tax returns, bank and brokerage statements, credit reports and the like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answers-rule506htm.html|title=SEC.gov {{!}} Rule 506 of Regulation D|website=www.sec.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another change was the amendment of SEC Rule 147. Section 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act allows for unlimited capital raising from investors in a single state through an intrastate exemption. However, the SEC created Rule 147 with a number of requirements to ensure compliance. For example, intrastate solicitation was allowed, but a single out-of-state offer could destroy the exemption. Additionally, the issuer was required to be incorporated and do business in the same state of the intrastate offering. With the expansion of interstate business activities because of the internet, it became difficult for businesses to comply with the exemption. Therefore, on October 26, 2016 the SEC adopted Rule 147(a) which removed many of the restrictions to modernize the Rules. For example, companies would have to do business and have its principal place of business in the state where the offering is sold, and not necessarily where ''offered'' per the prior rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/secg/intrastate-offering-exemptions-compliance-guide-041917.htm|title= Intrastate Offering Exemptions:A Small Entity Compliance Guide for Issuers [1]|website=www.sec.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and risks==

===Benefits for the creator===
Crowdfunding campaigns provide producers with a number of benefits, beyond the strict financial gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crowdfunding in a Canadian Context|url=http://nordicity.com/reports/CMF-Crowdfunding-Study.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118231657/http://nordicity.com/reports/CMF-Crowdfunding-Study.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=November 18, 2012|work=Canada Media Fund|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are non financial benefits of crowdfunding.
* Profile – a compelling project can raise a producer's profile and provide a boost to their reputation.
* Marketing – project initiators can show there are an audience and market for their project. In the case of an unsuccessful campaign, it provides good market feedback.
* Audience engagement – crowdfunding creates a forum where project initiators can engage with their audiences. An audience can engage in the production process by the following progress through updates from the creators and sharing feedback via comment features on the project's crowdfunding page.
* Feedback – offering pre-release access to content or the opportunity to beta-test content to project backers as a part of the funding incentives provides the project initiators with instant access to good market testing feedback.

There are also financial benefits to the creator. For one, crowdfunding allows creators to attain low-cost capital. Traditionally, a creator would need to look at "personal savings, home equity loans, personal credit cards, friends and family members, angel investors, and [[venture capitalists]]." With crowdfunding, creators can find funders from around the world, sell both their product and equity, and benefit from increased information flow. Additionally, crowdfunding that supports pre-buying allows creators to obtain early feedback on the product.&lt;ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"/&gt; Proponents of the crowdfunding approach argue that it allows good ideas which do not fit the pattern required by conventional financiers to break through and attract cash through the [[wisdom of the crowd]]. If it does achieve "traction" in this way, not only can the enterprise secure seed funding to begin its project, but it may also secure evidence of backing from potential customers and benefit from [[word of mouth]] promotion in order to reach the fundraising goal.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaprive/2012/12/05/youve-just-crowdfunded-your-way-to-success-now-what// |title= You've Just Crowdfunded Your Way to Success – Now What?| accessdate=December 5, 2012 | work=Forbes |first=Tanya |last=Prive |date=December 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another potential positive effect is the propensity of groups to "produce an accurate aggregate prediction" about market outcomes as identified by author [[James Surowiecki]] in his book ''[[The Wisdom of Crowds]]'', thereby placing financial backing behind ventures likely to succeed.

Proponents also identify a potential outcome of crowdfunding as an exponential increase in available [[venture capital]]. One report claims that If every American family gave one percent of their investable assets to crowdfunding, $300 billion (a 10X increase) would come into venture capital.&lt;ref name= Gigaom &gt;{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/2012/05/08/fred-wilson-what-crowdfunding-means-for-the-vc-business/ |title= Gigaom: What crowdfunding means for the VC business| accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents also cite that a benefit for companies receiving crowdfunding support is that they retain control of their operations, as voting rights are not conveyed along with ownership when crowdfunding. As part of his response to the Amanda Palmer Kickstarter controversy, Albini expressed his supportive views of crowdfunding for musicians, explaining: "I've said many times that I think they're part of the new way bands and their audience interact and they can be a fantastic resource, enabling bands to do things essentially in cooperation with their audience." Albini described the concept of crowdfunding as "pretty amazing."&lt;ref name="Steve"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricalaudio.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=60267&amp;p=1545867#p1545867|title=Re: amanda "$1.2m" palmer wants you to play with her for fre|author=Steve Albini|date=September 13, 2012|work=Electrical Audio|publisher=Electrical Audio|format=Forum post|accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risks and barriers for the creator===
Crowdfunding also comes with a number of potential risks or barriers.&lt;ref name="CMF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/crowdfunding|title=Oxford Dictionary Definition of Crowdfunding|accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the creator, as well as the investor, studies show that crowdfunding contains "high levels of risk, uncertainty, and information asymmetry."&lt;ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"/&gt;
* Reputation – failure to meet campaign goals or to generate interest results in a public failure. Reaching financial goals and successfully gathering substantial public support but being unable to deliver on a project for some reason can severely negatively impact one's reputation.
* IP protection – many Interactive Digital Media developers and content producers are reluctant to publicly announce the details of a project before production due to concerns about idea theft and protecting their IP from plagiarism.&lt;ref name=CMF /&gt; Creators who engage in crowdfunding are required to release their product to the public in early stages of funding and development, exposing themselves to the risk of copy by competitors.&lt;ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"/&gt;
* Donor exhaustion – there is a risk that if the same network of supporters is reached out to multiple times, that network will eventually cease to supply necessary support.
* Public fear of abuse – concern among supporters that without a regulatory framework, the likelihood of a scam or an abuse of funds is high. The concern may become a barrier to public engagement.
* Lack of participation - It is seen that some stories are more likely to get picked up than others based on the story. it is easy to get support if you "just tell a story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2018-02-25/australians-crowdfunding-cancer-care-symptom-not-solution/9475070|title=The hidden costs of crowdfunding medical care|first=Ariel|last=Bogle|date=February 25, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For crowdfunding of equity stock purchases, there is some research in social psychology that indicates that, like in all investments, people don't always do their due diligence to determine if it's a sound investment before investing, which leads to making investment decisions based on emotion rather than financial logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isenberg |first=Daniel |url=http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/04/the_road_to_crowdfunding_hell.html |title=The Road to Crowdfunding Hell – Daniel Isenberg – Harvard Business Review |publisher=Blogs.hbr.org |date=April 23, 2012 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using crowdfunding, creators also forgo potential support and value that a single angel investor or venture capitalist might offer. Likewise, crowdfunding requires that creators manage their investors. This can be time-consuming and financially burdensome as the number of investors in the crowd rises.&lt;ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"/&gt; Crowdfunding draws a crowd: investors and other interested observers who follow the progress, or lack of progress, of a project. Sometimes it proves easier to raise the money for a project than to make the project a success. Managing communications with a large number of possibly disappointed investors and supporters can be a substantial, and potentially diverting, task.&lt;ref name=NYT91712&gt;{{cite news|title=Success of Crowdfunding Puts Pressure on Entrepreneurs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/technology/success-of-crowdfunding-puts-pressure-on-entrepreneurs.html|accessdate=September 18, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 17, 2012|author=Jenna Wortham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most popular fundraisings are for commercial companies which use the process to reach customers and at the same time market their products and services. This favors companies like microbreweries and specialist restaurants – in effect creating a "club" of people who are customers as well as investors. In the USA in 2015, new rules from the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] to regulate equity crowdfunding will mean that larger businesses with more than 500 investors and more than $25 million in assets will have to file reports like a public company. The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' commented: "It is all the pain of an IPO without the benefits of the IPO."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Christopher |last=Mims |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-startup-crowdfunding-isnt-all-its-cracked-up-to-be-1449464460|title=Tech Startup Crowdfunding Isn’t All It’s Cracked Up to Be |work= [[Wall Street Journal]]date= 7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two trends may mean crowdfunding is most suited to small consumer-facing companies rather than tech start-ups.

=== Benefits for the investor ===
There are several ways in which a well-regulated crowdfunding platform can provide attractive returns for investors:
* Crowdfunding Reduces Costs – The platforms reduce search and transaction costs, which allows a higher participation in the market. Many individual investors would otherwise have a hard time to invest in early-stage companies because of the difficulty of identifying a company directly and the high costs of joining an Angel Group or doing it through a professional venture firm.
* Current Early Stage Investing Isn't Efficient – Venture capital firms often neglect the consumer sector and focus mainly on high-tech companies. Crowdfunding opens up some of these neglected markets to individual investors. Crowdfunding doesn't make sense in every industry, but for some, like retail and consumer, it does.
* Value of New Investors – Another reason why crowdfunding is attractive is that the investors add value to companies. They act as brand advocates and can even be used as a focus group. Crowdfunding allows individual investors to be a valuable part of the company they invest in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/470631-3-reasons-crowdfunding-is-good-for-investors|title=3 Reasons Crowdfunding Is Good For Investors|last=Caldbeck|first=Ryan|date=2012-04-01|newspaper=Seeking Alpha|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risks for the investor ===
On crowdfunding platforms, the problem of [[information asymmetry]] is exacerbated due to the reduced ability of the investor to conduct due diligence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Early stage investing is typically localized, as the costs of conducting due diligence before making investment decisions and the costs of monitoring after investing both rises with distance. However, this trend is not observed on crowdfunding platforms - these platforms are not geographically constrained and bring in investors from near and far.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agrawal|first=Ajay|last2=Catalini|first2=Christian|last3=Goldfarb|first3=Avi|date=2015-06-01|title=Crowdfunding: Geography, Social Networks, and the Timing of Investment Decisions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jems.12093/abstract|journal=Journal of Economics &amp; Management Strategy|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=253–274|doi=10.1111/jems.12093|issn=1530-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt; On non-equity or reward-based platforms, investors try to mitigate this risk by using the amount of capital raised as a signal of performance or quality. On equity-based platforms, [[Syndicate#Crowdfunding|crowdfunding syndicates]] reduce information asymmetry through dual channels – through portfolio diversification and better due diligence as in the case of offline early-stage investing, but also by allowing ''lead investors'' with more information and better networks to lead ''crowds'' of backers to make investment decisions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7534">'''Dataism''' is a term that has been used to describe the mindset or philosophy created by the emerging significance of [[Big data|Big Data]]. It was first used by [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; More recently, the term has been expanded to describe what social scientist [[Yuval Noah Harari]] has called an emerging ideology or even a new form of religion, in which 'information flow' is the 'supreme value'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
"If you asked me to describe the rising philosophy of the day, I'd say it is Data-ism", wrote [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] in the New York Times in February 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/opinion/brooks-the-philosophy-of-data.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Philosophy of Data|last=Brooks|first=David|date=2013-02-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks argued that in a world of increasing complexity, relying on data can reduce cognitive biases and "illuminate patterns of behavior we haven't yet noticed".

In 2015, Steve Lohr's book 'Data-ism' looked at how Big Data is transforming society, using the term to describe the Big Data revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/you-can-run-from-big-data-but-can-you-hide/2015/03/20/082ea46c-c805-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html|title=You can run from Big Data, but can you hide?|last=Igo|first=Sarah E.|date=2015-03-20|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/861210012|title=Data-ism : The Revolution Transforming Decision Making, Consumer Behavior, and Almost Everything Else|last=Lohr|first=Steve|publisher=HarperBusiness|year=May 2015|isbn=0062226819|edition=First|location=New York, NY|pages=|oclc=861210012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development by Harari ===
In his 2016 book, [[Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|Homo Deus]], [[Yuval Noah Harari]] takes the idea of Dataism further, putting it into a historical context. He argues that all competing political or social structures can be seen as data processing systems: "Dataism declares that the universe consists of data flows, and the value of any phenomenon or entity is determined by its contribution to data processing"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=428}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Hilbert_InfoGrowth.png|thumb|Harari expands on the term: A Dataist is someone that trusts Big Data (above) and computer algorithms, in preference to human knowledge and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953597984|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=2017|publisher=Vintage|year=|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=429|oclc=953597984}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Harari posits that "we may interpret the entire human species as a single data processing system, with individual humans serving as its chips."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage, Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then argues that the whole of human history can be read as a process of improving the efficiency of this system by increasing the number and variety of processors/chips (humans) in the system, increasing the number of connections between the processors and increasing the freedom of movement along existing connections. A condensed form of this argument can be read in Harari's Wired article from 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/yuval-noah-harari-dataism|title='Homo sapiens is an obsolete algorithm': Yuval Noah Harari on how data could eat the world|last=Harari|first=Yuval|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harari goes on to argue that Dataism, like any other religion, has practical commandments. A Dataist should want to "maximise dataflow by connecting to more and more media"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and believes that freedom of information is "the greatest good of all". Harari also argues that [[Aaron Swartz]], who took his life in 2013 after being prosecuted for releasing hundreds of thousands of scientific papers from the [[JSTOR]] archive online for free, could be called the "first martyr" of Dataism.

Writing in the Financial Times, Harari argued that Dataism presents an existential challenge to the dominant moral ideology of Humanism, which sees human feelings as the ultimate authority in the world: "humanism is now facing an existential challenge and the idea of “free will” is under threat... Once Big Data systems know me better than I know myself, authority will shift from humans to algorithms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/50bb4830-6a4c-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c|title=Yuval Noah Harari on big data, Google and the end of free will|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=2016-08-26|website=Financial Times|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harari predicts that the logical conclusion of this process is that eventually humans will give algorithms the authority to make the most important decisions in their lives, such as who to marry and which career to pursue.

== Criticism ==
Commenting on Harari's characterisation of Dataism, security analyst Daniel Miessler believes that Dataism does not present the challenge to the ideology of liberal humanism that Harari claims, because humans will simultaneously be able to believe in their own importance and that of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://danielmiessler.com/blog/some-thoughts-on-dataism/|title=Some Thoughts on Dataism|date=2017-04-07|work=Daniel Miessler|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harari himself raises some criticisms, such as the problem of consciousness, which Dataism is unlikely to illuminate. Humans may also find out that organisms are not algorithms, he suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dataethics.eu/en/humanism-dataism-future-scenario/|title=From Humanism to Dataism. A future scenario. - Dataethical Thinkdotank|date=2017-04-25|work=Dataethical Thinkdotank|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other analysts such as Terry Ortleib have looked at the extent to which Dataism poses a dystopian threat to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Terry Ortlieb|title=is Harari Dataism Dystopian|date=2017-03-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev0Q4tCwgdI|accessdate=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Decapping''' (decapsulation) or '''delidding''' of an [[integrated circuit]] is the process of removing the protective cover of a microchip so that the contained [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] is revealed for [[visual inspection]] of the micro circuitry imprinted on the die. This process is typically done in order to debug a manufacturing problem with the chip, or possibly to copy information from the device. Modern integrated circuits can be encapsulated in plastic, [[ceramic]], or epoxy.

Decapping is usually carried out by chemical etching of the covering, laser cutting, or mechanical removal of the cover using a [[Milling (machining)|milling machine]]. The process can be either destructive or non-destructive.

The DAA platform enables secure authentication of a mobile user whilst simultaneously preserving privacy of the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://451research.com/report-short?entityId=94202/|title=451 Research Analyst Report|last=Bekker|first=Garrett|date=2018-01-30|website=451 Research|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/3955296/ovum-report-averon.pdf?hsCtaTracking=21516a12-2112-4331-b738-9cc9ebbd4b19%7C77dd6935-548f-45ff-9b6a-8652e13c284c/|title=Ovum Report: On The Radar |last=Kellet|first=Andrew|date=2018-03-21|website=ovum.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology was developed in stealth from late 2015, first publicly introduced by Averon in 2018, and featured at the 2018 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] as a new technology that combats the increasing threats of cybercrime and consumer account hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crn.com.au/news/10-coolest-smb-products-at-ces-2018-480892?utm_source=desktop&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=share/|title=10 Coolest Products at CES 2018|last=Alspach|first=Kyle|date=2018-01-11|website=CRN|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Overview ==
In contrast to legacy methods of cybersecurity, the DAA platform bypasses end user actions, and rather than focusing on the authentication of a user's device, DAA instead provides autonomous authentication of a user's mobile phone number, since the mobile phone number continues to be associated with the user even when they lose, destroy or upgrade their mobile phone. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.redherring.com/mobile/averon-ceo-wendell-brown-ux-now-crucial-element-cybersecurity/|title=UX Now Crucial Element in Cybersecurity|last=Williams|first=Sean|date=2017-11-02|website=redherring.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DAA method uses a proprietary mix of technology developed by Averon that works inside the secure mobile network data pipelines together with encrypted technology already within every smartphone. The combination of these autonomous authentication methods has been described by research analysts as a faster, more secure, and stronger method of cybersecurity than traditional methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://451research.com/report-short?entityId=94202/|title=Averon offers frictionless mobile authentication|last=Bekker|first=Garrett|date=2018-01-28|website=451 Research|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blockchain and privacy properties ==
Blockchain technology incorporated into the DAA platform ensures the privacy of end users. No identifiable personal data is maintained on the platform, therefore public disclosure of one's authentic identity (such as for the purpose of verified social media interactions) is voluntary. DAA technology affords the end user full control over identity disclosure in any given online interaction, which can be controlled by the end user in varying degrees from fully anonymous to fully identified publicly. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://martechseries.com/mobile/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-invests-in-mobile-identity-start-up-averon/|title=Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff Invests in Mobile Identity Startup Averon |last=|first=|date=2018-03-22|website=martechseries.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases involving the need for anonymity with regard to an end user's safety, such as in cases of whistleblowers or political activists, the DAA platform's blockchain technology provides a method for both complete anonymity with the option of voluntary verification of limited but often needed data (such as verifying an anonymous user's general location). Thus DAA technology alleviates the heretofore insurmountable challenge of protecting user privacy with the need for authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://451research.com/report-short?entityId=94202/|title=Averon offers frictionless mobile authentication|last=Bekker|first=Garrett|date=2018-01-28|website=451 Research|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use cases ==
The DAA technology platform was designed to be seamlessly adopted for utilization in a wide variety of industries and use cases in which mobile authentication of users is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/ideo-colab/digital-identity-is-broken-but-we-can-fix-it-b15398180bdf/|title=Digital Identity Is Broken, But We Can Fix It|last=Elitzer|first=Dan|date=2017-04-11|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://451research.com/report-short?entityId=94202/|title=Averon offers frictionless mobile authentication|last=Bekker|first=Garrett|date=2018-01-28|website=451 Research|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==
Since its introduction to the market in 2018, the DAA platform has been recognized by a number of industry groups for its innovation, including winning the Gold prize at the 2018 [[Edison Awards]], a Cybersecurity Excellence Award, and a BIG Innovation 2018 Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edisonawards.com/winners2018.php  |title=Edison Awards 2018 Winners|last=|first=|date=2018-04-17|website=tmcnet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2018/04/17/8737272.htm/|title=Gold Edison Award 2018|last=|first=|date=2018-04-17|website=tmcnet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bintelligence.com/blog/2018/2/7/55-chosen-as-winners-in-annual-big-innovation-awards|title=BIG Innovation Winners 2018|last=|first=|date=2018-02-07|website=bintelligence.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cybersecurity-excellence-awards.com/candidates/averon|title=Cybersecurity Excellence Awards|last=|first=|date=2018-05-03|website=oneworldidentity.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ducks demo''' was a [[tech demo]] that demonstrated the capabilities of the [[PlayStation 2]] at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2000 and the [[PlayStation 3]] at E3  2005. In the PlayStation 2 demo, only one duck is shown interacting with the water in the bathtub. In the PlayStation 3 demo, there are many ducks interacting with each other and their environment, as a visual representation of the leap in processing abilities from the PlayStation 2 Sony executives promise the PlayStation 3 will deliver. The Ducks demo was the basis for ''[[Super Rub 'a' Dub]]'' which is a downloadable title for the PS3 produced by SCEE.

== The 2005 Demo ==

In the demo, [[Phil Harrison]] shows the crowd a small bathtub with some [[rubber duck]]s in it. He uses these to demonstrate the real-time water ripples and dynamics. He then uses two toy pirate ships to demonstrate cloth dynamics. To show the [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell's]] processing power, he adds a huge amount of ducks to the tub (all reacting as they would in real-life, due to the advanced physics engine). Phil comments dryly that "this is only possible with the use of [[Level of detail|LOD]] technology, for those of you that don't know, LOD stands for "Lots of Ducks"

== The EyeToy ==

Phil Harrison then invites the creator of [[EyeToy]] to show the new technology the PlayStation 3 can use. Plugging a standard PlayStation 2 EyeToy into the PlayStation 3, he picks up two ordinary cups and proceeds to move the cups in a scooping motion, which scoops up the water pictured on screen. (animated and reacting as real water would).

== Trivia ==

The ducks demo was the basis for ''[[Super Rub 'a' Dub]]'' which is a downloadable title for the PS3 produced by SCEE.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41444">A '''Dyson sphere''' is a hypothetical [[megastructure]] that completely encompasses a [[star]] and captures a large percentage of its power output. The concept is a [[thought experiment]] that attempts to explain how a spacefaring civilization would meet its energy requirements once those requirements exceed what can be generated from the home planet's resources alone. Only a fraction of a star's energy emissions reach the surface of any orbiting planet. Building structures encircling a star would enable a civilization to harvest far more energy.

The first contemporary description of the structure was by [[Olaf Stapledon]] in his science fiction novel ''[[Star Maker]]'' (1937), in which he described "every solar system... surrounded by a gauze of light traps, which focused the escaping solar energy for intelligent use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tate|first1=Karl|title=Dyson Spheres: How Advanced Alien Civilizations Would Conquer the Galaxy|url=https://www.space.com/24276-dyson-spheres-how-advanced-alien-civilizations-would-conquer-the-galaxy-infographic.html|website=space.com|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was later popularized by [[Freeman Dyson]] in his 1960 paper "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of [[Infrared Radiation]]".&lt;ref name="search"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|year= 1960 |url=http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/SETI1.HTM |title=Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation|author= [[Freeman Dyson|Freemann J. Dyson]]|pages= 1667–1668 |volume =131 |doi= 10.1126/science.131.3414.1667|pmid=17780673|issue=3414|bibcode = 1960Sci...131.1667D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson speculated that such structures would be the logical consequence of the escalating energy needs of a technological civilization and would be a necessity for its long-term survival. He proposed that searching for such structures could lead to the detection of advanced, intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]]. Different types of Dyson spheres and their energy-harvesting ability would correspond to levels of technological advancement on the [[Kardashev scale]].

Since then, other variant designs involving building an artificial structure or series of structures to encompass a star have been proposed in [[exploratory engineering]] or described in [[science fiction]] under the name "Dyson sphere". These later proposals have not been limited to solar-power stations, with many involving [[space habitat|habitation]] or [[industry|industrial]] elements. Most fictional depictions describe a solid [[#Dyson shell|shell of matter]] enclosing a star, which is considered{{By whom|date=July 2018}} the least plausible variant of the idea. In May 2013, at the Starship Century Symposium in San Diego, Dyson repeated his comments that he wished the concept had not been named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starshipconf.ucsd.edu/|title=STARSHIP CENTURY SYMPOSIUM, MAY 21 - 22, 2013|date=7 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707123030/http://starshipconf.ucsd.edu/|archivedate=7 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of concept ==
{{see also|Energy development}}
[[File:Freeman Dyson.jpg|thumb|upright|Freeman Dyson]]
The concept of the Dyson sphere was the result of a [[thought experiment]] by physicist and mathematician [[Freeman Dyson]], when he theorized that all technological civilizations constantly increased their demand for energy. He reasoned that if human civilization expanded energy demands long enough, there would come a time when it demanded the ''total'' energy output of the [[Sun]]. He proposed a system of orbiting structures (which he referred to initially as a ''shell'') designed to intercept and collect all energy produced by the Sun. Dyson's proposal did not detail how such a system would be constructed, but focused only on issues of energy collection, on the basis that such a structure could be distinguished by its unusual emission spectrum in comparison to a star. His 1960 paper "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation", published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', is credited with being the first to formalize the concept of the Dyson sphere.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;

However, Dyson was not the first to advance this idea.  He was inspired by the mention of the concept in the 1937 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Star Maker]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Disturbing the Universe |last=Dyson |first=Freeman |year=1979 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-01677-4 |page=211 |quote=Some science fiction writers have wrongly given me the credit of inventing the artificial biosphere. In fact, I took the idea from Olaf Stapledon, one of their own colleagues}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Olaf Stapledon]], and possibly by the works of [[J. D. Bernal]], [[Raymond Z. Gallun]], and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], who seem to have explored similar concepts in their work.&lt;ref name = dsfaq-as-first-2012-01&gt;{{Cite web

== Feasibility ==
Although such megastructures may be theoretically possible, all plans to build a fixed-in-place Dyson sphere are currently far beyond humanity's engineering capacity. The number of craft required to obtain, transmit, and maintain a complete Dyson sphere far exceeds present-day industrial capabilities. [[George Dvorsky]] has advocated use of [[self-replicating robots]] to overcome this limitation in the relatively near term.&lt;ref name=dvorsky2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sentientdevelopments.com/2012/03/how-to-build-dyson-sphere-in-five.html |title=How to build a Dyson sphere in five (relatively) easy steps |last1=Dvorsky |first1=George |date=2012-03-20 |access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that such habitats could be built around [[white dwarf]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |title=Dyson Spheres around White Dwarfs|eprint=1503.04376|last1=Semiz|first1=İbrahim|last2=Oğur|first2=Salim|class=physics.pop-ph|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[Pulsar|pulsars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Osmanov | first1 = Z. | year = 2015| title = On the search for artificial Dyson-like structures around pulsars | arxiv = 1505.05131| journal = Int.

== Variants ==
In fictional accounts, the Dyson-sphere concept is often interpreted as an artificial hollow [[sphere]] of [[matter]] around a star. This perception is based on a literal interpretation of Dyson's original short paper introducing the concept. In response to letters prompted by some papers, Dyson replied, "A solid shell or ring surrounding a star is mechanically impossible. The form of 'biosphere' which I envisaged consists of a loose collection or swarm of objects traveling on independent orbits around the star."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume= 132|year= 1960|pages= 250–253|title= Letters and Response, Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation|author= [[Freeman Dyson|F. J. Dyson]], J. Maddox, P. Anderson, E. A. Sloane|doi= 10.1126/science.132.3421.252-a|pmid= 17748945| issue= 3421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dyson swarm ===
[[File:Dyson Ring.PNG|thumb|A '''Dyson ring'''—the simplest form of the Dyson swarm—to scale. Orbit is 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] in radius, collectors are 1.0{{e|7}} km in diameter (10 [[Gigametre|Gm]] or ≈25 times the [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Earth–Moon distance]]), spaced 3 degrees from center to center around the orbital circle.]]
[[File:Dyson Swarm.png|thumb|A relatively simple arrangement of multiple Dyson rings of the type pictured above, to form a more complex Dyson swarm. Rings' orbital radii are spaced 1.5{{e|7}} km with regard to one another, but average orbital radius is still 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]. Rings are rotated 15 degrees relative to one another, around a common axis of rotation.]]

The variant closest to Dyson's original conception is the "Dyson swarm". It consists of a large number of independent constructs (usually [[solar power satellite]]s and [[Space colonization|space habitats]]) orbiting in a dense formation around the star. This construction approach has advantages: components could be sized appropriately, and it can be constructed incrementally.&lt;ref name="canbuild"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#BUILT| title= Dyson FAQ: Can a Dyson sphere be built using realistic technology? | accessdate=2006-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various forms of [[wireless energy transfer]] could be used to transfer energy between swarm components and a planet.

Disadvantages resulting from the nature of [[Astrodynamics|orbital mechanics]] would make the arrangement of the orbits of the swarm extremely complex. The simplest such arrangement is the ''Dyson ring'', in which all such structures share the same orbit. More-complex patterns with more rings would intercept more of the star's output, but would result in some constructs eclipsing others periodically when their orbits overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Tech/Megascale/dyson_page.html|title= Some Sketches of Dyson Spheres|accessdate= 2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another potential problem is that the increasing loss of orbital stability when adding more elements increases the probability of orbital perturbations.

As noted [[Dyson sphere#Search for megastructures|below]], such a cloud of collectors would alter the light emitted by the star system. However, the disruption compared to a star's overall natural emitted spectrum would most likely be too small for Earth-based astronomers to observe.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;

=== Dyson bubble ===
[[File:Dyson Bubble.png|thumb|A '''Dyson bubble''': an arrangement of [[statite]]s around a star, in a non-orbital pattern. As long as a satellite has an unobstructed line-of-sight to its star, it can hover at any point in space near its star. This relatively simple arrangement is only one of an infinite number of possible statite configurations, and is meant as a contrast for a Dyson swarm only. Statites are pictured as the same size as the collectors pictured above, and arranged at a uniform 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] distance from the star.
]]

A second type of Dyson sphere is the "Dyson bubble". It would be similar to a Dyson swarm, composed of many independent constructs and likewise could be constructed incrementally.

Unlike the Dyson swarm, the constructs making it up are not in orbit around the star, but would be [[statite]]s—satellites suspended by use of enormous [[light sail]]s using [[radiation pressure]] to counteract the star's pull of gravity. Such constructs would not be in danger of collision or of eclipsing one another; they would be totally stationary with regard to the star, and independent of one another. Because the ratio of [[radiation pressure]] to the force of gravity from a star is constant regardless of the distance (provided the statite has an unobstructed line-of-sight to the surface of its star&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/Numbers/Math/Mathematical_Thinking/sunlight_exerts_pressure.htm| title= Sunlight Exerts Pressure| accessdate=2006-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;), such statites could also vary their distance from their central star.

The practicality of this approach is questionable with modern [[material science]], but cannot yet be ruled out. A 100% reflective statite deployed around the Sun would have an overall [[density]] of 0.78 grams per square meter of sail.&lt;ref name="stable"/&gt; To illustrate the low mass of the required materials, consider that the total mass of a bubble of such material 1 AU in radius would be about 2.17{{e|20}} kg, which is about the same mass as the asteroid [[2 Pallas|Pallas]].&lt;ref name="FAQ enough"/&gt; Another illustration: Regular printing [[paper]] has a density of around 80 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Such a material has not yet been produced in the form of a working light sail. The lightest carbon-fiber [[light sail|light-sail]] material currently produced has a density—without payload—of 3 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or about four times as heavy as would be needed to construct a solar statite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/carbonsail_000302.html |title=SPACE.com Exclusive: Breakthrough In Solar Sail Technology |first=Greg |last=Clark |publisher=Space.com |year=2000 |accessdate=2006-03-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114020015/http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/carbonsail_000302.html |archivedate=2006-01-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single sheet of [[graphene]], the two-dimensional form of carbon, has a density of only 0.37&amp;nbsp;mg per square meter,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Mitali | last = Kakran | contribution = Graphene: The New Wonder Material!!! | title = IET present around the world | date = 2011 | url = http://conferences.theiet.org/patw/-documents/mitali-kakran-slides.cfm | format = PDF | accessdate = 2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; making such a single sheet of graphene possibly effective as a solar sail. However, as of 2015 graphene has not been fabricated in large sheets, and it has a relatively high rate of radiation absorption, about 2.3% (i.e., still about 97.7% will be transmitted).&lt;ref name="Graphene properties"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graphene-battery.net/graphene-properties.htm |title=Graphene properties | publisher=www.graphene-battery.net | date=2014-05-29 |accessdate=2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1201.3071|last1=Apell|first1=S. P|title=High optical absorption in graphene|last2=Hanson|first2=G. W|last3=Hägglund|first3=C|class=physics.optics|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For frequencies in the upper GHz and lower THz range, the absorption rate is as high as 50–100% due to voltage bias and/or doping.&lt;ref name="Graphene properties"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Ultra-light [[carbon nanotube]]s meshed through [[molecular manufacturing]] techniques have densities between 1.3 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.4 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. By the time a civilization is ready to use this technology, the [[carbon nanotube]]'s manufacturing might be optimised enough for them to have a density lower than the necessary 0.7 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the average sail density with [[rigging]] might be kept to 0.3 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (a "[[Solar sail#Investigated sail designs|spin stabilized]]" light sail requires minimal additional mass in [[rigging]]). If such a sail could be constructed at this [[areal density]], a [[space habitat]] the size of the [[L5 Society]]'s proposed [[O'Neill cylinder]]—500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with room for over 1 million inhabitants, massing 3{{e|6}} [[ton]]s—could be supported by a circular light sail 3,000&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, with a combined sail/habitat mass of 5.4{{e|9}} kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thespacereview.com/article/317/1| title=The Space Review: The high risk frontier | first=Sam| last=Dinkin| publisher=Thespacereview.com| year=2006| accessdate=2006-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, this is just slightly smaller than the diameter of [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] (although the sail is a flat disc, not a sphere), or the distance between [[San Francisco]] and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. Such a structure would, however, have a mass quite a lot less than many asteroids. Although the construction of such a massive habitable statite would be a gigantic undertaking, and the required material science behind it is early stage, there are other engineering feats and required materials proposed in other Dyson sphere variants.

In theory, if enough satellites were created and deployed around their star, they would compose a non-rigid version of the Dyson shell mentioned below. Such a shell would not suffer from the drawbacks of massive compressive pressure, nor are the mass requirements of such a shell as high as the rigid form. Such a shell would, however, have the same optical and thermal properties as the rigid form, and would be detected by searchers in a similar fashion (see [[#Search for extra-terrestrial intelligence|below]]).

=== Dyson shell ===
[[Image:Dyson Sphere Diagram-en.svg|thumb|A cut-away diagram of an idealized Dyson shell, a variant on Dyson's original concept, with a radius of 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]]]
The variant of the Dyson sphere most often [[Dyson spheres in fiction|depicted in fiction]] is the "Dyson shell": a uniform solid shell of matter around the star.&lt;ref name="what"/&gt; Such a structure would completely alter the emissions of the central star, and would intercept 100% of the star's energy output. Such a structure would also provide an immense surface that many envision would be used for habitation, if the surface could be made habitable.

A spherical shell Dyson sphere in the Solar System with a radius of one [[astronomical unit]], so that the interior surface would receive the same amount of sunlight as Earth does per unit [[solid angle]], would have a surface area of approximately {{convert|2.8e17|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, or about 550 million times the surface area of Earth. This would intercept the full 384.6 [[yotta]][[watt]]s (3.846 × 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; watts)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/sunfact.html|title=NASA Sun Fact Sheet|accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Sun's output. Non-shell designs would intercept less, but the shell variant represents the maximum possible energy captured for the Solar System at this point of the Sun's [[stellar evolution|evolution]].&lt;ref name="what"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#WHAT| title= Dyson FAQ: What is a Dyson Sphere? | accessdate=2007-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is approximately 33 [[10^18|trillion]] times the power consumption of humanity in 1998, which was 12 terawatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sustainable/oomm.html|title=Order of Magnitude Morality|accessdate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several serious theoretical difficulties with the solid shell variant of the Dyson sphere:

Such a shell would have no net gravitational interaction with its englobed star (see [[shell theorem]]), and could drift in relation to the central star. If such movements went uncorrected, they could eventually result in a collision between the sphere and the star—most likely with disastrous results. Such structures would need either some form of propulsion to counteract any drift, or some way to repel the surface of the sphere away from the star.&lt;ref name="stable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#STABLE|title=Dyson Sphere FAQ: Is a Dyson sphere stable?|accessdate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the same reason, such a shell would have no net gravitational interaction with anything else inside it. The contents of any biosphere placed on the inner surface of a Dyson shell would not be attracted to the sphere's surface and would simply fall into the star. It has been proposed that a biosphere could be contained between two concentric spheres, placed on the interior of a rotating sphere (in which case, the force of artificial "gravity" is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, causing all matter placed on the interior of the sphere to pool around the equator, effectively rendering the sphere a [[Niven ring]] for purposes of habitation, but still fully effective as a radiant-energy collector) or placed on the outside of the sphere where it would be held in place by the star's gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Todd|last=Drashner|author2=Steve Bowers |author3=Mike Parisi |author4=M.

If assuming a radius of one [[Astronomical unit|AU]], then the compressive strength of the material forming the sphere would have to be immense to prevent implosion due to the star's gravity. Any arbitrarily selected point on the surface of the sphere can be viewed as being under the pressure of the base of a dome 1 AU in height under the Sun's gravity at that distance. Indeed, it can be viewed as being at the base of an infinite number of arbitrarily selected domes, but because much of the force from any one arbitrary dome is counteracted by those of another, the net force on that point is immense, but finite. No known or theorized material is strong enough to withstand this pressure, and form a rigid, static sphere around a star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#STRENGTH| title= Dyson FAQ: How strong does a rigid Dyson shell need to be? | accessdate=2006-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed by [[Paul Birch (writer)|Paul Birch]] (in relation to smaller "Supra-Jupiter" constructions around a large planet rather than a star) that it may be possible to support a Dyson shell by dynamic means similar to those used in a [[space fountain]].&lt;ref&gt;Search [https://archive.org/web/web.php WaybackMachine] for the 14th of June 2011 copy of  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulbirch.net/SupramundanePlanets.zip |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627074700/http://www.paulbirch.net/SupramundanePlanets.zip |archivedate=2006-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Masses travelling in circular tracks on the inside of the sphere, at velocities significantly greater than orbital velocity, would press outwards on [[magnetic bearing]]s due to [[centrifugal force]]. For a Dyson shell of 1-AU radius around a star with the same mass as the Sun, a mass travelling ten times the orbital velocity (297.9&amp;nbsp;km/s) would support 99 (a=v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/r) times its own mass in additional shell structure.

Also if assuming a radius of one AU, then there may not be sufficient building material in the Solar System to construct a Dyson shell. [[Anders Sandberg]] estimates that there is 1.82{{e|26}} kg of easily usable building material in the Solar System, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of 600&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;—about 8–20&amp;nbsp;cm thick on average, depending on the density of the material. This includes the hard-to-access cores of the gas giants; the inner planets alone provide only 11.79{{e|24}} kg, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of just 42&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="FAQ enough"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#ENOUGH| title= Is there enough matter in the Solar System to build a Dyson shell?| work=Dyson Sphere FAQ| first=Anders| last= Sandberg| accessdate=2006-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shell would be vulnerable to impacts from interstellar bodies, such as [[comet]]s, [[meteoroid]]s, and material in [[interstellar space]] that is currently being deflected by the Sun's [[bow shock]]. The [[heliosphere]], and any protection it theoretically provides, would cease to exist.

=== Other types ===

==== Dyson net ====
Another possibility is the "Dyson net", a web of cables strung about the star that could have power or heat collection units strung between the cables. The Dyson net reduces to a special case of Dyson shell or bubble, however, depending on how the cables are supported against the sun's gravity.

==== Bubbleworld ====
A bubbleworld is an artificial construct that consists of a shell of living space around a sphere of hydrogen gas. The shell contains air, people, houses, furniture, etc. The idea was conceived to answer the question, "What is the largest space colony that can be built?"&lt;ref name = "tuwyau"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#OTHER| title= Other Dyson Sphere-Like Concepts| work=Dyson Sphere FAQ| first=Anders| last= Sandberg| accessdate=2006-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the volume is not habitable and there is no power source.

Theoretically, any [[gas giant]] could be enclosed in a solid shell; at a certain radius the surface gravity would be terrestrial, and energy could be provided by tapping the thermal energy of the planet.&lt;ref name = "tuwyau"/&gt; This concept is explored peripherally in the novel ''[[Accelerando (book)|Accelerando]]'' (and the short story ''Curator'', which is incorporated into the novel as a chapter) by [[Charles Stross]], in which [[Saturn]] is converted into a human-habitable world.

==== Stellar engine ====
[[Stellar engine]]s are a class of hypothetical [[megastructure]]s whose purpose is to extract useful energy from a star, sometimes for specific purposes. For example, [[Matrioshka brain]]s extract energy for purposes of computation; [[Stellar engine#Class A (Shkadov thruster)|Shkadov thrusters]] extract energy for purposes of propulsion. Some of the proposed stellar engine designs are based on the Dyson sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/stellar_engine.html|title=Stellar engine|work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[black hole]] could be the power source instead of a star in order to increase the matter-to-energy conversion efficiency. A black hole would also be smaller than a star. This would decrease communication distances that would be important for computer-based societies as those described above.&lt;ref name = "tuwyau"/&gt;

== Search for megastructures ==
In Dyson's original paper, he speculated that sufficiently advanced extraterrestrial civilizations would likely follow a similar power-consumption pattern to that of humans, and would eventually build their own sphere of collectors. Constructing such a system would make such a civilization a Type II [[Kardashev scale|Kardashev civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolai Kardashev|Kardashev, Nikolai]]. "[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1985IAUS..112..497K On the Inevitability and the Possible Structures of Supercivilizations]", The search for extraterrestrial life: Recent developments; Proceedings of the Symposium, Boston, MA, June 18–21, 1984 (A86-38126 17–88). Dordrecht, D. Reidel Publishing Co., 1985, p. 497–504.&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of such a system of collectors would alter the light emitted from the star system. Collectors would absorb and reradiate energy from the star.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt; The wavelength(s) of radiation emitted by the collectors would be determined by the [[emission spectrum|emission spectra]] of the substances making them up, and the temperature of the collectors. Because it seems most likely that these collectors would be made up of heavy elements not normally found in the emission spectra of their central star—or at least not radiating light at such relatively "low" energies compared to what they would be emitting as energetic free nuclei in the [[stellar atmosphere]]—there would be atypical wavelengths of light for the star's [[spectral type]] in the light spectrum emitted by the star system. If the percentage of the star's output thus filtered or transformed by this absorption and reradiation was significant, it could be detected at interstellar distances.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;

Given the amount of energy available per square meter at a distance of 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from the [[Sun]], it is possible to calculate that most known substances would be reradiating energy in the [[infrared]] part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Thus, a Dyson sphere, constructed by life forms not dissimilar to humans, who dwelled in proximity to a [[Solar analog|Sun-like star]], made with materials similar to those available to humans, would most likely cause an increase in the amount of infrared radiation in the star system's emitted spectrum. Hence, Dyson selected the title "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation" for his published paper.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;

[[SETI]] has adopted these assumptions in their search, looking for such "infrared heavy" spectra from [[solar analog]]s. {{As of|2005}} [[Fermilab]] has an ongoing survey for such spectra by analyzing data from the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/infrared_astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| year=2006| accessdate=2006-03-02| first=D.| last=Carrigan| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306222359/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| archive-date=2006-03-06| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shostak |first=Seth |date=Spring 2009 |journal=Engineering &amp; Science |title=When Will We Find the Extraterrestrials? |volume=72 |number=1 |pages=12–21 |issn=0013-7812 |url=http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf &lt;!-- permalink to official source with abstract &amp; alternate PDF link: http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechES:72.1.Extraterrestrials --&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415115307/http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying one of the many infrared sources as a Dyson sphere would require improved techniques for discriminating between a Dyson sphere and natural sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dyson_sphere|title=''Dyson sphere'' at Scholarpedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermilab discovered 17 potential "ambiguous" candidates, of which four have been named "amusing but still questionable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| year=2012| accessdate=2012-01-15| first=D.| last=Carrigan| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306222359/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| archive-date=2006-03-06| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2016}} Other searches also resulted in several candidates, which are, however, unconfirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dick Carrigan |url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/infrared_astronomy/Other_searches.htm |title=Dyson Sphere Searches |publisher=Home.fnal.gov |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/alien-supercivilizations-absent-from-100-000-nearby-galaxies|title=Alien Supercivilizations Absent from 100,000 Nearby Galaxies|first=Lee|last=Billings|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="econ2015"&gt;{{Cite web

===Postulated sightings===
On 14 October 2015, the realization of a strange pattern of light from star [[KIC 8462852]], nicknamed "Tabby's Star" after [[Tabetha S. Boyajian]] — the lead researcher who discovered the irregular light fluctuation— captured by the [[Kepler Space Telescope]], raised speculation that a Dyson sphere may have been discovered.&lt;ref name="ATL-20151013"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Andersen| first1=Ross| title=The Most Mysterious Star in Our Galaxy| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/10/the-most-interesting-star-in-our-galaxy/410023/ |date=13 October 2015 |work=[[The Atlantic]]| accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IND-20151015"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Williams| first1=Lee| title=Astronomers may have found giant alien 'megastructures' orbiting star near the Milky Way| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/forget-water-on-mars-astronomers-may-have-just-found-giant-alien-megastructures-orbiting-a-star-near-a6693886.html |date=15 October 2015 |work=[[The Independent]]| accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2016, Boyajian gave a [[TED (Conference)|TED talk]] where she explained the story of how her research on the star quickly took a turn into the mysterious. However, she was skeptical and in the talk she reminded everyone that skepticism is the best policy whenever delving into alien territory. Her exact quote is as follows:

{{quote|Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and it is my job, my responsibility, as an astronomer to remind people that alien hypotheses should always be a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Mysterious Star in the Universe |url=https://www.ted.com/talks/tabetha_boyajian_the_most_mysterious_star_in_the_universe |date= February 2016 |work= [[TED (Conference)]] |accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wanting to understand the strange light pattern, [[Tabetha S. Boyajian]] put several hypotheses to the test. The first general assumption was an exoplanet [[Transit (astronomy)|transiting]] (eclipsing) its massive star, but the dips in light lasted between 5 and 80 days and were erratically spaced apart, thus ruling out any kind of an orbit for one celestial object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1509.03622 |last1=Boyajian |first1=T. S |title=Planet Hunters X. KIC 8462852 - Where's the Flux? |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=457 |issue=4 |pages=3988 |last2=LaCourse |first2=D.

A dust cloud was proposed but the star showed no signs of being young so a dust cloud was highly improbable. Lastly, a comet shower was hypothesized. However, as Boyajian pointed out in her TED talk this was also highly improbable. 
"It would take hundreds of comets to reproduce what we're observing. And these are only the comets that happen to pass between us and the star. And so in reality, we're talking thousands to tens of thousands of comets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Mysterious Star in the Universe |url=https://www.ted.com/talks/tabetha_boyajian_the_most_mysterious_star_in_the_universe/transcript#t-429568 |date= February 2016 |work= [[TED (Conference)]] |accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So after all the natural explanations turned up weak, her team decided to send off their research to SETI ([[Search for extraterrestrial life]]) to rule out alien structures. After reviewing the research, the [[SETI Institute]] was so intrigued that they decided to study the star themselves and pointed their [[Allen Telescope Array]] (ATA) at the star "with hopes of catching a tell-tale signal that might reveal a technological civilization."&lt;ref name='SETI 2017'&gt;{{cite web|title=What's Up with Tabby's Star? |url=https://www.seti.org/whats-up-with-tabby-star | date=23 May 2017 | work= [[Search for extraterrestrial life]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[SETI Institute]] mentioned that what caught their interest was that "the timing of the present dip (in light) suggests that whatever this material is, it is situated at just the right distance from the star to be in the [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]], where we believe life like ours could develop as it has on Earth."&lt;ref name='SETI 2017'/&gt;

Being skeptical as Boyajian was, she finally decided to take SETI's approach and allow herself to have a bit of fun in hypothesizing what the light pattern could have been. In her Ted Talk she joked: "Another idea that's one of my personal favorites is that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet. Now, I admit that this would produce a lot of dust that we don't observe. But if we're already invoking aliens in this explanation, then who is to say they didn't efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Mysterious Star in the Universe| url=https://www.ted.com/talks/tabetha_boyajian_the_most_mysterious_star_in_the_universe/transcript |date= February 2016|work= [[TED (Conference)]] |accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The search for answers to [[KIC 8462852]] is still ongoing.

On August 25, 2016, a similar phenomenon was reported for another stellar object: [[EPIC 204278916]],&lt;ref name='EPIC'&gt;{{cite journal|title=The peculiar dipping events in the disk-bearing young-stellar object EPIC 204278916|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=463|issue=2|pages=2265|arxiv=1608.07291|bibcode = 2016MNRAS.463.2265S |doi = 10.1093/mnras/stw2155 |year=2016|last1=Scaringi|first1=S|last2=Manara|first2=C.

Dimmings of up to 65% for 25 consecutive days (out of 79 total observation) were observed. The variability is highly periodic and attributed to stellar rotation.&lt;ref name='EPIC'/&gt; The researchers hypothesize that the irregular dimmings are caused by either a warped inner-disk edge or transiting cometary-like objects in either circular or eccentric orbits.&lt;ref name='EPIC'/&gt;

The '''engineering design process''' is a methodical series of steps that engineers use in creating functional products and processes. The process is highly [[iterative]] - parts of the process often need to be repeated many times before another can be entered - though the part(s) that get iterated and the number of such cycles in any given project may vary.

{{quote|…It is a [[decision making]] process (often iterative) in which the basic sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences are applied to convert resources optimally to meet a stated objective.  Among the fundamental elements of the [[design process]] are the establishment of objectives and criteria, synthesis, analysis, construction, testing and evaluation.|[[ABET]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.me.unlv.edu/Undergraduate/coursenotes/meg497/ABETdefinition.htm|title=ABET Definition of Design: "Engineering design is the process of devising a system, component, or process to meet desired needs|author=|date=|website=www.me.unlv.edu|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The steps tend to get articulated, subdivided, and/or illustrated in different ways, but they generally reflect certain core principles regarding the underlying concepts and their respective sequence and interrelationship.

==Common Stages of the Engineering Design Process==

One framing of the engineering design process delineates the following stages: ''research, conceptualization, feasibility assessment, establishing design requirements, preliminary design, detailed design, production planning and tool design, and production''.&lt;ref name="refB"&gt;Ertas, A. &amp; Jones, J. (1996). The Engineering Design Process. 2nd ed. New York, N.Y., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, noting that "different authors (in both research literature and in textbooks) define different phases of the design process with varying activities occurring within them," have suggested more simplified/generalized models - such as ''problem definition, conceptual design, preliminary design, detailed design, and design communication''.&lt;ref&gt;Dym, C.L. &amp; Little, P. (2009). Engineering Design. 3rd ed. New York, N.Y., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; A standard summary of the process in European engineering design literature is that of ''clarification of the task, conceptual design, embodiment design, detail design''.&lt;ref&gt;Pahl, G. &amp; Beitz, W. (1988). Engineering Design: a systematic approach. London, UK, The Design Council.&lt;/ref&gt; In these examples, other key aspects - such as concept evaluation and prototyping - are subsets and/or extensions of one or more of the listed steps. It's also important to understand that in these as well as other articulations of the process, different terminology employed may have varying degrees of overlap, which affects what steps get stated explicitly or deemed "high level" versus subordinate in any given model.

===Research===
Various stages of the design process (and even earlier) can involve a significant amount of time spent on locating information and [[research]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;A.Eide, R.Jenison, L.Mashaw, L.Northup. Engineering: Fundamentals and Problem Solving. New York City: McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.,2002&lt;/ref&gt; Consideration should be given to the existing applicable literature, problems and successes associated with existing solutions, costs, and marketplace needs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The source of information should be relevant, including existing solutions.  [[Reverse engineering]] can be an effective technique if other solutions are available on the market.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Other sources of information include the Internet, local [[libraries]], available government documents, personal organizations, [[trade journal]]s, vendor catalogs and individual [[experts]] available.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Design requirements===
Establishing design [[requirements]] and conducting [[requirement analysis]], sometimes termed '''problem definition''' (or deemed a related activity), is one of the most important elements in the design process,&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P., and Wand, Y. A Proposal for a Formal Definition of the Design Concept. In, Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., (eds.), Design Requirements Engineering: A Ten-Year Perspective: Springer-Verlag, 2009, pp. 103-136.&lt;/ref&gt; and this task is often performed at the same time as a feasibility analysis. The design requirements control the design of the product or process being developed, throughout the engineering design process. These include basic things like the functions, attributes, and [[specification]]s - determined after assessing user needs. Some design requirements include hardware and software parameters, [[maintainability]], [[availability]], and [[testability]].&lt;ref name="refB"/&gt;

===Feasibility===
In some cases, a [[feasibility study]] is carried out after which schedules, resource plans and estimates for the next phase are developed. The feasibility study is an evaluation and analysis of the potential of a proposed project to support the process of [[decision making]]. It outlines and analyses alternatives or methods of achieving the desired outcome. The feasibility study helps to narrow the scope of the project to identify the best scenario.
A feasibility report is generated following which Post Feasibility Review is performed.

The purpose of a feasibility assessment is to determine whether the engineer's project can proceed into the [[design phase]].  This is based on two criteria: the project needs to be based on an achievable idea, and it needs to be within [[cost accounting|cost constraint]]s. It is important to have engineers with experience and good judgment to be involved in this portion of the feasibility study.&lt;ref name="refB"/&gt;

===Conceptualization===
A concept study ([[conceptualization]], [[conceptual design]]) is often a phase of project planning that includes producing ideas and taking into account the pros and cons of implementing those ideas. This stage of a project is done to minimize the likelihood of error, manage costs, [[risk assessment|assess risks]], and evaluate the potential success of the intended project. In any event, once an engineering issue or problem is defined, potential solutions must be identified.  These solutions can be found by using [[Ideation (idea generation)|ideation]], the mental process by which ideas are generated. In fact, this step is often termed '''Ideation''' or "Concept Generation." The following are widely used techniques:&lt;ref name="refB"/&gt;

*trigger word - a word or phrase associated with the issue at hand is stated, and subsequent words and phrases are evoked.  
*[[morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]] - independent design characteristics are listed in a chart, and different engineering solutions are proposed for each solution.  Normally, a preliminary sketch and short report accompany the morphological chart.
*[[synectics]] - the engineer imagines him or herself as the item and asks, "What would I do if I were the system?"  This unconventional method of thinking may find a solution to the problem at hand. The vital aspects of the conceptualization step is synthesis. Synthesis is the process of taking the element of the concept and arranging them in the proper way. Synthesis creative process is present in every design.
*[[brainstorming]] - this popular method involves thinking of different ideas, typically as part of a small group, and adopting these ideas in some form as a solution to the problem

Various generated ideas must then undergo a '''concept evaluation''' step, which utilizes various tools to compare and contrast the relative strengths and weakness of possible alternatives.

===Preliminary design===
The preliminary design, or high-level design includes  (also called [[Front-end engineering|FEED]]), often bridges a gap between design conception and detailed design, particularly in cases where the level of conceptualization achieved during ideation is not sufficient for full evaluation. So in this task, the overall system configuration is defined, and [[schematic]]s, [[diagram]]s, and [[:wikt:layout|layout]]s of the project may provide early project configuration. (This notably varies a lot by field, industry, and product.) During detailed design and optimization, the parameters of the part being created will change, but the preliminary design focuses on creating the general framework to build the project on.&lt;ref name="refB"/&gt;

S. Blanchard and J. Fabrycky describe it as:
“The ‘whats’ initiating conceptual design produce ‘hows’ from the conceptual design evaluation effort applied to feasible conceptual design concepts. Next, the ‘hows’ are taken into preliminary design through the means of allocated requirements. There they become ‘whats’ and drive preliminary design to address ‘hows’ at this lower level.”

===Detailed design===
Following FEED is the Detailed Design (Detailed Engineering) phase, which may consist of [[procurement]] of materials as well.
This phase further elaborates each aspect of the project/product by complete description through [[solid modeling]], [[drawings]] as well as [[specification]]s.

===Design for manufacturability=== 
[[Design for manufacturability]] (DFM) is the general engineering art of designing products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture.

*Operating parameters
*Operating and nonoperating environmental stimuli
*Test requirements
*External dimensions
*Maintenance and testability provisions
*Materials requirements
*[[Reliability engineering|Reliability]] requirements
*External surface treatment
*Design life
*[[Packaging]] requirements
*External marking

[[Computer-aided design]] (CAD) programs have made detailed design phase more efficient.  For example, a CAD program can provide [[optimization]] to reduce volume without hindering a part's quality.  It can also calculate [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] and [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] using the [[finite element method]] to determine stresses throughout the part. &lt;ref name="refC"&gt;Widas, P. (1997, April 9). Introduction to finite element analysis. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/97ClassProj/num/widas/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514233218/http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/97ClassProj/num/widas/history.html |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production planning===
The [[production planning]] and tool design consists of planning how to [[mass-produce]] the product and which tools should be used in the [[manufacturing]] process.  Tasks to complete in this step include selecting materials, selection of the production processes, determination of the sequence of operations, and selection of tools such as jigs, fixtures, metal cutting and metal or plastics forming tools.  This task also involves additional [[prototype testing]] iterations to ensure the mass-produced version meets [[qualification testing]] standards.&lt;ref name="refB"/&gt;

==Comparison with the Scientific Method==
Engineering is formulating a problem that can be solved through design. Science is formulating a question that can be solved through investigation. 
The engineering design process bears some similarity to the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt; Braha, Dan; Maimon, Oded (1997). [http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/IEEE_TSMC_Design_Process.pdf The design process: properties, paradigms, and structure]. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Part A: Systems and Humans, 27(2), 146-166. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braha, Dan; Maimon, Oded (1998). A Mathematical Theory of Design: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications. Springer. [http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/CHAPTER2.pdf Chapter 2].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dieter |first1=George |last2=Schmidt |first2=Linda |date=2007 |title=Engineering Design |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=9 |isbn=978-0-07-283703-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both processes begin with existing knowledge, and gradually become more specific in the search for ''knowledge'' (in the case of "pure" or basic science) or a ''solution'' (in the case of "applied" science, such as engineering).  The key difference between the engineering process and the scientific process is that the engineering process focuses on [[design]], [[creativity]] and [[innovation]] while the scientific process emphasizes [[Discovery (observation)]].

[[File:Euphonia.London.Journal.1870.png|The Euphonia (''The London Journal,'' 1870)|thumb]]
The '''euphonia''' was a talking [[machine]] created in the early to mid-nineteenth century by the Austrian inventor Joseph Faber and exhibited in 1845 in Philadelphia and in 1846 in London. An earlier version of the invention had been destroyed in 1844 by Faber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes and Notices|periodical=Mechanics Magazine|date=July 27, 1844|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KY5fAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=faber+%22the+talking+machine%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4jIbfiOnLAhVCXh4KHcxjCLEQ6AEISTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=faber%20%22the%20talking%20machine%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mechanical device that he had reportedly spent over twenty-five years developing, Faber's "Fabulous Talking Machine", which would later be renamed the "euphonia", was constructed of several different mechanisms and instruments: a [[piano]], a [[bellows]], and a mechanical replica of the human throat and [[speech organ|vocal organ]]s. By pressing the keys on the keyboard, a human operator produced sounds that inflated the bellows, caused the mechanical mouth to open, the mechanical tongue to be lifted, and the mechanical jaws to move. Able to produce sentences in English, French, and German, the euphonia was reported by ''The London Journal'' to speak all three with a German accent, a fact attributed to the native language (German) of the inventor. Exhibited with a female mask covering the mechanical mouth, tongue, and jaw and at times with a dress hanging below the mask, the euphonia would perform for audiences, pretending to respond to or mimic the words of the keyboard operator. In describing the euphonia, the 19th century American scientist [[Joseph Henry]] explained "that sixteen levers or keys 'like those of a piano' projected sixteen elementary sounds by which 'every word in all European languages can be distinctly produced.' A seventeenth key opened and closed the equivalent of the glottis, an aperture between the vocal cords. 'The plan of the machine is the same as that of the human organs of speech, the several parts being worked by strings and levers instead of tendons and muscles.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Millikan, Frank Rives|title=Joseph Henry and the Telephone|work=Smithsonian Institution Archives|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/jhpp/JHP_Joseph_Henry_and_the_Telephone.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Funzing''' is an online [[sharing economy]] [[Online marketplace|marketplace]] that facilitates people to host and attend events and experiences in their leisure time based on their hobbies, passions or skills. Funzing was founded in Israel in 2014 by ''Avigur Zmora'', the former CEO of [[Playtech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Playtech CEO launches Funzing - Globes English|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-former-playtech-ceo-launches-funzing-1000965229|website=Globes|accessdate=9 March 2017|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funzing is currently active in [[London]], [[Manchester]], [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Real People Show Off Their Talents Through Events With Funzing|url=http://londonist.com/2015/05/real-people-show-off-their-talents-through-events-with-funzing|website=Londonist|accessdate=9 March 2017|date=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
According to co-founder ''Yaron Saghiv'', the idea about the online sharing economy came out of several friends’ frustration at being bored by going to the same places every time they wanted to spend quality free time in a social setting. Thus, they devised the platform which allows anyone with creative potential to showcase their skills to the world while entertaining others and earning some money along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company pays lady in S’pore S$1000 a month to organise an event every week, somehow this is good news {{!}} Mothership.SG|url=http://mothership.sg/2016/08/company-pays-lady-in-spore-s1000-a-month-to-organise-an-event-every-week-somehow-this-is-good-news/|website=mothership.sg|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SafeCharge Enables Payments for Innovative Marketplace Funzing|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/safecharge-enables-payments-for-innovative-marketplace-funzing-2017-03-02|website=MarketWatch|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SafeCharge enables payments for sharing economy marketplace Funzing|url=https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/68277/safecharge-enables-payments-for-sharing-economy-marketplace-funzing|website=Finextra Research|accessdate=9 March 2017|language=en|date=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SafeCharge Provides Payment Tech For Funzing {{!}} PYMNTS.com|url=http://www.pymnts.com/digital-payments/2017/safecharge-provides-payment-technology-for-innovative-marketplace-funzing/|website=www.pymnts.com|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Funzing was founded in Israel in 2014. It was the brainchild of Avigur Zmora, former CEO of [[Playtech]], who went on to set up the company together with Eran Alon, Noa Moscati and Yaron Saghiv.
The initial investment capital to start Funzing was raised from [[venture capital]] firm ''Inimiti'' and amounted to $1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innovation in Funding 2015-2016 competition entry: Funzing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/sep/01/innovation-in-funding-2015-2016-funzing|website=The Guardian|accessdate=9 March 2017|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, there are over 2,000 registered hosts on the Funzing system, and more than 35,000 individuals have attended events as of June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roue|first1=Lucy|title=Get creative as Funzing launches in Manchester|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/business/creative-funzing-launches-manchester-11414338|website=men|accessdate=9 March 2017|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gestell''''' (or sometimes '''''Ge-stell''''') is a [[German language|German]] word used by twentieth-century German [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Martin Heidegger]] to describe what lies behind or beneath modern [[technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

It was derived from the root word ''stellen'', which means "to put" or "to place" and combined with the German prefix ''Ge-'', which denotes a form of "gathering" or "collection".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger on Technology|last=Wendland|first=Aaron|last2=Merwin|first2=Christopher|last3=Hadjioannou|first3=Christos|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781138674615|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term gathers together all kinds of entities and orders them in a certain way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Heidegger's notion of ''Gestell''==
Heidegger applied the concept of ''Gestell'' to his exposition of the [[essence]] of [[technology]]. He concluded that technology is fundamentally '''Enframing''' (''Gestell'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

As such, the essence of technology is ''Gestell''. Indeed, "''Gestell'', literally 'framing', is an all-encompassing view of technology, not as a means to an end, but rather a mode of [[human]] [[existence]]".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/martin1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110153844/http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/martin1.html |archivedate=2006-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such enframing pertains to the manner reality appears or unveils itself in the period of modern technology and people born into this "mode of ordering" are always embedded into the Gestell (enframing).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gendered Bodies and New Technologies: Rethinking Embodiment in a Cyber-era|last=du Preez|first=Amanda|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9781443813235|location=Newcastle upon Tyne, UK|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In defining the essence of technology as ''Gestell'', Heidegger indicated that all that has come to presence in the world has been enframed. Thus what is revealed in the world, what has shown itself as itself (the truth of itself) required first an Enframing, literally a way to exist in the world, to be able to be seen and understood. Concerning the essence of technology and how we see things in our technological age, the world has been framed as the "standing-reserve." Heidegger writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Enframing means the gathering together of that setting-upon which sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve. Enframing means that way of revealing which holds sway in the essence of modern technology and which is itself nothing technological.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays'' (New York: Harper, 1977), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, Heidegger uses the word in a way that is uncommon by giving ''Gestell'' an active role. In ordinary usage the word would signify simply a display apparatus of some sort, like a book rack, or picture frame; but for Heidegger, ''Gestell'' is literally a challenging forth, or ''perform''ative "gathering together", for the purpose of revealing or presentation. If applied to science and modern technology, "standing reserve" is active in the case of a river once it generates electricity or the earth if revealed as a coal-mining district or the soil as a mineral deposit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger and the Work of Art History|last=Boetzkes|first=Amanda|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409456131|location=Oxon|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For some scholars, Gestell effectively explains the violence of technology. This is attributed to Heidegger's explanation that, when Gestell holds sway, "it drives out every other possibility of revealing" and that it "conceals that revealing which, in the sense of ''[[poiesis]]'', lets what presences come forth into appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger's Later Philosophy|last=Young|first=Julian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521809223|location=Cambridge|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, [[Hong Kong]] and the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yupnet.org/boyle/archives/85 |title=Chapter 4: The Internet Threat |work=The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind |first=James |last=Boyle}}&lt;/ref&gt; a '''green paper''' is a tentative government report and consultation document of [[policy]] proposals for debate and discussion. A green paper represents the best that the government can propose on the given issue, but, remaining uncommitted, it is able without loss of face to leave its final decision open until it has been able to consider the public reaction to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/82326.stm |title=Green Paper |publisher=BBC News | date=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green papers may result in the production of a [[white paper]]. They may be considered as [[grey literature]].

==Canada==
A green paper in [[Canada]], like a white paper, is an official government document. Green papers tend to be statements not of policy already determined, but of propositions put before the whole nation for discussion. They are produced early in the policy-making process, while ministerial proposals are still being formulated. Many white papers in Canada have been, in effect, green papers, while at least one green paper—that on immigration and population in 1975—was released for public debate after the government had already drafted [[legislation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/green-paper |title=Green Paper |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
Similarly, in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], green papers are official consultation documents produced by the government for discussion both inside and outside [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], for instance when a government department is considering introducing a new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/green-papers/ |title=Green Papers |publisher=The UK Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/careandsupportreform/what-green-paper|title=What is a Green Paper?|date=2009-06-18|website=The Guardian|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==
A green paper released by the [[European Commission]] is a discussion document intended to stimulate debate and launch a process of consultation, at European level, on a particular topic. A green paper usually presents a range of ideas and is meant to invite interested individuals or organizations to contribute views and information. It may be followed by a white paper, an official set of proposals that is used as a vehicle for their development into law.

==Examples==
===Discussion of defence policy in Australia, 2000===
A major review of [[defence policy]] in [[Australia]] culminated in a white paper issued in December 2000. Prior to this, a discussion paper was released in June 2000. This discussion paper was in nature what is known as a green paper (and was sometimes referred to as such).

===Copyright in the knowledge economy, 2008===
The purpose of the 2008 EU green paper on [[copyright]] was to foster a debate on how knowledge for research, science and education can best be disseminated in the online environment. The green paper, which was published on 16 July 2008, aimed to set out a number of issues connected with the role of copyright in the "[[knowledge economy]]" and intended to launch a consultation on these issues (see [http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/copyright-infso/greenpaper_en.pdf this document]). The EU asked for answers and comments to be submitted up to 30 November 2008.

The '''history of science and technology''' ('''HST''') is a field of [[history]] which examines how humanity's understanding of the natural world (science) and ability to manipulate it ([[technology]]) have changed over the centuries.  This academic discipline also studies the cultural, economic, and political impacts of scientific innovation.

[[Historiography of science|Histories of science]] were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, starting primarily with [[William Whewell]], as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public. In the early 1930s, after a famous paper given by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] historian [[Boris Hessen]], was focused into looking at the ways in which scientific practices were allied with the needs and motivations of their context. After [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline, with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world. In the 1960s, especially in the wake of the work done by [[Thomas Kuhn]], the discipline began to serve a very different function, and began to be used as a way to critically examine the scientific enterprise. At the present time it is often closely aligned with the field of [[science studies]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Modern engineering as it is understood today took form during the [[scientific revolution]], though much of the mathematics and science was built on the work of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Mesopotamia]]ns, [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese]], [[Science and technology in ancient India|Indians]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} See the main articles [[History of science]] and [[History of technology]] for these respective topics.

=== United States ===
Academic study of the History of Science as an independent discipline was launched by [[George Sarton]] at Harvard with his book ''Introduction to the History of Science'' (1927) and the [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'' journal]] (founded in 1912).  Sarton exemplified the early 20th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The History of Science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested Scientists and Physicians rather than professional Historians.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Reingold, "History of Science Today, 1. Uniformity as Hidden Diversity: History of Science in the United States, 1920-1940," ''British Journal for the History of Science'' 1986 19(3): 243-262&lt;/ref&gt;  With the work of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] at Harvard, the history of Science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Dauben | first1= JW | last2= Gleason | first2= ML | last3= Smith | first3= GE | title= Seven decades of history of science: I.

[[File:Ur_chariot.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[wheel]], invented sometime before the 4th millennium BC, is one of the most ubiquitous and important technologies. This detail of the "Standard of Ur", c. 2500 BC., displays a Sumerian [[chariot]]]]

The '''history of technology''' is the history of the [[invention]] of [[tool]]s and techniques and is one of the categories of the [[Human history|history of humanity]]. Technology can refer to methods ranging from as simple as [[stone tools]] to the complex [[genetic engineering]] and [[information technology]] that has emerged since the 1980s. The term technology comes from the Greek word techne, meaning art and craft, and the word logos, meaning word and speech. It was first used to describe applied arts, but it is now used to described advancements and changes which affect the environment around us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/history-of-technology|title=history of technology – Summary &amp; Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New knowledge has enabled people to create new things, and conversely, many scientific endeavors are made possible by [[technologies]] which assist humans in [[travel|traveling]] to places they could not previously reach, and by [[scientific instrument]]s by which we study nature in more detail than our natural senses allow.

Since much of technology is [[applied science]], technical history is connected to the [[history of science]]. Since technology uses [[resource]]s, technical history is tightly connected to [[economic history]]. From those [[Resource (Windows)|resources]], technology produces other resources, including ''technological artifacts'' used in [[everyday life]].

[[Technological change]] affects and is affected by, a society's cultural [[tradition]]s. It is a force for [[economic growth]] and a means to develop and project economic, political, military power and wealth.

== Measuring technological progress ==
{{More citations needed section|date=August 2018}}
Many [[sociology|sociologists]] and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] have created [[social theory|social theories]] dealing with [[social evolution|social]] and [[cultural evolution]]. Some, like [[Lewis H. Morgan]], [[Leslie White]], and [[Gerhard Lenski]] have declared [[technological progress]] to be the primary factor driving the development of human civilization. Morgan's concept of three major stages of social evolution (savagery, [[Primitive culture|barbarism]], and [[civilization]]) can be divided by technological milestones, such as [[fire]]. White argued the measure by which to judge the evolution of culture was [[energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Elliot|last2=Smith|first2=Karen|title=American Materialism|url=http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=American%20Materialism|website=The University of Alabama – Department of Anthropology|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For White, "the primary function of [[culture]]" is to "harness and control energy." White differentiates between five stages of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]]: In the first, people use the energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use the energy of [[domestication of animals|domesticated animals]]. In the third, they use the energy of plants ([[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]]). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of [[natural resource]]s: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. White introduced a formula P=E*T, where E is a measure of energy consumed, and T is the measure of the efficiency of technical factors using the energy. In his own words, "culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased". [[Nikolai Kardashev]] extrapolated his theory, creating the [[Kardashev scale]], which categorizes the energy use of advanced civilizations.

Lenski's approach focuses on [[information]]. The more information and knowledge (especially allowing the shaping of [[natural environment]]) a given society has, the more advanced it is. He identifies four stages of human development, based on advances in the [[history of communication]]. In the first stage, information is passed by [[gene]]s. In the second, when humans gain [[sentience]], they can [[learn]] and pass information through experience. In the third, the humans start using signs and develop [[logic]]. In the fourth, they can create [[symbol]]s, develop [[language]] and [[writing]]. Advancements in [[communications technology]] translate into advancements in the [[economic system]] and [[political system]], [[distribution of wealth]], [[social inequality]] and other spheres of social life. He also differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication, and economy:
* [[hunter-gatherer]],
* simple [[Agriculture|agricultural]],
* advanced agricultural,
* [[Industry|industrial]],
* special (such as fishing societies).

In economics, [[productivity]] is a measure of technological progress. Productivity increases when fewer inputs (classically labor and capital but some measures include energy and materials) are used in the production of a unit of output. Another indicator of technological progress is the development of new products and services, which is necessary to offset unemployment that would otherwise result as labor inputs are reduced. In developed countries productivity growth has been slowing since the late 1970s; however, productivity growth was higher in some economic sectors, such as manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Way It Worked and Why It Won't: Structural Change and the Slowdown of U.S. Economic Growth |last=Bjork |first= Gordon J.|authorlink= |year= 1999|publisher =Praeger|location= Westport, CT; London|isbn=978-0275965327 |pages=2, 67| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, employment in [[manufacturing in the United States]] declined from over 30% in the 1940s to just over 10% 70 years later. Similar changes occurred in other developed countries. This stage is referred to as ''post-industrial''.

In the late 1970s sociologists and anthropologists like [[Alvin Toffler]] (author of ''[[Future Shock]]''), [[Daniel Bell]] and [[John Naisbitt]] have approached the theories of [[post-industrial society|post-industrial societies]], arguing that the current era of [[industrial society]] is coming to an end, and [[Service (economics)|services]] and information are becoming more important than [[industry]] and [[good (economics)|goods]]. Some extreme visions of the post-industrial society, especially in [[Fictional technology|fiction]], are strikingly similar to the visions of near and post-[[Technological singularity|Singularity]] societies.

==== Stone Age ====
{{Main|Stone Age}}
[[File:Prehistoric Tools - Les Combarelles - Les Eyzies de Tayac - MNP.jpg|thumb|left|A variety of [[stone tool]]s]]
During most of the '''[[Paleolithic]]''' – the bulk of the Stone Age – all humans had a lifestyle which involved limited tools and few permanent settlements. The first major technologies were tied to survival, hunting, and food preparation. [[Stone tools]] and weapons, [[control of fire by early humans|fire]], and [[History of clothing and textiles|clothing]] were technological developments of major importance during this period.

Human ancestors have been using stone and other tools since long before the emergence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' approximately 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501000000*/http://anthropology.si.edu/humanorigins/ha/sap.htm | title=Human Ancestors Hall: Homo sapiens | accessdate=8 December 2007 | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest methods of [[stone tool]] making, known as the [[Oldowan]] "industry", date back to at least 2.3 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/336555.stm | title=Ancient 'tool factory' uncovered | accessdate=18 February 2007 | publisher=BBC News | date=6 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the earliest direct evidence of tool usage found in [[Ethiopia]] within the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]], dating back to 2.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Environment and Behavior of 2.5-Million-Year-Old Bouri Hominids | last=Heinzelin | first=Jean de | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=April 1999 | volume=284 | issue=5414 | pages=625–629 | doi= 10.1126/science.284.5414.625 | pmid=10213682 | last2=Clark | first2=JD | last3=White | first3=T | last4=Hart | first4=W | last5=Renne | first5=P | last6=Woldegabriel | first6=G | last7=Beyene | first7=Y | last8=Vrba | first8=E}}&lt;/ref&gt; This era of stone tool use is called the ''[[Paleolithic]]'', or "Old stone age", and spans all of human history up to the development of [[agriculture]] approximately 12,000 years ago.

To make a stone tool, a "[[lithic core|core]]" of hard stone with specific flaking properties (such as [[flint]]) was struck with a [[hammerstone]]. This flaking produced sharp edges which could be used as tools, primarily in the form of [[chopper (archaeology)|choppers]] or [[scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]].&lt;ref name="ea_archaeology"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=17 May 2008|url=http://ea.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0019880-04|title=Archaeology|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Americana]]|author=Burke, Ariane |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20080521022936/http://ea.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0019880-04 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tools greatly aided the early humans in their [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle to perform a variety of tasks including [[butcher]]ing carcasses (and breaking bones to get at the [[Bone marrow|marrow]]); chopping wood; cracking open nuts; skinning an animal for its [[Hide (skin)|hide]], and even forming other tools out of softer materials such as bone and wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Flaked Stones and Old Bones: Biological and Cultural Evolution at the Dawn of Technology|author= Plummer, Thomas|publisher=[[Yearbook of Physical Anthropology]]|year=2004|issue=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest stone tools were irrelevant, being little more than a fractured rock. In the [[Acheulian]] era, beginning approximately 1.65 million years ago, methods of working these stone into specific shapes, such as [[hand axe]]s emerged. This early Stone Age is described as the [[Lower Paleolithic]].

The [[Middle Paleolithic]], approximately 300,000 years ago, saw the introduction of the [[prepared-core technique]], where multiple blades could be rapidly formed from a single core stone.&lt;ref name="ea_archaeology" /&gt; The [[Upper Paleolithic]], beginning approximately 40,000 years ago, saw the introduction of [[pressure flaking]], where a wood, bone, or antler [[punch (engineering)|punch]] could be used to shape a stone very finely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge|author= Haviland, William A.|publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0534624873|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the last Ice Age about 10,000 years ago is taken as the end point of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] and the beginning of the [[Epipaleolithic]] / [[Mesolithic]]. The Mesolithic technology included the use of [[microliths]] as composite stone tools, along with wood, bone, and antler tools.

The later Stone Age, during which the rudiments of agricultural technology were developed, is called the [[Neolithic]] period. During this period, polished [[stone tool]]s were made from a variety of hard rocks such as [[flint]], [[jade]], [[jadeite]], and [[Greenschist|greenstone]], largely by working exposures as quarries, but later the valuable rocks were pursued by tunneling underground, the first steps in mining technology. The polished axes were used for forest clearance and the establishment of crop farming and were so effective as to remain in use when bronze and iron appeared. These stone axes were used alongside a continued use of stone tools such as a range of [[Projectile point|projectiles]], knives, and [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], as well as tools, made organic materials such as wood, bone, and antler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Zsuzsanna|last1=Tóth | editor1-first=Alexandra |editor1-last=Anders | editor2-first=Zsuzsanna |editor2-last=Siklósi | year=2012 | title=Bone, Antler, and Tusk tools of the Early Neolithic Körös Culture | contribution=The First Neolithic Sites in Central/South-East European Transect, Volume III: The Körös Culture in Eastern Hungary | page= | location=Oxford | publisher=BAR International Series 2334 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone Age cultures developed [[Prehistoric music|music]] and engaged in organized [[Prehistoric warfare|warfare]]. Stone Age humans developed ocean-worthy [[outrigger canoe]] technology, leading to [[History of Papua New Guinea|migration]] across the [[Malay archipelago]], across the Indian Ocean to [[Madagascar]] and also across the Pacific Ocean, which required knowledge of the ocean currents, weather patterns, sailing, and [[celestial navigation]].

Although Paleolithic cultures left no written records, the shift from nomadic life to settlement and agriculture can be inferred from a range of archaeological evidence. Such evidence includes ancient tools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lovgren|first1=Stefan|title=Ancient Tools Unearthed in Siberian Arctic|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/01/0114_040114_siberianhumans.html|website=National Geographic News|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cave painting]]s, and other [[prehistoric art]], such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]]. Human remains also provide direct evidence, both through the examination of bones, and the study of [[mummy|mummies]]. Scientists and historians have been able to form significant inferences about the lifestyle and culture of various prehistoric peoples, and especially their technology.

=== Ancient ===
{{Main|Ancient technology}}

==== Copper and bronze Ages ====
{{Main|Bronze Age}}

[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|upright|A late [[Bronze Age sword]] or dagger blade]]

Metallic copper occurs on the surface of weathered copper ore deposits and copper was used before copper [[smelting]] was known.  Copper smelting is believed to have originated when the technology of pottery [[kiln]]s allowed sufficiently high temperatures.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;  The concentration of various elements such as arsenic increase with depth in copper ore deposits and smelting of these ores yields [[arsenical bronze]], which can be sufficiently work hardened to be suitable for making tools.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;  [[Bronze]] is an alloy of copper with tin; the latter being found in relatively few deposits globally caused a long time to elapse before true tin bronze to became widespread. (See: [[Tin sources and trade in ancient times]]) [[Bronze]] was a major advance over stone as a material for making tools, both because of its mechanical properties like strength and ductility and because it could be cast in molds to make intricately shaped objects.  

Bronze significantly advanced shipbuilding technology with better tools and bronze nails.  Bronze nails replaced the old method of attaching boards of the hull with cord woven through drilled holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World |last=Paine |first= Lincoln |year= 2013 |publisher =Random House, LLC|location= New York|isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Better ships enabled long distance trade and the advance of civilization. 
   
This technological trend apparently began in the [[Fertile Crescent]] and spread outward over time. These developments were not, and still are not, universal. The [[three-age system]] does not accurately describe the technology history of groups outside of [[Eurasia]], and does not apply at all in the case of some isolated populations, such as the [[Spinifex People]], the [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]], and various Amazonian tribes, which still make use of Stone Age technology, and have not developed agricultural or metal technology.

==== Iron Age ====
{{Main|Iron Age}}
[[File:Axe of iron from Swedish Iron Age, found at Gotland, Sweden.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|An [[axe]]head made of iron, dating from the Swedish [[Iron Age]]]]
Before iron smelting was developed the only iron was obtained from meteorites and is usually identified by having nickel content.  [[Meteoric iron]] was rare and valuable, but was sometimes used to make tools and other implements, such as fish hooks.

The '''[[Iron age]]''' involved the adoption of iron [[bloomery|smelting]] technology. It generally replaced bronze and made it possible to produce tools which were stronger, lighter and cheaper to make than bronze equivalents. The raw materials to make iron, such as ore and limestone, are far more abundant than copper and especially tin ores. Consequently, iron was produced in many areas. 

It was not possible to mass manufacture steel or pure iron because of the high temperatures required.  Furnaces could reach melting temperature but the crucibles and molds needed for melting and casting had not been developed.  [[Steel]] could be produced by [[forging]] bloomery iron to reduce the carbon content in a somewhat controllable way, but steel produced by this method was not homogeneous.

In many Eurasian cultures, the Iron Age was the last major step before the development of written language, though again this was not universally the case.

In Europe, large [[hill fort]]s were built either as a refuge in time of war or sometimes as permanent settlements. In some cases, existing forts from the Bronze Age were expanded and enlarged. The pace of land clearance using the more effective iron axes increased, providing more farmland to support the growing population.

==== Egyptians ====
The [[Egyptians]] invented and used many simple machines, such as the [[inclined plane|ramp]] to aid construction processes. Egyptian society made significant advances during dynastic periods in areas such as astronomy, mathematics, and medicine. They also made paper and monuments. The Egyptians made significant advances in shipbuilding. Astronomy was used by Egyptian leaders to govern people.

==== Indus Valley ====
The [[Indus Valley Civilization]], situated in a resource-rich area, is notable for its early application of city planning and sanitation technologies. Indus Valley construction and architecture, called '[[Vaastu Shastra]]', suggests a thorough understanding of materials engineering, hydrology, and sanitation.

==== Mesopotamians ====
The peoples of [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkad (region)|Akkadians]], [[Assyria]]ns, and [[Babylonia]]ns) have been credited with the invention of the [[wheel]], but this is no longer certain. They lived in cities from c. 4000&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref&gt;JN Postgate, ''Early Mesopotamia'', Routledge (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and developed a sophisticated architecture in mud-brick and stone,&lt;ref&gt;See entries under [[Nineveh]] and [[Babylon]]&lt;/ref&gt; including the use of the true arch. The walls of Babylon were so massive they were quoted as a [[Wonder of the World]]. They developed extensive water systems; canals for transport and irrigation in the alluvial south, and catchment systems stretching for tens of kilometers in the hilly north. Their palaces had sophisticated drainage systems.&lt;ref name=Dalley2013&gt;S Dalley, ''The Mystery of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon'', Oxford University Press(2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing was invented in Mesopotamia, using the [[cuneiform]] script. Many records on clay tablets and stone inscriptions have survived. These civilizations were early adopters of bronze technologies which they used for tools, weapons and monumental statuary. By 1200&amp;nbsp;BC they could cast objects 5 m long in a single piece. The Assyrian King [[Sennacherib]] (704–681&amp;nbsp;BC) claims to have invented automatic sluices and to have been the first to use water screws, of up to 30 tons weight, which were cast using two-part clay molds rather than by the 'lost wax' process.&lt;ref name=Dalley2013/&gt; The Jerwan Aqueduct (c. 688&amp;nbsp;BC) is made with stone arches and lined with waterproof concrete.&lt;ref&gt;T Jacobsen and S Lloyd, ''Sennacherib's Aqueduct at Jerwan'', Chicago University Press, (1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]] spanned 800 years. They enabled meticulous astronomers to plot the motions of the planets and to predict eclipses.&lt;ref&gt;CBF Walker, ''Astronomy before the telescope,'' British Museum Press, (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chinese ====
The Chinese made many first-known discoveries and developments. Major technological contributions from China include early [[Seismometer|seismological detectors]], matches, [[paper]], sliding calipers, the double-action piston pump, [[cast iron]], the iron plough, the multi-tube [[seed drill]], the wheelbarrow, the [[suspension bridge]], the parachute, natural gas as fuel, the [[compass]], the [[raised-relief map]], the propeller, the [[crossbow]], the [[South Pointing Chariot]] and [[gunpowder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention |last1=Temple|first1= Robert|coauthors= Joseph Needham|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York |isbn= |pages=| postscript = &lt;Based on the works of Joseph Needham&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Chinese discoveries and inventions from the Medieval period include [[block printing]], [[movable type|movable type printing]], phosphorescent paint, endless power [[chain drive]] and the clock escapement mechanism. The solid-fuel [[rocket]] was invented in China about 1150, nearly 200 years after the invention of [[gunpowder]] (which acted as the rocket's fuel). Decades before the West's age of exploration, the Chinese emperors of the [[Ming Dynasty]] also sent [[Treasure voyages|large fleets]] on maritime voyages, some reaching Africa.

==== Greek ====
[[File:Aeolipile illustration.png|thumb|upright|An illustration of the [[aeolipile]], the earliest steam-powered device]]

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] engineers [[Ancient Greek technology|were responsible for myriad inventions and improvements to existing technology]]. The [[Hellenistic period]], in particular, saw a sharp increase in technological advancement, fostered by a climate of openness to new ideas, the blossoming of a mechanistic philosophy, and the establishment of the [[Library of Alexandria]] and its close association with the adjacent [[museion]]. In contrast to the typically anonymous inventors of earlier ages, ingenious minds such as [[Archimedes]], [[Philo of Byzantium]], [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]], [[Ctesibius]], and [[Archytas]] remain known by name to posterity.

Ancient Greek innovations were particularly pronounced in mechanical technology, including the ground-breaking invention of the [[watermill]] which constituted the first human-devised motive force not to rely on muscle power (besides the [[sail]]). Apart from their pioneering use of waterpower, Greek inventors were also the first to experiment with wind power (see [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]]'s windwheel) and even created the earliest steam engine (the [[aeolipile]]), opening up entirely new possibilities in harnessing natural forces whose full potential would not be exploited until the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The newly devised right-angled [[gear]] and [[screw]] would become particularly important to the operation of mechanical devices. That is when the age of mechanical devices started.

[[File:Overshot water wheel schematic.svg|thumb|left|The compartmented water-wheel, here its overshot version, was invented in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic times]].]]

Ancient agriculture, as in any period prior to the modern age the primary mode of production and subsistence, and its irrigation methods, were considerably advanced by the invention and widespread application of a number of previously unknown water-lifting devices, such as the vertical [[water-wheel]], the compartmented wheel, the water [[turbine]], [[Archimedes' screw]], the bucket-chain and pot-garland, the [[force pump]], the [[suction pump]], the double-action [[piston pump]] and quite possibly the [[chain pump]].&lt;ref name="Lewis 2000 356f."&gt;{{Cite book

In music, the [[water organ]], invented by Ctesibius and subsequently improved, constituted the earliest instance of a [[keyboard instrument]]. In time-keeping, the introduction of the inflow [[Water clock|clepsydra]] and its mechanization by the dial and pointer, the application of a [[feedback|feedback system]] and the [[escapement]] mechanism far superseded the earlier outflow clepsydra.

The famous [[Antikythera mechanism]], a kind of analogous computer working with a [[differential gear]], and the [[astrolabe]] both show great refinement in astronomical science.

Greek engineers were also the first to devise [[automata]] such as [[vending machine]]s, suspended ink pots, automatic [[washstand]]s, and doors, primarily as toys, which however featured many new useful mechanisms such as the [[cam]] and [[gimbal]]s.

In other fields, ancient Greek inventions include the [[catapult]] and the [[gastraphetes]] crossbow in warfare, hollow bronze-casting in metallurgy, the [[dioptra]] for surveying, in infrastructure the [[lighthouse]], [[central heating]], the [[Tunnel of Eupalinos|tunnel excavated from both ends by scientific calculations]], the [[Diolkos|ship trackway]], the [[dry dock]], and plumbing. In horizontal, vertical and transport, great progress resulted from the invention of the [[crane (machine)|crane]], the [[winch]], the [[wheelbarrow]] and the [[odometer]].

Further newly created techniques and items were [[List of ancient spiral stairs|spiral staircases]], the [[chain drive]], [[caliper|sliding calipers]] and [[shower]]s.

==== Roman ====
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]] in France, a Roman aqueduct]]

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] developed an intensive and sophisticated agriculture, expanded upon existing iron working technology, created [[Roman law|laws]] providing for individual ownership, advanced stone masonry technology, advanced [[Roman road|road-building]] (exceeded only in the 19th century), military engineering, civil engineering, spinning and weaving and several different machines like the [[reaper|Gallic reaper]] that helped to increase productivity in many sectors of the Roman economy. Roman engineers were the first to build monumental arches, [[List of Roman amphitheatres|amphitheatres]], [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[Thermae|public baths]], [[Roman bridge|true arch bridges]], [[harbour]]s, [[reservoir]]s and [[dam]]s, vaults and domes on a very large scale across their Empire. Notable Roman inventions include the [[Codex|book (Codex)]], [[glass blowing]] and [[concrete]]. Because Rome was located on a volcanic peninsula, with sand which contained suitable crystalline grains, the [[concrete]] which the Romans formulated was especially durable. Some of their buildings have lasted 2000 years, to the present day.

==== Inca, Maya, and Aztec ====
The engineering skills of the [[Inca]] and the [[Mayans]] were great, even by today's standards. An example of this great engineering is the use of pieces weighing upwards of one ton in their stonework placed together so that not even a blade can fit into the cracks. Inca villages used irrigation canals and [[drainage]] systems, making agriculture very efficient. While some claim that the Incas were the first inventors of [[hydroponics]], their agricultural technology was still soil based, if advanced.

Though the [[Maya civilization]] did not incorporate metallurgy or wheel technology in their architectural constructions, they developed complex writing and astronomical systems, and created beautiful sculptural works in stone and flint. Like the Inca, the Maya also had command of fairly advanced agricultural and construction technology. The Maya are also responsible for creating the first pressurized water system in Mesoamerica, located in the Maya site of [[Palenque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amp.livescience.com/5959-ancient-mayans-fountains-toilets.html|title=Ancient Mayans Likely Had Fountains and Toilets|date=December 23, 2009|work=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main contribution of the [[Aztec]] rule was a system of communications between the conquered cities and the ubiquity of the ingenious agricultural technology of [[chinampas]]. In [[Mesoamerica]], without draft animals for transport (nor, as a result, wheeled vehicles), the roads were designed for travel on foot, just as in the Inca and Mayan civilizations. The Aztec, subsequently to the Maya, inhereted many of the technologies and intellectual advancements of their predecessors: the [[Olmec]] (see [[Native American inventions and innovations]]).

=== Medieval to early modern ===
One of the most significant development of the Medieval era was the development of economies where water and wind power were more significant than animal and human muscle power.&lt;ref name="Stark_2005"&gt;{{cite book|title= The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism and Western Success|last= Stark|first= Rodney |year= 2005 |publisher =Random House Trade Paperbacks|location= New York |isbn=0-8129-7233-3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}} Most water and wind power was used for milling grain.  Water power was also used for blowing air in [[blast furnace]], pulping rags for paper making and for felting wool.  The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' recorded 5,624 water mills in Great Britain in 1086, being about one per thirty families.&lt;ref name="Stark_2005"/&gt;

As earlier empires had done, the Muslim [[caliphate]]s united in trade large areas that had previously traded little. The conquered sometimes paid lower taxes than in their earlier independence, and ideas spread even more easily than goods. Peace was more frequent than it had been. These conditions fostered improvements in agriculture and other technology as well as in sciences which largely adapted from earlier Greek, Roman and Persian empires, with improvements.

==== Medieval Europe ====

[[File:Trebuchet.jpg|thumb|Medieval [[trebuchet|counterweight trebuchet]] (reconstruction)]]

{{Main|Medieval technology}}

European technology in the [[Middle Ages]] was a mixture of tradition and innovation. While medieval technology has been long depicted as a step backwards in the evolution of Western technology, sometimes willfully so by modern authors intent on denouncing the church as antagonistic to scientific progress (see e.g. [[Myth of the Flat Earth]]), a generation of medievalists around the American historian of science [[Lynn White]] stressed from the 1940s onwards the innovative character of many medieval techniques. Genuine medieval contributions include for example [[mechanical clock]]s, [[spectacles]] and vertical [[windmill]]s. Medieval ingenuity was also displayed in the invention of seemingly inconspicuous items like the [[watermark]] or the [[push button|functional button]]. In navigation, the foundation to the subsequent [[age of exploration]] was laid by the introduction of pintle-and-gudgeon [[rudder]]s, [[lateen sail]]s, the [[dry compass]], the horseshoe and the [[astrolabe]].

Significant advances were also made in military technology with the development of [[plate armour]], steel [[crossbow]]s, [[trebuchet|counterweight trebuchets]] and [[cannon]]. The Middle Ages are perhaps best known for their architectural heritage: While the invention of the [[rib vault]] and [[arch|pointed arch]] gave rise to the high rising [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]], the ubiquitous medieval fortifications gave the era the almost proverbial title of the 'age of castles'.

[[Papermaking]], a 2nd-century Chinese technology, was carried to the Middle East when a group of Chinese papermakers were captured in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Timeline: 8th century|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191735516.timeline.0001|website=Oxford reference|publisher=HistoryWorld|accessdate=9 April 2015|doi=10.1093/acref/9780191735516.timeline.0001|doi-broken-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papermaking technology was spread to Europe by the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Safita|first1=Neathery|title=A Brief History Of Paper.|url=http://users.stlcc.edu/nfuller/paper/|accessdate=9 April 2015|date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper mill was established in Sicily in the 12th century. In Europe the fiber to make pulp for making paper was obtained from linen and cotton rags. [[Lynn Townsend White Jr.]] credited the spinning wheel with increasing the supply of rags, which led to cheap paper, which was a factor in the development of printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==== Renaissance technology ====
{{Main|Renaissance technology}}
[[File:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|left|A water-powered [[mine hoist]] used for raising ore, ca. 1556]]
Before the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as [[millwright]]s, clock makers, instrument makers and surveyors.  Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining and chemistry.  ''De re metallica'' was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;

Due to the casting of cannon, the [[blast furnace]] came into widespread use in France in the mid 15th century.  The blast furnace had been used in China since the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World|last1=Merson |first1= John|year= 1990|publisher = The Overlook Press|location=Woodstock, NY |isbn= 978-0879513979|page=69| postscript = A companion to the PBS Series “The Genius That Was China”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the movable cast metal type [[printing press]], whose pressing mechanism was adapted from an olive screw press, (c. 1441) lead to a tremendous increase in the number of books and the number of titles published.  Movable ceramic type had been used in China for a few centuries and woodblock printing dated back even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention |last1=Temple|first1= Robert|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York |isbn= |pages=}}Based on the works of Joseph Needham&lt;/ref&gt;

The era is marked by such profound technical advancements like [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perceptivity]], [[Santa Maria del Fiore|double shell domes]] or [[Bastion fortress]]es. Note books of the Renaissance artist-engineers such as [[Taccola]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] give a deep insight into the mechanical technology then known and applied. Architects and engineers were inspired by the structures of [[Ancient Rome]], and men like [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] created the large dome of [[Florence Cathedral]] as a result. He was awarded one of the first [[patent]]s ever issued in order to protect an ingenious [[crane (machine)|crane]] he designed to raise the large masonry stones to the top of the structure. Military technology developed rapidly with the widespread use of the [[cross-bow]] and ever more powerful [[artillery]], as the city-states of Italy were usually in conflict with one another. Powerful families like the [[Medici]] were strong patrons of the arts and sciences. [[History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance science]] spawned the [[Scientific Revolution]]; science and technology began a cycle of mutual advancement.

==== Age of Exploration ====
{{Main|Age of Exploration}}

An improved sailing ship, the (nau or [[carrack]]), enabled the [[Age of Exploration]] with the [[European colonization of the Americas]], epitomized by [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[New Atlantis]]''. Pioneers like [[Vasco da Gama]], [[Pedro Álvares Cabral|Cabral]], [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] and [[Christopher Columbus]] explored the world in search of new trade routes for their goods and contacts with Africa, India and China to shorten the journey compared with traditional routes overland. They produced new maps and charts which enabled following mariners to explore further with greater confidence. Navigation was generally difficult, however, owing to the [[History of longitude|problem of longitude]] and the absence of accurate [[Marine chronometer|chronometers]]. European powers rediscovered the idea of the [[civil code]], lost since the time of the Ancient Greeks.

====Pre-Industrial Revolution====
The [[stocking frame]], which was invented in 1598, increased a knitter's number of knots per minute from 100 to 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1=Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0226726342 |page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mines were becoming increasingly deep and were expensive to drain with horse powered bucket and chain pumps and wooden piston pumps. Some mines used as many as 500 horses. Horse-powered pumps were replaced by the [[Thomas Savery#First steam engine mechanism|Savery steam pump]] (1698) and the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen steam engine]] (1712).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Industrial Revolution]] is characterized by developments in the areas of textile machinery, [[mining]], [[metallurgy]] and [[transport]] the [[steam engine]] and the invention of [[machine tool]]s.

Before invention of machinery to spin yarn and weave cloth, spinning was done the spinning wheel and weaving done on a hand and foot operated loom. It took from three to five spinners to supply one weaver.&lt;ref name="Landes_1969"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present |last=Landes |first= David. S.|year= 1969|publisher =Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|location= Cambridge, NY|isbn=  978-0521094184|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayres_1989"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ayres| first = Robert | title =Technological Transformations and Long Waves| year = 1989 |page= | url = http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/RR-89-001.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the [[flying shuttle]] in 1733 doubled the output of a weaver, creating a shortage of spinners. The [[spinning frame]] for wool was invented in 1738. The [[spinning jenny]], invented in 1764, was a machine that used multiple spinning wheels; however, it produced low quality thread. The [[water frame]] patented by Richard Arkwright in 1767, produced a better quality thread than the spinning jenny. The [[spinning mule]], patented in 1779 by [[Samuel Crompton]], produced a high quality thread.&lt;ref name="Landes_1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayres_1989"/&gt; The [[power loom]] was invented by Edmund Cartwright in 1787.&lt;ref name="Landes_1969"/&gt;

In the mid 1750s the steam engine was applied to the water power-constrained iron, copper and lead industries for powering blast bellows. These industries were located near the mines, some of which were using steam engines for mine pumping. Steam engines were too powerful for leather bellows, so cast iron blowing cylinders were developed in 1768. Steam powered blast furnaces achieved higher temperatures, allowing the use of more lime in iron blast furnace feed. (Lime rich slag was not free-flowing at the previously used temperatures.) With a sufficient lime ratio, sulfur from coal or coke fuel reacts with the slag so that the sulfur does not contaminate the iron. Coal and coke were cheaper and more abundant fuel. As a result, iron production rose significantly during the last decades of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R. F. |year=  1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution was driven by cheap energy in the form of [[coal]], produced in ever-increasing amounts from the abundant resources of [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Coal converted to [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] fueled higher temperature [[blast furnace]]s and produced [[cast iron]] in much larger amounts than before, allowing the creation of a  range of structures such as [[The Iron Bridge]]. Cheap coal meant that industry was no longer constrained by water resources driving the mills, although it continued as a valuable source of power. The steam engine helped drain the mines, so more coal reserves could be accessed, and the output of coal increased. The development of the high-pressure steam engine made locomotives possible, and a transport revolution followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title='The Mechanical Age': technology, innovation and industrialisation|url=https://eastanglia.academia.edu/EmmaGriffin/Books|work=Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|publisher=Palgrave|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[steam engine]] which had existed since the early 18th century, was practically applied to both [[steamboat]] and [[railway]] transportation. The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], the first purpose built railway line, opened in 1830, the [[Rocket locomotive]] of [[Robert Stephenson]] being one of its first working [[steam locomotive|locomotives]] used.

Manufacture of ships' pulley [[Block and tackle|blocks]] by all-metal machines at the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] in 1803 instigated the age of sustained [[mass production]]. [[Machine tools]] used by engineers to manufacture parts began in the first decade of the century, notably by [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]]. The development of [[interchangeable parts]] through what is now called the [[American system of manufacturing]] began in the firearms industry at the U.S Federal arsenals in the early 19th century, and became widely used by the end of the century.

=== Second Industrial Revolution (1860s–1914) ===
{{main|Second Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Stephenson's Rocket.jpg|thumb|left|The preserved ''Rocket'']]

The 19th century saw astonishing developments in transportation, construction, manufacturing and communication technologies originating in Europe. After a recession at the end of the 1830s and a general slowdown in major inventions, the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] was a period of rapid innovation and industrialization that began in the 1860s or around 1870 and lasted until [[World War I]]. It included rapid development of chemical, electrical, petroleum, and steel technologies connected with highly structured technology research.

[[Telegraphy]] developed into a practical technology in the 19th century to help run the railways safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Visible Hand: The Management Revolution in American Business |last=Chandler Jr. |first= Alfred D. |year= 1993|publisher =Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn= 978-0674940529}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the development of telegraphy was the patenting of the first [[telephone]]. March 1876 marks the date that Alexander Graham Bell officially patented his version of an "electric telegraph". Although Bell is noted with the creation of the telephone, it is still debated about who actually developed the first working model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-greatest-inventions-of-the-19th-century.php|title=Top 10 Greatest Inventions of the 19th Century |date=2010-08-09|work=Toptenz.net|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on improvements in vacuum pumps and materials research, [[incandescent light bulb]]s became practical for general use in the late 1870s. This invention had a profound effect on the workplace because factories could now have second and third shift workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology|last=Nye |first=David E.|authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher= The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA, USA and London, England |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoe production was mechanized during the mid 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Path to Mechanized Shoe Production in the United States|last=Thomson |first= Ross |authorlink= |year= 1989|publisher =University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0807818671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass production of [[sewing machine]]s and [[agricultural machinery]] such as reapers occurred in the mid to late 19th century.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bicycles were mass-produced beginning in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"/&gt;

Steam-powered factories became widespread, although the conversion from water power to steam occurred in England before in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ironclad warship]]s were found in battle starting in the 1860s, and played a role in the opening of Japan and China to trade with the West.

=== 20th century ===

[[File:Buzz salutes the U.S. Flag.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 11|Landing on the Moon]]]]

20th-century technology developed rapidly. Broad teaching and implementation of the [[scientific method]], and increased research spending contributed to the advancement of modern science and technology. New technology improved communication and transport, thus spreading technical understanding.

[[Mass production]] brought [[automobile]]s and other high-tech goods to masses of consumers. [[Military research]] and development sped advances including electronic [[computing]] and [[jet engine]]s. [[Radio]] and [[telephony]] improved greatly and spread to larger populations of users, though near-universal access would not be possible until [[mobile phones]] became affordable to [[developing world]] residents in the late 2000s and early 2010s.

Energy and engine technology improvements included [[nuclear power]], developed after the [[Manhattan project]] which heralded the new [[Atomic Age]]. [[Rocket]] development led to long range missiles and the first [[space age]] that lasted from the 1950s with the launch of Sputnik to the mid-1980s.

[[Electrification]] spread rapidly in the 20th century. At the beginning of the century electric power was for the most part only available to wealthy people in a few major cities such as New York, London, Paris, and Newcastle upon Tyne, but by the time the [[World Wide Web]] was invented in 1990 an estimated 62 percent of homes worldwide had electric power, including about a third of households in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energyfordevelopment.com/2014/11/rural-electrification-by-numbers-1970_2.html|title=Two Billion People Gain Electricity Access: 1970–2010|website=www.energyfordevelopment.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rural developing world.

[[Birth control]] also became widespread during the 20th century. [[Electron microscopes]] were very powerful by the late 1970s and genetic theory and knowledge were expanding, leading to developments in [[genetic engineering]].

The first "[[test tube baby]]" [[Louise Brown]] was born in 1978, which led to the first successful [[gestational surrogacy]] pregnancy in 1985 and the first pregnancy by [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]] in 1991, which is the implanting of a single sperm into an egg. [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] was first performed in late 1989 and led to successful births in July 1990. These procedures have become relatively common.

The massive data analysis resources necessary for running transatlantic research programs such as the [[Human Genome Project]] and the [[Large Electron-Positron Collider]] led to a necessity for distributed communications, causing Internet protocols to be more widely adopted by researchers and also creating a justification for [[Tim Berners-Lee]] to create the [[World Wide Web]].

[[Vaccination]] spread rapidly to the developing world from the 1980s onward due to many successful humanitarian initiatives, greatly reducing childhood mortality in many poor countries with limited medical resources.

=== 21st century ===

[[File:NASA Mars Rover.jpg|thumb|The [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s have provided huge amounts of information by functioning well beyond NASA's original lifespan estimates.]]

{{Main|2000s in science and technology}}

In the early 21st century research is ongoing into [[quantum computers]], [[gene therapy]] (introduced 1990), [[3D printing]] (introduced 1981), [[nanotechnology]] (introduced 1985), [[bioengineering]]/[[biotechnology]], [[nuclear technology]], [[Materials science|advanced materials]] (e.g., graphene), the [[scramjet]] and [[Unmanned combat air vehicle|drones]] (along with [[railgun]]s and high-energy laser beams for military uses), [[superconductivity]], the [[memristor]], and green technologies such as [[alternative fuel]]s (e.g., [[fuel cells]], self-driving electric and plug-in hybrid cars), [[augmented reality]] devices and [[wearable electronics]], [[artificial intelligence]], and more efficient and powerful [[LEDs]], [[solar cells]], [[integrated circuits]], [[wireless power]] devices, engines, and [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]].

Perhaps the greatest research tool built in the 21st century is the [[Large Hadron Collider]], the largest single machine ever built. The understanding of [[particle physics]] is expected to expand with better instruments including larger [[particle accelerator]]s such as the LHC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Largest Science Experiment comes to Northern Ireland|url=https://www.stfc.ac.uk/2668.aspx|website=Science &amp; Technology Facilities Council|accessdate=9 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413064023/https://www.stfc.ac.uk/2668.aspx|archivedate=13 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and better [[neutrino detector]]s. [[Dark matter]] is sought via underground detectors and observatories like [[LIGO]] have started to detect [[gravitational wave]]s.

Genetic engineering technology continues to improve, and the importance of [[epigenetics]] on development and inheritance has also become increasingly recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2006/nov/cover|title=DNA Is Not Destiny: The New Science of Epigenetics |publisher=DiscoverMagazine.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New [[spaceflight]] technology and [[spacecraft]] are also being developed, like the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] and [[Dragon V2|Dragon]]. New, more capable [[Space observatory|space telescopes]], such as the [[James Webb Space Telescope|James Webb Telescope]], to be launched to orbit in early 2021, and the [[Extremely large telescope#Colossus Telescope|Colossus Telescope]] are being designed. The [[International Space Station]] was completed in the 2000s, and [[NASA]] and [[ESA]] plan a [[manned mission to Mars]] in the 2030s. The [[Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket]] (VASIMR) is an electro-magnetic thruster for spacecraft propulsion and is expected to be tested in 2015.

[[Breakthrough Initiatives]], together with famed physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], plan to send [[Breakthrough Starshot|the first ever spacecraft to visit another star]], which will consist of numerous super-light chips driven by [[Electric propulsion]] in the 2030s, and receive images of the [[Proxima Centauri]] system, along with, possibly, the [[List of potentially habitable exoplanets|potentially habitable planet]] [[Proxima Centauri b]], by midcentury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3|title=Breakthrough Initiatives|website=breakthroughinitiatives.org|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2004 saw the [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P|first manned commercial spaceflight]] when [[Mike Melvill]] crossed the [[boundary of space]] on June 21, 2004.

'''Internet geography''', also called '''cybergeography''', is a subdiscipline of [[geography]] that studies the spatial organization of the [[Internet]], from social, economic, cultural, and technological perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mapping the 'Geography' of the Internet|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/09/mapping-the-geography-of-the-internet/279434/|accessdate = 2015-09-15|first = Emma|last = Green|date = 2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Global Geographies of the Internet|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HGHwMXVXzD8C|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2012-08-01|isbn = 9789400712454|first = Barney|last = Warf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core assumption of Internet geography is that the location of servers, [[website]]s, data, services, and infrastructure is key to understand the development and the dynamics of the Internet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10261">The '''knowledge divide''' is the gap in standards of living between those who can find, create, manage, process, and disseminate information or knowledge, and those who are impaired in this process. According to a 2005 UNESCO World Report, the rise in the 21st century of a global information society has resulted in the emergence of knowledge as a valuable resource, increasingly determining who has access to power and profit.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Report: Toward Knowledge Societies (Paris: UNESCO, 2005), 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid dissemination of information on a potentially global scale as a result of new information media&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 160.&lt;/ref&gt; and the globally uneven ability to assimilate knowledge and information has resulted in potentially expanding gaps in knowledge between individuals and nations.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Stiglitz, "Knowledge as a Global Public Good," in Global Public Goods: International Cooperation in the 21st Century, ed. I. Kahl et al. (Oxford University Press, 1999), 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

In the 21st century, the emergence of the [[knowledge society]] becomes pervasive.&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]] World Report (2005) Towards Knowledge Societies; retrieved from http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001418/141843e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The transformations of world's economy and of each society have a fast pace. Together with information and communication technologies ([[Information technology|ICT]]) these new paradigms have the power to reshape the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;Information Society Commission (2002). Building the Knowledge Society - Report to Government, December 2002 retrieved from http://www.isc.ie/downloads/know.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In order to keep pace with innovations, to come up with new ideas, people need to produce and manage knowledge. This is why knowledge has become essential for all societies.

==Between nations==

According to [[UNESCO]] and the [[World Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report: Knowledge for Development (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; knowledge gaps between nations may occur due to the varying degrees by which individual nations incorporate the following elements:

* ''Human rights and fundamental freedoms'': An absence of freedom within a society can diminish or delay the ability of its members to acquire, debate, and transmit knowledge.  Vital to the spread of knowledge and information between nations are such freedoms as [[freedom of expression]], an absence of censorship, free circulation of information, and [[freedom of the press]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Democracy]]''
* ''Plurality of knowledge and information'': This includes a diverse media&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and the acceptance of diverse forms of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Quality infrastructure'': For instance, a poor electrical grid makes the existence of computer networks or of higher education institutions less attainable.
* ''Effective communication system'': This will affect the dissemination of knowledge or movement of ideas within and between nations.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 317-318.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Effective education system'': Gaps in knowledge between nations can exist when individual countries invest too little in primary school education, which acts as the base for the entire education system.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 317.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[UNESCO]], in order for a nation to become a knowledge society, primary education must focus on basic literacy and must be universally accessible.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as others have pointed out, higher education may be equally important for closing knowledge gaps between nations, particularly between newly industrialized nations, such as the Republic of Korea, and more advanced industrial societies.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 317.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the former, higher education can play an important role in bridging knowledge gaps, but must benefit more than a small elite portion of the population and must be taught at international standards.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 317.&lt;/ref&gt; The poor development of educational institutions from a society affects the creativity of people belonging to that society.
* ''Focus on Research and Innovation'': As the [[World Bank]] suggests, [[Research &amp; Development]] within a nation can enable it to follow current developments in global knowledge and also to understand how to adapt external knowledge and technology to meet its needs.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report, 1999, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  In nations with low degrees of R&amp;D, government funding can provide a significant portion of support that can later be taken over by private investment.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report, 1999, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Closely tied to effective education systems is the need for a nation to allow for academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because higher educational institutions are significant contributors to R&amp;D,&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report 1999, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; these institutions must be granted freedom to create and disseminate knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  An environment supportive of research and innovation may also help stem the "[[brain drain]]" of educated individuals from knowledge-poor nations to knowledge-rich nations.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Intellectual Property Rights'': Closely connected to a focus on research and innovation are national and international Intellectual Property Rights. Within a nation, Intellectual Property Rights can spawn research and innovation by providing economic incentives for investing in new knowledge development.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 311.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as stated by the [[World Bank]], by protecting innovations, intellectual property rights may also inhibit knowledge-sharing and may prevent developing nations from benefitting from knowledge produced in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report 1999, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital divide==

The information and ICT systems that support knowledge are very important. This is why digitization is viewed closely related to knowledge. Scientists generally agree that there is a [[digital divide]], recently different reports also showed the existence of knowledge divide.&lt;ref&gt;Information Society Commission, 2002; UNESCO, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation and effective use of knowledge are increasingly related to the development of an ICT infrastructure. Without ICT, it is impossible to have an infrastructure able to process the huge flow of information required in an advanced economy. In particular, without adequate technical support, it is difficult to develop and use e-learning and electronic documents to overcome time and space constraints.

The digital divide is, however, but one important part of the larger knowledge divide.  As UNESCO states, "closing the digital divide will not suffice to close the knowledge divide, for access to useful, relevant knowledge is more than simply a matter of infrastructure—it depends on training, cognitive skills and regulatory frameworks geared towards access to contents."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===

In the book Digital Dead End, Virginia Eubanks criticizes the way that the digital divide is generally thought of as a division between haves and have-nots, where the solution is distribution. This over simplistic depiction obscures the fact that often social and [[structural inequality]] is at the root of the divide. According to a study done by Eubanks with women of the YWCA, the women of the community "insisted that have-nots possess many different kinds of crucial information and skills." In other words, it is not simply knowledge of the technology itself that is the issue but the structural system based on perpetuating the status quo in which the haves "hoard" knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Eubanks, V. (2011). Digital dead end: fighting for social justice in the information age. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In gender, race, ethnicity and social class==

First, it was noticed that a great difference exists between the [[North-South divide|North and the South]] {{Where|date=July 2011}} (rich countries vs. poor countries). The development of knowledge depends on spreading Internet and computer technology and also on the development of education in these countries. If a country has attained a higher literacy level then this will result in having higher level of knowledge.
Indeed, UNESCO's report details many social issues in knowledge divide related to globalization. There was noticed a knowledge divide with respect to
* Gender: Socio-cultural inequalities between men and women, such as unequal access to education and technology, create the conditions for unequal access to knowledge.  This can cause significant knowledge gaps both within and between nations, the latter resulting from individual nations' underutilization of their full knowledge workforce.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Report 2005, 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Race
* Ethnicity
* Social class

This is a '''list of ovens'''. An [[oven]] is a thermally insulated chamber used for the [[heating]], [[baking]] or [[drying]] of a substance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oven Oven]. Merriam-webster.com. Retrieved on 2011-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and most commonly used for [[cooking]]. [[Kiln]]s and [[furnace]]s are special-purpose ovens, used in [[pottery]] and [[metalworking]], respectively.

==Ovens==

===Baking ovens===
[[Baking]] is a food [[cooking]] method that uses prolonged dry heat by [[convection]], rather than by [[thermal radiation]], normally in an oven, but also in hot ashes, or on hot stones.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Bread is a commonly baked food.

===Earth ovens===
An [[earth oven]], or cooking pit, is one of the most simple and long-used cooking structures. At its simplest, an earth oven is a pit in the ground used to trap heat and bake, smoke, or steam food. Earth ovens have been used in many places and cultures in the past, and the presence of such cooking pits is a key sign of human settlement often sought by [[archaeologists]].  They remain a common tool for cooking large quantities of food where no equipment is available.

===Kilns===
A [[kiln]] is a thermally insulated chamber, a type of oven, that produces temperatures sufficient to complete some process, such as hardening, drying, or chemical changes. Various industries and trades use kilns to harden objects made from [[clay]] into [[pottery]], [[brick]]s etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioenergylists.org/stovesdoc/Goyer/Kilns/Goyer_Kilns_and_Brick_Making.pdf |title=Brick making kilns |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various industries use [[rotary kiln]]s for [[pyroprocessing]]—to calcinate ores, produce [[Cement kiln|cement]], lime, and many other materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10848">'''Mobile collaboration''' is a technology-based process of communicating using electronic assets and accompanying software designed for use in remote locations. Newest generation hand-held electronic devices feature video, audio, and telestration (on-screen drawing) capabilities broadcast over secure networks, enabling multi-party conferencing in real time (although real time communication is not a strict requirement of mobile collaboration and may not be applicable or practical in many collaboration scenarios).

Differing from traditional [[videoconferencing|video conferencing]], mobile collaboration utilizes [[wireless]], [[Cellular network|cellular]] and [[broadband]] technologies enabling effective [[collaboration]] independent of location. Where traditional video conferencing has been limited to boardrooms, offices, and lecture theatres, [[recent technological advancements]] have extended the capabilities of video conferencing for use with discreet, [[Mobile device|hand-held mobile devices]], permitting true mobile collaborative possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Scope ==
The scope of mobile collaboration takes into account a number of elements that continue to evolve in their sophistication and complexity: video, audio and telestration capabilities, conferencing and [[telepresence]] systems, collaboration tools, [[Data transmission|transmission]] technologies, and mobility.

== Forecasts ==
[[Cisco Systems]] predicts "two-thirds of the world's mobile data traffic will be video by 2015."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Unified Communications Interoperability Forum]] (UCIF), a non-profit alliance of technology vendors states that "one important driver for the growth of UC ([[unified communications]]) is mobility and the remote worker. No segment is growing faster than mobile communications, and virtually every [[Smartphone|smart phone]] will be equipped with [[Videotelephony|video chat]], [[Instant Messaging|IM]], directory, and other UC features within a few years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manufacturing ===
Manufacturers of all kinds use mobile collaboration technology in a number of ways. Recent trends in [[globalization]] and [[outsourcing]] in particular, have meant that companies need to communicate with employees, suppliers, and customers the world over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flexibility of hand-held mobile collaboration devices allow real-time communication to take place at any location where products are being designed, built, and inspected, such as an automotive assembly plant a continent away. Improved communication through mobile collaboration affects many aspects of complex manufacturing such as production line maintenance, [[supply chain management]] and [[Field service management|equipment field service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy ===
Companies in the energy sector face unique challenges due to, for example, the vast distances between a head office and the remote, harsh environment of an offshore oil rig, as well as the often inadequacies or absence of  necessary transmission networks. Recent advancements in mobile collaboration technology and transmission networks are making it possible for employees in these situations to collaborate in secure and reliable ways with colleagues thousands of miles away. The use of mobile collaboration in the energy sector is enabling companies to conduct remote inspections, safety audits, maintenance, repair and overhaul work, as well as IT/communication infrastructure troubleshooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare ===
Although [[telemedicine]] technology has been in use for a number of years in the healthcare sector, mobile collaboration technology extends these capabilities to locations now reachable through the use of hand-held devices such as a remote community, long-term care facility, or a patient’s home. Healthcare professionals in multiple locations can together view, discuss, and assess patient issues. The use of mobile collaboration technology within the healthcare sector has the potential to improve the quality and access to care, while making its delivery more cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | url = http://www.librestream.com/Brochures/PR/GovernmentPurchasing.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Mobile collaboration technology might also be used for remote education. From one on one tutoring to large classes it has many uses. Homeschooling could really benefit from this technology as you participate in a lecture from anywhere in the world. Most useful you can record your classes or lectures and review them. Internet schools, including higher education, will most certainly also benefit from this development in mobile education. Though these methods are not widely used they are quite useful and most likely will become widely popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Franchise businesses ==
Mobile collaboration between franchiser and franchisee allows modern technology to be used to allow a better flow of communications similar to face-to-face, albeit remotely via video/voice media such as smartphones, tablets, iPhones, iPads, etc. to be collectively used without requiring one party to travel to another location.  This in turn reduces travel time and expenses not to mention better and quicker modes of communication.

Franchisers who have several hundred franchisees find it an absolute must.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8959">'''Mobile technology''' is the technology used for [[Cellular network|cellular communication]]. Mobile [[code-division multiple access]] (CDMA) technology has evolved rapidly over the past few years. Since the start of this millennium, a standard mobile device has gone from being no more than a simple two-way [[pager]] to being a [[mobile phone]], [[GPS navigation device]], an embedded [[web browser]] and [[instant messaging]] client, and a [[handheld gaming console]]. Many experts believe that the future of computer technology rests in [[mobile computing]] with [[wireless network]]ing. Mobile computing by way of tablet computers are becoming more popular. Tablets are available on the [[3G]] and [[4G]] networks.

==Mobile phone generations==
{{main|List of mobile phone generations}}

In the early 1980s, [[1G]] was introduced as voice-only communication via "brick phones".&lt;ref name="lifewire_phone_gens"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lifewire.com/1g-vs-2g-vs-2-5g-vs-3g-vs-4g-578681 |title=1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, &amp; 5G Explained |work=[[Lifewire]] |accessdate=2018-02-27 |date=2017-12-18 |author=Fendelman, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1991, the development of [[2G]] introduced [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) and [[Multimedia Messaging Service]] (MMS) capabilities, allowing picture messages to be sent and received between phones.&lt;ref name="lifewire_phone_gens"/&gt; In 1998, 3G was introduced to provide faster data-transmission speeds to support [[video calling]] and [[internet]] access. [[4G]] was released in 2008 to support more demanding services such as [[Mobile gaming|gaming services]], HD [[mobile TV]], [[Video conference|video conferencing]], and [[3D TV]].&lt;ref name="lifewire_phone_gens"/&gt; [[5G]] technology has been planned for the upcoming future.

===4G networking===
{{main|4G}}

4G is the current mainstream  cellular service offered to cell phone users, performance roughly 10 times faster than [[3G]] service.&lt;ref name="lifewire_4g"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-4g-wireless-577577 |work=[[Lifewire]] |accessdate=2018-02-27 |date=2017-12-18 |author=Cassavoy, Liane |title=What is 4G wireless?}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important features in the [[4G]] mobile networks is the domination of high-speed [[packet (information technology)|packet]] transmissions or burst traffic in the channels. The same codes used in the [[2G]]-[[3G]] networks are applied to 4G mobile or wireless networks, the detection of very short bursts will be a serious problem due to their very poor partial correlation properties. Recent study has indicated that traditional multilayer network architecture based on the [[Open Systems Interconnection]] (OSI) model may not be well suited for 4G mobile network, where transactions of short packets will be the major part of the traffic in the channels. As the packets from different mobiles carry completely different channel characteristics, the receiver should execute all necessary [[algorithm]]s, such as channel estimation, interactions with all upper layers and so on, within a very short period of time.

==Operating systems==
Many types of [[mobile operating system]]s (OS) are available for [[smartphone]]s, including [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry OS]], [[webOS]], [[iOS]], [[Symbian]], [[Windows Mobile]] Professional (touch screen), Windows Mobile Standard (non-touch screen), and [[Bada]]. The most popular are the Apple iPhone, and the newest: Android. Android, a mobile OS developed by [[Google]], is the first completely [[Open-source model|open-source]] mobile OS, meaning that it is free to any cell phone [[mobile network]].

Since 2008 customizable OSs allow the user to download [[Mobile app|apps]] like games, GPS, utilities, and other tools. Users can also create their own apps and publish them, e.g. to Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]. The [[Palm Pre]] using [[webOS]] has functionality over the [[Internet]] and can support Internet-based programming languages such as [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS), [[HTML]], and [[JavaScript]]. The [[Research In Motion]] (RIM) [[BlackBerry]] is a smartphone with a multimedia player and third-party software installation. The Windows Mobile Professional Smartphones ([[Pocket PC]] or Windows Mobile PDA) are like [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDA) and have [[touchscreen]] abilities. The Windows Mobile Standard does not have a touch screen but uses a [[trackball]], [[touchpad]], or rockers.

==Channel hogging and file sharing==
There will be a hit to file sharing, the normal web surfer would want to look at a new web page every minute or so at 100 kbs a page loads quickly.{{clarification needed|date=February 2018}} Because of the changes to the security of wireless networks users will be unable to do huge file transfers because service providers want to reduce channel use. [[AT&amp;T]] claimed that they would ban any of their users that they caught using [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) [[file sharing]] applications on their 3G network. It then became apparent that it would keep any of their users from using their iTunes programs. The users would then be forced to find a [[hotspot (Wi-Fi)|Wi-Fi hotspot]] to be able to download files. The limits of wireless networking will not be cured by 4G, as there are too many fundamental differences between wireless networking and other means of Internet access. If wireless vendors do not realize these differences and [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] limits, future wireless customers will find themselves disappointed and the market may suffer setbacks.

== Impacts on the modern family ==
Increasing mobile technology use has changed how the modern family interacts with one another through technology. With the rise of mobile devices, families are becoming increasingly "on-the-move",&lt;ref name="TaylorTakeuchi2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Katie Headrick|last2=Takeuchi|first2=Lori|last3=Stevens|first3=Reed|year=2017|title=Mapping the daily media round: novel methods for understanding families’ mobile technology use|journal=Learning, Media and Technology|pages=1–15|doi=10.1080/17439884.2017.1391286|issn=1743-9884}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spend less time in physical contact with one another. However, this trend does not mean that families are no longer interacting with each other, but rather have evolved into a more digitized variant. A study has shown that the modern family actually learns better with usage of mobile media,&lt;ref name="TaylorTakeuchi2017" /&gt; and children are more willing to cooperate with their parents via a digital medium than a more direct approach. For example, family members can share information from articles or online videos via mobile devices and thus stay connected with one another during a busy day.

This trend is not without controversy, however. Many parents of [[elementary school]]-age children express concern and sometimes disapproval of heavy mobile technology use.&lt;ref name="TaylorTakeuchi2017" /&gt; Parents may feel that excessive usage of such technologies distracts children from "un-plugged" bonding experiences, and many express safety concerns about children using mobile media. While parents may have many concerns are, they are not necessarily [[anti-technology]].&lt;ref name="TaylorTakeuchi2017" /&gt; In fact, many parents express approval of mobile technology usage if their children can learn something from the session. for example, through art or music tutorials on [[YouTube]].

==Future of smartphones==
The next generation of smartphones will be context-aware, taking advantage of the growing availability of embedded physical sensors and data exchange abilities. One of the main features applying to this is that phones will start keeping track of users' personal data, and adapt to anticipate the information will need.  All-new applications will come out with the new phones, one of which is an X-ray device that reveals information about any location at which the phone is pointed. Companies are developing software to take advantage of more accurate location-sensing data. This has been described as making the phone a virtual mouse able to click the real world.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} An example would be pointing the phone's camera at a building while having the live feed open, and the phone will show text with the image of the building, and save its location for use in the future.

[[Omnitouch]] is a device via which apps can be viewed and used on a hand, arm, wall, desk, or any other everyday surface. The device uses a sensor touch interface, which enables the user to access all the functions through the use of the touch of a finger. It was developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. This device uses a projector and camera worn on the user's shoulder, with no controls other than the user's fingers.

'''Mobiles for Development (M4D)''', a more specific iteration of [[Information and Communication Technologies for Development]] (ICT4D), refers to the use of [[mobile technologies]] in [[International development|global development]] strategies.  Focusing on the fields of international and socioeconomic development and human rights, M4D relies on the theory that increased access to mobile devices acts as an integral cornerstone in the promotion of overall societal development.

Once viewed as an item of luxury and privilege, [[mobile phones]] and devices have become a near necessity throughout the developed and developing world alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aker|first=J|author2=Mbiti, I|title=Mobile phones and economic development in Africa|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|year=2010|volume=24|issue=3|pages=207–232|jstor=20799163|doi=10.1257/jep.24.3.207}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a 2007 [[United Nations]] study, over two thirds of the world’s mobile phones are owned and utilized within [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blumenstock|first=Joshua Evan|author2=Eagle, Nathan|title=Divided We Call: Disparities in Access and Use of Mobile Phones in Rwanda|journal=Information Technologies and International Development|year=2012|volume=8|issue=2|pages=1–16|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA298504149&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=utoronto_main&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=6c19c711135ec1dc2de19c74d3a41126|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With less-developed wired infrastructure and the high cost associated with its modernization and implementation, the adoption of cellular technologies can be attributed to a necessary [[leapfrogging]] of traditional telephony and communication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wired/Wireless Internet Communications: Third International Conference, WWIC|year=2005|publisher=Springer|page=117|author=Heijenk, Geert|chapter=Interference-Based Routing in Multi-hop Wireless Infrastructures|author2=Liu, Fei|editor=Braun, Torsten|accessdate=3 February 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3dojYnyBIgC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=wired+infrastructure&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0c7ONovckg&amp;sig=7jpum-Gi8AKOJ8BYlKcYn5BHzIw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=P8D8UrTrNsHJygHKyYHwBw&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition, the unsound and undependable electrical infrastructure of many developing countries does not cater well to mass hardwired ICT adoption.  The portability, battery power, and flexibility of mobile technologies is well suited to the common pursuits and lifestyles of those residing in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vincent|first=Katharine|author2=Cull, Tracy|title="Ten Seeds": How Mobiles Have Contributed to Development in Women-Led Farming Cooperatives in Leshotho|journal=Information Technologies &amp; International Development|date=Spring 2013|volume=9|issue=1|pages=37–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This mass adoption of ICTs and mobile phones as well the increased quality and expanse of signal coverage within many developing countries has led to increased academic, socioeconomic, and political attention as the various impacts of the M4D movement continue to expand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vincent|first=Katharine|author2=Cull, Tracy|title="Ten Seeds": How Mobiles Have Contributed to Development in Women-Led Farming Cooperatives in Lesotho|journal=Information Technologies &amp; International Development|date=Spring 2013|volume=9|issue=1|pages=37–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition to the predictable developmental outcomes of mobile adoption including increased economic agency, unforeseen progress has been experienced in the forms of individual empowerment, female agency, as well as familial and community growth.

The opportunities for effective mass mobilization and aggregation of information and data offered by developmental movements utilizing cellular telephones and other mobile devices such as [[Tablet computer|tablets]] have been widely featured in the mass media and academia.  Literature on this matter is being steadily produced as developing countries continue to adopt mobile technologies at a remarkable rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key ICT indicators for developed and developing countries and the world (totals and penetration rates)|url=http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx|accessdate=2 March 2014|author=International Telecommunication Union|format=Spreadsheet|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobile accessibility and use ==

Recent developments in [[mobile communication]] and computation technologies have led to the expansion of [[mobile phone]], [[smartphone]], [[tablet computer]], and [[netbook]] ownership.  Typically marketed to the developed world as supplementary to standard [[laptops]] and [[desktop computers]], these electronic products often offer lower price points to the consumer.  This lower price point caters well to developing countries and their rapidly evolving markets for ICT expansion and adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crothers|first=Brooke|title=Netbooks get faster but less popular, at least in the U.S.|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-57349750-64/netbooks-get-faster-but-less-popular-at-least-in-the-u.s/|accessdate=2 March 2014|newspaper=CNET|date=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These mobile devices come equipped with basic mobile communications hard and software such as [[WiFi]] and [[3G]] services which allow users to connect to the Internet via mobile and wireless networks without having to secure a landline or an expensive broadband connection via [[DSL]], [[cable Internet]] or [[fiber optics]].  This leapfrogging movement towards the acceptance and implementation of mobile technologies made the Internet and modern digital telecommunications more accessible to people, particularly those in emerging markets and developing countries.

According to [[International Telecommunication Union]], mobile ICTs have emerged as the primary form of technology that will offer a bridge within the [[digital divide]].  Data collected by the ITU shows the trajectory of mobile technologies as their adoption out-paces and even replaces the adoption of desktop computers and standard laptops.

The International Telecommunication Union estimates that as of 2013, approximately 6.8 billion [[List of countries by number of mobile phones in use|mobile-cellular subscriptions]] are held worldwide, 5.2 billion of which are held in developing countries.&lt;ref name="itu.int"&gt;{{cite web|title=Key ICT Indicators for Developed and Developing Countries and the World|url=http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx|publisher=ITU|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These numbers stand in stark contrast to the penetration rate of [[List of countries by number of telephone lines in use|fixed-telephone subscriptions]] which stand at approximately 1.2 billion worldwide, a small margin over half of which belong to the developing world.&lt;ref name="itu.int"/&gt;

The following table displays key ICT indicators for developed and developing countries as well as world totals from 2010 to 2013:

The trends displayed in the table above are further supported by the successful sales reports of technology companies selling mobile technologies in emerging markets within developing countries.  Some multinational computer manufacturers like Acer and Lenovo are marketing more affordable netbooks to emerging markets such as those in China, Indonesia and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pinola|first=Melanie|title=Acer Says It Will Continue Making Netbooks|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/245163/acer_says_it_will_continue_making_netbooks.html|publisher=PC World|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crothers|first=Brooke|title=Netbooks get faster but less popular, at least in the U.S.|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-57349750-64/netbooks-get-faster-but-less-popular-at-least-in-the-u.s/|accessdate=1 March 2014|newspaper=CNet|date=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobile leapfrogging ==

Originally a concept used in reference to economic growth theories and industrialization, [[leapfrogging]] has more recently been used in the context of sustainable development for developing countries within world development theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schumpeter|first=J|title=Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy|date=1942|publisher=Harper|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Technological leapfrogging refers to the acceleration of development through the skipping of low-grade, less efficient, and more costly technologies and industries in favour of the direct adoption of more effective and advanced technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steinmueller|first=W. E.|title=ICTs and the possibilities for leapfrogging by developing countries|journal=International Labour Review|date=2001|volume=140|issue=2|page=194|url=http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=ICTs+and+the+possibilities+for+leapfrogging+by+developing+countries&amp;rft.jtitle=International+labour+review&amp;rft.au=Steinmueller%2C+W.+Edward&amp;rft.date=2001&amp;rft.pub=Blackwell&amp;rft.issn=0020-7780&amp;rft.eissn=1564-913X&amp;rft.volume=140&amp;rft.issue=2&amp;rft.spage=193&amp;rft.epage=210&amp;rft.externalDocID=336367392|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of M4D, the trajectory of the rapid mass adoption of mobile technologies can be attributed to the "mobile leapfrog effect", whereby many developing countries have been seen to bypass traditional routes of wired telephony and broadband infrastructure and development, opting instead for the immediate appropriation of wireless cellular and broadband technology.&lt;ref name=Shade&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shade|first=Leslie|title=Mobilizing for Development: Promises, Perils, and Policy Implications in M4D|date=2013|editor1-first=Susan|editor1-last=Ilcan}}&lt;/ref&gt;    This mobile leapfrogging can be attributed to the lengthy process and high cost of wired infrastructure implementation.  Additionally, as seen in mobile adoption in the Arab States, wired infrastructure that predates mobile technology is often old, outdated, and incapable of data transmission, "the basic requirement for implementing [[Digital subscriber line|Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)]] services".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamade|first=Samir|title=The Impact of Mobile Technology on Low-Income Communities in Lebanon|journal=Digest of Middle East Studies|year=2012|volume=21|issue=1|pages=24–38|doi=10.1111/j.1949-3606.2012.00125.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile ICT platforms and their wide adoption in developing countries serves as an ideal example of leapfrog technology and current practices of leapfrogging within the sustainable development of developing countries.  By enabling developing countries to “leapfrog” over legacy technologies of the wired telephone and Internet service of the 20th century and embrace the mobile technologies of the 21st century, opportunities to bridge the [[Digital divide]] have been argued to become more prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Limits of Leapfrogging|url=http://www.economist.com/node/10650775|accessdate=10 March 2014|newspaper=The Economist|date=7 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of ICT in Advancing Growth in Least Developed Countries: Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities 2011|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ldc/turkey/docs/The_Role_of_ICT_in_Advancing_Growth_in_LDCs_Trends_Challenges_and_Opportunities.pdf|publisher=International Telecommunication Union|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobile hacking ==

The term ‘mobile hack’ refers to the use-based practices of mobile technology that goes beyond the use intended by the creators of the device.&lt;ref name=Hamade&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamade|first=Samir|title=The Impact of Mobile Technology on Low-Income Communities in Lebanon|journal=Digest of Middle East Studies|date=2012|volume=12|issue=1|pages=24–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Often used in order to circumvent the high cost of mobile ownership and use, mobile hacks have become common practice in many developing countries.&lt;ref name=Hamade&gt;{{cite journal|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Mobile hacks have also proven to be widespread in the adoption of mobile technologies in developing countries.  Device sharing, the ‘Missed Call’ technique, and the transferring of mobile credits has allowed for individuals who were previously isolated from digital communication the opportunity to economically engage in the networked community.&lt;ref name=Hamade&gt;{{cite journal|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Device sharing, most commonly the sharing of mobile telephones, refers to the practice of sharing a mobile device between a number of individuals either within a family or a community.&lt;ref name=Hamade&gt;{{cite journal|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Missed call' technique refers to the establishment of a [[code]] that works around connection charges by utilizing a specified number of rings prior to cutting a call.&lt;ref name=Hamade&gt;{{cite journal|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This method avoids call charge and uses discreet codes to convey messages.  This technique goes against the [[profit model]]s of [[Mobile network operator|mobile service providers]] and allows for individuals to communicate messages in a cost-effective manner.&lt;ref name=Hamade&gt;{{cite journal|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the transfer of mobile credits, mobile device owners are able to use credits of an amount specified by their service provider as a means of monetary transaction.&lt;ref name=Hamade&gt;{{cite journal|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; By sending credits to another's mobile device, an exchange of cash can be made in situations that it is necessitated.&lt;ref name=Hamade&gt;{{cite journal|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social impacts ==

According to the ITU's report "Measuring the Information Society," mobile phones and other mobile ICT devices are seen to be replacing standard laptops and desktop computers as the main platform for Internet and ICT access and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring the Information Society|url=http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/backgrounders/general/pdf/5.pdf|publisher=International Telecommunications Union|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This increased access to and use of mobile phones offers individuals a handheld communication platform that can assist in expanding the level of citizen agency in the development of local and international social, economic, and political endeavours. It also offers individuals the opportunity to form social, economic, and political communities, regardless of geographic location, and provides an at-hand device that allows individuals to fight against human rights abuses from the ground.  Organizations such as [http://www.digital-democracy.org/ Digital Democracy] (Dd) and the [http://www.dvb.no Democratic Voice of Burma] offers users the ability to report, compile, and disseminate news and information about human rights violations in order to effectuate global attention and action.&lt;ref name="Shade, Leslie 2013 340–360"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mobilities, Knowledge, and Social Justice|year=2013|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Kingston|isbn=978-0-7735-8882-0|pages=340–360|author=Shade, Leslie|chapter=Mobilizing for Development: Promises, Perils, and Policy Implications of M4D|editor=Ilcan, Suzan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the establishment and fostering of mobile [[citizen]]s within developing countries, a "[[bottom of the pyramid]]" corporate approach has been encouraged in order to "convert poverty into a business opportunity that benefits everyone."&lt;ref name="Shade, Leslie 2013 340–360"/&gt;

== Case studies ==

=== Africa ===

* [[Nigeria]]: Statistics regarding mobile phone adoption and coverage in Nigeria estimate that new subscribers are signing up for mobile phone services at a rate of approximately 1/second with approximately 90% of sub-Saharan Africa equipped with mobile service coverage.&lt;ref name=Blumenstock&gt;{{cite web|last=Blumenstock|first=Joshua Evan|title=Essays on the Economic Impacts of Mobile Phones in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=http://gradworks.umi.com/35/26/3526521.html|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In correlation with this mass adoption and widespread geographic coverage, the ITU estimates that 77% of individuals in Nigeria over the age of 15 who own a mobile device use mobile technologies such as their personal mobile phones to access the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring the Information Society|url=http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/backgrounders/general/pdf/5.pdf|publisher=International Telecommunication Union|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In comparison to the 13% who access the Internet through traditional laptops and desktop computers, the importance and potential impact of mobile telephony, information, and communications technologies is perceptible.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* [[South Africa]]: According to a 2012 [[UNAIDS]] study, approximately 18% of the population of South Africa between the ages of 15 and 49 are infected with [[HIV/AIDS]].  This high [[prevalence rate]] along with South Africa’s weak state health infrastructure and disparate system of rural clinics has promoted a difficult environment in which to monitor and ensure effective treatment of the disease.&lt;ref name=Kinkade&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kinkade|first=Sheila|author2=Katrin Verclas|title=Wireless Technology for Social Change: Trends in Mobile Use by NGOs|journal=Access to Communication Publication Series|date=2008|volume=2|pages=1–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The introduction of mobile technology has allowed for home-based care, medical advice, and counseling for HIV/AIDS patients.  Programs such as [https://www.cell-life.org/ Cell-Life]’s “Aftercare” have introduced the use of mobile telephones for the documentation and reporting of a patient’s medical status and [[Defined daily dose|drug dosage adherence]].&lt;ref name=Kinkade&gt;{{cite journal|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The information that is produced is stored in a database in order to facilitate future care options and to inform on the severity and prevalence of the South African AIDS epidemic according to region.&lt;ref name=Kinkade&gt;{{cite journal|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Concerning the patient, “Aftercare” aims to diminish the risk of a patient contracting high levels of toxicity in their system due to inaccurate dosage of [[Management of HIV/AIDS|anti-retroviral treatment]] drugs.&lt;ref name=Kinkade&gt;{{cite journal|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== M4D in health ===

According to a report by [[InfoDev]], “[h]ealth conditions in rural areas are generally poorer, and access to information, services, and supplies is most limited.”&lt;ref name="Kinkade"/&gt;   With the rapid worldwide adoption of mobile technology, a range of health-related areas such as the improvement of [[public health]] information dissemination, the facilitation of remote consultation, diagnosis, and treatment, the sharing of a patient’s health information between health professional, and the monitoring and increased efficiency of public health systems have adopted and benefited from mobile based practices.&lt;ref name="Kinkade"/&gt;

Studies have suggested that the use of mobile capabilities such as [[text message]] reminders regarding [[Defined daily dose|dosage information]] and the increased communication between health professionals has allowed for increased effectiveness in treatment and control of disease.&lt;ref name="Vodafone Group"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vodafone Group|title=The Role of Mobile Phones in Increasing Accessibility and Efficiency in Health Care|journal=Vodafone Group Policy Paper Series|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cases of mobile technology being effectively piloted and utilized in the area of public health exhibits the promise of M4D programs and practices in the spheres of health prevention and medical care for the world’s developing nations.

The following lists a sampling of programs utilizing M4D strategies for the improvement of public health in developing countries around the world:

* [[Academy for Educational Development|Academy for Educational Development’s]] [http://www.healthnet.org/ Satellife] program – A non-profit program exploring the increased potential of a health workers’ ability to diagnose and treat illnesses due to the information that can be delivered over mobile networks of health professionals.&lt;ref name="Kinkade"/&gt;
* [http://www.cell-life.org/ Cell-Life] – Cell-Life is an [[NGO]] engaging in development programs that promote and assist in the collection of medical data on mobile devices in order to better disseminate information and promote better patient and public health management.  In conjunction with [[Columbia University]]'s [[International Center for AIDS Care and Treatment Programs – ICAP|International Center for AIDS Care and Treatment Programs]], Cell-Life is working on the development of mobile technology based [[Behaviour change method|behaviour change communications]] (BCC) that aims to address the increasing incidence of HIV as well as morbidity and mortality rates amongst the South African homosexual population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SMS Based HIV &amp; AIDS Behaviour Change Communications for MSM in South Africa - ICAP Project|url=https://www.cell-life.org/projects/sms-based-hiv-aids-behaviour-change-communications-for-msm-in-south-africa-icap-project/|publisher=Cell-Life|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Their campaigns [https://www.cell-life.org/projects/sms-based-hiv-aids-behaviour-change-communications-for-msm-in-south-africa-icap-project/ 'HealthSmart' and 'Just-Tested'] aim to promote safer sexual practices and provide information pertaining to HIV prevention and care through the use of [[SMS]].  The [[World Health Organization]] has also partnered with Cell-Life in order to evaluate the use of mobile phones in reference to medical abortion in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;ref name=m-assist&gt;{{cite web|title=m-assist: Mobile in Medical Abortion|url=http://www.cell-life.org/projects/m-assist/|publisher=Cell-Life|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The m-assist project "aimed to assess whether the combination of information, self-assessment and support provided via mobile phones would reduce the need for follow-up visits by clients; enhance the experience of MA; reduce demands on MA providers; and increase post-abortion knowledge and uptake of contraception."&lt;ref name="m-assist"/&gt;   Through the use of SMS, women were coached through the process of [[Medical abortion|MA]], asked to self-assess their completion of MA, and were offered family planning information.&lt;ref name="m-assist"/&gt;  Cell-Life also runs programs without external partnerships.  Cell-Life's program Red aims to offer South African youth easy access to HIV/AIDS related information in order to improve levels of knowledge pertaining to prevention.&lt;ref name=Red&gt;{{cite web|title=Red|url=http://www.cell-life.org/projects/red/|publisher=Cell-Life|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Red also aims through the use of mobile platforms to create a private, affordable, and easily accessible space in which those suffering from or affected by HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Red"/&gt;

== Affiliated programs ==

The ability to mobilize data aggregation to the mobile-carrying public offers NGOs a valuable resource for their efforts for social, political, economic, and environmental justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinkade|first=Sheila|title=Wireless Technology for Social Change|year=2008|publisher=UN Foundation-Vodafone Group Foundation Partnership|location=Washington, DC and Berkshire, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;   According to a study published by the Vodafone Group Foundation and the UN Foundation Partnership, of a sample of over 500 NGOs, “eighty-six per cent used mobiles, with 99 per cent characterizing its utility positively, with one-quarter of those citing it as a ‘revolutionary’ technology and another one-third calling it indispensable for their work.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinkade|first=Sheila|title=Wireless Technology for Social Change|year=2008|publisher=UN Foundation-Vodafone Group Foundation Partnership|location=Washington, DC and Berkshire, UK|page=6|url=http://www.dochas.ie/Shared/Files/4/Trends_in_mobile_use_by_NGOs[2].pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The benefits perceived by M4D initiatives include their "ability to mobilize and aggregate information and data more effectively and to a wider audience" as well as their time-saving qualities in the fields of social justice, environmental conservation, global health and humanitarian assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shade|first=Leslie|title=Mobilizing for Development: Promises, Perils, and Policy Implications of M4D|year=2013|editor1-first=Suzan|editor1-last=Ilcan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following lists organizations engaging in M4D strategies and programming:

* [[GSMA|GSMA Mobile for Development]]
* [[United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force|United Nations ICT Task Force]]
* [[FrontlineSMS]]
* [[Fahamu]]
* [[SOAWR|Solidarity for African Women’s Rights]] [http://www.soawr.org/en/about/ (SOAWR)]
* [[UNAIDS]]
* [[TechChange]]

== Criticisms and challenges ==

The potential for the expansion and replication of M4D projects has been recognized as vital to the overall success of this development practice.&lt;ref name=Kinkade&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kinkade|first=Sheila|author2=Katrin Verclas|title=Wireless Technology for Social Change: Trends in Mobile Use by NGOs|journal=Access to Communication Publication Series|date=2008|volume=2|pages=1–60|publisher=The Vodafone Group Foundation and the UN Foundation Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sharing and exchange of information and technical advancements can allow for easier and less costly adoption in other developing countries however, many of the organizations creating and implementing M4D projects act within 'innovation silos'.&lt;ref name="Kinkade"/&gt; This siloing of information threatens to create and solidify boundaries between organizations and mobile development projects.

The environmental implications of increased mobile usage can be seen in the form of the large [[Electronic waste|electronic waste dumps]] found in many of the developing countries meant to benefit from M4D programs and policies.

In addition, it has been argued that the introduction of mobile information and communication technologies could result in the proliferation of the [[Matthew effect]], whereby the "rich get richer."  In the case of mobile adoption, the inequalities of wealth considered encompass both economic and knowledge-based wealth.  Despite the benefits attributed to the adoption and use of mobile ICTs for development purposes, the information and communication resources in question have been initially created and adopted within already developed countries.&lt;ref name=Pearce&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Katy E.|author2=Ronald E.

:Even though eventually almost everyone might benefit from a resource such as the Internet, those with the most resources (status, cognition, education, income, access) adopt first, have and gain more skills, and use more and different activities more effectively.  They thus obtain earlier and more benefits, thereby ''increasing'', rather than ''reducing'', knowledge gaps in society.&lt;ref name=Pearce&gt;{{cite journal|page=722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also problematic is the potential for mobile hardware and software development in developing countries to become a purely for-profit endeavour.  As stated by a UN Foundation-Vodafone Group Foundation Partnership publication, "the potential for scaling up 'mobile for good' initiatives may come with identifying commercial incentives."&lt;ref name="Kinkade"/&gt;  The free and open source software applications that have been developed and implemented by various NGOs in developing countries as well as the ad-hoc communal use of mobile devices could be threatened by the prospective monetization of the mass markets available in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mobilities, Knowledge, and Social Justice|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Kingston|isbn=978-0-7735-8882-0|pages=340–360|author=Shade, Leslie|chapter=14.

'''Molinology''' (from [[Latin]]: molīna, mill; and [[Greek language|Greek]] λόγος, study) is the study of mills and other mechanical devices which use the energy of moving water or wind, or the strength of animal or human muscle to power machines for purposes such as [[hammer]]ing, [[Grinder (milling)|grinding]], [[pump]]ing, [[saw]]ing, [[Crusher|pressing]] or [[fulling]]. More particularly, molinology aims to retain the knowledge of those traditional engines which have been rendered obsolete by modern technical and economic trends. 

The term "Molinology" was coined in 1965 by the Portuguese industrial historian João Miguel dos Santos Simões. 

Cultural and scientific interest in molinology is maintained by [[The International Molinological Society]] (TIMS), a non-profit organisation which brings together around five hundred members worldwide. It was founded in 1973 after earlier international symposia in 1965 and 1969.

NB-IoT focuses specifically on indoor coverage, low cost, long battery life, and high connection density. NB-IoT uses a subset of the LTE standard, but limits the bandwidth to a single narrow-band of 200kHz.

The '''Neolithic Revolution''', '''Neolithic Demographic Transition''', '''Agricultural Revolution''', or '''First Agricultural Revolution''' was the wide-scale transition of many [[human culture]]s during the [[Neolithic]] period from a lifestyle of [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] to one of [[agriculture]] and [[sedentism|settlement]], making an increasingly larger population possible.&lt;ref name=SCNDR&gt;{{cite journal|title= When the World's Population Took Off: The Springboard of the Neolithic Demographic Transition|journal= Science|date= July 29, 2011|volume= 333|issue= 6042|pages= 560–561|doi= 10.1126/science.1208880|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6042/560.full|accessdate= June 10, 2012|author= Jean-Pierre Bocquet-Appel|bibcode = 2011Sci...333..560B|pmid= 21798934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These settled communities permitted humans to observe and experiment with plants to learn how they grew and developed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Worlds together, worlds apart concise edition vol.1 |last = Pollard, Rosenberg, and Tigor |publisher = W.W.

Archaeological data indicates that the [[domestication]] of various types of plants and animals happened in separate locations worldwide, starting in the [[Geologic time scale|geological]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] of the [[Holocene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.westfalen-blatt.de/nachricht/2012-11-25-klimaschutz-die-ziele-schmelzen-dahin/613/

The Neolithic Revolution greatly narrowed the diversity of foods available, resulting in a downturn in human nutrition.&lt;ref name=Armelagos2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Armelagos|first1= George J.|title= Brain Evolution, the Determinates of Food Choice, and the Omnivore's Dilemma|journal= Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|volume= 54|issue= 10|year= 2014|pages= 1330–1341|issn= 1040-8398|doi= 10.1080/10408398.2011.635817|pmid= 24564590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neolithic Revolution involved far more than the adoption of a limited set of food-producing techniques. During the next millennia it would transform the small and mobile groups of hunter-gatherers that had hitherto dominated [[human history|human pre-history]] into [[sedentism|sedentary]] (non-[[nomad]]ic) [[society|societies]] based in built-up villages and towns. These societies radically modified their [[natural environment]] by means of specialized food-crop cultivation, with activities such as [[irrigation]] and [[deforestation]] which allowed the production of surplus food.  Other developments found very widely are the [[domestication of animals]],  [[pottery]], polished stone tools, and rectangular houses.

These developments, sometimes called the '''Neolithic package''', provided the basis for centralized administrations and political structures, hierarchical [[ideology|ideologies]], depersonalized systems of knowledge (e.g. [[history of writing|writing]]), [[population density|densely populated]] settlements, specialization and [[division of labour]], more [[trade]], the development of non-portable [[art]] and [[architecture]], and [[property]] ownership.  The earliest known [[civilization]] developed in [[Sumer]] in southern [[Mesopotamia]] ({{circa|6,500 [[Before Present|BP]]}}); its emergence also heralded the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.ancient.eu/Neolithic/|title= Neolithic|work= Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date= 2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship of the above-mentioned Neolithic characteristics to the onset of agriculture, their sequence of emergence, and empirical relation to each other at various Neolithic sites remains the subject of academic debate, and varies from place to place, rather than being the outcome of universal laws of [[social evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/images/neolithic_agriculture.htm "The Slow Birth of Agriculture"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101201656/http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/images/neolithic_agriculture.htm |date=2011-01-01 }}, [[Heather Pringle]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/middle_east/zawichemishanidar.html |title=Wizard Chemi Shanidar |work=EMuseum |publisher=[[Minnesota State University]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618214404/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/middle_east/zawichemishanidar.html |archive-date=June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Levant]] saw the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BCE, followed by sites in the wider [[Fertile Crescent]].

The term ''Neolithic Revolution'' was coined in 1923 by [[V. Gordon Childe]] to describe the first in a series of agricultural revolutions in [[Middle East]]ern history. The period is described as a "revolution" to denote its importance, and the great significance and degree of change affecting the communities in which new agricultural practices were gradually adopted and refined.

The beginning of this process in different regions has been dated from 10,000 to 8,000 BC in the [[Fertile Crescent]]&lt;ref name=Barker2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thissen2002&gt;Thissen, L. "Appendix I, The CANeW 14C databases, Anatolia 10,000-5000 cal. BC." in: F. Gérard and L. Thissen (eds.), '' The Neolithic of Central Anatolia. Internal developments and external relations during the 9th–6th millennia cal BC'', Proc. Int.  CANeW Round Table, Istanbul 23–24 November 2001, (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps 8000 BC in the [[Kuk Swamp|Kuk Early Agricultural Site]] of [[Melanesia]].&lt;ref name="Denham2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Denham|first = Tim P.|authorlink =|year = 2003|title = Origins of Agriculture at Kuk Swamp in the Highlands of New Guinea|journal = Science|volume = 301|issue = 5630|pages = 189–193|doi = 10.1126/science.1085255| pmid = 12817084 |author3 = and others|displayauthors = 2|last2 = Haberle|first2 = S.

Recent archaeological research suggests that in some regions such as the Southeast Asian peninsula, the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculturalist was not linear, but region-specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kealhofer |first=Lisa |title=Looking into the gap: land use and the tropical forests of southern Thailand |journal=Asian Perspectives |date=2003 |volume=42 |issue=1|pages=72–95 |doi=10.1353/asi.2003.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several competing (but not mutually exclusive) theories as to the factors that drove populations to take up agriculture. The most prominent of these are:
* The Oasis Theory, originally proposed by [[Raphael Pumpelly]] in 1908, popularized by [[V. Gordon Childe]] in 1928 and summarised in Childe's book ''Man Makes Himself''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man Makes Himself|author=Gordon Childe|year=1936|publisher=Oxford university press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory maintains that as the climate got drier due to the Atlantic depressions shifting northward, communities contracted to [[oases]] where they were forced into close association with animals, which were then domesticated together with planting of seeds. However, today this theory has little support amongst archaeologists because subsequent climate data suggests that the region was getting wetter rather than drier.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, Chris (2005). "The World Transformed: From Foragers and Farmers to States and Empires" in ''The Human Past: World Prehistory and the Development of Human Societies'' (Ed: Chris Scarre). London: Thames and Hudson. p. 188. {{ISBN|0500285314}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Hilly Flanks]] hypothesis, proposed by [[Robert Braidwood]] in 1948, suggests that agriculture began in the hilly flanks of the [[Taurus Mountains|Taurus]] and [[Zagros mountains]], where the climate was not drier as Childe had believed, and fertile land supported a variety of plants and animals amenable to domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rise of Civilization: From Early Hunters to Urban Society in the Ancient Near East |author=Charles E. Redman |year=1978 |publisher=Freeman |location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Feasting model by Brian Hayden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayden|first=Brian |chapter=Models of Domestication|title=Transitions to Agriculture in Prehistory |editor=Anne Birgitte Gebauer and T.

* [[Leonid Grinin]] argues that whatever plants were cultivated, the independent invention of agriculture always took place in special natural environments (e.g., South-East Asia). It is supposed that the cultivation of cereals started somewhere in the Near East: in the hills of Palestine or Egypt.

* [[Andrew M. T. Moore|Andrew Moore]] suggested that the Neolithic Revolution originated over long periods of development in the [[Levant]], possibly beginning during the [[Epipaleolithic]]. In ''"A Reassessment of the Neolithic Revolution"'', [[Frank Hole]] further expanded the relationship between plant and [[animal domestication]]. He suggested the events could have occurred independently over different periods of time, in as yet unexplored locations. He noted that no transition site had been found documenting the shift from what he termed immediate and delayed return social systems. He noted that the full range of domesticated animals ([[goat]]s, [[sheep]], [[cattle]] and [[pigs]]) were not found until the sixth millennium at [[Tell Ramad]]. Hole concluded that ''"close attention should be paid in future investigations to the western margins of the [[Euphrates]] basin, perhaps as far south as the [[Arabian Peninsula]], especially where [[wadi]]s carrying Pleistocene rainfall runoff flowed."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/paleo_0153-9345_1984_num_10_2_939 Hole, Frank., A Reassessment of the Neolithic Revolution, Paléorient, Volume 10, Issue 10-2, pp. 49-60, 1984.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Molino neolítico de vaivén.jpg|thumb|right|Neolithic grindstone or [[quern-stone|quern]] for processing grain]]
Once agriculture started gaining momentum, around 9000 BC, human activity resulted in the [[selective breeding]] of cereal grasses (beginning with [[emmer]], [[einkorn]] and [[barley]]), and not simply of those that would favour greater caloric returns through larger seeds. Plants with traits such as small seeds or bitter taste would have been seen as undesirable. Plants that rapidly shed their seeds on maturity tended not to be gathered at harvest, therefore not stored and not seeded the following season; years of harvesting selected for strains that retained their edible seeds longer.

Several plant species, the "pioneer crops" or [[Neolithic founder crops]], were identified by [[Daniel Zohary]], who highlighted the importance of the three [[cereal]]s, and suggested that domestication of [[flax]], [[pea]]s, [[chickpea]]s, [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]] and [[lentil]]s came a little later. Based on analysis of the [[gene]]s of domesticated plants, he preferred theories of a single, or at most a very small number of domestication events for each [[taxon]] that spread in an arc from the [[Levantine corridor]] around the [[Fertile Crescent]] and later into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRi1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=The+Origins+and+Spread+of+Agriculture+and+Pastoralism+in+Eurasia&amp;dq=The+Origins+and+Spread+of+Agriculture+and+Pastoralism+in+Eurasia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jSDLeRcJNI&amp;sig=V8u7my28ypj_bN_lBNIYmGc_HX8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cvUqUIbjFOmf0QXxp4GgCQ&amp;redir_esc=y Zohary, D., The mode of domestication of the founder crops of Southwest Asian agriculture. pp. 142-158 in D.

Selectively propagated [[ficus|figs]], wild barley and wild oats were cultivated at the early Neolithic site of [[Gilgal I]], where in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/06/060602074522.htm|title=Tamed 11,400 Years Ago, Figs Were Likely First Domesticated Crop}}&lt;/ref&gt; archaeologists found caches of seeds of each in quantities too large to be accounted for even by [[intensive gathering]], at strata datable to c. 11,000 years ago. Some of the plants tried and then abandoned during the Neolithic period in the Ancient Near East, at sites like Gilgal, were later successfully domesticated in other parts of the world.

Once early farmers perfected their agricultural techniques like irrigation, their crops would [[Crop yield|yield]] surpluses that needed storage. Most hunter gatherers could not easily store food for long due to their migratory lifestyle, whereas those with a sedentary dwelling could store their surplus grain. Eventually [[granary|granaries]] were developed that allowed villages to store their seeds longer. So with more food, the population expanded and communities developed specialized workers and more advanced tools.

The process was not as linear as was once thought, but a more complicated effort, which was undertaken by different human populations in different regions in many different ways.

===In the Fertile Crescent===

Early agriculture is believed to have originated and become widespread in Southwest [[Asia]] around 10,000–9,000 BP, though earlier individual sites have been identified. The [[Fertile Crescent]] region of Southwest Asia is the centre of domestication for three cereals (einkorn wheat, emmer wheat and barley), four legumes (lentil, pea, bitter vetch and chickpea), and flax. Domestication was a slow process involving multiple sites for each crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Brown | first1=T. A. | last2=Jones | first2=M.

[[File:Nile-River1.ogv|thumb|right|Nile River Valley, Egypt]]

On the African continent, three areas have been identified as independently developing agriculture: the [[Ethiopian Highlands|Ethiopian highlands]], the [[Sahel]] and [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{cite book |last=Diamond|first= Jared|authorlink=Jared Diamond| year=1999|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel|publisher= New York: Norton Press|isbn= 978-0393317558|title-link= Guns, Germs, and Steel}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast,   [[Agriculture in Egypt|Agriculture in the Nile River Valley]] is thought to have developed from the original Neolithic Revolution in the [[Fertile Crescent]]. 
Many grinding stones are found with the early Egyptian [[Sebilian]] and [[Mechian]] cultures and evidence has been found of a neolithic domesticated crop-based economy dating around 7,000 BP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JAca1F3qG34C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Africa,+neolithic&amp;source=web&amp;ots=wWVGAvbwDC&amp;sig=oLsfZADAq2fplcionxe5hXjBgXw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V8GKSaSbO9eitge6-eibBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA76,M1 The Cambridge History of Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, Philip E.L., Stone Age Man on the Nile, Scientific American Vol. 235 No. 2, August 1976: "With the benefit of hindsight we can now see that many Late Paleolithic peoples in the Old World were poised on the brink of plant cultivation and animal husbandry as an alternative to the hunter-gatherer's way of life".&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike the Middle East, this evidence appears as a "false dawn" to agriculture, as the sites were later abandoned, and permanent farming then was delayed until 6,500 BP with the [[Tasian]] and [[Badarian]] cultures and the arrival of crops and animals from the Near East.

[[Bananas]] and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], which were first domesticated in [[Southeast Asia]], most likely [[Papua New Guinea]], were re-domesticated in Africa possibly as early as 5,000 years ago. Asian yams and [[taro]] were also cultivated in Africa.&lt;ref name="diamond"/&gt;

The most famous crop domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands is [[coffee]]. In addition, [[khat]], [[ensete]], [[noog]], [[teff]] and [[finger millet]] were also domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands. Crops domesticated in the Sahel region include [[sorghum]] and [[pearl millet]]. The [[kola nut]] was first domesticated in West Africa. Other crops domesticated in West Africa include [[African rice]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]] and the [[oil palm]].&lt;ref name="diamond"/&gt;

Agriculture spread to Central and Southern Africa in the [[Bantu expansion]] during the 1st millennium BC to 1st millennium AD.

===In the Americas===
{{further|New World Crops|Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Oasisamerica|Proto-Uto-Aztecan}}

[[Maize]] (corn), [[beans]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]] were among the earliest crops domesticated in [[Mesoamerica]], with maize beginning about 4000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Johannessen, S. |editor2=Hastorf, C.

[[Potatoes]] and [[manioc]] were domesticated in [[South America]]. In what is now the eastern United States, Native Americans domesticated [[sunflower]], [[sumpweed]] and [[goosefoot]] around 2500 BC. Sedentary village life based on farming did not develop until the second millennium BC, referred to as the formative period.&lt;ref name="Barker2009p252"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graeme Barker|title=The Agricultural Revolution in Prehistory: Why Did Foragers Become Farmers?|page=  252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fkifXu2gx4YC|accessdate=4 January 2012|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199559954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In New Guinea===
Evidence of drainage ditches at [[Kuk Swamp]] on the borders of the [[Western Highlands Province|Western]] and [[Southern Highlands Province|Southern Highlands]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] shows evidence of the cultivation of [[taro]] and a variety of other crops, dating back to 11,000 BP. Two potentially significant economic species, taro (''[[Colocasia esculenta]]'') and [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] (''[[Dioscorea]]'' sp.), have been identified dating at least to 10,200 calibrated years before present (cal BP). Further evidence of [[banana]]s and [[sugarcane]] dates to 6,950 to 6,440 BP. This was at the altitudinal limits of these crops, and it has been suggested that cultivation in more favourable ranges in the lowlands may have been even earlier. [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] has found evidence that taro was introduced into the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|Solomon Islands]] for human use, from 28,000 years ago, making taro cultivation the earliest crop in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Denham, Tim et al. (received July 2005) "Early and mid Holocene tool-use and processing of taro (''Colocasia esculenta''), yam (''Dioscorea'' sp.) and other plants at Kuk Swamp in the highlands of Papua New Guinea" (Journal of Archaeological Science, Volume 33, Issue 5, May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoy, Thomas &amp; Matthew Springs (1992), " Direct evidence for human use of plants 28,000 years ago: starch residues on stone artefacts from the northern Solomon Islands" (Antiquity  Volume: 66,  Number: 253, pp. 898–912)&lt;/ref&gt;  It seems to have resulted in the spread of the [[Trans–New Guinea languages]] from New Guinea east into the Solomon Islands and west into [[Timor]] and adjacent areas of [[Indonesia]]. This seems to confirm the theories of [[Carl O. Sauer|Carl Sauer]] who, in "Agricultural Origins and Dispersals", suggested as early as 1952 that this region was a centre of early agriculture.

==Domestication of animals==
{{Further|Domestication of animals}}
When hunter-gathering began to be replaced by sedentary food production it became more profitable to keep animals close at hand.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Therefore, it became necessary to bring animals permanently to their settlements, although in many cases there was a distinction between relatively sedentary farmers and nomadic herders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/|title=The Development of Agriculture|work=Genographic Project|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en-US|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414142437/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/|archivedate=2016-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=November 2016}} The animals' size, temperament, diet, mating patterns, and life span were factors in the desire and success in domesticating animals. Animals that provided milk, such as cows and goats, offered a source of protein that was renewable and therefore quite valuable. The animal’s ability as a worker (for example ploughing or towing), as well as a food source, also had to be taken into account. Besides being a direct source of food, certain animals could provide leather, wool, hides, and fertilizer. Some of the earliest domesticated animals included dogs ([[East Asia]], about 15,000 years ago),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Domestication of animals in the Middle East===
[[File:Menare.jpg|Dromedary caravan in Algeria|thumb|right]]

The Middle East served as the source for many animals that could be domesticated, such as sheep, goats and pigs. This area was also the first region to [[domesticate]] the [[dromedary]]. [[Henri Fleisch]] discovered and termed the [[Shepherd Neolithic]] [[flint]] industry from the [[Bekaa Valley]] in [[Lebanon]] and suggested that it could have been used by the earliest [[nomad]]ic [[shepherd]]s. He dated this industry to the [[Epipaleolithic]] or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] as it is evidently not [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]] or even [[Pottery]] [[Neolithic]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleisch, Henri., Notes de Préhistoire Libanaise : 1) Ard es Saoude. 2) La Bekaa Nord. 3) Un polissoir en plein air. BSPF, vol. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of these animals gave the region a large advantage in cultural and economic development. As the climate in the Middle East changed and became drier, many of the farmers were forced to leave, taking their domesticated animals with them. It was this massive emigration from the Middle East that would later help distribute these animals to the rest of [[Afroeurasia]]. This emigration was mainly on an east-west axis of similar climates, as crops usually have a narrow optimal climatic range outside of which they cannot grow for reasons of light or rain changes. For instance, wheat does not normally grow in tropical climates, just like tropical crops such as bananas do not grow in colder climates. Some authors, like [[Jared Diamond]], have postulated that this East-West axis is the main reason why plant and animal domestication spread so quickly from the [[Fertile Crescent]] to the rest of Eurasia and North Africa, while it did not reach through the North-South axis of [[Africa]] to reach the Mediterranean climates of [[South Africa]], where temperate crops were successfully imported by ships in the last 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]: The Fates of Human Societies''. [[Jared Diamond]] (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the African [[Zebu]] of central Africa and the domesticated bovines of the fertile-crescent — separated by the dry sahara desert — were not introduced into each other's region.

==Consequences==

===Social change===
[[File:World population growth (lin-log scale).png|thumb|left|320px|World population (estimated) did not rise for a few millennia after the Neolithic revolution.]]

Despite the significant technological advance, the Neolithic revolution did not lead immediately to a rapid growth of population. Its benefits appear to have been offset by various adverse effects,
mostly diseases and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[[James C. Scott]],''Against the Grain: a Deep History of the Earliest States'', NJ:Yale UP, (2017), "The world's population in 10 000 BC, according to a careful estimate was roughly 4 million. A full five thousand years later it has risen only to 5 million...One likely explanation for this apparent human progress in subsistance techniques together with a long period of demographic stagnation is that epidemologically this was perhaps the most lethal period in human history".&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of agriculture has not necessarily led to unequivocal progress. The nutritional standards of the growing Neolithic populations were inferior to that of hunter-gatherers. Several ethnological and archaeological studies conclude that the transition to cereal-based diets caused a reduction in life expectancy and stature, an increase in infant mortality and infectious diseases, the development of chronic, inflammatory or degenerative diseases (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and multiple nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia and mineral disorders affecting bones (such as osteoporosis and rickets) and teeth.&lt;ref name="SandsMorris2009"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Sands DC, Morris CE, Dratz EA, Pilgeram A| title=Elevating optimal human nutrition to a central goal of plant breeding and production of plant-based foods. | journal=Plant Sci | year= 2009 | volume= 177 | issue= 5 | pages= 377–389 | pmid=20467463 | doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.07.011 | pmc=2866137 |  type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKeefeCordain2004"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=O'Keefe JH, Cordain L| title=Cardiovascular disease resulting from a diet and lifestyle at odds with our Paleolithic genome: how to become a 21st-century hunter-gatherer. | journal=Mayo Clin Proc | year= 2004 | volume= 79 | issue= 1 | pages= 101–108 | pmid=14708953 | doi=10.4065/79.1.101 | type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shermer, Michael 2001 p.250"&gt;{{cite book |author=Shermer, Michael |authorlink=Michael Shermer |year=2001 |title=The Borderlands of Science |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average height went down from 5'10" (178&amp;nbsp;cm) for men and 5'6" (168&amp;nbsp;cm) for women to 5'5" (165&amp;nbsp;cm) and 5'1" (155&amp;nbsp;cm), respectively, and it took until the twentieth century for average human height to come back to the pre-Neolithic Revolution levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hermanussen | first=Michael | last2=Poustka | first2=Fritz | title=Stature of early Europeans | journal=Hormones (Athens) | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=175–178 |date=July–September 2003 | pmid=17003019 | doi=10.1159/000079404 | url=http://hormones.gr/preview.php?c_id=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional view is that agricultural food production supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. The development of larger societies led to the development of different means of decision making and to governmental organization. Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite who were not otherwise engaged in agriculture, industry or commerce, but dominated their communities by other means and monopolized decision-making.&lt;ref name="Eagly99"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eagly, Alice H. |author2=Wood, Wendy |title=The Origins of Sex Differences in Human Behavior: Evolved Dispositions Versus Social Roles |journal=American Psychologist |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=June 1999 |pages=408–423 |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/facets/eagly&amp;wood.htm |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.6.408}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] (in [[The World Until Yesterday]]) identifies the availability of milk and cereal grains as permitting mothers to raise both an older (e.g. 3 or 4 year old) and a younger child concurrently. The result is that a population can increase more rapidly. Diamond, in agreement with feminist scholars such as [[V. Spike Peterson]], points out that agriculture brought about deep social divisions and encouraged [[gender inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Diamond, Jared |authorlink=Jared Diamond |url=http://discovermagazine.com/1987/may/02-the-worst-mistake-in-the-history-of-the-human-race  |title=The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race |journal=Discover Magazine |date=May 1987 |pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=V.

===Subsequent revolutions===
[[File:Egyptian Domesticated Animals.jpg|thumb|Domesticated cow being milked in [[Ancient Egypt]]]]

[[Andrew Sherratt]] has argued that following upon the Neolithic Revolution was a second phase of discovery that he refers to as the [[secondary products revolution]]. Animals, it appears, were first domesticated purely as a source of meat.&lt;ref name="Sherratt 1981"&gt;Sherratt 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The Secondary Products Revolution occurred when it was recognised that animals also provided a number of other useful products. These included:
* [[History of hide materials|hides and skins (from undomesticated animals)]]
* [[manure]] for soil conditioning (from all domesticated animals)
* [[wool]] (from sheep, llamas, alpacas, and [[Angora goat]]s)
* [[milk]] (from goats, cattle, yaks, sheep, horses and camels)
* [[Working animal|traction]] (from oxen, [[onagers]], donkeys, horses, camels and dogs)
* guarding and herding assistance (dogs)

Sherratt argued that this phase in agricultural development enabled humans to make use of the energy possibilities of their animals in new ways, and permitted permanent intensive subsistence farming and crop production, and the opening up of heavier soils for farming. It also made possible [[nomadic pastoralism]] in semi arid areas, along the margins of deserts, and eventually led to the domestication of both the [[dromedary]] and [[Bactrian camel]].&lt;ref name="Sherratt 1981"/&gt; Overgrazing of these areas, particularly by herds of goats, greatly extended the areal extent of deserts.

Living in one spot would have more easily permitted the accrual of personal possessions and an attachment to certain areas of land. From such a position, it is argued{{by whom|date=May 2015}}, prehistoric people were able to stockpile food to survive lean times and trade unwanted surpluses with others. Once [[trade]] and a secure food supply were established, populations could grow, and society would have diversified into food producers and artisans, who could afford to develop their trade by virtue of the free time they enjoyed because of a surplus of food. The artisans, in turn, were able to develop technology such as metal weapons. Such relative complexity would have required some form of social organisation to work efficiently, so it is likely that populations that had such organisation, perhaps such as that provided by religion, were better prepared and more successful. In addition, the denser populations could form and support legions of professional soldiers. Also, during this time property ownership became increasingly important to all people. Ultimately, Childe argued that this growing social complexity, all rooted in the original decision to settle, led to a second [[Urban Revolution]] in which the first cities were built.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Disease===

Throughout the development of sedentary societies, disease spread more rapidly than it had during the time in which hunter-gatherer societies existed. Inadequate sanitary practices and the domestication of animals may explain the rise in deaths and sickness following the Neolithic Revolution, as diseases jumped from the animal to the human population. Some examples of [[infectious diseases]] spread from animals to humans are [[influenza]], [[smallpox]], and [[measles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Furuse | first1=Y. | last2=Suzuki | first2=A. | last3=Oshitani | first3=H. | title=Origin of measles virus: Divergence from rinderpest virus between the 11th and 12th centuries | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-7-52 | journal=Virology Journal | volume=7 | page=52 | year=2010 | pmc=2838858 | pmid=20202190}}&lt;/ref&gt; In concordance with a process of [[natural selection]], the humans who first domesticated the big [[mammals]] quickly built up immunities to the diseases as within each generation the individuals with better immunities had better chances of survival. In their approximately 10,000 years of shared proximity with animals, such as cows, Eurasians and Africans became more resistant to those diseases compared with the indigenous populations encountered outside [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel|Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]''.  [[Jared Diamond]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the population of most [[Caribbean]] and several [[Pacific Islands]] have been completely wiped out by diseases. 90% or more of many populations of the Americas were [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|wiped out by European and African diseases]] before recorded contact with European explorers or colonists. Some cultures like the [[Inca Empire]] did have a large domestic mammal, the [[llama]], but llama milk was not drunk, nor did llamas live in a closed space with humans, so the risk of contagion was limited. According to bioarchaeological research, the effects of agriculture on physical and dental health in Southeast Asian rice farming societies from 4000 to 1500 B.P. was not detrimental to the same extent as in other world regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Halcrow |first=S. |author2=E., Harris, N. J., Tayles, N., Ikehara‐Quebral, R., &amp; Pietrusewsky, M. |title=From the mouths of babes: Dental caries in infants and children and the intensification of agriculture in mainland Southeast Asia |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |date=2013 |volume=150 |issue=3 |pages=409–420 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.22215 |pmid=23359102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===

In his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', [[Jared Diamond]] argues that Europeans and East Asians benefited from an advantageous geographical location that afforded them a head start in the Neolithic Revolution. Both shared the temperate climate ideal for the first agricultural settings, both were near a number of easily [[domestication|domesticable]] plant and animal species, and both were safer from attacks of other people than civilizations in the middle part of the Eurasian continent. Being among the first to adopt agriculture and sedentary lifestyles, and neighboring other early agricultural societies with whom they could compete and trade, both Europeans and East Asians were also among the first to benefit from technologies such as [[firearm]]s and steel [[sword]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/british_prehistory/overview_british_prehistory_01.shtml|title=BBC – History – Ancient History in depth: Overview: From Neolithic to Bronze Age, 8000–800 BC|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--During and after the [[Age of Discovery]], European explorers, such as the Spanish [[conquistador]]s, encountered other groups of people who had never or only recently adopted agriculture. (SO WHAT?)--&gt;

==Archaeogenetics==
The dispersal of Neolithic culture from the Middle East has recently been associated with the distribution of human genetic markers. In Europe, the spread of the Neolithic culture has been associated with distribution of the [[E1b1b]] lineages and [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup J]] that are thought to have arrived in Europe from North Africa and the Near East respectively.&lt;ref name="semino2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Semino|year=2004|title=Origin, Diffusion, and Differentiation of Y-Chromosome Haplogroups E and J: Inferences on the Neolithization of Europe and Later Migratory Events in the Mediterranean Area|pmid=15069642|first1=O|last2=Magri|first2=C|last3=Benuzzi|first3=G|last4=Lin|first4=AA|last5=Al-Zahery|first5=N|last6=Battaglia|first6=V|last7=MacCioni|first7=L|last8=Triantaphyllidis|first8=C|last9=Shen|first9=P|volume=74|issue=5|pages=1023–34|doi=10.1086/386295|pmc=1181965|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|displayauthors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lancaster"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lancaster|first=Andrew|year=2009|url=http://www.jogg.info/51/files/Lancaster.pdf|journal=Journal of Genetic Genealogy|volume=5|issue=1|title=Y Haplogroups, Archaeological Cultures and Language Families: a Review of the Multidisciplinary Comparisons using the case of E-M35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa, the spread of farming, and notably the [[Bantu expansion]], is associated with the dispersal of Y-chromosome haplogroup [[E1b1a]] from West Africa.&lt;ref name="semino2004"/&gt;

'''Neophile''' or '''Neophiliac''', a term popularised by cult writer [[Robert Anton Wilson]],  is a personality type characterized by a strong affinity for [[novelty]]. The term was used earlier by [[Christopher Booker]] in his book [[The Neophiliacs]] (1969), and by [[J. D. Salinger]] in his short story [[Hapworth 16, 1924]] (1965).

==Characteristics==
Neophiles/Neophiliacs have the following basic characteristics:

* The ability to adapt rapidly to extreme change.
* A distaste or downright loathing of [[tradition]], repetition, and routine.
* A tendency to become bored quickly with old things.
* A desire, bordering on obsession in some cases, to experience novelty.
* A corresponding and related desire to create novelty by creating or achieving something and/or by stirring social or other forms of unrest.
* A complete objection to or distrust of commitment.

A neophile is distinct from a [[revolutionary]] in that anyone might become a revolutionary if pushed far enough by the reigning authorities or social norms, whereas neophiles are revolutionaries by nature. Their intellectual abhorrence of tradition and repetition usually bemoans a deeper emotional need for constant novelty and change. The meaning of neophile approaches and is not mutually exclusive to the term [[visionary]], but differs in that a neophile actively seeks first-hand experience of novelty rather than merely pontificating about it.

The opposite of a neophile is a [[neophobia|neophobe]]; a person with an aversion to novelty and change. Wilson observes that neophobes tend to regard neophiles, especially extreme ones, with fear and contempt, and to brand them with titles such as "[[witch]]," "[[satanist]]," "[[heresy|heretic]]," etc. He also speculates in his [[Prometheus Rising]] series of books that the [[industrial revolution]] and related [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] represents one of the first periods of history in which neophiles were a dominant force in society. Neophiles accelerate change because they like it that way.

==Types==
Open-source advocate and programmer [[Eric S. Raymond]] observes that this personality is especially prevalent in certain fields of expertise; in business, these are primarily [[computer science]] and other areas of high technology. Raymond speculates that the rapid progress of these fields (especially computers) is a result of this. A neophile's love of novelty is likely to lead them into subjects outside of the normal areas of human interest. Raymond observes a high concentration of neophiles in or around what he calls "leading edge subcultures" such as science fiction fandom, [[neo-paganism]], [[transhumanism]], etc. as well as in or around nontraditional areas of thought such as fringe philosophy or the [[occult]]. Raymond observes that most neophiles have roving interests and tend to be widely well-read.

There is more than one type of neophile. There are social neophiles (the extreme social butterfly), intellectual neophiles (the revolutionary [[philosopher]] and the [[technophile]]), and physical/kinetic neophiles (the [[extreme sports]] enthusiast). These tendencies are not mutually exclusive, and might exist simultaneously in the same individual.

The word "neophilia" has particular significance in Internet and [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] culture. ''The New Hacker's Dictionary'' gave the following definition to neophilia:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The trait of being excited and pleased by novelty. Common among most hackers, [[Science fiction|SF]] fans, and members of several other connected leading-edge subcultures, including the pro-technology '[[Whole Earth Review|Whole Earth]]' wing of the [[ecology movement]], [[space activist]]s, many members of [[Mensa International|Mensa]], and the [[Discordianism|Discordian]]/[[neo-pagan]] underground (see [[geek]]). All these groups overlap heavily and (where evidence is available) seem to share characteristic hacker tropisms for science fiction, [[music]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Research has uncovered a possible link between certain predisposition to some kind of neophilia and increased levels of the enzyme [[monoamine oxidase]] A.&lt;ref name="pmid16538181"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shiraishi H, Suzuki A, Fukasawa T, Aoshima T, Ujiie Y, Ishii G, Otani K | title = Monoamine oxidase A gene promoter polymorphism affects novelty seeking and reward dependence in healthy study participants | journal = Psychiatr.

'''Normalization process theory''' ('''NPT''') is a derivative  [[sociological theory]] of the implementation, embedding, and integration of new technologies and organizational innovations developed originally from a collective set of learning workshops and included a large number of people including [[Carl R. May]], Tracy Finch, Elizabeth Murray, Anne Rogers, Catherine Pope, Anne Kennedy, Pauline Ong and . The theory is a contribution to the field of [[science and technology studies]] (STS), and is the result of a programme of theory building by May and a range of academics from applied social science to medicine.&lt;ref&gt;May CR, Mair F, Finch T, Macfarlane A, Dowrick C, Treweek S, Rapley T, Ballini L, Ong BN, Rogers A, Murray E, Elwyn G, Légaré F, Gunn J, Montori VM. Development of a theory of implementation and integration: normalization process theory. Implement Sci. 2009 May 21;4:29.&lt;/ref&gt; Through three iterations, the theory has built upon the [[normalization process model]] previously developed by May et al. to explain the social processes that lead to the routine embedding of innovative health technologies.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2006. A rational model for assessing and evaluating complex interventions in health care. BMC Health Services Research. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, C., et al., 2007. Understanding the implementation of complex interventions in health care: the normalization process model. BMC Health Services Research. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normalization process theory focuses attention on agentic contributions – the things that individuals and groups do to operationalize new or modified modes of practice as they interact with dynamic elements of their environments. It defines the implementation, embedding, and integration as a process that occurs when participants deliberately initiate and seek to sustain a sequence of events that bring it into operation. The dynamics of implementation processes are complex, but normalization process theory facilitates understanding by focusing attention on the mechanisms through which participants invest and contribute to them. It reveals  "the work that actors do as they engage with some ensemble of activities (that may include new or changed ways of thinking, acting, and organizing) and by which means it becomes routinely embedded in the matrices of already existing, socially patterned, knowledge and practices".&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Finch, T., 2009. Implementation, embedding, and integration: an outline of Normalization Process Theory. Sociology. 43(3), 535-554.&lt;/ref&gt;  These have explored objects, agents, and contexts. In a paper published under a [[creative commons license]], May and colleagues describe how, since 2006, NPT has undergone three iterations.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Sibley, A. and Hunt, K. (2014) 'The nursing work of hospital-based clinical practice guideline implementation: An explanatory systematic review using Normalisation Process Theory', International Journal of Nursing Studies, 51(2), 289-299&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Objects''. The first iteration of the theory focused attention on the relationship between the properties of a complex healthcare intervention and the collective action of its users. Here, agents' contributions are made in reciprocal relationship with the emergent capability that they find in the objects – the ensembles of behavioural and cognitive practices – that they enact. These socio-material capabilities are governed by the possibilities and constraints presented by objects, and the extent to which they can be made workable and integrated in practice as they are mobilized.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2006. A rational model for assessing and evaluating complex interventions in health care. BMC Health Services Research. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, C., et al., 2007. Understanding the implementation of complex interventions in health care: the normalization process model. BMC Health Services Research. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Agents''. The second iteration of the theory built on the analysis of collective action, and showed how this was linked to the mechanisms through which people make their activities meaningful and build commitments to them.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Finch, T., 2009. Implementation, embedding, and integration: an outline of Normalization Process Theory. Sociology. 43, 535-554.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, investments of social structural and social cognitive resources are expressed as emergent contributions to social action through a set of generative mechanisms: coherence (what people do to make sense of objects, agency, and contexts); cognitive participation (what people do to initiate and be enrolled into delivering an ensemble of practices); collective action (what people do to enact those practices); and reflexive monitoring (what people do to appraise the consequences of their contributions). These constructs are the core of the theory, and provide the foundation of its analytic purchase on practice. 
* ''Contexts''. The third iteration of the theory developed the analysis of agentic contributions by offering an account of centrally important structural and cognitive resources on which agents draw as they take action.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2013. Towards a general theory of implementation. Implementation Science. 8, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, dynamic elements of social contexts are experienced by agents as capacity (the social structural resources, that they possess, including informational and material resources, and social norms and roles) and potential (the social cognitive resources that they possess, including knowledge and beliefs, and individual intentions and shared commitments). These resources are mobilized by agents when they invest in the ensembles of practices that are the objects of implementation.

Normalization process theory is regarded as a [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle range theory]] that is located within the 'turn to materiality' in STS. It therefore fits well with the case-study oriented approach to empirical investigation used in STS. It also appears to be a straightforward alternative to [[actor–network theory]] in that it does not insist on the agency of non-human actors, and seeks to be explanatory rather than descriptive. However, because normalization process theory specifies a set of generative mechanisms that empirical investigation has shown to be relevant to implementation and integration of new technologies, it can also be used in larger scale structured and comparative studies. Although it fits well with the interpretive approach of [[ethnography]] and other [[qualitative research methods]],&lt;ref&gt;Gallacher K, May CR, Montori VM, Mair FS.  Understanding patients' experiences of treatment burden in chronic heart failure using normalization process theory.  Annals of Family Medicine 2011;14(4):351-360.&lt;/ref&gt; it also lends itself to [[systematic review]]&lt;ref&gt;Mair F, May C, O'Donnell C, Finch T, Sullivan F, Murray E.  Factors that promote or inhibit the implementation of e-health systems: an explanatory systematic review.  Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2012;90:357-364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallacher K, Jani B, Morrison D, Macdonald S, Blane D, Erwin P, May CR, Montori VM, Eton DT, Smith F, Batty DG, Mair FS.  Qualitative systematic reviews of treatment burden in stroke, heart failure, and diabetes - Methodological challenges and solutions.  BMC Medical Research Methodology 2013;13(10).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Statistical survey|survey]] [[research methods]]. As a middle range theory, it can be federated with other theories to explain empirical phenomena. It is compatible with theories of the transmission and organization of innovations, especially [[diffusion of innovations]] theory, [[labor process theory]], and psychological theories including the [[theory of planned behavior]] and [[social learning theory]].

'''Phandeeyar''' (standing for "creation place")&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Potkin|first1=Fanny|title=Myanmar's First Tech Accelerator Is Propelling Forward Next Generation Of Startups|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/fannypotkin/2016/08/15/myanmars-first-tech-accelerator-is-propelling-forward-next-generation-of-startups/#2bb966c325dc|website=Forbes|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a technology [[seed accelerator]] based in [[Yangon, Myanmar]]. Formally beginning in 2015, Phandeeyar provides funding and training for emerging [[startups]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar's Internet innovators emerge amid connectivity boom|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Myanmar-s-Internet-innovators-emerge-amid-connectivity-boom|website=Nikkei Asian Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phandeeyar also conducts trainings, hosts workshops, and holds competitions for startups within the digital sector.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Lanmadaw, Yangon, Myanmar (Burma) - panoramio (3).jpg|upright|thumb|175px|Yangon, Myanmar]]

In 2014, Phandeeyar emerged from a [[hackathon]] named "Code for Change Myanmar"&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lack of risk capital in Myanmar: David Madden, Phandeeyar|url=https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/we-believe-very-deeply-in-the-potential-of-the-tech-community-phandeeyars-david-madden-41822/|website=www.dealstreetasia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; where its founder and current CEO, [[David Madden (entrepreneur)|David Madden]], wanted to promote the growth of Myanmar's digital sector. Through this hackathon, politics and elections were addressed. 

Madden states the need for better financial support for emerging start-ups in Myanmar which also led to the creation of the accelerator.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=(http://www.hydrant.co.uk)|first1=Site designed and built by Hydrant|title=David Madden, Founder &amp; CEO, Phandeeyar: Myanmar Innovation Lab: Interview|url=https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/interview/david-madden-founder-ceo-phandeeyar-myanmar-innovation-lab/myanmar-2017|website=Oxford Business Group|language=en|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funding ===

Phandeeyar's sponsors and investors include the [[Omidyar Network]] which has donated 2 million US dollars to the company, &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phandeeyar gets $2 million grant for tech start-ups|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/business/technology/20631-phandeeyar-gets-2-million-grant-for-tech-start-ups.html|website=The Myanmar Times|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Institute of Peace]], the [[Open Society Foundation]], and the [[Schmidt Family Foundation]].&lt;ref name="invest"&gt;{{cite web|title=Omidyar Network grant jumpstarts for-profit accelerator in Myanmar|url=https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/startups/omidyar-network-grant-jumpstarts-profit-accelerator-myanmar|website=Digital News Asia|language=en|date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

David Madden states that Phandeeyar's objective is to connect those in the tech field with others actively working in the social sector through different events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Madden and Soloff on the Power of the Smartphone|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/madden-and-soloff-on-the-power-of-the-smartphone-1438715401|website=Wall Street Journal|date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Events and Initiatives===

In 2015, Phandeeyar hosted a two week event event called "MaePaySoe" (translating to "let's vote")&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hackers in programming meet to prepare for the vote|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/business/technology/16485-hackers-in-programming-meet-to-prepare-for-the-vote.html|website=The Myanmar Times|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; where more than one hundred web developers gathered to create technology which informs the general public about potential political candidates in Myanmar and the country's voting process.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"/&gt;
===Seed Funding===
In 2016, around fifteen to twenty startups were projected to be accepted into the accelerator in a three year span.&lt;ref name="invest"/&gt; Phandeeyar also plans to invest around $2 million into startups in the near future. &lt;ref name=":100"&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar: Phandeeyar sets up accelerator, to invest $200k in 8 startups in 2016 - DealStreetAsia|url=https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/phandeeyar-to-seed-fund-up-to-200000-through-their-first-tech-startup-accelerator-43871/|website=www.dealstreetasia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the startups accepted, Phandeeyar would claim a 12 percent ownership of the companies. 
Those selected for Phandeeyar's 6 month training program would receive a funding of $25,000 to launch their ventures in addition to business partnerships to help with the early stages of their startups. &lt;ref name="invest"/&gt; These partnerships include leaders from regional companies such as the Myanmar Information Technology, CarsDB, [[Muru-D]]. and Golden Gate Ventures. &lt;ref name=":100"/&gt; Towards the end of the program, companies have the opportunity to pitch their startup ideas to [[venture capitalists]] and [[angel investors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Roundup (February 25)|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/business/business-roundup-february-25.html|website=The Irrawaddy|date=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Select startups from Phandeeyar====
'''Chate Sat''' is a digital platform to connect freelance workers with employers to find jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A sneak-peek at the 4 startups graduating from Myanmar's Phandeeyar Accelerator|url=https://e27.co/meet-4-startups-graduating-myanmars-phandeeyar-accelerator-20170303/|website=e27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its launch from Phandeeyar, Chate Sat recruited around 800 businesses looking to contract work and 5,000 freelancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chate Sat targets substantial growth in one year {{!}} Eleven Myanmar|url=http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/business/11185|website=www.elevenmyanmar.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chate Sat also received funding from some investors such as Vulpes Investment Management Ltd. 

'''GoP''' is an online, tourism-based website that compiles different traveling information into one platform. Nyunt Win Aung, one of the company's co-founders, states that its increased website traffic will increase their bookings, directly as a result of more funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GoP Tour aims 50pc monthly growth {{!}} Eleven Myanmar|url=http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/business/11318|website=www.elevenmyanmar.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''White Merak''' is a phone application used to read comics made by local artists and the company's team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tech in Asia - Connecting Asia's startup ecosystem|url=https://www.techinasia.com/angel-funding-myanmarese-app-lets-read-comics-mobile|website=www.techinasia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, this platform shows animated comics, as well as a bilingual setting where users can switch comic text from Burmese to English and vice versa. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Merak Comics Studio Pte.Ltd: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=531258455|website=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''EZ Stay''' is an online hotel booking platform co-founded by Aung Phyo Lwi focused on informing those traveling to Myanmar about different hotel and motel availabilities. According to Aung Phyo Lwi, this website can better market local Myanmar businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar-based EzStay helps domestic travellers find affordable hotel stays easily|url=https://e27.co/myanmar-based-ezstay-helps-domestic-travellers-find-affordable-hotel-stays-easily-20170807/|website=e27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== News == 
In April 2018, Myanmar civil rights groups and Myanmar-based technology companies accused [[Facebook]] of failing to effectively detect hate speech online in Myanmar, which many have claimed to have contributed to an anti-Rohingya sentiment in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar Activists Welcome Zuckerberg's 24-Hour Target to Block Hate Speech on Facebook|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/12/business/12reuters-facebook-privacy-myanmar.html|website=The New York Times|date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phandeeyar, along with other companies, released an open letter to the social media platform, posing questions about Facebook's transparency in accordance with these issues and the possible implications of social media with current events in Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roose|first1=Kevin|last2=Mozur|first2=Paul|title=Zuckerberg Was Called Out Over Myanmar Violence. Here’s His Apology.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/business/facebook-myanmar-zuckerberg.html|website=The New York Times|date=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RailTel Corporation of India Ltd.''' is a "[[Miniratna]]" (public sector) enterprise of [[Government of India]] focusing on providing [[broadband]] and [[VPN]] services. RailTel was formed in September 2000 with the objective of creating nationwide broadband, telecom and multimedia network, to modernise train control operation and safety system of [[Indian Railways]]. RailTel's network passes through around 5,000 stations across the country, covering all major commercial centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=100106 |title=RAILTEL Celebrates its Annual Day|date=18 October 2013 |publisher=Press Information Bureau, Indian government|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Indian Railways (IR) was initially solely dependent on the Department of Telecom (now [[BSNL]]) for their control and administrative communication circuits. To increase circuit efficiency, the Railways began building up its own communication systems from early 1970s based on overhead telephone lines, quad cables and [[microwave]] signalling. In 1983, the Railway Reforms Committee decided to introduce [[optical fibre cable]] (OFC) based communications in IR to provide safety, reliability, availability and serviceability through use of a dedicated network. The decision was also taken to create a network independent of the DoT and replace the existing microwave telecom systems (60% of which had reached end of life) with OFC.

Indian Railways commissioned the first OFC on the [[Western line (Mumbai Suburban Railway)|Churchgate–Virar line]] in Mumbai in 1988 for train operation and control purpose, which consisted of 60&amp;nbsp;km of network across 28 stations. The network was expanded in Central India with the commissioning of 900&amp;nbsp;km of OFC network in 1991–92 across Durg–Nagpur, Nagpur–Itarsi and Itarsi–Bhusaval sections of the [[Howrah–Nagpur–Mumbai line]], and in Eastern India with the commissioning of 60&amp;nbsp;km of OFC network in [[Tatanagar–Bilaspur section|Tatanagar–Chakradhrapur section]] of the same line.

The second National Telecom Policy in 1999 opened the National Long-Distance segment under favourable licensing conditions with revenue sharing to assist mobile network operators to spread their networks across India. In 2000, the Government announced the formation of a telecom corporation to build a nationwide broadband multimedia telecommunication network. RailTel was established in September 2000 as a [[Public Sector Undertaking]] (PSU), wholly owned by the Indian Railways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railtelindia.com/profile/about-us.html Rural Broadband Connectivity Provider in India | RailTel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wi-Fi and WiMax===
RailTel, in collaboration with Google, provides free [[WiFi]] access at selected railways stations across India. Google chose railway stations as the location to provide free WiFi because stations have access to reliable power supply and fibre provided by RailTel, and because the passengers at a station come from all demographics of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google teams up with RailTel to give free Wifi to all railway stations in India|url=http://www.indialivetoday.com/google-teams-up-with-railtel-to-give-free-wifi-to-all-railway-stations-in-india/16505.html|website=India Live Today|accessdate=25 August 2016|date=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free WiFi service was launched at [[Mumbai Central railway station]] in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-central-gets-googles-highspeed-wifi-network/article8140702.ece Mumbai Central gets Google's Wi-Fi network – The Hindu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the service was expanded to 9 more railway stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google, RailTel expand free WiFi reach, cover 9 more stations|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/google-railtel-expand-free-wifi-reach-cover-9-more-stations-116041500438_1.html|publisher=''[[Business Standard]]''|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, Google announced that free Wi-Fi was available across 19 stations in India and was being used by over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1.5&amp;nbsp;million Indians enjoy high Speed Wi-Fi across 19 Railway Stations|url=http://googleindia.blogspot.in/2016/06/15-million-indians-enjoy-high-speed-wi.html|website=Official Google India Blog|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google and RailTel plan to provide free WiFi at 100 railway stations across the country by the end of 2016.

In September 2016, Google announced a public WiFi initiative called Google Station. Google plans to expand free WiFi coverage under the initiative to locations such as cafes and malls across India, and later expand worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byford|first1=Sam|title=Google Station is a new platform that aims to make public Wi-Fi better|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/27/13070922/google-station-public-wi-fi-india|website=The Verge|accessdate=28 September 2016|date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Google announced that it's Free Wi-Fi project is now powering 400 Indian railway stations. As a result, there are now more than 8 million people accessing the internet each month via the project.&lt;ref&gt;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/railways/google-says-free-wifi-available-at-400-railway-stations/articleshow/64492865.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railwire===
Based on its nationwide fibre network, RailTel offers various bandwidth intensive application to its customers. One such initiative is RailWire, a joint venture with MSOs to provide Voice, Video and Multimedia access on a single wire at a customer's home or office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RailTel to tie up with MSOs to expand internet base in rural T.N.|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/railtel-to-tie-up-with-msos-to-expand-internet-base-in-rural-tn/article5387079.ece|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=25 November 2013|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Maglifter.jpg|thumb|right|350px|An example of rocket sled launch assist: NASA's Maglifter proposal for giving a 500+ ton rocket initial velocity from a mountain.]]

A '''rocket sled launch''', also known as "ground based launch assist", "catapult launch assist", and "sky ramp launch", is a proposed method for [[Non-rocket spacelaunch|launching]] [[space]] vehicles. With this concept the launch vehicle is supported by an eastward pointing rail or maglev track that goes up the side of a mountain while an externally applied force is used to accelerate the launch vehicle to a given velocity.  Using an externally applied force for the initial acceleration reduces the propellant the launch vehicle needs to carry to reach orbit.  This allows the launch vehicle to carry a larger payload and reduces the cost of getting to orbit.  When the amount of velocity added to the launch vehicle by the ground accelerator becomes great enough, [[single-stage-to-orbit]] flight with a reusable launch vehicle becomes possible.

For hypersonic research in general, tracks at [[Holloman Air Force Base]] have tested, as of 2011, small rocket sleds moving at up to {{convert|6453|mph|km/h|abbr=on|}} (Mach 8.5).&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. Air Force: {{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123004755|title=Test Sets World Land Speed Record|accessdate=April 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120604184801/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123004755|archivedate=June 4, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effectively a 'sky ramp' would make the most expensive, first stage of a rocket fully reusable since the sled is returned to its starting position, to be refueled and may be reused in the order of hours after use. Present launch vehicles have performance-driven costs of [[Rocket#Costs and economics|thousands of dollars per kilogram of dry weight]]; sled launch would aim to reduce performance requirements and amortize hardware expenses over frequent, repeated launches.  Designs for mountain based inclined rail 'rocket' sleds often use jet engines or rockets to accelerate the spacecraft mounted on it. Electromagnetic methods (such as Bantam, Maglifter, and [[StarTram]]) are another technique investigated to accelerate a rocket before launch, potentially scalable to greater rocket masses and velocities than [[air launch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias-spes.org/SPESIF2010/Plenary%20I/Rather_abs.html|title=Transformational Technologies to Expedite Space Access and Development|publisher=SPESIF, Dr. John Rather, prior Assistant Director for Space Technology Program Development at [[NASA]]|accessdate=28 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323091323/http://www.ias-spes.org/SPESIF2010/Plenary%20I/Rather_abs.html|archivedate=23 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = NASAmaglifter&gt;{{cite web|citeseerx=10.1.1.110.9317|title=Maglifter Tradeoff Study and Subscale System Demonstrations|publisher=NASA|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the problem==
[[NASA]] studies have shown that the [[Space Shuttle]] used more than a third of its fuel just to reach {{convert|1000|mph|km/h|abbr=on|}}.&lt;ref&gt;''NASA: {{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/basics/launch.html|title=Space Shuttle Basics|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If a rocket were already moving at launch, with corresponding reduced propellant needs, a greater fraction of liftoff mass could have been payload and hardware.

==An example==

Due to factors including the exponential nature of the [[rocket equation]] and higher [[propulsive efficiency#Rocket engines|propulsive efficiency]] than if a rocket takes off stationary, a [[NASA]] Maglifter study estimated that a {{convert|270|m/s|mph|abbr=on}} launch of an [[Expendable launch system|ELV]] rocket from a 3000-meter altitude mountain peak could increase payload to [[Low earth orbit|LEO]] by 80% compared to the same rocket from a conventional [[launch pad]].&lt;ref name = MaglifterMankins&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=24756.0;attach=288934|title=The Maglifter: An Advanced Concept Using Electromagnetic Propulsion in Reducing the Cost of Space Launch|publisher=NASA|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mountains of such height are available [[Mountain peaks of the United States|within the mainland U.S.]] for the easiest logistics, or nearer to the Equator for a little more gain from [[Earth's rotation]]. Among other possibilities, a larger [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) could be reduced in liftoff mass by 35% with such launch assist, dropping to 4 instead of 6 engines in one case considered.&lt;ref name = MaglifterMankins/&gt;

At an anticipated efficiency close to 90%, electrical energy consumed per launch of a 500-ton rocket would be around 30 [[Joule#Gigajoule|GJ]], 8000 [[kilowatt hour]]s (each kilowatt-hour costing a few cents at the current [[cost of electricity]] in the United States), aside from any additional losses in energy storage. It is a system with low marginal costs dominated by initial capital costs&lt;ref name = NASAmaglifter/&gt;  Although a fixed site, it was estimated to provide a substantial net payload increase for a high portion of the varying launch azimuths needed by different satellites, with rocket maneuvering during the early stage of post-launch ascent (an alternative to adding [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] for later [[orbital inclination change]]).  Maglev guideway costs were estimated as $10 – $20 million per mile in the 1994 study, which had anticipated annual maglev maintenance costs on the order of 1% of capital costs.&lt;ref name = MaglifterMankins/&gt;

==Benefits of high altitude launches==

Rocket sled launch helps a vehicle gain altitude, and proposals commonly involve the track curving up a mountain.  Advantages to any launch system that starts from high altitudes include reduce [[gravity drag]] (the cost of lifting fuel in a gravity well).  The thinner air will reduce [[air resistance]] and allow more efficient engine geometries.  Rocket nozzles have different shapes (expansion ratios) to maximize thrust at different air pressures. (Though NASA's [[aerospike engine]] for the [[Lockheed Martin X-33]] was designed to change geometry to remain efficient at a variety of different pressures, the aerospike engine had added weight and complexity; [[Lockheed Martin X-33|X-33]] funding was canceled in 2001; and other benefits from launch assist would remain even if aerospike engines reached flight testing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/engines/rs2200.htm|title=RS-2200|accessdate=April 28, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317035653/http://www.astronautix.com/engines/rs2200.htm|archivedate=March 17, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/x-33/aero_faq.htm|title=The Aerospike Nozzle|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the air is 39% thinner at 2500 meters. The more efficient rocket plume geometry and the reduced air friction allows the engine to be 5% more efficient per amount of fuel burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/aerospike/compensation.shtml|title=Altitude Compensation|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another advantage to high altitude launches is that it eliminates the need to throttle back the engine when the "[[Max Q]]" limit is attained.  Rockets launched in thick atmosphere can go so fast that air resistance may cause structural damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/dynpress.html|title=Dynamic Pressure|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Engines are throttled back when Max Q is reached, until the rocket is high enough that they can resume full power.  The [[Atlas V]] 551 gives an example of this.  It reaches its Max Q at 30,000 feet.  Its engine is throttled back to 60% thrust for 30 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/design_lib/Atlas5.pl.guide.pdf|title=Atlas Launch System Mission Planner's Guide|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reduced acceleration adds to the gravity drag the rocket must overcome.  Additionally, space craft engines concerned with Max Q are more complex as they must be throttled during launch.

A launch from high altitude need not throttle back at Max Q as it starts above the thickest portion of the Earth's atmosphere.

Debora A. Grant and James L. Rand in: "The Balloon Assisted Launch System - A Heavy Lift Balloon"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&amp;gTable=mtgpaper&amp;gID=2127|title=The Balloon Assisted Launch System|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: "It was established some time ago that a ground launched rocket capable of reaching 20 km would be able to reach an altitude of almost 100km if it was launched from 20km."  They suggest that small rockets are lifted above the majority of the atmosphere by balloon in order to avoid the problems discussed above.

==Compatibility with reusable launch vehicles==

Rocket sleds at China Lake testing ground have reached Mach 4 while carrying 60,000&amp;nbsp;kg masses.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} A sled track that gave a Mach 2 or greater launch assist could reduce the fuel to orbit by 40% or more, while helping counter the [[Reusable launch system#Weight penalty|weight penalty]] when aiming to make a fully [[Reusable launch system|reusable launch vehicle]].  Angled at 55 degrees to vertical, a track on a tall mountain could allow a single stage to orbit reusable vehicle with no new technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g2mil.com/timeline.htm|title=Sky Ramp Technology|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Complex systems}}
'''Scalability''' is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|doi=10.1145/350391.350432|title=Characteristics of scalability and their impact on performance|conference=Proceedings of the second international workshop on Software and performance – WOSP '00|year=2000|last1=Bondi|first1=André B.|isbn=158113195X|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a system is considered scalable if it is capable of increasing its total output under an increased load when resources (typically hardware) are added. An analogous meaning is implied when the word is used in an [[economics|economic]] context, where a company's scalability implies that the underlying [[business model]] offers the potential for [[economic growth]] within the company.

Scalability, as a property of systems, is generally difficult to define&lt;ref&gt;See for instance, {{cite journal|doi=10.1145/121973.121975|title=What is scalability?|year=1990|last1=Hill|first1=Mark D.|journal=ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News|volume=18|issue=4|page=18}} and {{cite conference|doi=10.1145/1134285.1134460|title=A framework for modelling and analysis of software systems scalability|conference=Proceedings of the 28th international conference on Software engineering – ICSE '06|year=2006|last1=Duboc|first1=Leticia|last2=Rosenblum|first2=David S.|last3=Wicks|first3=Tony|isbn=1595933751|page=949}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in any particular case it is necessary to define the specific requirements for scalability on those dimensions that are deemed important. It is a highly significant issue in electronics systems, databases, routers, and networking. A system whose performance improves after adding hardware, proportionally to the capacity added, is said to be a '''''scalable system'''''.

An [[algorithm]], design, [[Protocol (computing)|networking protocol]], [[Computer program|program]], or other system is said to ''scale'' if it is suitably [[Algorithmic efficiency|efficient]] and practical when applied to large situations (e.g. a large input data set, a large number of outputs or users, or a large number of participating nodes in the case of a distributed system). If the design or system fails when a quantity increases, it ''does not scale''. In practice, if there are a large number of things ({{mvar|n}}) that affect scaling, then resource requirements (for example, algorithmic time-complexity) must grow less than {{mvar|n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} as {{mvar|n}} increases. An example is a search engine, which scales not only for the number of users, but also for the number of objects it indexes. Scalability refers to the ability of a site to increase in size as demand warrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/E_commerce.html?id=n4bUGAAACAAJ|title=E-commerce: Business, Technology, Society|first1=Kenneth Craig|last1=Laudon|first2=Carol Guercio|last2=Traver
|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall/Pearson Education|year=2008|isbn=9780136006459}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
The concept of scalability is desirable in technology as well as [[business]] settings. The base concept is consistent{{snd}} the ability for a business or technology to accept increased volume without impacting the [[contribution margin]] (= [[revenue]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus; [[variable cost]]s). For example, a given piece of equipment may have a capacity for 1&amp;ndash;1000 users, while beyond 1000 users additional equipment is needed or performance will decline (variable costs will increase and reduce contribution margin).

Another example is the Incident Command System (ICS), the emergency management system used across response agencies in the United States.  ICS can scale resource coordination from a single-engine roadside brushfire to an interstate wildland fire, for example. The first resource on scene establishes IC, with authority to order resources and delegate responsibility within the span of control (managing five to seven officers, who will again delegate to up to seven, and on as the incident grows).  Senior officers assume command at the top as complexity warrants.  This proven system is remarkably simple, fully scalable and has been saving lives and property for nearly half a century.[http://amj.aom.org/content/44/6/1281.short]


Scalability can be measured in various dimensions, such as:

* ''Administrative scalability'': The ability for an increasing number of organizations or users to easily share a single distributed system.
* ''Functional scalability'': The ability to enhance the system by adding new functionality at minimal effort.
* ''Geographic scalability'': The ability to maintain performance, usefulness, or usability regardless of expansion from concentration in a local area to a more distributed geographic pattern.
* ''Load scalability'': The ability for a [[distributed system]] to easily expand and contract its resource pool to accommodate heavier or lighter loads or number of inputs. Alternatively, the ease with which a system or component can be modified, added, or removed, to accommodate changing load.
* ''Generation scalability'': The ability of a system to scale up by using new generations of components. Thereby, [[Open architecture|''heterogeneous scalability'']] is the ability to use the components from different vendors.&lt;ref name="parallel_arch"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hesham El-Rewini and Mostafa Abd-El-Barr|title=Advanced Computer Architecture and Parallel Processing|url=https://books.google.ee/books?id=7JB-u6D5Q7kC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=parallel+architectures+scalability&amp;hl=et&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bQZtUtTKC6SO4gT27oC4Ag&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=parallel%20architectures%20scalability&amp;f=false|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|date=April 2005|isbn=978-0-471-47839-3|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;



* A [[routing protocol]] is considered scalable with respect to network size, if the size of the necessary [[routing table]] on each node grows as [[Big O notation|O]](log ''N''), where ''N'' is the number of nodes in the network.
* A scalable [[online transaction processing]] system or [[database management system]] is one that can be upgraded to process more transactions by adding new processors, devices and storage, and which can be upgraded easily and transparently without shutting it down.
* Some early [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) implementations of [[Gnutella]] had scaling issues. Each node query [[Query flooding|flooded]] its requests to all peers. The demand on each peer would increase in proportion to the total number of peers, quickly overrunning the peers' limited capacity. Other P2P systems like [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] scale well because the demand on each peer is independent of the total number of peers. There is no centralized bottleneck, so the system may expand indefinitely without the addition of supporting resources (other than the peers themselves).
* The distributed nature of the [[Domain Name System]] allows it to work efficiently even when all [[server (computing)|hosts]] on the worldwide [[Internet]] are served, so it is said to "scale well".

=={{Anchor|HORIZONTAL-SCALING|VERTICAL-SCALING}}Horizontal and vertical scaling==
Methods of adding more resources for a particular application fall into two broad categories: horizontal and vertical scaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4228359|conference=2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium|date=March 26, 2007|doi=10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370631|title=Scale-up x Scale-out: A Case Study using Nutch/Lucene|last1=Michael|first1=Maged|last2=Moreira|first2=Jose E.|last3=Shiloach|first3=Doron|last4=Wisniewski|first4=Robert W.|isbn=1-4244-0909-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* To '''scale horizontally''' (or '''scale out/in''') means to add more nodes to (or remove nodes from) a system, such as adding a new computer to a distributed software application. An example might involve scaling out from one Web server system to three. As computer prices have dropped and performance continues to increase, high-performance computing applications such as seismic analysis and biotechnology workloads have adopted low-cost "[[commodity server|commodity]]" systems for tasks that once would have required [[supercomputer]]s. System architects may configure hundreds of small computers in a [[computer cluster|cluster]] to obtain aggregate computing power that often exceeds that of computers based on a single traditional processor. The development of high-performance interconnects such as [[Gigabit Ethernet]], [[InfiniBand]] and [[Myrinet]] further fueled this model. Such growth has led to demand for software that allows efficient management and maintenance of multiple nodes, as well as hardware such as shared data storage with much higher I/O performance. ''Size scalability'' is the maximum number of processors that a system can accommodate.&lt;ref name="parallel_arch"/&gt;
* To '''scale vertically''' (or '''scale up/down''') means to add resources to (or remove resources from) a single node in a system, typically involving the addition of CPUs or memory to a single computer. Such vertical scaling of existing systems also enables them to use [[platform virtualization|virtualization]] technology more effectively, as it provides more resources for the hosted set of [[operating system]] and [[application software|application]] modules to share. Taking advantage of such resources can also be called "scaling up", such as expanding the number of [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] daemon processes currently running. ''Application scalability'' is the improved performance of running applications on a scaled-up version of the system.&lt;ref name="parallel_arch"/&gt;

There are tradeoffs between the two models. Larger numbers of computers means increased management complexity, as well as a more complex programming model and issues such as throughput and latency between nodes; also, [[Amdahl's Law|some applications do not lend themselves to a distributed computing model]]. In the past, the price difference between the two models has favored "scale up" computing for those applications that fit its paradigm, but recent advances in virtualization technology have blurred that advantage, since deploying a new virtual system over a [[hypervisor]] (where possible) is often less expensive than actually buying and installing a real one. Configuring an existing idle system has always been less expensive than buying, installing, and configuring a new one, regardless of the model.

'''Note that [[Network function virtualization|NFV]] defines these terms differently''': scaling out/in is the ability to scale by add/remove resource instances (e.g. virtual machine), whereas scaling up/down is the ability to scale by changing allocated resources (e.g. memory/CPU/storage capacity)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV); Terminology for Main Concepts in NFV|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV003v010201p.pdf}} {{Dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Database scalability==
A number of different approaches enable [[database]]s to grow to very large size while supporting an ever-increasing rate of [[Transactions Per Second|transactions per second]]. The rapid pace of hardware advances in both the speed and capacity of [[mass storage]] devices, as well as similar advances in CPU and networking speed is also important.

One technique supported by most of the major [[Database management system|database management system (DBMS)]] products is the [[Partition (database)|partitioning]] of large tables, based on ranges of values in a key field. In this manner, the database can be ''scaled out'' across a cluster of separate [[database server]]s. Also, with the advent of 64-bit [[microprocessor]]s, [[Multi-core (computing)|multi-core]] CPUs, and large [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP multiprocessors]], DBMS vendors have been at the forefront of supporting [[Thread (computer science)|multi-threaded]] implementations that substantially ''scale up'' [[transaction processing]] capacity.

[[Network-attached storage|Network-attached storage (NAS)]] and [[Storage area network|Storage area networks (SANs)]] coupled with fast local area networks and [[Fibre Channel]] technology enable still larger, more loosely coupled configurations of databases and distributed computing power. The widely supported [[X/Open XA]] standard employs a global transaction monitor to coordinate [[distributed transaction]]s among semi-autonomous XA-compliant database resources. [[Oracle RAC]] uses a different model to achieve scalability, based on a "shared-everything" architecture that relies upon high-speed connections between servers.

While DBMS vendors debate the relative merits of their favored designs, some companies and researchers question the inherent limitations of [[relational database management system]]s. [[GigaSpaces]], for example, contends that an entirely different model of distributed data access and transaction processing, [[space-based architecture]], is required to achieve the highest performance and scalability. On the other hand, [[Base One]] makes the case for extreme scalability without departing from mainstream relational database technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Base One|url=http://www.boic.com/scalability.htm|title=Database Scalability - Dispelling myths about the limits of database-centric architecture|year=2007|accessdate=May 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For specialized applications, [[NoSQL]] architectures such as Google's [[Bigtable]] can further enhance scalability. Google's horizontally distributed [[Spanner (distributed database technology)|Spanner]] technology, positioned as an relational alternative to Bigtable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Google|url=https://cloud.google.com/storage-options/|title=Choosing a storage option|year=2018|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, supports general-purpose [[database transaction]]s and provides a more conventional [[SQL]]-based query language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en//archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf|title=Spanner: Google's Globally-Distributed Database|year= 2012|accessdate=September 30, 2012|isbn=978-1-931971-96-6|series=OSDI'12 Proceedings of the 10th USENIX conference on Operating Systems Design and Implementation|pages=251–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strong versus eventual consistency (storage)==
In the context of scale-out [[Computer data storage|data storage]], scalability is defined as the maximum storage cluster size which guarantees full data consistency, meaning there is only ever one valid version of stored data in the whole cluster, independently from the number of redundant physical data copies. Clusters which provide "lazy" redundancy by updating copies in an asynchronous fashion are called [[Eventual consistency|'eventually consistent']]. This type of scale-out design is suitable when availability and responsiveness are rated higher than consistency, which is true for many web file hosting services or web caches (''if you want the latest version, wait some seconds for it to propagate''). For all classical transaction-oriented applications, this design should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eventual consistency by Werner Vogels|author=Sadek Drobi|url=http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/01/consistency-vs-availability|date=January 11, 2008|accessdate=April 8, 2017|publisher=InfoQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many open source and even commercial scale-out storage clusters, especially those built on top of standard PC hardware and networks, provide [[eventual consistency]] only. Idem some NoSQL databases like [[CouchDB]] and others mentioned above. Write operations invalidate other copies, but often don't wait for their acknowledgements. Read operations typically don't check every redundant copy prior to answering, potentially missing the preceding write operation. The large amount of metadata signal traffic would require specialized hardware and short distances to be handled with acceptable performance (i.e. act like a non-clustered storage device or database).

Whenever strong data consistency is expected, look for these indicators: 
* the use of InfiniBand, Fibrechannel or similar low-latency networks to avoid performance degradation with increasing cluster size and number of redundant copies. 
* short cable lengths and limited physical extent, avoiding signal runtime performance degradation.
* majority / quorum mechanisms to guarantee data consistency whenever parts of the cluster become inaccessible.

Indicators for [[Eventual consistency|eventually consistent]] designs (not suitable for transactional applications!) are:
* write performance increases linearly with the number of connected devices in the cluster.
* while the storage cluster is partitioned, all parts remain responsive. There is a risk of conflicting updates.

==Performance tuning versus hardware scalability==
It is often advised to focus system design on hardware scalability rather than on capacity. It is typically cheaper to add a new node to a system in order to achieve improved performance than to partake in [[performance tuning]] to improve the capacity that each node can handle. But this approach can have diminishing returns (as discussed in [[performance engineering]]). For example: suppose 70% of a program can be sped up if parallelized and run on multiple CPUs instead of one. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of a calculation that is sequential, and &lt;math&gt;1-\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction that can be parallelized, the maximum [[speedup]] that can be achieved by using P processors is given according to [[Amdahl's Law]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {\alpha+\frac{1-\alpha} P}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the value for this example, using 4 processors we get

: &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {0.3+\frac{1-0.3} 4} = 2.105.&lt;/math&gt;

If we double the compute power to 8 processors we get

: &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {0.3+\frac{1-0.3} 8} = 2.581.&lt;/math&gt;

Doubling the processing power has only improved the speedup by roughly one-fifth. If the whole problem was parallelizable, the speed would also double. Therefore, throwing in more hardware is not necessarily the optimal approach.

==Weak versus strong scaling==
In the context of [[high performance computing]] there are two common notions of scalability:
* The first is ''strong scaling'', which is defined as how the solution time varies with the number of processors for a fixed ''total'' problem size.
* The second is ''weak scaling'', which is defined as how the solution time varies with the number of processors for a fixed problem size ''per processor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stfc.ac.uk/cse/25052.aspx|title=The Weak Scaling of DL_POLY 3|publisher=STFC Computational Science and Engineering Department|accessdate=March 8, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307224104/http://www.stfc.ac.uk/cse/25052.aspx|archivedate=March 7, 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4920">'''ShapeWriter''' (previously known as '''Shorthand-Aided Rapid Keyboarding (SHARK)''') was a keyboard text input method for tablet, handheld PCs, and mobile phones invented by [[Shumin Zhai]] and [[Per Ola Kristensson]] at [[IBM Almaden Research Center]] and the Department of Computer and Information Science at [[Linköping University]].

Using ShapeWriter text entry software, a user draws words on a [[graphical keyboard]] using a pen. Instead of tapping the keys, the user draws a [[pen gesture]] that connects all the letters in the desired word. After some usage the user learns the movement pattern for the commonly used words and can write them faster than is possible on a traditional [[virtual keyboard]].

The first system described by Shumin Zhai and Per Ola Kristensson (2003) was only a prototype system that could recognize about 100 pen gestures for the top 100 words used in the English language. It used a [[handwriting recognition]] [[algorithm]] that relied on [[dynamic programming]] to recognize the word patterns drawn from a lexicon. The next version described by Per Ola Kristensson and Shumin Zhai (2004) has a fundamentally different [[recognition engine]] that can recognize 50,000 - 60,000 words with low [[Latency (engineering)|latency]]. This system introduced the notion that every word in a large lexicon should be possible to write by tracing the letters. It is this system that was the basis for the software release on IBM alphaWorks that is generally associated with the term "ShapeWriter".

ShapeWriter was acquired by [[Nuance Communications]], and taken off the market in 2010.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.androidcentral.com/shapewriter-being-pulled-market-get-it-while-you-still-can&lt;/ref&gt; its technology presumably incorporated as part of Nuance's FlexT9 app in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuancemobilelife.com/apps/flext9/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2011/06/nuance-flext9-gives-you-four-android-input-methods-in-one-app/&lt;/ref&gt;

==iPhone==
ShapeWriter was made available for the iPhone approximately in 2008 and was revised several times (including ShapeWriter Lite and ShapeWriter Pro or Plus) before being pulled due to its sale to [[Nuance Communications]] (see following entry).

Those who purchased the iPhone version continued to use it and it also functioned on iPads v. 1 and 2 until 2013.

As of 2013 it no longer functions on iOS devices and is no longer available in Apple's App Store.

==Android==
ShapeWriter software was made available as a free application for [[Android (operating system)]] smartphones through the [[Android Market]]. As a touchscreen keyboard replacement, it had over 50,000 users on Android worldwide. It was available only for Android OS versions 1.6 or higher. ShapeWriter for Android was available in 7 European languages including English, Spanish, and German. There was also a Beta release for Android 1.5 phones including the [[HTC Hero]] and [[Droid Eris]].

ShapeWriter, Inc. was purchased by [[Nuance Communications]] and the ShapeWriter software was removed from the Android Market indefinitely on June 20, 2010.

'''Social software''', also known as '''Web 2.0 applications''' or '''social apps''', include communication and interactive tools often based on the [[Internet]]. Communication tools typically handle the capturing, storing and presentation of communication, usually written but increasingly including audio and video as well. Interactive tools handle mediated interactions between a pair or group of users. They focus on establishing and maintaining a connection among users, facilitating the mechanics of conversation and talk.&lt;ref name = "Allen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/10/tracing_the_evo.html|title=Tracing the Evolution of Social Software|last=Allen|first=Christopher|date=13 October 2004|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although we do not have a generally accepted definition, social software generally refers to software that makes collaborative behaviour, the organisation and moulding of communities, self-expression, social interaction and feedback possible for individuals. Another important element of the existing definition of "social software" is that it allows for the structured mediation of opinion between people, in a centralized or self-regulating manner. The most improved area for social software is that [[Web 2.0]] [[application software|applications]] can all promote cooperation between people and the creation of online communities more than ever before.

== Types ==

=== Instant messaging ===
{{main|Instant messaging}}
An ''[[instant messaging]]'' application or [[client (computing)|client]] allows one to communicate with another person over a network in real time, in relative privacy. Popular, consumer-oriented clients include [[AOL Instant Messenger]], [[Google Hangouts]], [[ICQ]], [[Meebo]], [[MSN Messenger]], [[Gaim|Pidgin]] (formerly maig), and [[Yahoo! Messenger]]. Instant messaging software designed for use in business includes [[IBM Sametime]], [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] and [[Microsoft Messenger]].

One can add friends to a contact or buddy list by entering the person's email address or messenger ID. If the person is online, their name will typically be listed as available for chat. Clicking on their name will activate a chat window with space to write to the other person, as well as read their reply.

=== Text chat ===
{{main|Text chat}}
[[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC) and other [[online chat]] technologies allow users to join and communicate with many people at once, publicly. Users may join a pre-existing chat room or create a new one about any topic. Once inside, you may type messages that everyone else in the room can read, as well as respond to/from others. Often there is a steady stream of people entering and leaving. Whether you are in another person's chat room or one you've created yourself, you are generally free to invite others online to join you in that room.

=== Collaborative software ===
{{main|Collaborative software}}
The goal of collaborative software, also known as groupware, such as Moodle, Landing pages, Enterprise Architecture, and Sharepoint, is to allow subjects to share data – such as files, photos, text, etc. for the purpose of project work or school work. The intent is to first form a group and then have them collaborate. Clay Shirky defines social software as "software that supports group interaction". Since groupware supports group interaction (once the group is formed), it would consider it to be social software.

=== Internet forums ===
{{main|Internet forum}}
Originally modeled after the real-world paradigm of electronic [[bulletin board system|bulletin boards]] of the world before internet was widely available, ''internet forums'' allow users to post a "topic" for others to review. Other users can view the topic and post their own comments in a linear fashion, one after the other. Most forums are public, allowing anybody to sign up at any time. A few are private, gated communities where new members must pay a small fee to join, like the [[Something Awful Forums]].

Forums can contain many different categories in a hierarchy, typically organized according to topics and subtopics. Other features include the ability to post images or files or to quote another user's post with special formatting in one's own post. Forums often grow in popularity until they can boast several thousand members posting replies to tens of thousands of topics continuously.

There are various standards and claimants for the market leaders of each software category. Various add-ons may be available, including translation and spelling correction software, depending on the expertise of the operators of the bulletin board. In some industry areas, the bulletin board has its own commercially successful achievements: free and paid hardcopy magazines as well as professional and amateur sites.

Current successful services have combined new tools with the older [[newsgroup]] and [[mailing list]] paradigm to produce hybrids like [[Yahoo! Groups]] and [[Google Groups]]. Also as a service catches on, it tends to adopt characteristics and tools of other services that compete. Over time, for example, [[wiki user page]]s have become social portals for individual users and may be used in place of other portal applications.

=== Wikis ===
{{main|Wikis|Wiki software}}
In the past, web pages were only created and edited by web designers that had the technological skills to do so. Currently there are many tools that can assist individuals with web content editing. Wikis allow novices to be on the same level as experienced web designers because wikis provide easy rules and guidelines. Wikis allow all individuals to work collaboratively on web content without having knowledge of any markup languages. A wiki is made up of many content pages that are created by its users. Wiki users are able to create, edit, and link related content pages together. The user community is based on the individuals that want to participate to improve the overall wiki. Participating users are in a democratic community where any user can edit any other user's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farkas|first1=Meredith G.|title=Social Software in Libraries: Building Collaboration, Communication, and Community Online|date=2007|publisher=Information Today|location=Medford, N.J.|isbn=978-1573872751|pages=67–68|edition=2nd print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include [[Wikipedia]], [[Wiktionary]], the original [[Portland Pattern Repository]] wiki, [[MeatballWiki]], CommunityWiki and [[Wikisource]]. For more detail on free and commercially available wiki systems see [[Comparison of wiki software]].

=== Blogs ===
{{main|Blog}}
Blogs, short for web logs, are like online journals for a particular person. The owner will post a message periodically, allowing others to comment. Topics often include the owner's daily life, views on politics or a particular subject important to them.

Blogs mean many things to different people, ranging from "online journal" to "easily updated personal website." While these definitions are technically correct, they fail to capture the power of blogs as social software. Beyond being a simple homepage or an online diary, some blogs allow comments on the entries, thereby creating a discussion forum. They also have blogrolls (i.e. links to other blogs which the owner reads or admires) and indicate their social relationship to those other bloggers using the [[XHTML Friends Network|XFN]] social relationship standard. [[Pingback]] and [[trackback]] allow one blog to notify another blog, creating an inter-blog conversation. Blogs engage readers and can build a virtual community around a particular person or interest. Examples include [[Slashdot]], [[LiveJournal]], [[Blogger (service)|BlogSpot]]. Blogging has also become fashionable in business settings by companies who use software such as [[IBM Connections]].

=== Collaborative real-time editors ===
{{main|Collaborative real-time editor}}
Simultaneous editing of a text or media file by different participants on a network was first demonstrated on research systems as early as the 1970s, but is now practical on a global network.  Collaborative real-time editing is now utilized, for example, in film editing and on services such as [[Google Docs]].

=== Prediction markets ===
{{main|Prediction market}}
Many prediction market tools have become available (including some [[free software]]) that make it easy to predict and bet on future events. This software a more formal version of social interaction, although it qualifies as a robust type of social software.

=== Social network services ===
{{main|Social network service}}
Social network services allow people to come together online around shared interests, hobbies or causes. For example, some sites provide meeting organization facilities for people who practice the same sports. Other services enable business networking ([[Ryze]], [[XING]] and [[LinkedIn]]) and social event meetups ([[Meetup (website)|Meetup]]).

Some large [[wiki]]s have effectively become social network services by encouraging user pages and portals.

Anyone can create their own social networking service using hosted offerings like [[Ning (website)|Ning]],  or more flexible, installable software like [[Dolphin (social networking software)|Dolphin Pro]], [[Elgg (software)|Elgg Social Networking Engine]], [[BuddyPress]], [[SocialEngine]], [[Oxwall]], [[Status.net]] or [[Concursive|Concursive's]] [[ConcourseConnect]].

=== Social network search engines ===
Social network search engines are a class of search engines that use social networks to organize, prioritize or filter search results. There are two subclasses of social network search engines: those that use '''explicit''' social networks and those that use '''implicit''' social networks.

*'''Explicit''' social network search engines allow people to find each other according to explicitly stated social relationships, such as [[XHTML Friends Network|XFN]] social relationships. [[XHTML Friends Network]], for example, allows people to share their relationships on their own sites, thus forming a decentralized/distributed online social network, in contrast to centralized social network services listed in the previous section.
*'''Implicit''' social network search engines allow people to filter search results based upon classes of social networks they trust, such as a shared political viewpoint. This was called an [[epistemic filter]] in the 1993 "State of the Future Report" from the [[American Committee for the United Nations University]] which predicted that this would become the dominant means of search for most users.

Lacking trustworthy explicit information about such viewpoints, this type of social network search engine mines the web to infer the topology of online social networks. For example, the [[NewsTrove]] search engine infers social networks from content - sites, blogs, pods and feeds - by examining, among other things, subject matter, link relationships and grammatical features to infer social networks.

=== Deliberative social networks ===
Deliberative social networks are webs of discussion and debate for decision-making purposes. They are built for the purpose of establishing sustained relationships between individuals and their government. They rely upon informed opinion and advice that is given with a clear expectation of outcomes.

=== Commercial social networks ===
Commercial social networks are designed to support business transaction and to build a trust between an individual and a brand, which relies on opinion of product, ideas to make the product better, enabling customers to participate with the brands in promoting development, service delivery and a better customer experience.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} An example of these networks is [[Dell IdeaStorm]].

=== Social guides ===
A social guide recommending places to visit or contains information about places in the real world, such as coffee shops, restaurants and wifi hotspots, etc. One such application is [[Wikivoyage]].

=== Social bookmarking ===
{{main|Social bookmarking|Enterprise bookmarking}}
Some web sites allow users to post their list of [[Internet bookmark|bookmarks]] or favorite websites for others to search and view them. These sites can also be used to meet others through sharing common interests. Additionally, many social bookmarking sites allow users to browse through websites and content shared by other users based on popularity or category.  As such, use of social bookmarking sites is an effective tool for [[search engine optimization]] and [[social media optimization]] for [[webmaster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialbookmarksubmission.org/importance-of-social-bookmarking-in-seo-or-website-marketing-and-promotion/|title=Importance of Social Bookmarking in SEO or Website Marketing and Promotion|publisher=Social Bookmark Submission|accessdate=25 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504183805/http://socialbookmarksubmission.org/importance-of-social-bookmarking-in-seo-or-website-marketing-and-promotion/|archive-date=2012-05-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include [[digg]], [[Delicious (website)|Delicious]], [[StumbleUpon]], [[reddit]], and [[furl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/social-bookmarking-websites|title=Top 15 Most Popular Social Bookmarking Websites|date=May 2012|publisher=eBizMBA|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enterprise bookmarking]] is a method of tagging and linking any information using an expanded set of tags to capture knowledge about data. It collects and indexes these tags in a web-infrastructure server residing behind the firewall. Users can share knowledge tags with specified people or groups, shared only inside specific networks, typically within an organization. Examples of this software are [[Knowledge Plaza]], [[Jumper 2.0]], [[IBM Lotus Connections#Dogear|IBM Dogear]], and [[Connectbeam]].

=== Social viewing ===
{{Main|Social viewing}}
[[Social viewing]] allows multiple users to aggregate from multiple sources and view online videos together in a synchronized viewing experience.

=== Social cataloging ===
{{Main|Social cataloging application}}
In [[Social cataloging application|social cataloging]] much like social bookmarking, this software is aimed towards academics. It allows the user to post a citation for an article found on the internet or a website, online database like Academic Search Premier or LexisNexis Academic University, a book found in a library catalog and so on. These citations can be organized into predefined categories or a new category defined by the user through the use of [[Tag (metadata)|tags]]. This method allows academics researching or interested in similar areas to connect and share resources.

=== Social libraries ===
This applications allows visitors to keep track of their collectibles, books, records and DVDs. Users can share their collections. Recommendations can be generated based on user ratings, using statistical computation and [[network theory]]. Some sites offer a buddy system, as well as virtual "check outs" of items for borrowing among friends. [[Folksonomy]] or [[tag (metadata)|tagging]] is implemented on most of these sites.

=== Social online storage ===
Social online storage applications allow their users to collaboratively create file archives containing files of any type. Files can either be edited online or from a local computer, which has access to the storage system. Such systems can be built upon existing server infrastructure (e.g. [[GDrive]]) or leverage idle resources by applying P2P technology (e.g. [[Wuala]]). Such systems are social because they allow public file distribution and direct [[file sharing]] with friends.

=== Social network analysis ===
Social network analysis tools analyze the data connection graphs within social networks, and information flow across those networks, to identify groups (such as cliques or key influencers) and trends. They fall into two categories: professional research tools, such as [[Mathematica]], used by social scientists and statisticians, and consumer tools, such as [[Wolfram Alpha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19699776 |title = Facebook friends mapped by Wolfram Alpha app|work =  BBC News|date = 24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/30/wolfram-alpha-launches-personal-analytics-reports-for-facebook/ Wolfram Alpha Launches Personal Analytics Reports For Facebook] Tech Crunch&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasise ease-of-use. See list at [[Social network analysis software]].

=== Virtual worlds ===
{{main|Virtual world}}
Virtual Worlds are services where it is possible to meet and interact with other people in a virtual environment reminiscent of the real world. Thus the term [[virtual reality]]. Typically, the user manipulates an [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] through the world, interacting with others using [[online chat|chat]] or [[voice chat]].

==== Massively multiplayer online games ====
{{main|Massively multiplayer online game}}
MMOGs are virtual worlds (also known as virtual environments) that add various sorts of point systems, levels, competition and winners and losers to virtual world simulation. Commercial MMOGs (or, more accurately, massively multiplayer online role-playing games or [[MMORPG]]s,) include [[EverQuest]] and [[World of Warcraft]].

==== Non-game worlds ====
Another development are the worlds that are less game-like or not [[game]]s at all. Games have points, winners and losers. Instead, some virtual worlds are more like social networking services like MySpace and Facebook, but with 3D simulation features. Examples include [[Second Life]], ActiveWorlds, [[The Sims Online]] and [[There (internet service)|There]].

==== Economies ====
{{Main|Virtual economy}}
Very often a real economy emerges in these worlds, extending the non-physical [[service economy]] within the world to service providers in the real world. Experts can design dresses or hairstyles for characters, go on routine missions for them and so on, and be paid in game money to do so. This emergence has resulted in expanding social possibility and also in increased incentives to cheat. In the case of [[Second Life]], the in-world economy is one of the primary features of the world. Some MMOG companies even have economists employed full-time (for example, CCP Games with [[Eve Online]]) to monitor their in-game economic systems.

=== Other specialized social applications ===
There are many other applications with social software characteristics that facilitate human connection and collaboration in specific contexts. [[Social Project Management]] and [[e-learning]] applications are among these.

== Vendor lists ==
Various analyst firms have attempted to list and categorize the major social software vendors in the marketplace. Jeremiah Owyang of [[Forrester Research]] has listed fifty "community software" platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/08/04/forrester-report-vendor-product-catalog-of-community-platforms-for-the-interactive-marketer/|title=Forrester Report:  Vendor Product Catalog of Community Platforms For The Interactive Marketer - Web Strategy by Jeremiah Owyang - Digital Business|author=|date=|website=www.web-strategist.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent analyst firm [[Real Story Group]] has categorized 23 social software vendors,&lt;ref name = realstory&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.realstorygroup.com/Reports/Collaboration/Vendors|title=Collaboration Vendor Evaluations |website =  Real Story Group|author=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which it evaluates head-to-head.&lt;ref name = realstory/&gt;

== Politics and journalism ==
Use of social software for [[politics]] has also expanded drastically especially over 2004–2006 to include a wide range of social software, often closely integrated with services like [[phone tree]]s and [[deliberative democracy]] forums and run by a candidate, party or [[caucus]].

[[Open politics]], a variant of open-source governance, combines aspects of the [[free software]] and [[open content]] movements, promoting [[decision-making]] methods claimed to be more open, less antagonistic, and more capable of determining what is in the [[public interest]] with respect to [[public policy]] issues. It is a set of best practices from [[citizen journalism]], [[participatory democracy]] and [[deliberative democracy]], informed by [[e-democracy]] and [[netroots]] experiments, applying argumentation framework for issue-based argument and a [[political philosophy]], which advocates the application of the philosophies of the [[Open-source software|open-source]] and open-content movements to [[democracy|democratic]] principles to enable any interested citizen to add to the creation of policy, as with a [[wiki]] document. Legislation is democratically open to the general citizenry, employing their [[collective wisdom]] to benefit the decision-making process and improve democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=450zYUjsPNQC&amp;pg=PT56 Open-source democracy: how online communication is changing offline politics] by [[Douglas Rushkoff]], published by [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]]. Page 56 et al&lt;/ref&gt; Open politics encompasses the [[open government]] principle including those for public participation and engagement, such as the use of [[IdeaScale]], [[Google Moderator]], [[Semantic MediaWiki]], [[GitHub]], and other software.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gfzzrnHy5cQC&amp;pg=PA241 Knowledge governance: processes and perspectives]; Snejina Michailova, [[Nicolai J. Foss]], [[Oxford University Press]]. Page 241 et al&lt;/ref&gt;

Collective forms of [[online journalism]] have emerged more or less in parallel, in part to keep the political spin in check.

== Comparison of communication and interactive tools ==
Communication tools are generally [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]]. By contrast, interactive tools are generally [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronous]], allowing users to communicate in real time (phone, net phone, video chat) or near-synchronous (IM, text chat).

Communication involves the content of talk, speech or writing, whereas interaction involves the interest users establish in one another as individuals. In other words, a communication tool may want to make access and searching of text both simple and powerful. An interactive tool may want to present as much of a user's expression, performance and presence as possible. The organization of texts and providing access to archived contributions differs from the facilitation of interpersonal interactions between contributors enough to warrant the distinction in media.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

=== Virtual presence ===
{{Main|Telepresence}}
Widely viewed, ''virtual presence'' or [[telepresence]] means being present via intermediate technologies, usually radio, telephone, television or the internet. In addition, it can denote apparent physical appearance, such as voice, face and body language.

More narrowly, the term [[virtual presence]] denotes presence on [[World Wide Web]] locations, which are identified by [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s. People who are browsing a web site are considered to be virtually present at web locations. Virtual presence is a social software in the sense that people meet on the web by chance or intentionally. The ubiquitous (in the web space) communication transfers behavior patterns from the real world and [[virtual world]]s to the web. Research&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheizaf Rafaeli]] &amp; Noy, A. (2002), Online auctions, messaging, communication and social facilitation: a simulation and experimental evidence, ''[[European Journal of Information Systems]]'', September 2002, vol. 11, no. 3, pp. 196-207.&lt;/ref&gt;  has demonstrated effects&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheizaf Rafaeli]] and Noy, A. (2005).

EM-Electronic Markets, 15(2), 158-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debates or design choices ==
Social software may be better understood as a ''set'' of debates or design choices, rather than any particular list of tools. Broadly conceived, there are many older media such as [[mailing list]]s and [[Usenet]] fora that qualify as "social". However, most users of this term restrict its meaning to more recent software genres such as [[blog]]s and [[wiki]]s. Others suggest that the term ''social software'' is best used not to refer to a single type of software, but rather to the use of two or more modes of [[computer-mediated communication]] that result in "community formation."&lt;ref&gt;Stowe Boyd, [http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2006/10/are_you_ready_f.html "Are You Ready for Social Software?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112084039/http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2006/10/are_you_ready_f.html |date=2006-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, people form online communities by combining one-to-one (e.g. [[email]] and [[instant messaging]]), one-to-many ([[Web pages]] and [[blogs]]) and many-to-many ([[wiki]]s) communication modes.&lt;ref&gt;Clay Shirky, [http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html "A Group is Its Own Worst Enemy"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some groups schedule [[real life]] meetings and so become "real" communities of people that share physical lives.

Most definers of social software agree that they seem to facilitate "bottom-up" community development. The system is classless and promotes those with abilities. Membership is voluntary, [[reputation]]s are earned by winning the [[Trust (sociology)|trust]] of other members and the community's missions and governance are defined by the members themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Webb, [http://interconnected.org/home/2004/04/28/on_social_software "On Social Software"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Communities formed by "bottom-up" processes are often contrasted to the less vibrant collectivities formed by "top-down" software, in which users' roles are determined by an external authority and circumscribed by rigidly conceived software mechanisms (such as [[access control|access rights]]). Given small differences in policies, the same type of software can produce radically different social outcomes. For instance, [[Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware]] has a fine-grained permission system of detailed access control so the site administrator can, on a page-by-page basis, determine which groups can view, edit or view the history. By contrast, [[MediaWiki]] avoids per-user controls, to keep most pages editable by most users and puts more information about users currently editing in its recent changes pages. The result is that Tiki can be used both by community groups who embrace the social paradigm of MediaWiki and by groups who prefer to have more content control.

By design, social software reflects the traits of [[social network]]s and is consciously designed to let [[social network analysis]] work with a very compatible database. All social software systems create links between users, as persistent as the identity those users choose. Through these persistent links, a permanent community can be formed out of a formerly [[epistemic community]]. The ownership and control of these links - who is linked and who is not - is in the hands of the user. Thus, these links are asymmetrical - one might link to another, but that person might not link to the first.&lt;ref&gt;Trustlet, [http://www.trustlet.org/wiki/Trust_network Definition of trust network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303161017/http://www.trustlet.org/wiki/Trust_network |date=2008-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, these links are functional, not decorative - one can choose not to receive any content from people you are not connected to, for example. [[Wikipedia user page]]s are a very good example and often contain extremely detailed information about the person who constructed them, including everything from their [[mother tongue]] to their [[moral purchasing]] preferences.

In late 2008, independent analyst firm [[CMS Watch]] argued that a scenario-based (use-case) approach to examining social software would provide a useful method to evaluate tools and align business and technology needs.&lt;ref&gt;CMS Watch, [http://www.cmswatch.com/Feature/187-Social-Software "A Scenario-based Approach to Evaluating Social Software"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods and tools for the development of social software are sometimes summarized under the term [[Social Software Engineering]]. However, this term is also used to describe lightweight and community-oriented development practices.&lt;ref&gt;S. Lohmann and T. Riechert, [http://www.dei.inf.uc3m.es/slohmann/publications/SSE2010-lohmann.pdf "Adding Semantics to Social Software Engineering: (Re-)Using Ontologies in a Community-oriented Requirements Engineering Environment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918144453/http://www.dei.inf.uc3m.es/slohmann/publications/SSE2010-lohmann.pdf |date=2010-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Constructivist learning theorists such as [[Vygotsky]], [[D.E. Leidner|Leidner]] and [[S.L. Jarvenpaa|Jarvenpaa]] have theorized that the process of expressing knowledge aids its creation and that conversations benefit the refinement of knowledge. Conversational [[knowledge management]] software fulfills this purpose because conversations, e.g. questions and answers, become the source of relevant knowledge in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Hasan &amp; Charmaine C Pfaff. 2006. [http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1230000/1228250/p377-hasan.pdf?key1=1228250&amp;key2=6609899811&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=15151515&amp;CFTOKEN=6184618 "The Wiki: an environment to revolutionise employees' interaction with corporate knowledge" ACM International Conference Proceeding Series; Vol. 206, pp.377-380.]&lt;/ref&gt; Conversational technologies are also seen as tools to support both individual knowledge workers and work units.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Hasan &amp; Charmaine C Pfaff. 2006. [http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1297&amp;context=commpapers "Emergent Conversational Technologies that are Democratizing Information Systems in Organizations: the case of the corporate Wiki" Proceedings of the Information Systems Foundations (ISF): Theory, Representation and Reality Conference, Australian National University, Canberra, 27-28 September 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many advocates of Social Software assume, and even actively argue, that users create actual [[communities]]. They have adopted the term "[[online communities]]" to describe the resulting social structures.

== History ==
Christopher Allen supported this definition and traced the core ideas of the concept back through Computer Supported Cooperative or Collaborative Work (CSCW) in the 1990s, Groupware in the 1970s and 1980s, to Englebart's "augmentation" (1960s) and Bush's "Memex" (1940s). Although he identifies a "lifecycle" to this terminology that appears to reemerge each decade in a different form, this does not necessarily mean that social software is simply old wine in new bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/10/tracing_the_evo.html|title=Tracing the Evolution of Social Software|author=|date=|website=www.lifewithalacrity.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The augmentation capabilities of social software were demonstrated in early internet applications for communication, such as e-mail, newsgroups, groupware, virtual communities etc. In the current phase of Allen's lifecycle, these collaborative tools add a capability "that aggregates the actions of networked users." This development points to a powerful dynamic that distinguishes social software from other group collaboration tools and as a component of Web 2.0 technology. Capabilities for content and behavior aggregation and redistribution present some of the more important potentials of this media.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} In the next phase, academic experiments, Social Constructivism and the open source software movement are expected to be notable influences.

[[Clay Shirky]] traces the origin of the term "social software" to [[Eric Drexler|Eric Drexler's]] 1987 discussion of "hypertext publishing systems" like the subsequent World Wide Web, and how systems of this kind could support software for public critical discussion, collaborative development, [[Group decision making|group commitment]], and [[collaborative filtering]] of content based on voting and rating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://many.corante.com/20030501.shtml#33811 Social Software] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309222302/http://many.corante.com/20030501.shtml#33811 |date=2010-03-09 }}.

''Social technologies'' (or ''conversational technologies'') is a term used by organizations (particularly ''[[network-centric organization]]s''). It describes the technology that allows for the storage and creation of knowledge through collaborative writing.

=== Timeline ===
In 1945, [[Vannevar Bush]] described a [[hypertext]]-like device called the "[[memex]]" in his ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' article ''[[As We May Think]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Bush |first=Vannevar |date= July 1945 |journal=The Atlantic Monthly

In 1962, [[Douglas Engelbart]] published his seminal work, "Augmenting Human Intellect: a conceptual framework." In this paper, he proposed using computers to augment training. With his colleagues at the Stanford Research Institute, Engelbart started to develop a computer system to augment human abilities, including learning. Debuting in 1968, the system was simply called the oNLine System ([[NLS (computer system)|NLS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the same year, Dale McCuaig presented the initial concept of a global information network in his series of memos entitled "On-Line Man Computer Communication", written in August 1962. However, the actual development of the internet must be credited to [[Lawrence Roberts (scientist)|Lawrence G. Roberts]] of MIT,&lt;ref name="NAE_Draper_Citation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nae.edu/nae/awardscom.nsf/weblinks/NAEW-4NHMN6?OpenDocument|title=Previous Recipients of the Draper Prize|publisher=[[National Academy of Engineering]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302035959/http://www.nae.edu/nae/awardscom.nsf/weblinks/NAEW-4NHMN6?OpenDocument|archivedate=2010-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Leonard Kleinrock]], [[Bob Kahn|Robert Kahn]] and [[Vinton Cerf]].

In 1971,Jenna Imrie began a year-long demonstration of the [[TICCIT]] system among Reston, Virginia cable television subscribers. Interactive television services included informational and educational demonstrations using a touch-tone telephone.  The [[National Science Foundation]] re-funded the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] project and also funded MITRE's proposal to modify its TICCIT technology as a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) system to support English and algebra at community colleges.  MITRE subcontracted instructional design and courseware authoring tasks to the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Brigham Young University]]. Also during this year, [[Ivan Illich]] described computer-based "learning webs" in his book ''Deschooling Society''.&lt;ref&gt;Illich, Ivan (1971). ''Deschooling Society''. New York, Harper &amp; Row {{ISBN|0-06-012139-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, [[Seymour Papert]] at [[MIT]] published "Mindstorms: children, computers, and powerful ideas" (New York: Basic Books). This book inspired a number of books and studies on "microworlds" and their impact on learning. [[BITNET]] was founded by a consortium of US and Canadian universities. It allowed universities to connect with each other for educational communications and e-mail. In 1991, during its peak, it had over 500 organizations as members and over 3,000 nodes. Its use declined as the [[World Wide Web]] grew.

In 1986, [[Tony Bates]] published "''The Role of Technology in Distance Education''",&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;Bates, Tony &amp; Helm, Croom, eds. (1984). ''The Role of Technology in Distance Education''. Retrieved on 15 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting (in 1986!) on ways forward for e-learning. He based this work on 15 years of operational use of computer networks at the Open University and nine years of systematic R&amp;D on CAL, viewdata/videotex, audio-graphic teleconferencing and computer conferencing. Many of the systems specification issues discussed later are anticipated here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cade.athabascau.ca/vol1.1/bates.html Computer Assisted Learning or Communications: &lt;br&gt; Which Way for Information Technology in Distance Education?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213024102/http://cade.athabascau.ca/vol1.1/bates.html |date=2008-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though prototyped in 1983, the first version of Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environments (CSILE) was installed in 1986 on a small network of Cemcorp ICON computers, at an elementary school in Toronto, Canada. CSILE included text and graphical notes authored by different user levels (students, teachers, others) with attributes such as comments and thinking types which reflect the role of the note in the author's thinking. Thinking types included "my theory", "new information", and "I need to understand." CSILE later evolved into [[Knowledge Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jaylemke/courses/ED750/CSILE_KF_illus.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012114829/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jaylemke/courses/ED750/CSILE_KF_illus.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-12 |df= }} CSILE/Knowledge Forum Scardamalia, M.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Tim Berners-Lee]], then a young British engineer working at CERN in Switzerland, circulated a proposal for an in-house online document sharing system which he described as a "web of notes with links." After the proposal was grudgingly approved by his superiors, he called the new system the World Wide Web.

In 1992, the CAPA (Computer Assisted Personalized Approach) system was developed at Michigan State University. It was first used in a 92-student physics class in the fall of 1992. Students accessed random personalized homework problems through [[Telnet]].

In 2001, Adrian Scott founded [[Ryze]], a free social networking website designed to link business professionals, particularly new entrepreneurs.

In February 2002, the suvi.org Addressbook started its service. It was the first service that connected people together. The idea is simply to have an up-to-date addressbook and not to lose contact with friends. Other people on the globe had the same idea. Friendster, Facebook and many other services were successors to this.

In April 2002, Jonathan Abrams created his profile on [[Friendster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/business/yourmoney/15friend.html|title=Wallflower at the Web Party|first=Gary|last=Rivlin|date=15 October 2006|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Hi5]], [[LinkedIn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thealarmclock.com/mt/archives/2004/08/linkedin_hq_mou.html|title=Linked-In – Profile|author=|date=6 August 2004|website=thealarmclock.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MySpace]], and [[XING]] were launched.

In February 2004, [[Facebook]] was launched.

In 2004, Levin (in Allen 2004, sec. 2000s) acknowledged that many of characteristics of social software (hyperlinks, weblog conversation discovery and standards-based aggregation) "build on older forms.". Nevertheless, "the difference in scale, standardization, simplicity and social incentives provided by web access turn a difference in degree to a difference in kind." Key technological factors underlying this difference in kind in the computer, network and information technologies are: filtered hypertext, ubiquitous web/computing, continuous internet connectivity, cheap, efficient and small electronics, content syndication strategies (RSS) and others. Additionally, the convergence of several major information technology systems for voice, data and video into a single system makes for expansive computing environments with far reaching effects.

In October 2005, [[Marc Andreessen]] (after Netscape and Opsware) and [[Gina Bianchini]] co-founded [[Ning (website)|Ning]], an online platform where users can create their own social websites and networks. Ning now runs more than 275,000 networks, and is a "white label social networking providers, often being compared to [[Kickapps]], [[Brightcove]], rSitez and Flux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/07/24/9-ways-to-build-your-own-social-network/|title=Nine Ways to Build Your Own Social Network – TechCrunch|author=|date=|website=techcrunch.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[StudiVZ]] was launched in November 2005.

In 2009, the Army's [[Program Executive Office Command Control Communications Tactical|Program Executive Office - Command, Control, and Communications Tactical (PEO-C3T)]] founded [[milSuite]] capturing the concepts of Wiki, YouTube, Blogging, and connecting with other members of the DOD behind a secure firewall.  This platform engages the premise of social networking while also facilitating [[Open-source software|open source software]] with its purchase of [http://www.jivesoftware.com/ JIVE].

==Criticism==

===Exponential generation of resource consuming negative externalities===

When a person or business sends a message to a network of people this generates an
[[exponential growth|exponential process]] that can consume considerable amounts of resources - most importantly human time.
This approach can have a beneficial effect on those interested in the message, but can also consume time of people not interested in the message.  It can also create in many a [[social obligation]] to look - albeit briefly - at the message - particularly when it is from someone you know or consider to be a friend.

When a message is completely unwanted and unsolicited, this is a form of [[information pollution]] and is often known as [[Spam (electronic)|spam]]. When a message is from a network of friends, and wanted by some but not all, it generates [[negative externalities]] in that it consumes valuable resources (time).

Some examples :
Bill sends an email or social message to 20 friends.  Of these 2 are very interested, 8 become interested,
the rest are not interested but may read all or part of the message anyway, spending their time.
Some of these 20 people will forward the message to their friends.  The process repeats - resulting
in an [[Exponential time#Exponential time|exponentially]] increasing consumption of time by those uninterested in the message (as well
as an exponentially increasing consumption of time by people who are or become interested - which may
distract them from other more productive tasks).  Eventually, when the expected number of people forwarding
a message drops below 1, the process dies out, but in the interim it may circulate widely - resulting
in a potentially massive waste of resources.  Much of the time wasted will be due to a sense
of social obligation to at least scan or check on the title of the message.

====Social networking in a work environment====

Bill works for ACME company and sends out an email memo or network message to 20 coworkers.
Some have to read the message (for example if Bill is their boss or a senior person in the hierarchy), others will just scan it - even if they are uninterested.  Some may comment on it - sharing the response with multiple recipients, others may forward it to others.  Some may not want to read the message, but may feel obligated to read and respond.  The outgoing process of sharing or forwarding takes very little time, but may produce exponentially growing time demands on others.  Over time, employees may find more of their time devoted to social networking demands at work - including scanning, reading, commenting upon, forwarding, and responding to messages.  These social work-obligations may crowd out more productive activities resulting in longer hours with less efficiency.

In a sense, social networking at work is similar to a [[Dilbert|large ongoing group meeting]].
Sometimes excellent results occur, but other times major amounts of time are wasted.
Sometimes output benefits from everyone's input and ongoing consultation, other times,
individual work without constant obligation to check in and gain consensus may be more
productive. The output of a [[camel|"committee"]] is sometimes worse than that of an individual or small team.

===Information overload and arbitrary filtering of communication===

As information supply increases, the average time spent evaluating individual content has to decrease. Eventually, much communication is summarily ignored - based on
very arbitrary and rapid [[heuristics]] that will filter out the information for example by category. Bad information crowds out the good - much the way SPAM often crowds out potentially useful unsolicited communications. (See also the main article on [[Information overload]]).

===Downsides of ubiquitous social networking===

====Cyberbullying====
{{main|Cyberbullying}}
Cyber bullying is different than conventional bullying. Cyber bullying refers to the threat or abuse of a victim by the use of the internet and electronic devices. Victims of cyber bullying can be targeted over social media, email, or text messages.  These attacks are typically aggressive, and repetitive in nature.  Internet bullies can make multiple email, social media, etc. accounts to attack a victim.  Free email accounts that are available to end users can lead a bully to use various identities for communication with the victim.  Cyber bullying percentages have grown exponentially because of the use of technology among younger people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kowalski|first1=Robin|last2=Limber|first2=Susan|last3=Agatston|first3=Patricia|title=Cyberbullying : Bullying in the Digital Age|date=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, MA|isbn=9781444334814|pages=56–57|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyber Bullying Statistics 2014

25 percent of teenagers report that they have experienced repeated bullying via their cell phone or on the internet.
Over half (52 percent) off young people report being cyber bullied.
Embarrassing or damaging photographs taken without the knowledge or consent of the subject has been reported by 11 percent of adolescents and teens.
Of the young people who reported cyber bullying incidents against them, one-third (33 percent) of them reported that their bullies issued online threats.
Often, both bullies and cyber bullies turn to hate speech to victimize their target. One-tenth of all middle school and high school students have been on the receiving end of ‘hate terms' hurled against them.
Over half (55 percent) of all teens who use social media have witnessed outright bullying via that medium.
An astounding 95 percent of teens who witnessed bullying on social media report that others, like them, have ignored the behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobullying.com/cyber-bullying-statistics-2014/|title=Cyber Bullying Statistics - NoBullying - Bullying &amp; CyberBullying Resources|author=|date=24 February 2014|website=nobullying.com|accessdate=21 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322020453/http://nobullying.com/cyber-bullying-statistics-2014/|archive-date=2018-03-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology society and life''' or '''technology and culture''' refers to cyclical co-dependence, co-influence, and co-production of [[technology]] and [[society]] upon the other (technology upon culture, and vice versa). This synergistic relationship occurred from the dawn of humankind, with the invention of simple tools and continues into modern technologies such as the [[printing press]] and [[computer]]s. The academic discipline studying the impacts of science, technology, and society, and vice versa is called [[science and technology studies]].

==Pre-historical==
The importance of [[stone tool]]s, circa 2.5 million years ago, is considered fundamental in the human development in the [[hunting hypothesis]].

Primatologist, [[Richard Wrangham]], theorizes that the [[control of fire by early humans]] and the associated development of [[cooking]] was the spark that radically changed human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Texts such as ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' suggest that early advances in plant agriculture and husbandry fundamentally shifted the way that collective groups of individuals, and eventually societies, developed.

==Modern examples and effects==
Technology has become a huge part in society and day-to-day life. When societies know more about the development in a technology, they become able to take advantage of it. When an innovation achieves a certain point after it has been presented and promoted, this technology becomes part of the society.The use of technology in education provides students with technology literacy, information literacy, capacity for life-long learning and other skills necessary for the 21st century workplace. &lt;ref name=Puricelli&gt;{{harv|Puricelli|2011|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital technology]] has entered each process and activity made by the [[social system]]. In fact, it constructed another worldwide [[communication system]] in addition to its origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rückriem|2009|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1982 study by ''[[The New York Times]]'' described a technology assessment study by the [[Institute for the Future]], "peering into the future of an electronic world." The study focused on the emerging videotex industry, formed by the marriage of two older technologies, communications and computing. It estimated that 40 percent of American households will have two-way videotex service by the end of the century. By comparison, it took television 16 years to penetrate 90 percent of households from the time commercial service was begun.

Since the creation of [[computer]]s achieved an entire better approach to transmit and store [[data]]. Digital technology became commonly used for downloading music and watching movies at home either by [[DVD]]s or purchasing it online.
Digital music records are not quite the same as traditional recording media. Obviously, because [[digital media|digital]] ones are reproducible, portable and free.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Katz|2010|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several states started to implement education technology in schools, universities and colleges. According to the statistics, in the early beginnings of 1990s the use of Internet in schools was ,on average, 2-3%. Continuously, by the end of 1990s the evolution of technology increases rapidly and reaches to 60%, and by the year of 2008 nearly 100% of schools use Internet on educational form. According to ISTE researchers, technological improvements can lead to numerous achievements in classrooms. E-learning system, collaboration of students on project based learning, and technological skills for future results in motivation of students. 

Although these previous examples only show a few of the positive aspects of technology in society, there are negative side effects as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Lynden|first1 = Burke|title = Generation Y Heavily Dependent On Technology, Promotes Laziness|url = http://www.thejambar.com/generation-y-heavily-dependent-on-technology-promotes-laziness/|website = The Jambar|accessdate = 28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this virtual realm, social media platforms such as [[Instagram]], [[Instagram|Facebook]], and [[Snapchat]] have altered the way [[Millennials|Generation Y culture]] is understanding the world and thus how they view themselves. In recent years, there has been more research on the development of social media depression in users of sites like these. "Facebook Depression" is when users are so affected by their friends' posts and lives that their own jealousy depletes their sense of self-worth. They compare themselves to the posts made by their peers and feel unworthy or monotonous because they feel like their lives are not nearly as exciting as the lives of others.&lt;ref name=Puricelli/&gt;

Another instance of the negative effects of technology in society, is how quickly it is pushing younger generations into maturity. With the world at their fingertips, children can learn anything they wish to. But with the uncensored sources from the [[internet]], without proper supervision, children can be exposed to explicit material at inappropriate ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woollaston|first1=Victoria|title=Kids ARE growing up faster today - and it's all down to technology|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2834559/Kids-growing-faster-today-s-technology-Facebook-mobile-phones-causing-young-people-mature-quickly-poll-reveals.html|accessdate=28 October 2015|agency=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes in the forms of premature interests in experimenting with makeup or opening an email account or social media page—all of which can become a window for predators and other dangerous entities that threaten a child's innocence. Technology has a serious effect on youth's health. The overuse of technology is said to be associated with sleep deprivation which is linked to obesity and poor academic performance in the lives of adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi med J. 2016 pages 436-439&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics and technological development==
[[File:Doel Kerncentrale.JPG|thumb|Nuclear reactor, [[Doel]], [[Belgium]]]]

In ancient history, [[economics]] began when spontaneous exchange of goods and services was replaced over time by deliberate trade structures. Makers of arrowheads, for example, might have realized they could do better by concentrating on making arrowheads and barter for other needs. Regardless of goods and services bartered, some amount of technology was involved&amp;mdash;if no more than in the making of shell and bead jewelry. Even the shaman's potions and sacred objects can be said to have involved some technology. So, from the very beginnings, technology can be said to have spurred the development of more elaborate economies.Technology is seen as primary source in economic development.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev]], Artemy Malkov, and Daria Khaltourina. [https://www.academia.edu/35443515/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics_Compact_Macromodels_of_the_World_System_Growth._Moscow_KomKniga_2006 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''] {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology advancement and economic growth are related to each other.The level of technology is important to determine the economic growth.It is the technological process which keeps the economy moving.

In the modern world, superior technologies, resources, geography, and history give rise to robust economies; and in a well-functioning, robust economy, economic excess naturally flows into greater use of technology. Moreover, because technology is such an inseparable part of human society, especially in its economic aspects, funding sources for (new) technological endeavors are virtually illimitable. However, while in the beginning, technological investment involved little more than the time, efforts, and skills of one or a few men, today, such investment may involve the collective labor and skills of many millions.

===Funding===
Consequently, the sources of funding for large technological efforts have dramatically narrowed, since few have ready access to the collective labor of a whole society, or even a large part. It is conventional to divide up funding sources into governmental (involving whole, or nearly whole, social [[Organization|enterprises]]) and private (involving more limited, but generally more sharply focused) business or individual enterprises.

====Government funding for new technology====
The government is a major contributor to the development of new technology in many ways. In the United States alone, many government agencies specifically invest billions of dollars in new technology.

[In 1980, the UK government invested just over six million pounds in a four-year program, later extended to six years, called the [[Microelectronics Education Programme]] (MEP), which was intended to give every school in Britain at least one computer, software, training materials, and extensive teacher training. Similar programs have been instituted by governments around the world.]

Technology has frequently been driven by the military, with many modern applications developed for the military before they were adapted for civilian use. However, this has always been a two-way flow, with industry often developing and adopting a technology only later adopted by the military.

Entire government agencies are specifically dedicated to research, such as America's [[National Science Foundation]], the United Kingdom's [[List of UK government scientific research institutes|scientific research institutes]], America's [[Small Business Innovation Research|Small Business Innovative Research]] effort. Many other government agencies dedicate a major portion of their budget to research and development.

====Private funding====
[[Research and development]] is one of the smallest areas of investments made by corporations toward new and innovative technology.
&lt;!--source needed--&gt;

Many foundations and other nonprofit organizations contribute to the development of technology. In the [[OECD]], about two-thirds of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 98 percent and 10 percent, respectively, by [[University|universities]] and government. But in poorer countries such as [[Portugal]] and [[Mexico]] the industry contribution is significantly less. The U.S. government spends more than other countries on military research and development, although the proportion has fallen from about 30 percent in the 1980s to less than 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723051956/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf |date=July 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 founding of [[Kickstarter]] allows individuals to receive funding via [[crowdsourcing]] for many technology related products including both new physical creations as well as documentaries, films, and webseries that focus on [[technology management]]. This circumvents the corporate or government oversight most inventors and artists struggle against but leaves the accountability of the project completely with the individual receiving the funds.

===Other economic considerations===
* [[Appropriate technology]], sometimes called "intermediate" technology, more of [[Index of economics articles|an economics concern]], refers to compromises between central and expensive technologies of [[Developed country|developed nations]] and those that [[Developing country|developing nations]] find most effective to deploy given an excess of labour and scarcity of cash.
*[[Persuasive technology|Persuasion technology]]: In [[economics]], definitions or assumptions of progress or [[economic growth|growth]] are often related to one or more assumptions about technology's economic influence. Challenging prevailing assumptions about technology and its usefulness has led to alternative ideas like [[uneconomic growth]] or [[Quality of life|measuring well-being]]. These, and economics itself, can often be described as technologies, specifically, as persuasion technology.
* [[Technocapitalism]]
* [[Diffusion (business)|Technological diffusion]]
* [[Technology acceptance model]]
*[[Technology life cycle]]
* [[Technology transfer]]

==Sociological factors and effects==
{{See also|Social construction of technology}}

===Values===
The implementation of technology influences the [[Value (ethics)#Personal and cultural values|values]] of a society by changing expectations and realities. The implementation of technology is also influenced by values. There are (at least) three major, interrelated values that inform, and are informed by, technological innovations:
*[[Mechanism (philosophy)|Mechanistic world view]]: Viewing the universe as a collection of parts (like a machine), that can be individually analyzed and understood.&lt;ref name = McGinn&gt;{{harv|McGinn|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a form of [[reductionism]] that is rare nowadays. However, the "neo-mechanistic world view" holds that nothing in the universe cannot be understood by the human intellect. Also, while all things are greater than the sum of their parts (e.g., even if we consider nothing more than the information involved in their combination), in principle, even this excess must eventually be understood by human intelligence. That is, no [[Divinity|divine]] or [[Vitalism|vital]] principle or essence is involved.
*[[Efficiency (economics)|Efficiency]]: A value, originally applied only to machines, but now applied to all aspects of society, so that each element is expected to attain a higher and higher percentage of its maximal possible performance, output, or ability.
*Social [[progress]]: The belief that there is such a thing as social progress, and that, in the main, it is beneficent. Before the [[Industrial Revolution]], and the subsequent explosion of technology, almost all societies believed in a [[cyclical theory]] of social movement and, indeed, of all history and the universe. This was, obviously, based on the cyclicity of the seasons, and an agricultural economy's and society's strong ties to that cyclicity. Since much of the world is closer to their agricultural roots, they are still much more amenable to cyclicity than progress in history. This may be seen, for example, in Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar's modern social cycles theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metafuture.org/sarkar/prabhat.htm | title=Prabhat rainjan sarkar's social cycles, world unity and peace; Renaissance 2000 honoring Sarkar's 75th Anniversary, LA 1 | work=Metafuture.org | accessdate=July 6, 2016 | author=Galtung, Johan}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a more westernized version of social cyclicity, see ''Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069'' (Paperback) by Neil Howe and William Strauss; Harper Perennial; Reprint edition (September 30, 1992); {{ISBN|0-688-11912-3}}, and subsequent books by these authors.

====Institutions and groups====
Technology often enables organizational and bureaucratic group structures that otherwise and heretofore were simply not possible. Examples of this might include:
*The rise of very large organizations: e.g., governments, the military, health and social welfare institutions, supranational corporations.
*The commercialization of leisure: sports events, products, etc. (McGinn)
*The almost instantaneous dispersal of information (especially news) and entertainment around the world.

===International===
Technology enables greater knowledge of international issues, values, and cultures. Due mostly to mass transportation and mass media, the world seems to be a much smaller place, due to the following:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}
*Globalization of ideas
*Embeddedness of values
*Population growth and control

==Environment==
{{Main article|Environmental technology}}
Technology provides an understanding, and an appreciation for the world around us.

Most modern technological processes produce unwanted by products in addition to the desired products, which is known as industrial waste and pollution. While most material waste is re-used in the industrial process, many forms are released into the environment, with negative environmental side effects, such as pollution and lack of sustainability. Different social and political systems establish different balances between the value they place on additional goods versus the disvalues of waste products and pollution. Some technologies are designed specifically with the environment in mind, but most are designed first for economic or ergonomic effects. Historically, the value of a clean environment and more efficient productive processes has been the result of an increase in the wealth of society, because once people are able to provide for their basic needs, they are able to focus on less tangible goods such as clean air and water.

The effects of technology on the environment are both obvious and subtle. The more obvious effects include the depletion of nonrenewable natural resources (such as petroleum, coal, ores), and the added [[pollution]] of air, water, and land. The more subtle effects include debates over long-term effects (e.g., global warming, deforestation, natural habitat destruction, coastal wetland loss.)

Each wave of technology creates a set of waste previously unknown by humans: [[toxic waste]], [[radioactive waste]], [[electronic waste]].

One of the main problems is the lack of an effective way to remove these pollutants on a large scale expediently. In nature, organisms "recycle" the wastes of other organisms, for example, plants produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis, oxygen-breathing organisms use oxygen to metabolize food, producing carbon dioxide as a by-product, which plants use in a process to make sugar, with oxygen as a waste in the first place. No such mechanism exists for the removal of technological wastes.

==Construction and shaping==

===Choice===
Society also controls technology through the choices it makes. These choices not only include consumer demands; they also include:
*the channels of distribution, how do products go from raw materials to consumption to disposal;
*the cultural beliefs regarding style, freedom of choice, consumerism, materialism, etc.;
*the economic values we place on the environment, individual wealth, government control, capitalism, etc.

According to Williams and Edge,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Williams|Edge|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; the construction and shaping of technology includes the concept of choice (and not necessarily conscious choice). Choice is inherent in both the design of individual artifacts and systems, and in the making of those artifacts and systems.

The idea here is that a single technology may not emerge from the unfolding of a predetermined logic or a single determinant, technology could be a garden of forking paths, with different paths potentially leading to different technological outcomes. This is a position that has been developed in detail by [[Judy Wajcman]]. Therefore, choices could have differing implications for society and for particular social groups.

===Autonomous technology===
In one line of thought, technology develops autonomously, in other words, technology seems to feed on itself, moving forward with a force irresistible by humans. To these individuals, technology is "inherently dynamic and self-augmenting."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McGinn|1991|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Ellul]] is one proponent of the irresistibleness of technology to humans. He espouses the idea that humanity cannot resist the temptation of expanding our knowledge and our technological abilities. However, he does not believe that this seeming autonomy of technology is inherent. But the perceived autonomy is because humans do not adequately consider the responsibility that is inherent in technological processes.

[[Langdon Winner]] critiques the idea that [[Radovan Richta|technological evolution]] is essentially beyond the control of individuals or society in his book Autonomous Technology. He argues instead that the apparent autonomy of technology is a result of "technological somnambulism," the tendency of people to uncritically and unreflectively embrace and utilize new technologies without regard for their broader social and political effects.

===Government===
Individuals rely on governmental assistance to control the side effects and negative consequences of technology.
*Supposed independence of government. An assumption commonly made about the government is that their governance role is neutral or independent. However, some argue that governing is a political process, so government will be influenced by political winds of influence. In addition, because government provides much of the funding for technological research and development, it has a vested interest in certain outcomes. Other point out that the world's biggest ecological disasters, such as the [[Aral Sea]], [[Chernobyl]], and [[Lake Karachay]] have been caused by government projects, which are not accountable to consumers.
*Liability. One means for controlling technology is to place responsibility for the harm with the agent causing the harm. Government can allow more or less legal liability to fall to the organizations or individuals responsible for damages.
*Legislation. A source of controversy is the role of industry versus that of government in maintaining a clean environment. While it is generally agreed that industry needs to be held responsible when pollution harms other people, there is disagreement over whether this should be prevented by legislation or civil courts, and whether ecological systems as such should be protected from harm by governments.

Recently, the social shaping of technology has had new influence in the fields of [[E-Science|e-science]] and [[e-social science]] in the United Kingdom, which has made centers focusing on the social shaping of [[Science and technology studies|science and technology]] a central part of their funding programs.

'''Technology dynamics''' is broad and relatively new scientific field that has been developed in the framework of the postwar [[science and technology studies]] field. It studies the process of [[technological change]]. Under the field of Technology Dynamics the process of technological change is explained by taking into account influences from "internal factors" as well as from "external factors". Internal factors relate technological change to unsolved technical problems and the established modes of solving technological problems and external factors relate it to various (changing) characteristics of the [[social environment]], in which a particular [[technology]] is embedded.

==Overview==

For the last three decades, it has been argued that [[technology development]] is neither an autonomous process, determined by the "inherent progress" of human history, nor a process completely determined by external conditions like the prices of the resources that are needed to operate (develop) a technology, as it is theorized in neoclassical economic thinking. In mainstream neoclassical economic thinking, technology is seen as an exogenous factor: at the moment a technology is required, the most appropriate version can be taken down from the shelf based on costs of labor, capital and eventually raw materials.

Conversely, modern technology dynamics studies generally advocate that technologies are not "self-evident" or market-demanded, but are the upshot of a particular path of technology development and are shaped by social, economic and political factors. in this sense, technology dynamics aims at overcoming distinct "internal" and "external" points of views by presenting co-evolutionary approach regarding technology development.

In general, technology dynamics studies, besides giving a "thick description" of technology development, uses constructivist viewpoints emphasizing that technology is the outcome of particular social context. Accordingly, Technology Dynamics emphasizes the significance and possibility of regaining [[social control]] of technology, and also provides mechanisms needed to adapt to and steer the development of certain technologies. In that respect, it uses insights from retrospective studies to formulate hypotheses of a prospective nature on technology development of emerging technologies, besides formulating prescriptive policy recommendations.

An important feature of relevant theories of technological change therein is that they underline the quasi-evolutionary character of technological change: change based on technological variation and social selection in which technological knowledge, systems and [[institutions]] develop in interaction with each other. Processes of 'path dependence' are crucial in explaining technological change.

Following these lines, there have been different approaches and concepts used under the field of technology dynamics.

==Different frameworks to analyze the dynamics of technology==
*[[Social construction of technology]]
*[[Actor–network theory]]
*[[Systems theory]]
*[[Normalization process theory]]
*Quasi-evolutionary theories
*[[Innovation system]]
*[[Technological innovation system]]

Based on the analysis of the various perspectives, one can aim at developing interventions in the dynamics of a technology. Some approaches have been developed targeting on interventions in technological change:

*[[Technology assessment]]
*[[Backcasting]]
*Strategic niche management 
*[[Transition management (governance)]]

'''Technology education''' is the study of [[technology]], in which students "learn about the processes and knowledge related to technology".&lt;ref&gt;[[International Technology and Engineering Educators Association|ITEA]]. (2000). Standards for technological literacy; Content for the study of technology. Executive Summary. Reston, Va, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; As a field of study, it covers the human ability to shape and change the physical world to meet needs, by manipulating materials and [[tools]] with techniques. It addresses the disconnect between wide usage and the lack of knowledge about technical components of technologies used and how to fix them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education Today: International Perspectives|last=de Vries|first=Marc|last2=Fletcher|first2=Stefan|last3=Labudde|first3=Peter|last4=Lang|first4=Martin|last5=Mammes|first5=Ingelore|last6=Max|first6=Charles|last7=Munk|first7=Dieter|last8=Nicholl|first8=Bill|last9=Strobel|first9=Johannes|publisher=Waxmann Verlag|year=2016|isbn=9783830933847|location=Munster|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emergent discipline seeks to contribute to the learners' overall [[Scientific literacy|scientific]] and [[technological literacy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education in School and Industry: Emerging Didactics for Human Resource Development|last=Blandow|first=Dietrich|last2=Dyrenfurth|first2=Michael|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|isbn=3540582509|location=Berlin|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology education should not be confused with [[educational technology]]. Educational technology focuses on a more narrow subset of technology use that revolves around the use of technology in and for education as opposed to technology education's focus on technology's use in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dugger Jr.|first=William E.|last2=Naik|first2=Nitin|date=September 2001|title=Clarifying Misconceptions between Technology Education and Educational Technology|url=https://www.iteea.org/File.aspx?id=49264|journal=Technology Teacher|volume=61|issue=1|pages=31–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Technology education is an offshoot of the [[Industrial arts|Industrial Arts]] tradition in the [[United States]] and the Craft teaching or vocational education in other countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1980, through what was called the "Futuring Project", the name of "[[industrial arts education]]" was changed to be "technology education" in [[New York (state)|New York State]]; the goal of this movement was to increase students' technological literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oswego.edu/technology/history-1/|title=History {{!}} Department of Technology|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oswego.edu|at=sec. Technology Education|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the nature of technology education is significantly different from its predecessor, Industrial Arts teachers underwent inservice education in the mid-1980s while a Technology Training Network was also established by the New York State Education Department (NYSED).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In Sweden, technology as a new subject emerged from the tradition of crafts subjects while in countries like Taiwan and Australia, its elements are discernible in historical vocational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education for Teachers|last=Williams|first=John|last2=Williams|first2=Anthony|publisher=Macmillan Education Australia Pty Ltd|year=1996|isbn=0732940907|location=South Melbourne|pages=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, [[Mars suit]] design was utilized as a topic for technology education.&lt;ref name="nasa3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/topnav/materials/listbytype/Designing_Spacesuits_Mars.html|title=Designing Spacesuits for Mars|website=NASA|accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technical education is entirely different from general education

In Europe, the European Commission espoused a Digital Education Plan in January 2018. The program consists of 11 initiatives that support utilization of technology and digital capabilities in education development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/education/initiatives/european-education-area/digital-education-action-plan_en|title=Digital Education Action Plan - Education and training - European Commission|website=Education and training|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission also adopted an action plan called the Staff Working Document&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/beyond_gdp/staffworkingdoc_en.html|title=Staff Working Document - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which details its strategy in implementing digital education.
