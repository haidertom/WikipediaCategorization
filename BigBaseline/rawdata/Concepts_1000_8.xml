'''Acceptability''' is the characteristic of a thing being subject to [[acceptance]] for some purpose. A thing is '''acceptable''' if it is sufficient to serve the purpose for which it is provided, even if it is far less usable for this purpose than the ideal example. A thing is '''unacceptable''' (or has the characteristic of '''unacceptability''') if it deviates so far from the ideal that it is no longer sufficient to serve the desired purpose, or if it goes against that purpose. From a logical perspective, a thing can be said to be acceptable if it has no characteristics that make it unacceptable:

{{quote|We say that a theory Δ is acceptable if for any [[Well-formed formula|wff]] α, Δ does not prove both α and ¬α.&lt;ref&gt;Dov M. Gabbay, Odinaldo T. Rodrigues, Alessandra Russo, ''Revision, Acceptability and Context: Theoretical and Algorithmic Aspects'' (2010), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hungarian mathematician [[Imre Lakatos]] developed a concept of acceptability "taken as ''a measure of the approximation to the truth''".&lt;ref name="Stegmüller"&gt;W. Stegmüller, ''Collected Papers on Epistemology, Philosophy of Science and History of Philosophy, Volume 2'' (2012), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was criticized in its applicability to philosophy as requiring that better theories first be eliminated.&lt;ref name="Stegmüller"/&gt; Acceptability is also a key premise of [[negotiation]], wherein opposing sides each begin from a point of seeking their ideal solution, and [[compromise]] until they reach a solution that both sides find acceptable:

{{quote|When a proposal or counter-proposal is received by an agent, it has to decide whether it is acceptable. If it is, the agent can agree to it; if not, and alternative that is acceptable to the receiving agent needs to be generated. Acceptability is determined by searching the hierarchy. If the proposal is a specification of at least one acceptable goal, the proposal is acceptable. If it is the specification of at least one unacceptable goal, the proposal is clearly unacceptable.&lt;ref name="Bouma"&gt;L. G. Bouma, H. Velthuijsen, ''Feature Interactions in Telecommunications Systems'' (1994), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Where an unacceptable proposal has been made, "a counterproposal is generated if there are any acceptable ones that have had already been explored".&lt;ref name="Bouma"/&gt; Since the acceptability of proposition to a participant in a negotiation is only known to that participant, the participant may act as though a proposal that is actually acceptable to them is not, in order to obtain a more favorable proposal. 

==Acceptable risk==

One concept of acceptability that has been widely studied is [[acceptable risk]] in situations affecting human health. The idea of not increasing lifetime risk by more than one in a million has become commonplace in public health discourse and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/iwachap10.pdf|title=Acceptable Risk|first1=Paul R.|last1=Hunter|first2=Lorna|last2=Fewtrell|publisher=''[[World Health Organization]]''|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a heuristic measure. It provides a numerical basis for establishing a negligible increase in risk.

Environmental decision making allows some discretion for deeming individual risks potentially "acceptable" if less than one in ten thousand chance of increased lifetime risk.  Low risk criteria such as these provide some protection for a case where individuals may be exposed to multiple chemicals e.g. pollutants, food additives or other chemicals. In practice, a true zero-risk is possible only with the suppression of the risk-causing activity.

Stringent requirements of 1 in a million may not be technologically feasible or may be so prohibitively expensive as to render the risk-causing activity unsustainable, resulting in the optimal degree of intervention being a balance between risks vs. benefit. For example, emissions from hospital incinerators result in a certain number of deaths per year. However, this risk must be balanced against the alternatives.  There are public health risks, as well as economic costs, associated with all options. The risk associated with no [[incineration]] is potential spread of infectious diseases, or even no hospitals. Further investigation identifies options such as separating noninfectious from infectious wastes, or air pollution controls on a medical incinerator.

==Acceptable variance==

Acceptable variance is the range of variance in any direction from the ideal value that remains acceptable. In [[project management]], variance can be defined as "the difference between what is planned and what is actually achieved".&lt;ref&gt;Guy L. De Furia, ''Project Management Recipes for Success'' (2008), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Degrees of variance "can be classified into negative variance, zero variance, acceptable variance, and unacceptable variance".&lt;ref name="Desikan"&gt;Srinivasan Desikan, ''Software Testing: Principles and Practice'' (2006), p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[software testing]], for example, "[g]enerally 0-5% is considered as acceptable variance" from an ideal value.&lt;ref name="Desikan"/&gt;

[[Acceptance testing]] is a practice used in chemical and engineering fields, intended to check ahead of time whether or not a thing will be acceptable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12611">{{Grammatical categories}}
In [[linguistics]] and [[grammar]], '''affirmation''' and '''negation''' ([[List of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] respectively '''{{sc|aff}}''' and '''{{sc|neg}}''') are the ways that grammar encode negative and positive polarity in [[verb phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, or other [[utterance]]s. Essentially an affirmative (positive) form is used to express the validity or [[truth]] of a basic assertion, while a negative form expresses its falsity. Examples are the [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s "Jane is here" and "Jane is not here"; the first is affirmative, while the second is negative.

The [[grammatical category]] associated and with affirmative and negative is called '''polarity'''. This means that a sentence, verb phrase, etc. may be said to have either affirmative or negative polarity (its polarity may be either affirmative or negative). Affirmative is typically the unmarked polarity, whereas a negative statement is marked in some way, whether by a negating word or particle such as [[English grammar|English]] ''not'', an [[affix]] such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] -''nai'', or by other means, which reverses the meaning of the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. The process of converting affirmative to negative is called '''negation''' – the grammatical rules for negation vary from language to language, and a given language may have more than one method of doing so.

Affirmative and negative responses (especially, though not exclusively, to [[question]]s) are often expressed using [[particle (grammar)|particle]]s or words such as [[yes and no|''yes'' and ''no'']], where ''yes'' is the affirmative and ''no'' the negative particle.

==Affirmative and negative responses==
{{main article|Yes and no}}
Special affirmative and negative words ([[particle (grammar)|particle]]s) are often found in responses to questions, and sometimes to other assertions by way of agreement or disagreement. In English, these are ''yes'' and ''no'' respectively, in French ''oui'', ''si'' and ''non'', in Swedish ''ja'', ''jo'' and ''nej'', and so on. Not all languages make such common use of particles of this type; in some (such as [[Welsh grammar|Welsh]]) it is more common to repeat the verb or another part of the predicate, with or without negation accordingly.

Complications sometimes arise in the case of responses to negative statements or questions; in some cases the response that confirms a negative statement is the negative particle (as in English: "You're not going out? No."), but in some languages this is reversed. Some languages have a distinct form to answer a negative question, such as French ''si'' and Swedish ''jo'' (these serve to contradict the negative statement suggested by the first speaker).

== Grammatical rules for negation ==

===Simple negation of verbs and clauses===
Languages have a variety of [[grammar|grammatical]] rules for converting affirmative [[verb phrase]]s or [[clause]]s into negative ones.

In many languages, an affirmative is made negative by the addition of a [[grammatical particle|particle]], meaning "not". This may be added before the [[verb phrase]], as with the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''no'':
* ''Está en casa.'' ("(S)he is at home", affirmative)
* '''''No''' está en casa.'' ("(S)he is not at home", negative)
Other examples of negating particles preceding the verb phrase include [[Italian language|Italian]] ''non'', [[Russian grammar|Russian]] не ''nye'' and [[Polish grammar|Polish]] ''nie'' (they can also be found in [[constructed language]]s: ''ne'' in [[Esperanto language|Esperanto]] and ''non'' in [[Interlingua grammar|Interlingua]]). In some other languages the negating particle follows the verb or verb phrase, as in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]:
*''Ik zie hem.'' ("I see him", affirmative)
*''Ik zie hem '''niet'''.'' ("I do not see him", negative)
Particles following the verb in this way include ''not'' in archaic and dialectal [[English language|English]] ("you remember not"), ''nicht'' in [[German language|German]] (''ich schlafe nicht'', "I am not sleeping"), and ''inte'' in [[Swedish Language|Swedish]] (''han hoppade inte'', "he did not jump").

In [[French language|French]], particles are added both before the verb phrase (''ne'') and after the verb (''pas''):
*''Je sais'' ("I know", affirmative)
*''Je '''ne''' sais '''pas''''' ("I don't know", negative).
However, in colloquial French the first particle is often omitted: ''Je sais pas''. Similar use of two negating particles can also be found in [[Afrikaans]]: ''Hy kan '''nie''' Afrikaans praat '''nie''''' ("He cannot speak Afrikaans").

In standard [[Modern English]], negation is achieved by adding ''not'' after an [[auxiliary verb]] (which here means one of a special grammatical class of verbs that also includes forms of the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''be''; see [[English auxiliaries]]). If no such verb is present then the [[Auxiliary verb#Dummy|dummy auxiliary]] ''do'' (''does'', ''did'') is introduced – see [[do-support|''do''-support]].  For example:
*I have gone → I have '''not''' gone (''have'' is the auxiliary)
*He goes → He '''does not''' go (no auxiliary in the original sentence)
Different rules apply in [[subjunctive]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[non-finite clause|non-finite]] clauses. For more details see {{slink|English grammar|Negation}}. (In [[Middle English]], the particle ''not'' could follow any verb, e.g. "I see not the horse.")

In some languages, like [[Welsh language|Welsh]], verbs have special inflections to be used in negative clauses. (In some language families, this may lead to reference to a negative [[grammatical mood|mood]].) An example is [[Japanese language|Japanese]], which conjugates verbs in the negative after adding the suffix ''-nai'' (indicating negation), e.g. ''taberu'' ("eat") and ''tabe'''nai''''' ("do not eat"). It could be argued that English has joined the ranks of these languages, since negation requires the use of an auxiliary verb and a distinct [[syntax]] in most cases; the form of the basic verb can change on negation, as in "he '''sings'''" vs. "he doesn't '''sing'''". [[Arnold Zwicky|Zwicky]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum|Pullum]] have shown that ''n't'' is an [[inflection]]al suffix, not a [[clitic]] or a derivational suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complex rules for negation also apply in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]; see {{slink|Finnish grammar|Negation of verbs}}. In some languages negation may also affect the dependents of the verb; for example in some [[Slavic languages]], such as [[Russian language|Russian]], the [[grammatical case|case]] of a [[direct object]] often changes from [[accusative]] to [[genitive]] when the verb is negated.

===Negation of other elements===
Negation can be applied not just to whole verb phrases, clauses or sentences, but also to specific elements (such as [[adjective]]s and [[noun phrase]]s) within sentences.&lt;ref&gt;The linguist D. Biber refers to two types of negation, synthetic ('no', 'neither' or 'nor' negation) and analytic ('not' negation). For example, "He is neither here nor there" (synthetic) or "He is not here" (analytic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ways in which this can be done again depend on the grammar of the language in question. English generally places ''not'' before the negated element, as in "I witnessed '''not a debate''', but a war." There are also negating affixes, such as the English [[prefix]]es ''non-'', ''un-'', ''in-'', etc. Such elements are called [[privative]]s.

===Multiple negation===
{{Main article|Double negative|Litotes}}
There also exist elements which carry a specialized negative meaning, including [[pronoun]]s such as ''nobody'', ''none'' and ''nothing'', [[determiners]] such as ''no'' (as in "no apples"), and adverbs such as ''never'', ''no longer'' and ''nowhere''.

Although such elements themselves have negative force, in some languages a clause in which they appear is additionally marked for ordinary negation. For example, in Russian, "I see nobody" is expressed as я никого́ не ви́жу ''ja nikovó nye vízhu'', literally "I nobody not see" – the ordinary negating particle не ''nye'' ("not") is used in addition to the negative pronoun никого́  ''nikovó'' ("nobody"). Italian behaves in a similar way: ''Non ti vede nessuno'', "nobody can see you", although ''Nessuno ti vede'' is also a possible clause with exactly the same meaning.

In  [[Russian language|Russian]], all of the elements ("not", "never", "nobody", "nowhere") would appear together in the sentence in their negative form. In Italian, a clause works much as in Russian, but ''non'' does not have to be there, and can be there only before the verb if it precedes all other negative elements: ''Tu non porti mai nessuno da nessuna parte''. "Nobody ever brings you anything here", however, could be translated ''Nessuno qui ti porta mai niente'' or ''Qui non ti porta mai niente nessuno''. In French, where simple negation is performed using ''ne ... pas'' (see above), specialized negatives appear in combination with the first particle (''ne''), but ''pas'' is omitted:
*''Je '''ne''' bois '''jamais''''' ("I '''never''' drink")
*''Je '''ne''' vois '''personne''''' ("I see '''nobody'''")
*''Je '''n'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''ai '''jamais''' vu '''personne''''' ("I have '''never''' seen '''anybody'''") 
  
In [[Ancient Greek]], a simple negative (οὐ ''ou'' "not" or μή ''mḗ'' "not ([[Linguistic modality|modal]])") following another simple or compound negative (e.g. οὐδείς ''oudeís'' "nobody") results in an affirmation, whereas a compound negative following a simple or compound negative strengthens the negation:
* οὐδεὶς οὐκ ἔπασχέ τι ''oudeìs ouk épaskhé ti'', "nobody was not suffering something", i.e. "everybody was suffering"
* μὴ θορυβήσῃ μηδείς ''mḕ thorubḗsēi mēdeís'', "let (not) nobody raise an uproar", meaning "let nobody raise an uproar"

==Meaning of negation==
Simple grammatical negation of a clause in principle has the effect of converting a proposition to its [[negation|logical negation]] – replacing an assertion that something is the case by an assertion that it is not the case.

In some cases, however, particularly when a particular [[linguistic modality|modality]] is expressed, the semantic effect of negation may be somewhat different. For example, in English, the meaning of "you must not go" is not in fact the exact negation of that of "you must go" – this would be expressed as "you don't have to go" or "you needn't go". The negation "must not" has a stronger meaning (the effect is to apply the logical negation to the following infinitive rather than to the full clause with ''must''). For more details and other similar cases, see the relevant sections of [[English modal verbs]].

In some cases, by way of [[irony]], an affirmative statement may be intended to have the meaning of the corresponding negative, or vice versa. For examples see [[antiphrasis]] and [[sarcasm]].

For the use of double negations or similar as understatements ("not unappealing", "not bad", etc.) see [[litotes]].

The '''Andersen Healthcare Utilization Model - ''' is a [[conceptual model]] aimed at demonstrating the factors that lead to the use of health services. According to the model, usage of health services (including inpatient care, physician visits, dental care etc.) is determined by three dynamics: predisposing factors, enabling factors, and need. Predisposing factors can be characteristics such as race, age, and health beliefs.  For instance, an individual who believes health services are an effective treatment for an ailment is more likely to seek care. Examples of enabling factors could be family support, access to health insurance, one's community etc. Need represents both perceived and actual need for health care services. The original model was developed by Ronald M. Andersen, a health services professor at [[UCLA]], in 1968. The original model was expanded through numerous iterations and its most recent form models past the use of services to end at health outcomes and includes feedback loops.&lt;ref name="revisiting"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=Ronald|title=Revisiting the behavioral model and access to medical care: does it matter?|journal=J Health Soc Behav|year=1995|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–10|pmid=7738325|doi=10.2307/2137284}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-01-31--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access and Mutability==
A major motivation for the development of the model was to offer measures of access. Andersen discusses four concepts within access that can be viewed through the conceptual framework. Potential access is the presence of enabling resources, allowing the individual to seek care if needed. Realized access is the actual use of care, shown as the outcome of interest in the earlier models. The Andersen framework also makes a distinction between equitable and inequitable access.  Equitable access is driven by demographic characteristics and need whereas inequitable access is a result of social structure, health beliefs, and enabling resources.

Andersen also introduces the concept of mutability of his factors. The idea here being that if a concept has a high degree of mutability (can be easily changed) perhaps policy would be justified in using its resources to do rather than a factor with low mutability. Characteristics that fall under demographics are quite difficult to change, however, enabling resources is assigned a high degree of mutability as the individual, community, or national policy can take steps to alter the level of enabling resources for an individual. For example, if the government decides to expand the [[Medicaid]] program an individual may experience an increase in enabling resources, which in turn may beget an increase in health services usage. The [[RAND Health Insurance Experiment]] (HIE) changed a highly mutable factor, out-of-pocket costs, which greatly changed individual rates of health services usage.&lt;ref name="rand hie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhouse|first=J|title=Free for All? Lessons from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment|year=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-31846-3|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/commercial_books/CB199.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier Models==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lifecycle andersen.png|thumb|right|alt=Earlier versions of the Andersen model.|Lifecycle of the Andersen Model.&lt;ref name="revisiting" /&gt;]] --&gt;
The initial behavior model was an attempt to study of why a family uses health services.  However, due to the heterogeneity of family members the model focused on the individual rather than the family as the unit of analysis. Andersen also states that the model functions both to predict and explain use of health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=R|author2=Newman JF|title=Societal and individual determinants of medical care utilization in the United States|journal=Milbank Mem Fund Q Health Soc|year=1973|volume=51|issue=1|pages=95–124|pmid=4198894|doi=10.2307/3349613|pmc=2690261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second model was developed in the 1970s in conjunction with Aday and colleagues at the [[University of Chicago]]. This iteration includes systematic concepts of health care such as current policy, resources, and organization. The second generation model also extends the outcome of interest beyond utilization to consumer satisfaction.&lt;ref name=second&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aday|first=Lu Ann|author2=Andersen R|title=A framework for the study of access to medical care|journal=Health Serv Res|year=1974|volume=9|issue=3|pmid=4436074|pmc=1071804|pages=208–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next generation of the model builds upon this idea by including health status (both perceived and evaluated) as outcomes alongside consumer satisfaction. Furthermore, this model include personal health practices as an antecedent to outcomes, acknowledging that it not solely use of health services that drives health and satisfaction. This model emphasizes a more public health approach of prevention, as advocated by Evans and Stoddart&lt;ref name=evans&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=RG|author2=Stoddart GL|title=Producing health, consuming health care|journal=Soc Sci Med|year=1990|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1347–63|pmid=2126895|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(90)90074-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein personal health practices (i.e. smoking, diet, exercise) are included as a driving force towards health outcomes.

The 6th iteration of Andersen’s conceptual framework &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Ronald M.|last2=Davidson|first2=Pamela L.|last3=Baumeister|first3=Sebastian E.|title=Improving Access to Care in: Chaning the U.S. Health Care System|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian_Baumeister/publication/306017030_Andersen2014_Improving_Access_to_Care_in_Kominski_Changing_the_US_Health_Care_System/data/57aace3e08ae42ba52ad8a24/Andersen2014-Improving-Access-to-Care-in-Kominski-Changing-the-US-Health-Care-System.pdf|website=researchgate.net |publisher=Jossey Bass|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on the individual as the unit of analysis and goes beyond health care utilization, adopting health outcomes as the endpoint of interest.  This model is further differentiated from its predecessors by using a feedback loop to illustrate that health outcomes may affect aspects such as health beliefs, and need.  It added genetic susceptibility as a predisposing determinant and quality of life as an outcome &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Ronald M.|last2=Davidson|first2=Pamela L.|last3=Baumeister|first3=Sebastian E.|title=Improving Access to Care in: Chaning the U.S. Health Care System|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian_Baumeister/publication/306017030_Andersen2014_Improving_Access_to_Care_in_Kominski_Changing_the_US_Health_Care_System/data/57aace3e08ae42ba52ad8a24/Andersen2014-Improving-Access-to-Care-in-Kominski-Changing-the-US-Health-Care-System.pdf|website=researchgate.net |publisher=Jossey Bass|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By using the framework’s relationships we can determine the directionality of the effect following a change in an individual’s characteristics or environment. For example, if one experiences an increase in need as a result of an infection, the Andersen model predicts this will lead to an increased use of services (all else equal). One potential change for a future iteration of this model is to add genetic information under predisposing characteristics.&lt;ref name=true&gt;{{cite journal|last=True|first=WR|author2=et. al|title=Genetic and environmental contributions to healthcare need and utilization: a twin analysis|journal=Health Ser Res|year=1997|volume=32|issue=1|pages=37–53|pmid=9108803|pmc=1070168}}&lt;/ref&gt; As genetic information becomes more readily available it seems likely this could impact health services usage, as well as health outcomes, beyond what is already accounted for in the current model.&lt;ref name=rosenau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenau|first=PV|title=Reflections on the cost consequences of the new gene technology for health policy|journal=Int J Technol Assess Health Care|year=1994|volume=10|issue=4|pages=546–61|pmid=7843877|doi=10.1017/s0266462300008151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms and Rebuttals==
The model has been criticized for not paying enough attention to culture and social interaction but Andersen argues this social structure is included in the ''predisposing characteristics'' component.&lt;ref name=guendelman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guendelman|first=S|title=Health care users residing on the Mexican border. What factors determine choice of the U.S. or Mexican health system?|journal=Med Care|year=1991|volume=29|issue=5|pages=419–29|pmid=2020207|doi=10.1097/00005650-199105000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Portes|first=A|author2=Kyle D |author3=Eaton WW |title=Mental illness and help-seeking behavior among Mariel Cuban and Haitian refugees in south Florida|journal=J Health Soc Behav|date=Dec 1992|volume=33|issue=4|pages=283–298|pmid=1464715|doi=10.2307/2137309}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-01-30--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Another criticism was the overemphasis of  need and at the expense of health beliefs and social structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolinsky|first=FD|author2=Johnson RJ|title=The use of health services by older adults|journal=J Gerontol|date=Nov 1991|volume=46|issue=6|pages=S345-57|pmid=1940101|doi=10.1093/geronj/46.6.s345}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Andersen argues need itself is a [[social construct]].  This is why need is split into perceived and evaluated. Where evaluated need represents a more measurable/objective need, perceived need is partly determined by health beliefs, such as whether or not people think their condition is serious enough to seek health services. Another limitation of the model is its emphasis on health care utilization or adopting health outcomes as a dichotomous factor, present or not present. Other help-seeking models also consider the type of help source, including informal sources.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, C. J., Deane, F. P., Ciarrochi, J., &amp; Rickwood, D. (2005).

The '''Apollonian and Dionysian''' is a [[philosophical]] and literary [[concept]], or also a [[dichotomy]], based on [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]] in [[Greek mythology]].  Some [[Western culture|Western]] philosophical and literary figures have invoked this dichotomy in critical and creative works, most notably [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and later followers.  

In Greek mythology, Apollo and Dionysus are both [[son of God|sons]] of [[Zeus]]. Apollo is the god of the sun, of rational thinking and order, and appeals to logic, prudence and purity.  Dionysus is the god of wine and dance, of irrationality and chaos, and appeals to emotions and instincts. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] did not consider the two gods to be opposites or rivals, although often the two deities were entwined by nature.

==Nietzsche's version==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
Although the use of the concepts of the Apollonian and Dionysian is linked to [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', the terms were used before him in [[German culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Del Caro, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709799 Dionysian Classicism, or Nietzsche's Appropriation of an Aesthetic Norm]", in ''[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]'', Vol. 50, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 1989), pp. 589–605 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]] spoke of them, while [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] talked of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], the god of wine. After Nietzsche, others have continued to make use of the distinction. For example, [[Rudolf Steiner]] treated in depth the Apollonian and Dionysian and placed them in the general history and spiritual evolution of mankind.

[[File:Attic Black-Figure Lekythos with (Body) Dionysos between Maenads and Satyrs and (Shoulder) a Seated Man between Women and Men LACMA 50.9.43.jpg|thumb|230px|Attic Black-Figure Lekythos with (Body) Dionysos between Maenads and Sileni and (Shoulder) a Seated Man between Women and Men]]

Nietzsche's [[aesthetic]] usage of the concepts, which was later developed philosophically, first appeared in his book ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', which was published in 1872. His major premise here was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian "''Kunsttriebe''" ("artistic impulses") form dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. [[Nietzsche]] is adamant that the works of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with [[Euripides]] that tragedy begins its downfall ("''Untergang''"). Nietzsche objects to Euripides's use of Socratic rationalism (the [[dialectic]]) in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of [[ethics]] and [[reason]] robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian.

To further the split, Nietzsche diagnoses the [[Socratic method|Socratic Dialectic]] as being diseased in the manner that it deals with looking at life. The scholarly dialectic is directly opposed to the concept of the Dionysian because it only seeks to negate life; it uses reason to always deflect, but never to create. Socrates rejects the intrinsic value of the senses and life for "higher" ideals. Nietzsche claims in ''[[The Gay Science]]'' that when Socrates drinks the hemlock, he sees the hemlock as the cure for life, proclaiming that he has been sick a long time. (Section 340.) In contrast, the Dionysian existence constantly seeks to affirm life.  Whether in pain or pleasure, suffering or joy, the intoxicating revelry that Dionysus has for life itself overcomes the Socratic sickness and perpetuates the growth and flourishing of visceral life force—a great Dionysian 'Yes', to a Socratic 'No'. 
&lt;!-- As above, these two principles can only be described by provisional estimations and whatever Nietzsche states ought to mime that chord scrupulously, but these contrasts/notations might make it quite familiar to the reader wherewith their meaning can be adduced. Furthermore, something will have to be mentioned about the Greeks ''et cetera'' below in this section of the article; therefore, I have added a "section-stub" here. Consequently, other parts of this article will most likely require a slight alteration as well and additional evenhandedness, for this is a much debated topic. --&gt;

The interplay between the Apollonian and Dionysian is apparent, Nietzsche claimed in ''The Birth of Tragedy'', from their use in [[Greek tragedy]]: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make order of his unjust fate, though he dies unfulfilled in the end. For the audience of such a drama, Nietzsche claimed, this tragedy allows them to sense an underlying essence, what he called the "Primordial Unity", which revives our Dionysian nature—which is almost indescribably pleasurable. However, he later dropped this concept saying it was "...burdened with all the errors of youth" (Attempt at Self-Criticism, §2), the overarching theme was a sort of metaphysical solace or connection with the heart of creation.

Different from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s idea of the sublime, the Dionysian is all-inclusive rather than alienating to the viewer as a sublimating experience. The sublime needs critical distance, while the Dionysian demands a closeness of experience. According to Nietzsche, the critical distance, which separates man from his closest emotions, originates in Apollonian ideals, which in turn separate him from his essential connection with self. The Dionysian embraces the chaotic nature of such experience as all-important; not just on its own, but as it is intimately connected with the Apollonian. The Dionysian magnifies man, but only so far as he realizes that he is one and the same with all ordered human experience. The godlike unity of the Dionysian experience is of utmost importance in viewing the Dionysian as it is related to the Apollonian, because it emphasizes the harmony that can be found within one's chaotic experience.

==Other viewpoints==
===Post-modern reading===
Nietzsche's idea has been interpreted as an expression of ''fragmented consciousness'' or existential instability by a variety of modern and post-modern writers, especially [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AeNOhsRjzrcC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=Michel+Foucault+Apollonian+and+Dionysian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N5jHLWLXKP&amp;sig=tBkq0FoIuszQzCyAvLlF0aJUNcc&amp;hl=sr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dEJ4ULm3N8jxsga8jYCoBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Michel%20Foucault%20Apollonian%20and%20Dionysian&amp;f=false|title=The Postmodernism Reader|first=Drolet |last=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postmodernism and the re-reading of modernity By Francis Barker, Peter Hulme, Margaret Iversen, Manchester University Press,1992, {{ISBN|978-0-7190-3745-0}} p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Peter Sloterdijk]], the Dionysian and the Apollonian form a dialectic; they are contrasting, but Nietzsche does not mean one to be valued more than the other.&lt;ref&gt;Thinker on Stage: Nietzsche's Materialism, translation by Jamie Owen Daniel; foreword by Jochen Schulte-Sasse, Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8166-1765-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truth being ''primordial pain'', our existential being is determined by the Dionysian/Apollonian dialectic.

Extending the use of the Apollonian and Dionysian onto an argument on interaction between the mind and physical environment, Abraham Akkerman has pointed to masculine and feminine features of city form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Femininity and Masculinity in City-Form: Philosophical Urbanism as a History of Consciousness|journal=Human Studies|first=Abraham|last=Akkerman|volume=29|issue=2|pages=229–256|doi= 10.1007/s10746-006-9019-4|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/9337128m117q48k2/|year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruth Benedict===
Anthropologist [[Ruth Benedict]] used the terms to characterize cultures that value restraint and modesty (Apollonian) and ostentatiousness and excess (Dionysian). An example of an Apollonian culture in Benedict's analysis was the [[Zuñi people]] as opposed to the Dionysian [[Kwakiutl|Kwakiutl people]].&lt;ref&gt;BENEDICT, R. (1932), CONFIGURATIONS OF CULTURE IN NORTH AMERICA. American Anthropologist, 34: 1–27. doi: 10.1525/aa.1932.34.1.02a00020&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was developed by Benedict in her main work ''[[Patterns of Culture]]''.

===Albert Szent-Györgyi===
[[Albert Szent-Györgyi]], who wrote that "a discovery must be, by definition, at variance with existing knowledge",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szent-Györgyi|first=Albert|date=1972-06-02|title=Dionysians and Apollonians|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/176/4038/966.1|journal=Science|language=en|volume=176|issue=4038|pages=966–966|doi=10.1126/science.176.4038.966|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17778411}}&lt;/ref&gt; divided scientists into two categories: the Apollonians and the Dionysians. He called scientific dissenters, who explored "the fringes of knowledge", Dionysians. He wrote, "In science the Apollonian tends to develop established lines to perfection, while the Dionysian rather relies on intuition and is more likely to open new, unexpected alleys for research...The future of mankind depends on the progress of science, and the progress of science depends on the support it can find. Support mostly takes the form of grants, and the present methods of distributing grants unduly favor the Apollonian."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Camille Paglia===
American humanities scholar [[Camille Paglia]] writes about the Apollonian and Dionysian in her 1990 bestseller ''[[Sexual Personae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille (1990). ''[[Sexual Personae|Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson]],'' New York: Vintage Books.{{isbn missing|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broad outline of her concept has roots in Nietzschean discourse, an admitted influence, although Paglia's ideas diverge significantly.

The Apollonian and Dionysian concepts comprise a dichotomy that serves as the basis of Paglia's theory of art and culture. For Paglia, the Apollonian is light and structured while the Dionysian is dark and [[chthonic]] (she prefers ''Chthonic'' to Dionysian throughout the book, arguing that the latter concept has become all but synonymous with [[hedonism]] and is inadequate for her purposes, declaring that "the Dionysian is no picnic."). The Chthonic is associated with females, wild/chaotic nature, and unconstrained sex/procreation. In contrast, the Apollonian is associated with males, clarity, celibacy and/or homosexuality, rationality/reason, and solidity, along with the goal of oriented progress: "Everything great in western civilization comes from struggle against our origins."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

She argues that there is a biological basis to the Apollonian/Dionysian dichotomy, writing: "The quarrel between Apollo and Dionysus is the quarrel between the higher [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] and the older [[limbic]] and reptilian brains."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Paglia attributes all the progress of human civilization to masculinity revolting against the Chthonic forces of nature, and turning instead to the Apollonian trait of ordered creation. The Dionysian is a force of chaos and destruction, which is the overpowering and alluring chaotic state of wild nature. Rejection of &amp;ndash; or combat with &amp;ndash; Chthonianism by socially constructed Apollonian virtues accounts for the historical dominance of men (including asexual and homosexual men; and childless and/or lesbian-leaning women) in science, literature, arts, technology and politics. As an example, Paglia states: "The male orientation of [[classical Athens]] was inseparable from its genius. Athens became great not despite but because of its misogyny."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apophatic theology''', also known as '''negative theology''',{{sfn|McCombs|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=_cbuGVI_UNAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22negative+theology%22%22apophatic+theology%22%22via+negativa%22%22via+negationis%22 84]}} is a form of [[theology|theological]] thinking and religious practice which attempts to [[Problem of religious language|approach God]], the Divine, by [[negation]], to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is [[God]].{{r|Bunnin_Yu|group=web}} It forms a pair together with [[cataphatic theology]], which approaches God or the Divine by affirmations or positive statements about what God ''is''.{{r|DC_interview|group=web}}

The apophatic tradition is often, though not always, allied with the approach of [[mysticism]], which aims at the vision of God, the perception of the divine reality beyond the realm of [[Perception|ordinary perception]].{{sfn|Belzen|Geels|2003|p=84–87}}

==Etymology and definition==
"Apophatic", {{lang-grc|ἀπόφασις}} ([[adjective]]); from ἀπόφημι ''apophēmi'', meaning "to deny". From ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'': 
{{quote|apophatic (adj.) "involving a mention of something one feigns to deny; involving knowledge obtained by negation", 1850, from Latinized form of Greek ''apophatikos'', from apophasis "denial, negation", from apophanai "to speak off," from apo "off, away from" (see apo-) + phanai "to speak," related to pheme "voice," from PIE root *bha- (2) "to speak, tell, say."{{r|OED|group=web}}}}

''Via negativa'' or ''via negationis'' ([[Latin]]), "negative way" or "by way of denial".{{sfn|McCombs|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=_cbuGVI_UNAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22negative+theology%22%22apophatic+theology%22%22via+negativa%22%22via+negationis%22 84]}} The negative way forms a pair together with the ''[[kataphatic]]'' or positive way. According to Deirdre Carabine,
{{quote|Dionysius describes the kataphatic or affirmative way to the divine as the "way of speech": that we can come to some understanding of the Transcendent by attributing all the perfections of the created order to God as its source. In this sense, we can say "God is Love", "God is Beauty", "God is Good". The apophatic or negative way stresses God's absolute transcendence and unknowability in such a way that we cannot say anything about the divine essence because God is so totally beyond being. The dual concept of the immanence and transcendence of God can help us to understand the simultaneous truth of both "ways" to God: at the same time as God is immanent, God is also transcendent. At the same time as God is knowable, God is also unknowable. God cannot be thought of as one or the other only.{{r|DC_interview|group=web}}}}

==Origins and development==
According to Fagenblat, "negative theology is as old as philosophy itself;" elements of it can be found in Plato's "unwritten doctrines," while it is also present in Neo-Platonic, Gnostic and early Christian writers. A tendency to apophatic thought can also be found in [[Philo of Alexandria]].{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}}

According to Carabine, "apophasis proper" in Greek thought starts with Neo-Platonism, with its speculations about the nature of the One, culminating in the works of Proclus.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} According to Carabine, there are two major points in the development of apophatic theology, namely the fusion of the Jewish tradition with Platonic philosophy in the writings of Philo, and the works of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite, who infused Christian thought with Neo-Platonic ideas.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}}

The Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo,{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} and Meredith even states that Philo "is the real founder of the apophatic tradition."{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}} Yet, it was with [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Maximus the Confessor]],{{sfn|Berthold|1985|p=9}} whose writings shaped both [[Hesychasm]], the contemplative tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the mystical traditions of western Europe, that apophatic theology became a central element of Christian theology and contemplative practice.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}}

==Greek philosophy==

===Pre-Socratic===
For the ancient Greeks, knowledge of the gods was essential for proper worship.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} Poets had an important responsibility in this regard, and a central question was how knowledge of the Divine forms can be attained.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} [[Epiphany (feeling)|Epiphany]] played an essential role in attaining this knowledge.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} [[Xenophanes]] (c. 570 – c. 475 BC) noted that the knowledge of the Divine forms is restrained by the human imagination, and Greek philosophers realized that this knowledge can only be mediated through myth and visual representations, which are culture-dependent.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}}

According to [[Herodotus]] (484–425 BCE), [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] (between 750 and 650 BC) taught the Greek the knowledge of the Divine bodies of the Gods.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=51}} The ancient Greek poet Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) describes in his ''[[Theogony]]'' the birth of the gods and creation of the world,{{r|ellopsos|group=web}} which became an "ur-text for programmatic, first-person [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphanic]] narratives in Greek literature,"{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}}{{refn|group=note|Hesiod's ''Theogony'' was highly referred in the time of [[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), and Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' shows a profound familiarity with Hesiod's ''Theogony''.{{sfn|Boys-Stones|Haubold|2009|p=xiviii}} See also Timaeus e39-e41.{{r|ellopsos|group=web}}}} but also "explores the necessary limitations placed on human access to the divine."{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} According to Platt, the statement of the Muses who grant Hesiod knowledge of the Gods "actually accords better with the logic of apophatic religious thought."{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|Richard G. Geldard: "[M]ore than any other pre-Socratic thinker, Heraclitus embodies the apophatic method. He "unsaid" the myths of the Archaic tradition on his way to transforming the ideas of divinity through the divine Logos. It was a transformation affirmed by Plotinus 800 years later."{{sfn|Geldard|2000|p=23}}}}

[[Parmenides]] (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC), in his poem ''On Nature'', gives an account of a revelation on two ways of inquiry. "The way of conviction" explores Being, true reality ("what-is"), which is "What is ungenerated and deathless,/whole and uniform, and still and perfect."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109-111}} "The way of opinion" is the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. His distinction between unchanging Truth and shifting opinion is reflected in Plato's [[allegory of the Cave]]. Together with the Biblical story of Moses's ascent of Mount Sinai, it is used by Gregory of Nyssa and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite to give a Christian account of the ascent of the soul toward God.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=111-112}} Cook notes that Parmenides poem is a religious account of a mystical journey, akin to the [[mystery cults]],{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109}} giving a philosophical form to a religious outlook.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=112}} Cook further notes that the philosopher's task is to "attempt through 'negative' thinking to tear themselves loose from all that frustrates their pursuit of wisdom."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=112}}

===Plato===
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377]]
[[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), "deciding for Parmenides against [[Heraclitus]]" and his theory of eternal change,{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} had a strong influence on the development of apophatic thought.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}}

Plato further explored Parmenides's idea of timeless truth in his dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', which is a treatment of the [[Theory of Forms|eternal forms]], ''Truth, Beauty and Goodness'', which are the real aims for knowledge.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} The Theory of Forms is Plato's answer to the problem "how one unchanging reality or essential{{clarify|date=July 2017}} being can admit of many changing phenomena (and not just by dismissing them as being mere illusion)."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}}

In ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato argues that the "real objects of knowledge are not the changing objects of the senses, but the immutable Forms,"{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}} stating that the ''[[Form of the Good]]''{{refn|group=note|Identified by various commentators with the Form of Unity.{{explain|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}}} is the highest object of knowledge.{{sfn|Kahn|1998|p=61}}{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}}{{refn|group=note|See ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' 508d–e, 511b, 516b)}} His argument culminates in the [[Allegory of the Cave]], in which he argues that humans are like prisoners in a cave, who can only see shadows of the Real, the ''Form of the Good''.{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}} Humans are to be educated to search for knowledge, by turning away from their bodily desires toward higher contemplation, culminating in an intellectual{{refn|group=note|As opposed to mere rationality.}} understanding or apprehension of the Forms, c.q. the "first principles of all knowledge."{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}

According to Cook, the ''Theory of Forms'' has a theological flavour, and had a strong influence on the ideas of his Neo-Platonist interpreters Proclus and Plotinus.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} The pursuit of ''Truth, Beauty and Goodness'' became a central element in the apophatic tradition,{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} but nevertheless, according to Carabine "Plato himself cannot be regarded as the founder of the negative way."{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=21}} Carabine warns not to read later Neo-Platonic and Christian understandings into Plato, and notes that Plato did not identify his Forms with "one transcendent source," an identification which his later interpreters made.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=21-22}}

===Middle Platonism===
{{Main|Middle Platonism}}

[[Middle Platonism]] (1st century BCE - 3rd century CE){{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} further investigated Plato's "Unwritten Doctrines," which drew on [[Pythagoras]]' first principles of the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]] and the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|Dyad]] (matter).{{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} Middle Platonism proposed a [[hierarchy of being]], with God as its first principle at its top, identifying it with Plato's ''Form of the Good''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} An influential proponent of Middle Platonism was [[Philo of Alexandria|Philo]] (c.25 BCE–c. 50 CE), who employed Middle Platonic philosophy in his interpretation of the Hebrew scriptures, and asserted a strong influence on early Christianity.{{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} According to Craig D. Allert, "Philo made a monumental contribution to the creation of a vocabulary for use in negative statements about God."{{sfn|Allert|2002|p=89}} For Philo, God is undescribable, and he uses terms which emphasize God's transcendence.{{sfn|Allert|2002|p=89}}

===Neo-Platonism===
{{Main|Neo-Platonism}}

Neo-Platonism was a mystical or contemplative form of Platonism, which "developed outside the mainstream of Academic Platonism."{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}} It started with the writings of Plotinus (204/5–270), and ended with the closing of the Platonic Academy by Emperor Justinian in 529 CE, when the pagan traditions were ousted.{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}} It is a product of Hellenistic syncretism, which developed due to the crossover between Greek thought and the Jewish scriptures, and also gave birth to [[Gnosticism]].{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}} Proclus was the last head of the Platonic Academy; his student Pseudo-Dinosysius had a far-stretching Neo-Platonic influence on Christianity and Christian mysticism.{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}}

====Plotinus====
[[File:Plotinus.jpg|thumb|left|Plotinus]]
[[Plotinus]] (204/5–270) was the founder of Neo-Platonism.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} In the [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonic philosophy]] of Plotinus and Proclus, the first principle became even more elevated as a radical unity, which was presented as an unknowable Absolute.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} For Plotinus, ''the One'' is the first principle, from which everything else emanates.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} He took it from Plato's writings, identifying the Good of the ''Republic'', as the cause of the other Forms, with ''the One'' of the first hypothesis of the second part of the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]''.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} For Plotinus, ''the One'' precedes the [[Theory of Forms|Forms]],{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} and "is beyond Mind and indeed beyond Being."{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} From ''the One'' comes the [[Nous|Intellect]], which contains all the Forms.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} ''The One'' is the principle of Being, while the Forms are the principle of the essence of beings, and the intelligibility which can recognize them as such.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} Plotinus's third principle is Soul, the desire for objects external to the person. The highest satisfaction of desire is the contemplation of ''the One'',{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} which unites all existents "as a single, all-pervasive reality."{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}}

''The One'' is radically simple, and does not even have self-knowledge, since self-knowledge would imply multiplicity.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} Nevertheless, Plotinus does urge for a search for the Absolute, turning inward and becoming aware of the "presence of the intellect in the human soul,"{{refn|group=note|Compare Korean Chon (Zen) master [[Jinul]]s "tracing back the radiance":&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''"Question: What is the mind of void and calm, numinous awareness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chinul: What has just asked me this question is precisely your mind of void and calm, numinous awareness. Why not trace back its radiance rather than search for it outside? For your benefit I will now point straight to your original mind so that you can awaken to it. Clear your minds and listen to my words."''{{r|Chinul|group=web}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See also {{Citation | last =Buswell | first =Robert E. | year =1991 | title =Tracing Back the Radiance: Chinul's Korean Way of Zen | publisher =University of Hawaii Press}}}} initiating an ascent of the soul by [[Abstraction#In philosophy|abstraction]] or "taking away," culminating in a [[Subitism|sudden appearance]] of ''the One''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=8}} In the ''[[Enneads]]'' Plotinus writes: 
{{quote|Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul [...] To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One.}}

Carabine notes that Plotinus' apophasis is not just a mental exercise, an acknowledgement of the unknowability of ''the One'', but a means to ''[[Ecstasy (philosophy)|extasis]]'' and an ascent to "the unapproachable light that is God."{{r|Carabine_interview|group=web}} Pao-Shen Ho, investigating what are Plotinus' methods for reaching ''[[henosis]]'',{{refn|group=note|The Neoplatonic concept of ''henosis'' has precedents in the Greek [[mystery religions]]{{sfn|Angus|1975|p=52}} as well as parallels in [[Eastern philosophy]].{{sfn|Gregorios|2002}}}} concludes that "Plotinus' mystical teaching is made up of two practices only, namely philosophy and negative theology."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} According to Moore, Plotinus appeals to the "non-discursive, intuitive faculty of the soul," by "calling for a sort of prayer, an invocation of the deity, that will permit the soul to lift itself up to the unmediated, direct, and intimate contemplation of that which exceeds it (V.1.6)."{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}} Pao-Shen Ho further notes that "for Plotinus, mystical experience is irreducible to philosophical arguments."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} The argumentation about ''henosis'' is preceded by the actual experience of it, and can only be understood when ''henosis'' has been attained.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} Ho further notes that Plotinus's writings have a didactic flavour, aiming to "bring his own soul and ''the souls of others'' by way of [[Nous|Intellect]] to union with the One."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} As such, the ''Enneads'' as a spiritual or ascetic teaching device, akin to ''The Cloud of Unknowing'',{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20-21}} demonstrating the methods of philosophical and apophatic inquiry.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=26}} Ultimately, this leads to silence and the abandonment of all intellectual inquiry, leaving contemplation and unity.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=25-27}}

====Proclus====
[[Proclus]] (412-485) introduced the terminology which is being used in apophatic and cataphatic theology.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=139}} He did this in the second book of his ''Platonic Theology'', arguing that Plato states that ''the One'' can be revealed "through analogy," and that "through negations [''dia ton apophaseon''] its transcendence over everything can be shown."{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=139}} For Proclus, apophatic and cataphonic theology form a contemplatory pair, with the apophatic approach corresponding to the manifestation of the world from ''the One'', and cataphonic theology corresponding to the return to ''the One''.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=140}} The analogies are affirmations which direct us toward ''the One'', while the negations underlie the confirmations, being closer to ''the One''.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=140}} According to Luz, Proclus also attracted students from other faiths, including the Samaritan Marinus. Luz notes that "Marinus' Samaritan origins with its Abrahamic notion of a single [[Ineffability|ineffable]] [[Tetragrammaton|Name of God]] ({{Hebrew|יהוה}}) should also have been in many ways compatible with the school's ineffable and apophatic divine principle."{{sfn|Luz|2017|p=149}}

==Christianity==
===Apostolic Age===
The [[Book of Revelation]] 8:1 mentions "the silence of the perpetual choir in heaven." According to Dan Merkur,
{{quote|The silence of the perpetual choir in heaven had mystical connotations, because silence attends the disappearance of plurality during experiences of mystical oneness. The term "silence" also alludes to the "still small voice" ([[1 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|1 Kings|19:12|HE|}}) whose [[theophany|revelation]] to [[Elijah]] on [[Mount Horeb]] rejected visionary imagery by affirming a negative theology.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=331}}{{refn|group=note|According to Michel Masson, Elijah's theophany is an "apophatic revelation," a mystical experience which is akin to ''nirvana'' and Böhme's ''Ungrund''."

===Early Church Fathers===
The [[Early Church Fathers]] were influenced by [[Philo of Alexandria|Philo]]{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} (c. 25 BCE – c. 50 CE), who saw [[Moses]] as "the model of human virtue and Sinai as the archetype of man's ascent into the "luminous darkness" of God."{{sfn|Woloschak|2016}} His interpretation of Moses was followed by Clement of Alexandria, [[Origen]], the Cappadocian Fathers, Pseudo-Dionysius, and Maximus the Confessor.{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Lane|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}}{{sfn|Boersma|2013|p=243}}

God's appearance to Moses in the [[burning bush]] was often elaborated on by the Early Church Fathers,{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}} especially [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c. 335 – c. 395),{{sfn|Lane|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}}{{sfn|Boersma|2013|p=243}} realizing the fundamental unknowability of God;{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Mayes|2016|p=117]}} an exegesis which continued in the medieval mystical tradition.{{sfn|Glasscoe|1992|p=57]}} Their response is that, although God is unknowable, Jesus as person can be followed, since "following Christ is the human way of seeing God."{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=221}}

[[Clement of Alexandria]] (c. 150 – c. 215) was an early proponent of apophatic theology.{{sfn|Hägg|2006}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}} According to R.A. Baker, in Clement's writings the term ''theoria'' develops further from a mere intellectual "seeing" toward a spirutal form of contemplation.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=88}} Clement's apophatic theology or philosophy is closely related to this kind of ''theoria'' and the "mystic vision of the soul."{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=88}} For Clement, God is transcendent and immanent.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=89}} According to Baker, Clement's apophaticism is mainly driven by Biblical texts, but by the Platonic tradition.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92-92}} His conception of an ineffable God is a synthesis of Plato and Philo, as seen from a Biblical perspective.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92}} According to Osborne, it is a synthesis in a Biblical framework; according to Baker, while the Platonic tradition accounts for the negative approach, the Biblical tradition accounts for the positive approach.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92-93}} ''Theoria'' and abstraction is the means to conceive of this ineffable God; it is preceded by dispassion.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=98-103}}

According to [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 – c. 240),
{{quote|[t]hat which is infinite is known only to itself.  This it is which gives some notion of God, while yet beyond all our conceptions{{spndash}}our very incapacity of fully grasping Him affords us the idea of what He really is.  He is presented to our minds in His transcendent greatness, as at once known and unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Apologeticus'', § 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Saint [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (313-386), in his ''[[Catechesis|Catechetical]] [[Homily|Homilies]]'', states: 
{{quote|For we explain not what God is but candidly confess that we have not exact knowledge concerning Him.

===Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite===
Apophatic theology found its most influential expression in the works of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (late 5th to early 6th century), a student of [[Proclus]] (412-485), combining a Christian worldview with Neo-Platonic ideas.&lt;ref name="Berthold1985_p9"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berthold |first1=George C. |title="Introduction" to Maximus the Confessor.

Dionysius the Areopagite was a pseudonym, taken from [[Acts of the Apostles]] chapter 17, in which [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] gives a [[Areopagus sermon|missionary speech to the court of the Areopagus]] in Athens.{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=12}} In {{bibleref2|Acts|17:23|KJV|verse 23}} Paul makes a reference to an altar-inscription, dedicated to the [[Unknown God]], "a safety measure honoring foreign gods still unknown to the Hellenistic world."{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=12}} For Paul, Jesus Christ is this unknown God, and as a result of Paul's speech Dionysius the Areopagite converts to Christianity.{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=13}} Yet, according to Stang, for Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite Athens is also the place of Neo-Platonic wisdom, and the term "unknown God" is a reversal of Paul's preaching toward an integration of Christianity with Neo-Platonism, and the union with the "unknown God."{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=13}}

According to Corrigan and Harrington, "Dionysius' central concern is how a triune God, ... who is utterly unknowable, unrestricted being, beyond individual substances, beyond even goodness, can become manifest to, in, and through the whole of creation in order to bring back all things to the hidden darkness of their source."{{sfn|Corrigan|Harrington|2014}} Drawing on Neo-Platonism, Pseudo-Dionysius described humans [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|ascend to divinity]] as a process of purgation, illumination and union.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=439}} Another Neo-Platonic influence was his description of the cosmos as a series of hierarchies, which overcome the distance between God and humans.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=439}}

{{Main|Eastern Orthodox Church}}

In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] apophatic theology is taught as superior to cataphatic theology. The fourth-century [[Cappadocian Fathers]]{{refn|group=note|[[Basil the Great]] (330–379), who was bishop of [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]]; Basil's younger brother [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c.332–395), who was bishop of [[Nyssa (Cappadocia)|Nyssa]]; and a close friend, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (329–389), who became [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Commentary on Song of Songs; Letter on the Soul; Letter on Ascesis and the Monastic Life|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4168|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} stated a belief in the existence of God, but an existence unlike that of everything else: everything else that exists was created, but the Creator [[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]] this existence, is uncreated. The [[essence]] of God is completely unknowable; mankind can know God only through His [[Energies of God|energies]].&lt;ref name="McGinn"&gt;{{cite book |last=McGinn |first=Bernard |chapter=4.

[[John of Damascus]] (c.675/676–749) employed negative theology when he wrote that positive statements about God reveal "not the nature, but the things around the nature."

[[Maximus the Confessor]] (580-622) took over Pseudo-Dionysius' ideas, and had a strong influence on the theology and contemplative practices of the Eastern Orthodox Churches.&lt;ref name="Berthold1985_p9"/&gt; [[Gregory Palamas]] (1296–1359) formulated the definite theology of [[Hesychasm]], the Orthodox practices of [[contemplative prayer]] and [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], "deification."

Influential modern Eastern Orthodox theologians are [[Vladimir Lossky]], [[John Meyendorff]], [[John S. Romanides]] and [[Georges Florovsky]]. Lossky argues, based on his reading of Dionysius and Maximus Confessor, that positive theology is always inferior to negative theology which is a step along the way to the superior knowledge attained by negation.&lt;ref&gt;Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This is expressed in the idea that [[mysticism]] is the expression of dogmatic theology ''par excellence''.&lt;ref&gt;Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lossky, outside of directly revealed knowledge through [[Scripture]] and [[Sacred Tradition]], such as the Trinitarian nature of God, God in His essence is beyond the limits of what human beings (or even [[angel]]s) can understand. He is [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] in essence (''[[ousia]]''). Further knowledge must be sought in a direct experience of God or His [[Energies of God|indestructible energies]] through ''[[Christian contemplation|theoria]]'' (vision of God).&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Lossky|Lossky, Vladimir]] (1997), ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'', Crestwood, N.Y.: [[SVS Press]], p. 81, {{ISBN|0-913836-31-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lossky (1997), ''The Vision of God'', Crestwood, N.Y.: SVS Press, pp. 36–40, {{ISBN|0-913836-19-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle Papanikolaou, in Eastern Christianity, God is [[Immanence|immanent]] in his [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] or existences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle Papanikolaou|Papanikolaou, Aristotle]] (2006), ''Being With God: Trinity, Apophaticism, and Divine–Human Communion'' (1st Edition), Notre Dame, Indiana:[[University of Notre Dame Press]], p. 2, {{ISBN|978-0-268-03830-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Christianity===
Negative theology has a place in the Western Christian tradition as well. The 9th-century theologian [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|John Scotus Erigena]] wrote: 
{{quote|We do not know what God is. God Himself does not know what He is because He is not anything [i.e., "not any created thing"]. Literally God ''is not'', because He [[transcendence (religion)|transcends]] [[being]].''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=Eriugena+%22We+do+not+know+what+God+is.+God+Himself+does+not+know+what+He+is+because+He+is+not+anything.+Literally+God+is+not%2C+because+He+transcends+being%22 Quote] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
When he says "''He is not anything''" and "''God is not''", Scotus does not mean that there is no God, but that God cannot be said to exist in the way that creation exists, i.e. that God is uncreated. He is using apophatic language to emphasise that God is "other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Indick|first1=William|title=The Digital God.

Theologians like [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[Saint John of the Cross]] (San Juan de la Cruz) exemplify some aspects of or tendencies towards the apophatic tradition in the West. The medieval work, ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' and Saint John's ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]'' are particularly well known. In 1215 apophatism became the official position of the [[Catholic Church]], which, on the basis of [[Religious text#Christianity|Scripture]] and [[Sacred tradition|church tradition]], during the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Fourth Lateran Council]] formulated the following [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|dogma]]:

According to Adrian Langdon,
{{quote|The distinction between univocal, equivocal, and analogous language and relations corresponds to the distinction between the ''via positiva'', via ''negativa'', and ''via eminentiae''.

According to ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', the ''Doctor Angelicus'' and the [[Scholasticism|scholastici]] declare [that] 
{{quote|God is not absolutely unknowable, and yet it is true that we cannot define Him adequately. But we can conceive and name Him in an "analogical way".

Yet, they are not in Him as they are in the creature, with a mere difference of degree, nor even with a mere specific or generic difference (''univoce''), for there is no common concept including the finite and the Infinite. They are really in Him in a supereminent manner (''eminenter'') which is wholly incommensurable with their mode of being in creatures. We can conceive and express these perfections only by an analogy; not by an analogy of proportion, for this analogy rests on a participation in a common concept, and, as already said, there is no element common to the finite and the Infinite; but by an analogy of proportionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia |last=Sauvage |first=George |year=1907 |inline=1 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01449a.htm|title=Analogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[C. S. Lewis]], in his book ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'' (1947), advocates the use of negative theology when first thinking about God, in order to cleanse our minds of misconceptions. He goes on to say we must then refill our minds with the truth about God, untainted by mythology, bad [[analogies]] or false mind-pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brazier |first=P.

The mid-20th century Dutch philosopher [[Herman Dooyeweerd]], who is often associated with a neo-Calvinistic tradition, provides a philosophical foundation for understanding why we can never absolutely know God, and yet, paradoxically, truly know something of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friesen|first1=J. Glenn|title=The religious dialectic revisited|url=https://jgfriesen.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/revisited.pdf|website=jgfriesen.files|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dooyeweerd made a sharp distinction between theoretical and pre-theoretical attitudes of thought. Most of the discussion of knowledge of God presupposes theoretical knowledge, in which we reflect and try to define and discuss. Theoretical knowing, by its very nature, is never absolute, always depends on religious presuppositions, and cannot grasp either God or the law side. Pre-theoretical knowing, on the other hand, is intimate engagement, and exhibits a diverse range of aspects. Pre-theoretical intuition, on the other hand, can grasp at least the law side. Knowledge of God, as God wishes to reveal it, is pre-theoretical, immediate and intuitive, never theoretical in nature.&lt;ref name="VanDrunen"&gt;{{cite book |last=VanDrunen |first=David |title=Natural Law and the Two Kingdoms.

[[Ivan Illich]] (1926-2002), the historian and social critic, can be read as an apophatic theologian, according to a longtime collaborator, Lee Hoinacki, in a paper presented in memory of Illich, called "Why Philia?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pudel.uni-bremen.de/pdf/Hoinacki_Clar04_Philia_philia_en.pdf Hoinacki, Lee].&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
According to [[Deirdre Carabine]], negative theology has become a hot topic since the 1990s,{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=i, viii}} resulting from a broad effort in the 19 and 20th century to portray Plato as a mysticist, which revived the interest in Neoplatonism and negative theology.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=i-ii}}

[[File:Maimonides-2.jpg|thumb|left|Maimonides]]

[[Maimonides]] (1135/1138-1204) was "the most influential medieval Jewish exponent of the ''via negativa''."{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}} Maimonides, but also [[Samuel ibn Tibbon]], draw on [[Bahya ibn Paquda]],{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} who shows that our inability to describe God is related to the fact of His [[Jewish principles of faith#God is One|absolute unity]]. God, as the entity which is "truly One" (האחד האמת), must be free of properties and is thus unlike anything else and [[Divine simplicity|indescribable]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} According to Rabbi Yosef Wineberg, Maimonides stated that "[God] is knowledge," and saw His Essence, Being and knowledge as completely one, "a perfect unity and not a composite at all."&lt;ref name="Wineberg"/&gt; Wineberg quotes Maimonides as stating
{{quote|This [form of unity] wherein G‑d’s knowledge and so on is one with G‑d Himself is beyond the capacity of the mouth to express, beyond the capacity of the ear to hear, and beyond the capacity of the heart of man to apprehend clearly.&lt;ref name="Wineberg"&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=7994 ''Shaar Hayichud Vehaemunah Ch. 8]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' Maimonides stated:
{{quote|God's existence is absolute and it includes no composition and we comprehend only the fact that He exists, not His essence. Consequently it is a false assumption to hold that He has any positive [[Abstraction|attribute]] [...] still less has He accidents (מקרה), which could be described by an attribute. Hence it is clear that He has no positive attribute however, the negative attributes are necessary to direct the mind to the truths which we must believe [...] When we say of this being, that it exists, we mean that its non-existence is impossible; it is living &amp;mdash; it is not dead; [...] it is the first &amp;mdash; its existence is not due to any cause; it has power, wisdom, and will &amp;mdash; it is not feeble or ignorant; [[Jewish principles of faith#God is One|He is One]] &amp;mdash; there are not more Gods than one [...] Every attribute predicated of God denotes either the quality of an action, or, when the attribute is intended to convey some idea of the Divine Being itself &amp;mdash; and not of His actions &amp;mdash; the [[negation]] of the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp.htm 1:58]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Fagenblat, it is only in the modern period that negative theology really gains importance in Jewish thought.{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}} [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] (1903-1994) was a prominent modern exponent of Jewish negative theology.{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=2}} According to Leibowitz, a person's faith is his commitment to obey God, meaning God's commandments, and this has nothing to do with a person’s image of God. This must be so because Leibowitz thought that God cannot be described, that God's understanding is not man's understanding, and thus all the questions asked of God are out of place.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, "God, Man and Nietzsche: A Startling Dialogue between Judaism and Modern Philosophers" (New York: iUniverse, 2008), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian parallels==
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|Shankara]]
There are interesting parallels in Indian thought, which developed largely separate from Western thought. Early [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophical]] works which have apophatic themes include the [[Mukhya Upanishads|Principal Upanishads]] (800 BCE to the start of common era) and the [[Brahma Sutras]] (from 450 BCE and 200 CE). An expression of negative theology is found in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], where Brahman is described as "[[neti neti]]" or "neither this, nor that".&lt;ref&gt;Tharaud, Barry. Emerson for the Twenty-First Century: Global Perspectives on an American Icon. Rosemont Publishing and Printing Corp, 2010. p. 453. {{ISBN|978-0-87413-091-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further use of apophatic theology is found in the Brahma Sutras, which state:{{Quote|Whenever we deny something unreal, it is in reference to something real.&lt;ref&gt;Verse III.2.22, Brahma-Sutra, Translated by Swami Gambhirananda.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Buddhist philosophy]] has also strongly advocated the way of negation, beginning with the Buddha's own theory of [[anatta]] (not-[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]], not-self) which denies any truly existent and unchanging essence of a person. [[Madhyamaka]] is a Buddhist philosophical school founded by [[Nagarjuna]] (2nd-3rd century CE), which is based on a fourfold negation of all assertions and concepts and promotes the theory of emptiness ([[Śūnyatā|shunyata]]). Apophatic assertions are also an important feature of Mahayana sutras, especially the [[Prajnaparamita|prajñaparamita]] genre. These currents of negative theology are visible in all forms of Buddhism.

Apophatic movements in medieval [[Hindu philosophy]] are visible in the works of [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] (8th century), a philosopher of [[Advaita Vedanta]] (non-dualism), and [[Bhartṛhari]] (5th century), a grammarian. While Shankara holds that the transcendent noumenon, [[Brahman]], is realized by the means of negation of every phenomenon including language, Bhartṛhari theorizes that language has both phenomenal and noumenal dimensions, the latter of which manifests Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward|Coward, Harold G.]] and Foshay, Toby. Derrida and Negative Theology. State University of New York, 1992. P. 21. {{ISBN|0-7914-0964-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Advaita, Brahman is defined as being [[Nirguna]] or without qualities. Anything imaginable or conceivable is not deemed to be the ultimate reality.&lt;ref&gt;Renard, John.  Responses to One Hundred One Questions on Hinduism. Paulist Press, 1999. P. 75. {{ISBN|0-8091-3845-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taittiriya]] hymn speaks of Brahman as "one where the mind does not reach". Yet the Hindu scriptures often speak of Brahman's positive aspect. For instance, Brahman is often equated with bliss. These contradictory descriptions of Brahman are used to show that the attributes of Brahman are similar to ones experienced by mortals, but not the same. 

Negative theology also figures in the [[Buddhist]] and Hindu [[polemics]]. The arguments go something like this – Is Brahman an object of experience? If so, how do you convey this experience to others who have not had a similar experience? The only way possible is to relate this unique experience to common experiences while explicitly negating their sameness.

==Apophatic theology and atheism==
Even though the ''via negativa'' essentially rejects theological understanding in and of itself as a path to God, some have sought to make it into an intellectual exercise, by describing God only in terms of what God is not. One problem noted with this approach is that there seems to be no fixed basis on deciding what God is not, unless the Divine is understood as an abstract experience of full aliveness unique to each individual consciousness, and universally, the perfect goodness applicable to the whole field of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pondé|first1=Luiz Felipe|title=Crítica e profecia: a filosofia da religião em Dostoiévski |date=2003 |publisher=Editora 34 |location=São Paulo|pages=74–92|isbn=8573262842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apophatic theology is often accused of being a version of [[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]], since it cannot say truly that God exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Kvanvig |editor-first=Jonathan |editor-link=Jonathan Kvanvig |year=2015 |chapter=7.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2533">The concept of '''canon''' is very broad; in a general sense it refers to being a rule or a body of rules.

There are definitions that state it as: “the body of rules, principles, or standards accepted as axiomatic and universally binding in a field of study or art”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/canon |title=Define Canon|publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|date= |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be related to such topics as literary canons or the canons of rhetoric, which is a topic within itself that describes the rules of giving a speech. There are five key principles, and when grouped together, are the principles set for giving speeches as seen with regard to [[Rhetoric]]. This is one such example of how the term canon is used in regard to rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;WordNet 3.1. retrieved 2011-12-03 from: [http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=canon&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o8=1&amp;o1=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o9=&amp;o6=&amp;o3=&amp;o4=&amp;h= Canon Search Word.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.C Sayers (1915–1916) established a system of canons of classification Sayers, W.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3896">The '''Comstock–Needham system''' is a naming system for [[insect]] [[Insect wing|wing]] [[veins]], devised by [[John Henry Comstock|John Comstock]] and [[James George Needham|George Needham]] in 1898. It was an important step in showing the [[homology (biology)|homology]] of all [[insect wings]]. This system was based on Needham's ''pretracheation theory'' that was later discredited by [[Frederic Charles Fraser]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, F. C.  1938.  A note on the fallaciousness of the theory of pretracheation in the venation of Odonata.  ''Proc. Roy. Ent. Soc. London'' (A) 13: 60–70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vein terminology==

===Longitudinal veins===
[[Image:Comstock-needham.svg|thumb|Insect wing venation, showing the names after the Comstock–Needham system|400px|right]]The Comstock and Needham system attributes different names to the veins on an insect's wing. From the [[anterior]] (leading) edge of the wing towards the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] (rear), the major [[Anatomical terms of location|longitudinal]] veins are named:
*{{anchor|costa}}''costa'' '''C''', meaning ''rib''
*{{anchor|subcosta}}''subcosta'' '''Sc''', meaning ''below the rib''
*{{anchor|radius}}''radius'' '''R''', in analogy with a bone in the forearm, the [[radius (bone)|radius]]
*{{anchor|media}}''media'' '''M''', meaning ''middle''
*{{anchor|cubitus}}''cubitus'' '''Cu''', meaning ''elbow''
*{{anchor|anal veins}}''anal veins'' '''A''', in reference to its posterior location

Apart from the costal and the anal veins, each vein can be branched, in which case the branches are numbered from anterior to posterior. For example, the two branches of the {{anchor|subcostal vein}}subcostal vein will be called '''Sc&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

The {{anchor|radial veins}}radius typically branches once near the base, producing anteriorly the '''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and posteriorly the ''radial sector'' '''Rs'''. The radial sector may fork twice.

The media may also fork twice, therefore having four branches reaching the wing margin.

According to the Comstock–Needham system, the cubitus forks once, producing the {{anchor|cubital vein}}cubital veins Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 
According to some other authorities, Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; may fork again, producing the Cu&lt;sub&gt;1a&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sub&gt;1b&lt;/sub&gt;.

As there are several anal veins, they are called '''A1''', '''A2''', and so on. They are usually unforked.

===Crossveins===
Crossveins link the longitudinal veins, and are named accordingly (for example, the medio-cubital crossvein is termed '''m-cu'''). Some crossveins have their own name, like the [[humeral]] crossvein '''h''' and the sectoral crossvein '''s'''.

==Cell terminology==
The cells are named after the vein on the anterior side; for instance, the cell between Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is called '''Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

In the case where two cells are separated by a crossvein but have the same anterior longitudinal vein, they should have the same name. To avoid this, they are attributed a number. For example, the R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cell is divided in two by the radial cross vein: the basal cell is termed "first R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;", and the distal cell "second R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;".

If a cell is bordered anteriorly by a forking vein, such as R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the cell is named after the distal vein, in this case R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Concepts''' are mental representations, abstract objects or abilities that make up the fundamental building blocks of [[thought]]s and [[belief]]s. They play an important role in all aspects of [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1 of Laurence and Margolis' book called Concepts: Core Readings. {{ISBN|9780262631938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carey, S. (1991). Knowledge Acquisition: Enrichment or Conceptual Change? In S. Carey and R. Gelman (Eds.), ''The Epigenesis of Mind: Essays on Biology and Cognition'' (pp. 257-291). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy]], there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what a concept is:&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab at Stanford University|accessdate=6 November 2012|author=Eric Margolis|author2=Stephen Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Concepts as [[mental representation]]s, where concepts are entities that exist in the mind (mental objects)
* Concepts as [[skill|abilities]], where concepts are abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states)
* Concepts as [[Fregean]] senses (see [[sense and reference]]), where concepts are [[abstract objects]], as opposed to mental objects and mental states

Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed "superordinate" and lower levels termed "subordinate". Additionally, there is the "basic" or "middle" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a basic-level concept would be "chair", with its superordinate, "furniture", and its subordinate, "easy chair".

[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|right|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the concept of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables [[Hierarchy (thinking)|higher-level thinking]].]]

A concept is [[wikt:instantiate#Verb|instantiated (reified)]] by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other [[idea]]s.

Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the [[cognitive science]] disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]], where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts. Concepts are used as formal tools or models in [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[databases]] and [[artificial intelligence]] where they are sometimes called [[class (set theory)|classes]], [[database schema|schema]] or [[category (mathematics)|categories]]. In [[wikt:informal#Adjective|informal]] use the word ''concept'' often just means any [[idea]].

== Concepts in the representational theory of mind ==

Within the framework of the [[representational theory of mind]], the structural position of concepts can be understood as follows: Concepts serve as the building blocks of what are called ''mental representations'' (colloquially understood as ''ideas in the mind''). Mental representations, in turn, are the building blocks of what are called ''propositional attitudes'' (colloquially understood as the stances or perspectives we take towards ideas, be it "believing", "doubting", "wondering", "accepting", etc.). And these propositional attitudes, in turn, are the building blocks of our understanding of thoughts that populate everyday life, as well as folk psychology. In this way, we have an analysis that ties our common everyday understanding of thoughts down to the scientific and philosophical understanding of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry Fodor]], ''Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of concepts ==
{{main article|Abstract object}}

A central question in the study of concepts is the question of what concepts ''are''. Philosophers construe this question as one about the [[ontology]] of concepts – what they are really like. The ontology of concepts determines the answer to other questions, such as how to integrate concepts into a wider theory of the mind, what functions are allowed or disallowed by a concept's ontology, etc. There are two main views of the ontology of concepts: (1) Concepts are abstract objects, and (2) concepts are mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Platonism|Platonist]] views of the mind construe concepts as abstract objects,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"&gt;{{cite book|title=Concepts and Cognitive Science|year=1999|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|location=in Concepts: Core Readings|isbn=978-0-262-13353-1|pages=3–83|author=Stephen Lawrence|author2=Eric Margolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate as to the relationship between concepts and [[natural language]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; However, it is necessary at least to begin by understanding that the concept "dog" is philosophically distinct from the things in the world grouped by this concept – or the reference class or [[Extension (semantics)|extension]].&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Concepts that can be equated to a single word are called "lexical concepts".&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt;

Study of concepts and conceptual structure falls into the disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

In the simplest terms, a concept is a name or label that regards or treats an abstraction as if it had concrete or material existence, such as a person, a place, or a thing. It may represent a natural object that exists in the real world like a tree, an animal, a stone, etc. It may also name an artificial (man-made) object like a chair, computer, house, etc. Abstract ideas and knowledge domains such as freedom, equality, science, happiness, etc., are also symbolized by concepts. It is important to realize that a concept is merely a symbol, a representation of the abstraction. The word is not to be mistaken for the thing. For example, the word "moon" (a concept) is not the large, bright, shape-changing object up in the sky, but only ''represents'' that celestial object. Concepts are created (named) to describe, explain and capture reality as it is known and understood.

=== A priori concepts ===
{{Main article|A priori and a posteriori|Category (Kant)}}

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] declared that human minds possess pure or ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' concepts. Instead of being abstracted from individual perceptions, like empirical concepts, they originate in the mind itself. He called these concepts [[category (Kant)|categories]], in the sense of the word that means [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], attribute, characteristic, or [[quality (philosophy)|quality]]. But these pure categories are predicates of things ''in general'', not of a particular thing. According to Kant, there are twelve categories that constitute the understanding of phenomenal objects. Each category is that one predicate which is common to multiple empirical concepts. In order to explain how an ''a priori'' concept can relate to individual phenomena, in a manner analogous to an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' concept, Kant employed the technical concept of the [[schema (Kant)|schema]]. He held that the account of the concept as an abstraction of experience is only partly correct. He called those concepts that result from abstraction "a posteriori concepts" (meaning concepts that arise out of experience). An empirical or an ''a posteriori'' concept is a general representation (''Vorstellung'') or non-specific thought of that which is common to several specific perceived objects ([[Logic]], I, 1., §1, Note 1)

A concept is a common feature or characteristic. Kant investigated the way that empirical ''a posteriori'' concepts are created.
{{Quotation|The logical acts of the understanding by which concepts are generated as to their form are:

# ''comparison'', i.e., the likening of mental images to one another in relation to the unity of consciousness;
# ''reflection'', i.e., the going back over different mental images, how they can be comprehended in one consciousness; and finally
# ''abstraction'' or the segregation of everything else by which the mental images differ ...

In order to make our mental images into concepts, one must thus be able to compare, reflect, and abstract, for these three logical operations of the understanding are essential and general conditions of generating any concept whatever. For example, I see a fir, a willow, and a linden. In firstly comparing these objects, I notice that they are different from one another in respect of trunk, branches, leaves, and the like; further, however, I reflect only on what they have in common, the trunk, the branches, the leaves themselves, and abstract from their size, shape, and so forth; thus I gain a concept of a tree.|Logic, §6}}

===Embodied content===
{{Main article|Embodied cognition}}

In [[cognitive linguistics]], abstract concepts are transformations of concrete concepts derived from embodied experience. The mechanism of transformation is structural mapping, in which properties of two or more source domains are selectively mapped onto a blended space (Fauconnier &amp; Turner, 1995; see [[conceptual blending]]). A common class of blends are [[metaphors]]. This theory contrasts with the rationalist view that concepts are perceptions (or ''recollections'', in [[Plato]]'s term) of an independently existing world of ideas, in that it denies the existence of any such realm. It also contrasts with the empiricist view that concepts are abstract generalizations of individual experiences, because the contingent and bodily experience is preserved in a concept, and not abstracted away. While the perspective is compatible with Jamesian pragmatism, the notion of the transformation of embodied concepts through structural mapping makes a distinct contribution to the problem of concept formation.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Ontology===
{{Main article|Ontology}}

[[Plato]] was the starkest proponent of the realist thesis of universal concepts. By his view, concepts (and ideas in general) are innate ideas that were instantiations of a transcendental world of pure forms that lay behind the veil of the physical world. In this way, universals were explained as transcendent objects. Needless to say this form of realism was tied deeply with Plato's ontological projects. This remark on Plato is not of merely historical interest. For example, the view that numbers are Platonic objects was revived by [[Kurt Gödel]] as a result of certain puzzles that he took to arise from the phenomenological accounts.&lt;ref&gt;'Godel's Rationalism', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/#GodRat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]], founder of the analytic tradition in philosophy, famously argued for the analysis of language in terms of sense and reference. For him, the sense of an expression in language describes a certain state of affairs in the world, namely, the way that some object is presented. Since many commentators view the notion of sense as identical to the notion of concept, and Frege regards senses as the linguistic representations of states of affairs in the world, it seems to follow that we may understand concepts as the manner in which we grasp the world. Accordingly, concepts (as senses) have an ontological status (Morgolis:7).

According to [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]], in the introduction to his ''The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development'', concepts in calculus do not refer to perceptions. As long as the concepts are useful and mutually compatible, they are accepted on their own. For example, the concepts of the [[derivative]] and the [[integral]] are not considered to refer to spatial or temporal perceptions of the external world of experience. Neither are they related in any way to mysterious [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] in which quantities are on the verge of nascence or evanescence, that is, coming into or going out of existence. The abstract concepts are now considered to be totally autonomous, even though they originated from the process of abstracting or taking away qualities from perceptions until only the common, essential attributes remained.

== Mental representations ==
{{Main article|Mental representation}}

In a [[physicalism|physicalist]] [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]], a concept is a mental representation, which the brain uses to denote a class of things in the world. This is to say that it is literally, a symbol or group of symbols together made from the physical material of the brain.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carey|first=Susan|title=The Origin of Concepts|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536763-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Big Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Gregory|title=The Big Book of Concepts|year=2002|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-13409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts are mental representations that allow us to draw appropriate inferences about the type of entities we encounter in our everyday lives.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Concepts do not encompass all mental representations, but are merely a subset of them.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; The use of concepts is necessary to cognitive processes such as [[categorization]], [[memory]], [[decision making]], [[learning]], and [[inference]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Concepts are thought to be stored in long term [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] memory,&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[episodic memory]] of the particular objects and events which they abstract, which are stored in [[hippocampus]].  Evidence for this separation comes from hippocampal damaged patients such as [[patient HM]].  The abstraction from the day's hippocampal events and objects into cortical concepts is often considered to be the computation underlying (some stages of) sleep and dreaming. Many people (beginning with Aristotle) report memories of dreams which appear to mix the day's events with analogous or related historical concepts and memories, and suggest that they were being sorted or organised into more abstract concepts.  ("Sort" is itself another word for concept, and "sorting" thus means to organise into concepts.)

== Notable theories on the structure of concepts ==

=== Classical theory ===
{{Main article|Definitionism}}

The classical theory of concepts, also referred to as the empiricist theory of concepts,&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; is the oldest theory about the structure of concepts (it can be traced back to Aristotle&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;), and was prominently held until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; The classical theory of concepts says that concepts have a definitional structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Adequate definitions of the kind required by this theory usually take the form of a list of features. These features must have two important qualities to provide a comprehensive definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Features entailed by the definition of a concept must be both ''[[necessity and sufficiency|necessary]]'' and ''[[necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]]'' for membership in the class of things covered by a particular concept.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; A feature is considered necessary if every member of the denoted class has that feature. A feature is considered sufficient if something has all the parts required by the definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; For example, the classic example ''[[bachelor]]'' is said to be defined by ''unmarried'' and ''[[man]]''.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; An entity is a bachelor (by this definition) if and only if it is both unmarried and a man. To check whether something is a member of the class, you compare its qualities to the features in the definition.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Another key part of this theory is that it obeys the ''[[law of the excluded middle]]'', which means that there are no partial members of a class, you are either in or out.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

The classical theory persisted for so long unquestioned because it seemed intuitively correct and has great explanatory power. It can explain how concepts would be acquired, how we use them to categorize and how we use the structure of a concept to determine its referent class.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; In fact, for many years it was one of the major activities in [[philosophy]] – [[formal concept analysis|concept analysis]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concept analysis is the act of trying to articulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership in the referent class of a concept.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  For example, Shoemaker's classic "[[Time Without Change]]" explored whether the concept of the flow of time can include flows where no changes take place, though change is usually taken as a definition of time.

==== Arguments against the classical theory ====
Given that most later theories of concepts were born out of the rejection of some or all of the classical theory,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; it seems appropriate to give an account of what might be wrong with this theory. In the 20th century, philosophers such as Wittgenstein and Rosch argued against the classical theory. There are six primary arguments&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; summarized as follows:
*It seems that there simply are no definitions – especially those based in sensory primitive concepts.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*It seems as though there can be cases where our ignorance or error about a class means that we either don't know the definition of a concept, or have incorrect notions about what a definition of a particular concept might entail.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
* [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s argument against analyticity in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]] also holds as an argument against definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*Some concepts have fuzzy membership. There are items for which it is vague whether or not they fall into (or out of) a particular referent class. This is not possible in the classical theory as everything has equal and full membership.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*[[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]] found typicality effects which cannot be explained by the classical theory of concepts, these sparked the prototype theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; See below.
*Psychological experiments show no evidence for our using concepts as strict definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

=== Prototype theory ===
{{Main article|Prototype theory}}

Prototype theory came out of problems with the classical view of conceptual structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Prototype theory says that concepts specify properties that members of a class tend to possess, rather than must possess.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]], Mervis, [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]], Anglin, and [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Posner]] are a few of the key proponents and creators of this theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Roger|title=A New Paradigm of Reference|year=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc|isbn=0-12-497750-2|pages=159–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein describes the relationship between members of a class as ''family resemblances''. There are not necessarily any necessary conditions for membership, a dog can still be a dog with only three legs.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This view is particularly supported by psychological experimental evidence for prototypicality effects.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Participants willingly and consistently rate objects in categories like 'vegetable' or 'furniture' as more or less typical of that class.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm" /&gt; It seems that our categories are fuzzy psychologically, and so this structure has explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; We can judge an item's membership to the referent class of a concept by comparing it to the typical member – the most central member of the concept. If it is similar enough in the relevant ways, it will be cognitively admitted as a member of the relevant class of entities.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Rosch suggests that every category is represented by a central exemplar which embodies all or the maximum possible number of features of a given category.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; According to Lech, Gunturkun, and Suchan explain that categorization involves many areas of the brain, some of these are; visual association areas, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and temporal lobe.

=== Theory-theory ===
Theory-theory is a reaction to the previous two theories and develops them further.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This theory postulates that categorization by concepts is something like scientific theorizing.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concepts are not learned in isolation, but rather are learned as a part of our experiences with the world around us.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; In this sense, concepts' structure relies on their relationships to other concepts as mandated by a particular mental theory about the state of the world.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; How this is supposed to work is a little less clear than in the previous two theories, but is still a prominent and notable theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; This is supposed to explain some of the issues of ignorance and error that come up in prototype and classical theories as concepts that are structured around each other seem to account for errors such as whale as a fish (this misconception came from an incorrect theory about what a whale is like, combining with our theory of what a fish is).&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; When we learn that a whale is not a fish, we are recognizing that whales don't in fact fit the theory we had about what makes something a fish. In this sense, the Theory–Theory of concepts is responding to some of the issues of prototype theory and classic theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

== Ideasthesia ==
According to the theory of [[ideasthesia]] (or "sensing concepts"), activation of a concept may be the main mechanism responsible for creation of phenomenal experiences. Therefore, understanding how the brain processes concepts may be central to solving the mystery of how conscious experiences (or [[qualia]]) emerge within a physical system e.g., the sourness of the sour taste of lemon.&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, A., Nikolić D. (2014) Semantic mechanisms may be responsible for developing synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'' 8:509. {{doi|10.3389/fnhum.2014.00509}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question is also known as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevan Harnad (1995). Why and How We Are Not Zombies. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 1: 164–167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Chalmers (1995). Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 2 (3): 200–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on ideasthesia emerged from research on [[synesthesia]] where it was noted that a synesthetic experience requires first an activation of a concept of the inducer.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2009) Is synaesthesia actually ideaesthesia? An inquiry into the nature of the phenomenon. Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Synaesthesia, Science &amp; Art, Granada, Spain, April 26–29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Later research expanded these results into everyday perception.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.'' 20(1–2): pp. 84–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lot of discussion on the most effective theory in concepts. Another theory is semantic pointers, which use perceptual and motor representations and these representations are like symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Blouw, P., Solodkin, E., Thagard, P., &amp; Eliasmith, C. (2016). Concepts as semantic pointers: A framework and computational model. Cognitive Science, 40(5), 1128–1162. {{doi|10.1111/cogs.12265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "concept" is traced back to 1554–60 (Latin ''[[Wikt:conceptus|conceptum]]'' – "something conceived").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706200201/http://bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }} The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''concept map''' or '''conceptual diagram''' is a [[diagram]] that depicts suggested relationships between [[concept]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Hager, Nancy C. Corbin. ''Designing &amp; Delivering: Scientific, Technical, and Managerial Presentations,'' 1997, . 163.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a graphical tool that [[instructional designer]]s, [[engineer]]s, [[Technical communication|technical writers]], and others use to organize and structure [[knowledge]].

A concept map typically represents ideas and information as boxes or circles, which it connects with labeled arrows in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. The relationship between concepts can be articulated in '''linking phrases''' such as ''causes'', ''requires'', or ''contributes to''.&lt;ref name=theory&gt;[[Joseph D. Novak]] &amp; Alberto J. Cañas (2006). [http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryCmaps/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.htm "The Theory Underlying Concept Maps and How To Construct and Use Them"], [[Institute for Human and Machine Cognition]]. Accessed 24 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique for [[Visualization (graphic)|visualizing]] these relationships among different concepts is called ''concept mapping''. Concept maps have been used to define the [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] of computer systems, for example with the [[object-role modeling]] or [[Unified Modeling Language]] formalism.

== Overview ==
A concept map is a way of representing relationships between [[idea]]s, [[image]]s, or [[word]]s in the same way that a [[sentence diagram]] represents the grammar of a sentence, a road map represents the locations of highways and towns, and a [[circuit diagram]] represents the workings of an electrical appliance. In a concept map, each word or phrase connects to another, and links back to the original idea, word, or phrase. Concept maps are a way to develop logical thinking and study skills by revealing connections and helping students see how individual ideas form a larger whole. An example of the use of concept maps is provided in the context of learning about types of fuel.{{clarify|why is this noteworthy?|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref name="CMP"&gt;[http://www.energyeducation.tx.gov/pdf/223_inv.pdf CONCEPT MAPPING FUELS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721062626/http://www.energyeducation.tx.gov/pdf/223_inv.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}. Accessed 24 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept maps were developed{{according to whom|date=November 2016}} to enhance meaningful learning in the sciences{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. A well-made concept map grows within a ''context frame'' defined by an explicit "focus question", while a [[mind map]] often has only branches radiating out from a central picture. Some research evidence suggests that the brain stores knowledge as productions (situation-response conditionals) that act on [[declarative memory]] content, which is also referred to as chunks or propositions.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R., &amp; Lebiere, C. (1998). The atomic components of thought. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R., Byrne, M. D., Douglass, S., Lebiere, C., &amp; Qin, Y. (2004). An Integrated Theory of the Mind. Psychological Review, 111(4), 1036&amp;ndash;1050.&lt;/ref&gt; Because concept maps are constructed to reflect organization of the declarative memory system, they facilitate sense-making and meaningful learning on the part of individuals who make concept maps and those who use them.

== Differences from other visualizations ==

* ''Topic maps'': Concept maps are rather similar to [[topic map]]s in that both allow to concepts or topics via [[graph (data structure)|graphs]]. Among the various schema and techniques for visualizing ideas, processes, and organizations, concept mapping, as developed by [[Joseph D. Novak|Joseph Novak]] is unique in its philosophical basis, which "makes concepts, and propositions composed of concepts, the central elements in the structure of knowledge and construction of meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Novak, J.D. &amp; Gowin, D.B. (1996). Learning How To Learn, Cambridge University Press: New York, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Mind maps'': Both concept maps and topic maps can be contrasted with [[mind mapping]], which is often restricted to radial hierarchies and [[tree structure]]s. Another contrast between concept mapping and mind mapping is the speed and spontaneity when a mind map is created. A mind map reflects what you think about a single topic, which can focus group brainstorming. A concept map can be a map, a system view, of a real (abstract) system or set of concepts. Concept maps are more free form, as multiple hubs and clusters can be created, unlike mind maps, which typically emerge from a single center.

== History ==
Concept mapping was developed by [[Joseph D. Novak]] and his research team at [[Cornell University]] in the 1970s as a means of representing the emerging science knowledge of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihmc.us/users/user.php?UserID=jnovak|title=Joseph D. Novak|publisher=Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC)|accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently been used as a tool to increase meaningful learning in the sciences and other subjects as well as to represent the expert knowledge of individuals and teams in education, government and business. Concept maps have their origin  in the learning movement called [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]. In particular, constructivists hold that learners actively construct knowledge.

Novak's work is based on the cognitive theories of [[David Ausubel]], who stressed the importance of prior knowledge in being able to learn (or ''assimilate'') new concepts: "The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach accordingly."&lt;ref&gt;Ausubel, D. (1968) Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View. Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Novak taught students as young as six years old to make concept maps to represent their response to focus questions such as "What is water?" "What causes the seasons?" In his book ''Learning How to Learn'', Novak states that a "meaningful learning involves the assimilation of new concepts and propositions into existing cognitive structures."

Various attempts have been made to conceptualize the process of creating concept maps. Ray McAleese, in a series of articles, has suggested that mapping is a process of ''off-loading''. In this 1998 paper, McAleese draws on the work of Sowa&lt;ref&gt;Sowa, J.F., 1983. ''Conceptual structures: information processing in mind and machine'', Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; and a paper by Sweller &amp; Chandler.&lt;ref&gt;Sweller, J. &amp; Chandler, P., 1991. Evidence for Cognitive Load Theory. ''Cognition and Instruction'', 8(4), p.351-362.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, McAleese suggests that the process of making knowledge explicit, using ''nodes'' and ''relationships'', allows the individual to become aware of what they know and as a result to be able to modify what they know.&lt;ref&gt;McAleese, R. (1998) The Knowledge Arena as an Extension to the Concept Map: Reflection in Action, ''Interactive Learning Environments'', 6(3), p.251–272.&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Birbili applies that same idea to helping young children learn to think about what they know.&lt;ref&gt;Birbili, M. (2006) [http://ecrp.uiuc.edu/v8n2/birbili.html "Mapping Knowledge: Concept Maps in Early Childhood Education"], ''Early Childhood Research &amp; Practice'', ''8(2)'', Fall 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the ''knowledge arena'' is suggestive of a virtual space where learners may explore what they know and what they do not know.

==Use==
[[Image:Conceptmap.png|thumb|450px|Example concept map created using the IHMC CmapTools computer program.]]
Concept maps are used to stimulate the generation of ideas, and are believed to aid [[creativity]].&lt;ref name="theory"/&gt; Concept mapping is also sometimes used for [[brain-storming]]. Although they are often personalized and idiosyncratic, concept maps can be used to communicate complex ideas.

Formalized concept maps are used in [[software design]], where a common usage is [[Unified Modeling Language]] diagramming amongst similar conventions and development methodologies.

Concept mapping can also be seen as a first step in [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]]-building, and can also be used flexibly to represent formal argument &amp;mdash; similar to [[argument map]]s.

Concept maps are widely used in education and business. Uses include:
*[[Note taking]] and summarizing gleaning key concepts, their relationships and hierarchy from documents and source materials
*New knowledge creation: e.g., transforming [[tacit knowledge]] into an organizational resource, mapping team knowledge
*Institutional knowledge preservation (retention), e.g., eliciting and mapping expert knowledge of employees prior to retirement
*Collaborative knowledge modeling and the transfer of expert knowledge
*Facilitating the creation of shared vision and shared understanding within a team or organization
*Instructional design: concept maps used as [[David Ausubel|Ausubelian]] "advance organizers" that provide an initial conceptual frame for subsequent information and learning.
*Training: concept maps used as [[David Ausubel|Ausubelian]] "advanced organizers" to represent the training context and its relationship to their jobs, to the organization's strategic objectives, to training goals.
*Communicating complex ideas and arguments
*Examining the symmetry of complex ideas and arguments and associated terminology
*Detailing the entire structure of an idea, [[train of thought]], or line of argument (with the specific goal of exposing faults, errors, or gaps in one's own reasoning) for the scrutiny of others.
*Enhancing [[metacognition]] (learning to learn, and thinking about knowledge)
*Improving language ability
*Assessing learner understanding of learning objectives, concepts, and the relationship among those concepts
*Lexicon development

'''Conceptual art''', sometimes simply called '''conceptualism''', is [[art]] in which the [[concept]](s) or [[idea]](s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], technical, and material concerns. Some works of conceptual art, sometimes called [[Installation art|installations]], may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franklinfurnace.org/history/flow/lewitt/lewitt.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302213039/http://www.franklinfurnace.org/history/flow/lewitt/lewitt.html|title=Wall Drawing 811 – Sol LeWitt|archivedate=2 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was fundamental to American artist [[Sol LeWitt]]'s definition of Conceptual art, one of the first to appear in print:

{{quotation|In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work. When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sol LeWitt]] "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art", ''Artforum'', June 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tony Godfrey, author of ''Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas)'' (1998), asserts that conceptual art questions the nature of art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas) |author=Godrey, Tony |year=1988 |isbn= 978-0-7148-3388-0 |publisher=London: Phaidon Press Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notion that [[Joseph Kosuth]] elevated to a definition of art itself in his seminal, early manifesto of conceptual art, ''Art after Philosophy'' (1969). The notion that art should examine its own nature was already a potent aspect of the influential art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]'s vision of Modern art during the 1950s. With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists such as [[Art &amp; Language]], [[Joseph Kosuth]] (who became the american editor of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]), and [[Lawrence Weiner]] began a far more radical interrogation of art than was previously possible (see [[Conceptual art#Language and/as art|below]]). One of the first and most important things they questioned was the common assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of [[physical art|material objects]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kosuth, ''Art After Philosophy'' (1969). Reprinted in Peter Osborne, ''Conceptual Art: Themes and Movements'', Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art &amp; Language, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]]: Introduction (1969). Reprinted in Osborne (2002) p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Burn, Mel Ramsden: "Notes On Analysis" (1970). Reprinted in Osborne (2003), p. 237. E.g. "The outcome of much of the 'conceptual' work of the past two years has been to carefully clear the air of objects."&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, in popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], "conceptual art" came to denote all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name=tateconceptual&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041211013930/http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turnerprize/history/issue_conceptual.htm ''Turner prize history: Conceptual art'' Tate gallery] tate.org.uk. Accessed August 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It could be said that one of the reasons why the term "conceptual art" has come to be associated with various contemporary practices far removed from its original aims and forms lies in the problem of defining the term itself. As the artist [[Mel Bochner]] suggested as early as 1970, in explaining why he does not like the epithet "conceptual", it is not always entirely clear what "concept" refers to, and it runs the risk of being confused with "intention". Thus, in describing or defining a [[work of art]] as conceptual it is important not to confuse what is referred to as "conceptual" with an artist's "intention".

==History==
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|[[Marcel Duchamp]], ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]],'' 1917. Photograph by [[Alfred Stieglitz]]]]
[[File:Art-LanguageV3No1-1974.jpg|thumb|[[Art &amp; Language]], ''[[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]'' Vol.3 Nr.1, 1974]]
The French artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works — the [[readymade]]s, for instance. The most famous of Duchamp's readymades was ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917), a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym "R.Mutt", and submitted for inclusion in the annual, un-juried exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York (which rejected it).&lt;ref&gt;
Tony Godfrey, Conceptual Art, London: 1998. p. 28
&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object (such as a urinal) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art, nor is it unique or hand-crafted. Duchamp's relevance and theoretical importance for future "conceptualists" was later acknowledged by US artist [[Joseph Kosuth]] in his 1969 essay, ''Art after Philosophy'', when he wrote: "All art (after Duchamp) is conceptual (in nature) because art only exists conceptually".

In 1956 the founder of [[Lettrism]], [[Isidore Isou]], developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. This concept, also called ''Art esthapériste'' (or "infinite-aesthetics"), derived from the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] – quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually. The current incarnation ({{as of | 2013}}) of the Isouian movement, Excoördism, self-defines as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

In 1961 the term "concept art", coined by the artist [[Henry Flynt]] in his article bearing the term as its title, appeared in a proto-[[Fluxus]] publication ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henryflynt.org/aesthetics/conart.html|title=Essay: Concept Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, it assumed a different meaning when employed by [[Joseph Kosuth]] and by the English [[Art and Language]] group, who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry, that began in [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] in 1969, into the artist's social , philosophical and psychological status. By the mid-1970s they had produced publications, indices, performances, texts and paintings to this end. In 1970 ''Conceptual Art and Conceptual Aspects'', the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition, took place at the [[New York Cultural Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html Artlex.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516162830/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html |date=2013-05-16 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==The critique of formalism and of the commodification of art==
Conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s – in part as a reaction against [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] as then articulated by the influential [[New York City|New York]] [[art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]]. According to Greenberg [[Modern art]] followed a process of progressive reduction and refinement toward the goal of defining the essential, [[formalism (art)|formal]] nature of each medium. Those elements that ran counter to this nature were to be reduced. The task of painting, for example, was to define precisely what kind of object a painting truly is: what makes it a painting and nothing else. As it is of the nature of paintings to be flat objects with canvas surfaces onto which colored pigment is applied, such things as [[figurative art|figuration]], 3-D [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] illusion and references to external subject matter were all found to be extraneous to the essence of painting, and ought to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that conceptual art continued this "dematerialization" of art by removing the need for objects altogether,&lt;ref&gt;
Lucy Lippard &amp; John Chandler, "The Dematerialization of Art", ''Art International'' 12:2, February 1968. Reprinted in Osborne (2002), p. 218
&lt;/ref&gt;
while others, including many of the artists themselves, saw conceptual art as a radical break with Greenberg's kind of formalist Modernism. Later artists continued to share a preference for art to be self-critical, as well as a distaste for illusion. However, by the end of the 1960s it was certainly clear that Greenberg's stipulations for art to continue within the confines of each medium and to exclude external subject matter no longer held traction.&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
Conceptual art also reacted against the [[commodification]] of art; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art, and the art market as the owner and distributor of art. [[Lawrence Weiner]] said: "Once you know about a work of mine you own it. There's no way I can climb inside somebody's head and remove it." Many conceptual artists' work can therefore only be known about through documentation which is manifested by it, e.g. photographs, written texts or displayed objects, which some might argue are not in themselves the art. It is sometimes (as in the work of [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], [[Yoko Ono]], and Weiner himself) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work, but stopping short of actually making it—emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact. This reveals an explicit preference for the "art" side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and [[craft]], where art, unlike craft, takes place within and engages historical discourse: for example, Ono's "written instructions" make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time.

==Language and/as art==
Language was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s. Although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel, only in the 1960s did the artists [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Edward Ruscha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |title=Ed Ruscha and Photography |author= |date=March 1 – June 1, 2008 |work= |publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago |accessdate=14 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531181852/http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |archive-date=31 May 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], and [[Art &amp; Language]] begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means. Where previously language was presented as one kind of visual element alongside others, and subordinate to an overarching [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] (e.g. [[Synthetic Cubism]]), the conceptual artists used language in place of brush and canvas, and allowed it to signify in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rorimer, ''New Art in the Sixties and Seventies'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001; p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Of Lawrence Weiner's works Anne Rorimer writes, "The thematic content of individual works derives solely from the import of the language employed, while presentational means and contextual placement play crucial, yet separate, roles."&lt;ref name="Rorimer, p. 76"&gt;Rorimer, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]] suggests that among the many factors that influenced the gravitation toward language-based art, a central role for conceptualism came from the turn to linguistic theories of meaning in both Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy]], and [[structuralism|structuralist]] and [[post-structuralism|post structuralist]] [[Continental philosophy]] during the middle of the twentieth century. This [[linguistic turn]] "reinforced and legitimized" the direction the conceptual artists took.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, Conceptual Art: Themes and movements, Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne also notes that the early conceptualists were the first generation of artists to complete degree-based university training in art.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne (2002), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne later made the observation that contemporary art is ''post-conceptual''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in [[Como]] on July 9, 2010. It is a claim made at the level of the [[ontology]] of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement).

The American art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] points to the example of [[Roy Ascott]] who "powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology, exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories." Ascott, the British artist most closely associated with [[cybernetic art]] in England, was not included in Cybernetic Serendipity because his use of [[cybernetic]]s was primarily conceptual and did not explicitly utilize technology. Conversely, although his essay on the application of cybernetics to art and art pedagogy, "The Construction of Change" (1964), was quoted on the dedication page (to Sol Lewitt) of [[Lucy R. Lippard]]'s seminal ''Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972'', Ascott's anticipation of and contribution to the formation of conceptual art in Britain has received scant recognition, perhaps (and ironically) because his work was too closely allied with art-and-technology. Another vital intersection was explored in Ascott's use of the thesaurus in 1963 [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_shanken.html], which drew an explicit parallel between the taxonomic qualities of verbal and visual languages – a concept would be taken up in Joseph Kosuth's ''Second Investigation, Proposition 1'' (1968) and Mel Ramsden's ''Elements of an Incomplete Map'' (1968).

==Conceptual art and artistic skill==
[[Image:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|300px|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]]. 1973]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"By adopting language as their exclusive medium, Weiner, Barry, Wilson, Kosuth and Art &amp; Language were able to sweep aside the vestiges of authorial presence manifested by formal invention and the handling of materials."&lt;ref name="Rorimer, p. 76"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An important difference between conceptual art and more "traditional" forms of art-making goes to the question of artistic skill. Although skill in the handling of traditional media often plays little role in conceptual art, it is difficult to argue that no skill is required to make conceptual works, or that skill is always absent from them. [[John Baldessari]], for instance, has presented realist pictures that he commissioned professional sign-writers to paint; and many conceptual performance artists (e.g. [[Stelarc]], [[Marina Abramović]]) are technically accomplished performers and skilled manipulators of their own bodies. It is thus not so much an absence of skill or hostility toward tradition that defines conceptual art as an evident disregard for conventional, modern notions of authorial presence and of individual artistic expression.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Contemporary influence==
The first wave of the "conceptual art" movement extended from approximately 1967 to 1978. Early "concept" artists like [[Henry Flynt]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], and [[Ray Johnson]] influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual art. Conceptual artists like [[Dan Graham]], [[Hans Haacke]], and [[Lawrence Weiner]] have proven very influential on subsequent artists, and well known contemporary artists such as [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]] or [[Tracey Emin]] are sometimes labeled "second- or third-generation" conceptualists, or "[[post-conceptual]]" artists.

Many of the concerns of the conceptual art movement have been taken up by contemporary artists. While they may or may not term themselves "conceptual artists", ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with [[installation art]], [[performance art]], [[net.art]] and [[electronic art|electronic]]/[[digital art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptual Art – The Art Story|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-conceptual-art.htm|website=theartstory.org|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1917 : ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], described in an article in ''[[The Independent]]'' as the invention of conceptual art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hensher |first=Philip |title=The loo that shook the world: Duchamp, Man Ray, Picabi |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-and-architecture/features/the-loo-that-shook-the-world-duchamp-man-ray-picabi-784384.html |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' (''Extra'') |date=2008-02-20 |pages=2–5 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1953 : [[Robert Rauschenberg]] creates ''[[Erased De Kooning Drawing]]'', a drawing by [[Willem de Kooning]] which Rauschenberg erased. It raised many questions about the fundamental nature of art, challenging the viewer to consider whether erasing another artist's work could be a creative act, as well as whether the work was only "art" because the famous Rauschenberg had done it.
* 1955 : Rhea Sue Sanders creates her first text pieces of the series ''pièces de complices'', combining visual art with poetry and philosophy, and introducing the concept of complicity: the viewer must accomplish the art in her/his imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Bénédicte Demelas: Des mythes et des réalitées de l'avant-garde française. Presses universitaires de Rennes, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1956 : [[Isidore Isou]] introduces the concept of infinitesimal art in ''Introduction à une esthétique imaginaire'' (''Introduction to Imaginary Aesthetics'').
* 1957: [[Yves Klein]], ''Aerostatic Sculpture (Paris)''. This was composed of 1001 blue balloons released into the sky from [[Galerie Iris Clert]] to promote his ''Proposition Monochrome; Blue Epoch'' exhibition. Klein also exhibited 'One Minute Fire Painting' which was a blue panel into which 16 firecrackers were set. For his next major exhibition, ''The Void'' in 1958, Klein declared that his paintings were now invisible and to prove it he exhibited an empty room.
* 1958: [[Wolf Vostell]] ''Das Theater ist auf der Straße''/''The theater is on the street''. The first [[Happening]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-morsbroich.de/index.php?id=vorschau&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_mbausstellungen_pi1%5Bexhibition%5D=40&amp;ftu=17c0865f7589ebcedf2cba1501860715|title=Vorschau – Museum Morsbroich|author=ChewingTheSun|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1960: [[Yves Klein]]'s action called ''A Leap Into The Void'', in which he attempts to fly by leaping out of a window. He stated: "The painter has only to create one masterpiece, himself, constantly."
* 1960: The artist Stanley Brouwn declares that all the shoe shops in Amsterdam constitute an exhibition of his work.
* 1961: [[Wolf Vostell]] ''Cityrama'', in Cologne was the first Happening in Germany.
* 1961: [[Robert Rauschenberg]] sent a telegram to the [[Galerie Iris Clert]] which said: 'This is a portrait of [[Iris Clert]] if I say so.' as his contribution to an exhibition of portraits.
* 1961: [[Piero Manzoni]] exhibited ''[[Artist's Shit]]'', tins purportedly containing his own [[feces]] (although since the work would be destroyed if opened, no one has been able to say for sure). He put the tins on sale for their own weight in gold. He also sold his own breath (enclosed in balloons) as ''[[Corpo d'aria|Bodies of Air]]'', and signed people's bodies, thus declaring them to be living works of art either for all time or for specified periods. (This depended on how much they are prepared to pay). [[Marcel Broodthaers]] and [[Primo Levi]] are amongst the designated 'artworks'.
* 1962: Artist Barrie Bates rebrands himself as [[Billy Apple]], erasing his original identity to continue his exploration of everyday life and commerce as art. By this stage, many of his works are fabricated by third parties.&lt;ref name="Byrt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrt|first=Anthony|title=Brand, new|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/brand-new/|work=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1962: [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]]'s ''Iron Curtain'' work. This consists of a barricade of oil barrels in a narrow Paris street which caused a large traffic jam. The artwork was not the barricade itself but the resulting traffic jam.
* 1962: [[Yves Klein]] presents ''[[Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle|Immaterial Pictorial Sensitivity]]'' in various ceremonies on the banks of the Seine. He offers to sell his own 'pictorial sensitivity' (whatever that was, he did not define it) in exchange for gold leaf. In these ceremonies the purchaser gave Klein the gold leaf in return for a certificate. Since Klein's sensitivity was immaterial, the purchaser was then required to burn the certificate whilst Klein threw half the gold leaf into the Seine. (There were seven purchasers.)
* 1962: [[Piero Manzoni]] created ''The Base of the World'', thereby exhibiting the entire planet as his artwork.
* 1962: FLUXUS Internationale Festspiele Neuester Musik in [[Wiesbaden]] with, [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Nam June Paik]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus at 50''. Stefan Fricke, Alexander Klar, Sarah Maske, Kerber Verlag, 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-86678-700-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1963: [[George Brecht]]'s collection of Event-Scores, ''[[Water Yam (artist's multiple)|Water Yam]]'', is published as the first ''Fluxkit'' by [[George Maciunas]]. 
* 1963: Festum Fluxorum Fluxus in [[Düsseldorf]] with [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Ben Patterson]], [[Emmett Williams]] and others.
* 1963: [[Henry Flynt]]s article ''Concept Art'' is published in ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''; a collection of artworks and concepts by artists and musicians that was published by [[Jackson Mac Low]] and [[La Monte Young]] (ed.). ''An Anthology of Chance Operations'' documented the development of [[Dick Higgins]] vision of [[intermedia]] art in the context of the ideas of [[John Cage]] and became an early [[Fluxus]] masterpiece. Flynt's "concept art" devolved from his idea of "cognitive nihilism" and from his insights about the vulnerabilities of logic and mathematics.
* 1964: [[Yoko Ono]] publishes ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit: A Book of Instructions and Drawings]]''. An example of Heuristic art, or a series of instructions for how to obtain an aesthetic experience.
* 1965: [[Art &amp; Language]] founder Michael Baldwin ''Mirror Piece''. Instead of paintings, the work is showing a variable number of mirrors that challenge both the visitor and [[Clement Greenberg]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tate|title=Art &amp; Language – Conceptual Art, Mirrors and Selfies {{!}} TateShots|date=2016-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-klDfurJM5Y|accessdate=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1965: A complex conceptual art piece by [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] called ''Still and Chew''. He invites art students to protest against the values of [[Clement Greenberg]]'s ''Art and Culture'', much praised and taught at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in London, where Latham taught part-time. Pages of Greenberg's book (borrowed from the college library) are chewed by the students, dissolved in acid and the resulting solution returned to the library bottled and labelled. Latham was then fired from his part-time position.
* 1965: with ''Show V, immaterial sculpture'' the Dutch artist [[Marinus Boezem]] introduced Conceptual Art in the Netherlands. In the show various air doors are placed where people can walk through them. People have the sensory experience of warmth, air. Three invisible air doors, which arise as currents of cold and warm are blown into the room, are indicated in the space with bundles of arrows and lines. The articulation of the space which arises is the result of invisible processes which influence the conduct of persons in that space, and who are included in the system as co-performers.
* [[Joseph Kosuth]] dates the concept of ''[[One and Three Chairs]]'' in the year 1965. The presentation of the work consists of a chair, its photo and a blow up of a definition of the word "chair". Kosuth has chosen the definition from a dictionary. Four versions with different definitions are known.
* 1966: Conceived in 1966 ''The Air Conditioning Show'' of [[Art &amp; Language]] is published as an article in 1967 in the November issue of ''Arts Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/air-conditioning-show-air-show-frameworks-1966-67-al0481|title=Air-Conditioning Show / Air Show / Frameworks 1966–67|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1966: [[N.E. Thing Co.]] Ltd. (Iain and Ingrid Baxter of Vancouver) exhibited ''Bagged Place'' the contents of a four-room apartment wrapped in plastic bags. The same year they registered as a corporation and subsequently organized their practice along corporate models, one of the first international examples of the "aesthetic of administration".
* 1967: [[Mel Ramsden]] first ''100% Abstract Paintings''. The painting shows a list of chemical components that constitute the substance of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/exhibition-art-language-uncompleted/1/exhibitions/expo|title=ART &amp; LANGUAGE UNCOMPLETED|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1967: [[Sol LeWitt]]'s ''Paragraphs on Conceptual Art'' were published by the American art journal ''[[Artforum]]''. The ''Paragraphs'' mark the progression from Minimal to Conceptual Art.
* 1968: Michael Baldwin, [[Terry Atkinson]], [[David Bainbridge]] and [[Harold Hurrell]] found [[Art &amp; Language]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/culture/stories/2003/04/art-and-language.shtml|title=BBC – Coventry and Warwickshire Culture – Art and Language|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1968: [[Lawrence Weiner]] relinquishes the physical making of his work and formulates his "Declaration of Intent", one of the most important conceptual art statements following LeWitt's "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art." The declaration, which underscores his subsequent practice reads: "1. The artist may construct the piece. 2. The piece may be fabricated. 3. The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership."
* Friedrich Heubach launches the magazine ''Interfunktionen'' in Cologne, Germany, a publication that excelled in artists' projects. It originally showed a Fluxus influence, but later moved toward Conceptual art.
* 1969: The first generation of New York [[alternative exhibition space]]s are established, including [[Billy Apple]]'s APPLE, Robert Newman's Gain Ground, where [[Vito Acconci]] produced many important early works, and 112 Greene Street.&lt;ref name="Byrt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Terroni|first=Christelle|title=The Rise and Fall of Alternative Spaces|url=http://www.booksandideas.net/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Alternative.html|work=books&amp;ideas.net|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1969: [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]]'s ''Telepathic Piece'' at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, of which he said 'During the exhibition I will try to communicate telepathically a work of art, the nature of which is a series of thoughts that are not applicable to language or image'.
* 1969: The first issue of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] is published in May. It is subtitled as ''The Journal of conceptual art'' and edited by Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Michael Baldwin and Harold Hurrell. [[Art &amp; Language]] are the editors of this first number, and by the second number and until 1972, [[Joseph Kosuth]] will join and become the american editor.
* 1969: [[Vito Acconci]] creates ''Following Piece'', in which he follows randomly selected members of the public until they disappear into a private space. The piece is presented as photographs.
* The English journal ''Studio International'' published [[Joseph Kosuth]]´s article "Art after Philosophy" in three parts (October–December). It became the most discussed article on "Conceptual Art".
* 1970: [[Ian Burn]], [[Mel Ramsden]] and [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]] join [[Art &amp; Language]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;
* 1970: Painter [[John Baldessari]] exhibits a film in which he sets a series of erudite statements by Sol LeWitt on the subject of conceptual art to popular tunes like "Camptown Races" and "Some Enchanted Evening".
* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] exhibits a series of photographs which were taken every two minutes whilst driving along a road for 24 minutes.
* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] asks museum visitors to write down 'one authentic secret'. The resulting 1800 documents are compiled into a book which, by some accounts, makes for very repetitive reading as most secrets are similar.
* 1971: [[Hans Haacke]]'s ''Real Time Social System''. This piece of [[systems art]] detailed the real estate holdings of the third largest landowners in New York City. The properties were mostly in Harlem and the [[Lower East Side]], were decrepit and poorly maintained, and represented the largest concentration of real estate in those areas under the control of a single group. The captions gave various financial details about the buildings, including recent sales between companies owned or controlled by the same family. The Guggenheim museum cancelled the exhibition, stating that the overt political implications of the work constituted "an alien substance that had entered the art museum organism". There is no evidence to suggest that the trustees of the Guggenheim were linked financially to the family which was the subject of the work.
* 1972: [[Art &amp; Language|The Art &amp; Language Institute]] exhibits ''Index 01'' at the [[Documenta 5]], an installation indexing text-works by [[Art &amp; Language]] and text-works from [[Art &amp; Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]. 
* 1972: [[Antonio Caro]] exhibits in the National Art Salon (Museo Nacional, Bogotá, Colombia) his work: ''Aquinocabeelarte'' (Art does not fit here), where each of the letters is a separate poster, and under each letter is written the name of some victim of state repression.
* 1972: [[Fred Forest]] buys an area of blank space in the newspaper ''Le Monde'' and invites readers to fill it with their own works of art.
* [[General Idea]] launch ''File'' magazine in Toronto. The magazine functioned as something of an extended, collaborative artwork.
* 1973: [[Jacek Tylicki]] lays out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for the nature to create art.
* 1974: [[Cadillac Ranch]] near [[Amarillo]], Texas.
* 1975–76: Three issues of the journal ''The Fox'' were published by [[Art &amp; Language]] in New York by. The editor was [[Joseph Kosuth]]. ''The Fox'' became an important platform for the American members of [[Art &amp; Language]]. Karl Beveridge, Ian Burn, [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Michael Corris]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], Andrew Menard, Mel Ramsden and Terry Smith wrote articles which thematized the context of contemporary art. These articles exemplify the development of an institutional critique within the inner circle of Conceptual Art. The criticism of the art world integrates social, political and economic reasons.
* 1976: facing internal problems, members of [[Art &amp; Language]] separate. The destiny of the name [[Art &amp; Language]] remaining in Michael Baldwin, Mel Ramsden and Charles Harrison hands.
* 1977: [[Walter De Maria]]'s ''Vertical Earth Kilometer'' in [[Kassel]], Germany. This was a one kilometer brass rod which was sunk into the earth so that nothing remained visible except a few centimeters. Despite its size, therefore, this work exists mostly in the viewer's mind.
* 1977: [[John Fekner]] creates hundreds of environmental and conceptual outdoor works consisting of stenciled words, symbols, dates and icons spray painted in New York, Sweden, Canada, England and Germany.
* 1986: [[Art &amp; Language]] are nominated for the [[Turner Prize]].
* 1989: [[Christopher Williams (American artist)|Christopher Williams]]' ''Angola to Vietnam'' is first exhibited. The work consists of a series of black-and-white photographs of glass botanical specimens from the [[Botanical Museum]] at [[Harvard University]], chosen according to a list of the thirty-six countries in which political disappearances were known to have taken place during the year 1985.
* 1990: [[Ashley Bickerton]] and [[Ronald Jones (Interdisciplinarian)|Ronald Jones]] included in "Mind Over Matter: Concept and Object" exhibition of ”third generation Conceptual artists” at the Whitney Museum of American Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDA113CF93AA25753C1A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Brenson | title=Review/Art; In the Arena of the Mind, at the Whitney | date=19 October 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1993: [[Matthieu Laurette]] established his artistic birth certificate by taking part in a French TV game called ''Tournez manège'' (The Dating Game) where the female presenter asked him who he was, to which he replied: 'A multimedia artist'. Laurette had sent out invitations to an art audience to view the show on TV from their home, turning his staging of the artist into a performed reality.

'''Conceptual Design''' is an early phase of the design process, in which the broad outlines of function and form of something are articulated. It includes the design of interactions, experiences, processes and strategies. It involves an understanding of people's needs - and how to meet them with products, services, &amp; processes. Common artifacts of conceptual design are concept sketches and models.

A '''conceptual framework''' is an analytical tool with several variations and contexts. It can be applied in different categories of work where an overall picture is needed. It is used to make conceptual distinctions and organize ideas. Strong conceptual frameworks capture something real and do this in a way that is easy to remember and apply.

[[Isaiah Berlin]] used the metaphor of [[The Hedgehog and the Fox|a "fox" and a "hedgehog"]] to make conceptual distinctions in how important philosophers and authors view the world.&lt;ref name="Berlin1953"&gt;{{citation |last=Berlin |first=Isaiah |author-link=Isaiah Berlin |year=1953 |title=The Hedgehog and the Fox: An Essay on Tolstoy's View of History}} [[London]]: [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]]; 1986 [[New York City|New York]]: [[Simon and Schuster]], introduction by M. Walzer.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin describes hedgehogs as those who use a single idea or organizing principle to view the world (such as [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Plato]], [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]). Foxes, on the other hand, incorporate a type of pluralism and view the world through multiple, sometimes conflicting, lenses (examples include [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[James Joyce]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Aristotle]], [[Herodotus]], [[Molière]], and [[Honoré de Balzac]]).

Economists use the conceptual framework of "[[Supply (economics)|supply]]" and "[[Demand (economics)|demand]]" to distinguish between the behavior and incentive systems of firms and consumers.&lt;ref name="Colander2013"&gt;[[David Colander|Colander, David]]. 2013. ''Microeconomics,'' 9th edition, [[New York City|New York]]: [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw Hill]] and Frank, Robert and [[Ben Bernanke]]. 2013. ''Principles of Microeconomics,'' 5th edition. New York: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many conceptual frameworks, supply and demand can be presented through visual or graphical representations (see [[demand curve]]). Both [[political Science]] and [[economics]] use [[Principal-agent problem|principal agent theory]] as a conceptual framework. The [[politics-administration dichotomy]] is a long standing conceptual framework used in [[public administration]].&lt;ref name="Overeem2012"&gt;{{citation |last=Overeem |first=P. |year=2012 |title=The Politics Administration Dichotomy: Toward a Constitutional Perspective |edition=2 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-1-4665-5899-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three of these cases are examples of a macro level conceptual framework.

== Overview ==
The use of the term ''conceptual framework'' crosses both scale (large and small theories)&lt;ref name="RavitchRiggan2012"&gt;{{citation |author1=Ravitch |author2=Riggan |year=2012 |title=Reason and Rigor: How Conceptual Frameworks guide Research |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks CA]] |publisher=[[SAGE Publishing|Sage]] |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maxwell2009"&gt;{{citation |last=Maxwell |first=J. |year=2009 |chapter=Designing a qualitative study |title=The State Handbook of Applied Social Science Research |editor-last1=Bickmam |editor-first1=L. |editor-last2=Rog |editor-first2=D. |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[SAGE Publishing|Sage]] |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contexts (social science,&lt;ref name="Rodman1980"&gt;{{citation |last=Rodman |first=Hyman |title=Are Conceptual Frameworks Necessary for Theory Building? The Case of Family Sociology |journal=[[The Sociological Quarterly]] |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=429–441 |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moorstein"&gt;Moorstein, Mark. Frameworks, Conflict in Balance.&lt;/ref&gt; marketing,&lt;ref name="Jaworski_al.1993"&gt;{{citation |last1=Jaworski |first1=B |last2=Stathakopoulos |first2=V. |last3=Krishnan |first3=H. S. |year=1993 |title=Control Combinations in Marketing: Conceptual Framework and Empirical Evidence |work=[[Journal of Marketing]] |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=57–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied science,&lt;ref name="HobbsNorton2006"&gt;{{citation |last1=Hobbs |first1=R. |last2=Norton |first2=D. |year=2006 |title=Towards a Conceptual Framework for Restoration Ecology |work=Restoration Ecology |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=93–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; art&lt;ref name="Eco1978"&gt;{{citation |last=Eco |first=Umberto |author-link=Umberto Eco |year=1978 |title=A Theory of Semiotics |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |page=310 |isbn=978-0-2532-0217-8}} endnote #47&lt;/ref&gt; etc.). Its explicit definition and application can therefore vary.

Conceptual frameworks are particularly useful as organizing devices in empirical research. One set of scholars has applied the notion of conceptual framework to [[deductive]], empirical research at the micro- or individual study level.&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;{{citation |last1=Shields |first=Patricia M. |author-link=Patricia M. Shields |last2=Tajalli |first2=Hassan |title=Intermediate Theory: The Missing Link in Successful Student Scholarship |work=Journal of Public Affairs Education |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=313–334 |url=https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3967 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baum2003"&gt;{{citation |last=Baum |first=K. |year=2003 |chapter=Assessing Group Conflict: Understanding the Line-Staff Relationship in Fire Service |title=Handbook of Conflict Management |editor-first1=W. |editor-last1=Pammer |editor-first2=J. |editor-last2=Killian |location=New York |publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]] |pages=129–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shields |first1=Patricia |author1-link=Patricia M. Shields |last2=Rangarajan |first2=Nandhini |title=A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management |location=[[Stillwater, Oklahoma|Stillwater, OK]] |publisher=New Forums Press |isbn=1-58107-247-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVYbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Patricia+M.+Shields%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3iIU6X7HdOYyASjlIDwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shields1998"&gt;{{citation |last=Shields |first=Patricia |author-link=Patricia M.

Likewise, conceptual frameworks are abstract representations, connected to the research project's goal that direct the collection and analysis of data (on the plane of observation – the ground). Critically, a football play is a "plan of action" tied to a particular, timely, purpose, usually summarized as long or short yardage.&lt;ref name="Patricia2014"&gt;{{citation |last=Shields |first=Patricia |author-link=Patricia M. Shields |year=2014 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263861162_Tools_for_Writing_Excellent_Papers_2014_ASPA_Student_Summit |title=Tools for Excellent Papers: 2014 ASPA Student Summit |publisher=[[Texas State University]] |location=[[Washington D.C.]]}} Presentation at the [[American Society for Public Administration]] annual conference, Washington DC March 15, This powerpoint depicts the connection between football and conceptual frameworks in the context of a large graduate student paper. The national presentation was delivered before Public Administration graduate students in Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Shields and Rangarajan (2013) argue that it is this tie to "purpose" that make [[American football plays]] such a good metaphor. They define a conceptual framework as "the way ideas are organized to achieve a research project's purpose".&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt; Like football plays, conceptual frameworks are connected to a research purpose or aim. [[Explanation]]&lt;ref name="Babbie2007"&gt;{{citation |last=Babbie |first=Earl |year=2007 |title=The Practice of Social Research |edition=11th |location=[[Belmont, California|Belmont, CA]] |page=89 |publisher=[[Thompson Media Group|Thompson]], [[Cengage|Wadsworth]]}} Babbie also identifies exploration and description as purposes of empirical research&lt;/ref&gt; is the most common type of research purpose employed in empirical research. The formal [[hypothesis]] of a scientific investigation is the framework associated with [[explanation]]&lt;!-- this is not a complete sentence. --&gt;.&lt;ref name="Brains_al2011"&gt;{{citation |last1=Brains |first1=C. |last2=Willnat |first2=L. |last3=Manheim |first3=J. |last4=Rich |first4=R. |year=2011 |title=Empirical Political Analysis: Quantitative and Qualitative Research Methods |location=[[New York City|New York, NY]] |publisher=[[Longman]] |pages=75–77}} Brains et al 2011 also identify exploration, explanation and description as research purposes. Explanation is connected to hypotheses testing (as a framework). The other research purposes are not connected to a framework.&lt;/ref&gt;

Explanatory research usually focuses on "why" or "what caused" a phenomenon to occur. Formal hypotheses posit possible explanations (answers to the why question) that are tested by collecting data and assessing the evidence (usually quantitative using statistical tests). For example, Kai Huang wanted to determine what factors contributed to residential fires in U.S. cities. Three factors were posited to influence residential fires. These factors (environment, population and building characteristics) became the hypotheses or conceptual framework he used to achieve his purpose – explain factors that influenced home fires in [[United States|U.S.]] cities.&lt;ref name="Huang2009"&gt;{{citation |last=Huang |first=Kai |title=Population and Building Factors that impact residential fire rates in large U.S. Cities |publisher=Applied Research Projects, [[Texas State University]] |page=42 |url=https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3592 |year=2009}} The formal hypotheses took the form of relational statements. H1: environmental factors influence residential fire rates; H2: populations characteristics influence residential fire rates; H3: Building factors influence residential fire rates. These hypotheses could be represented visually as H1: A → RFR; H2: B → RFR; H3: C → RFR where A = environmental factors; B = population characteristics; C = Building Factors and RFR = Residential Fire Rates.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Several types of conceptual frameworks have been identified,&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shields1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShieldsTravis2017"&gt;{{citation |last1=Shields |first1=Patricia |author1-link=Patricia M. Shields |last2=Whetsell |first2=Travis |year=2017 |chapter=Public Administration Methodology: A Pragmatic Perspective |editor-last1=Raadshelders |editor-first1=Jos |editor-last2=Stillman |editor-first2=Richard |title=Foundations of Public Administration |pages=75–92 |publisher=Melvin and Leigh |isbn=978-0-9973-0842-6 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311511761_Public_Administration_Methodology_A_Pragmatic_Perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; and line up with a research purpose in the following ways:
* [[Working hypothesis]] – [[Exploration]] or [[Exploratory research]]
* Pillar Questions - [[Exploration]] or [[Exploratory research]]
* Descriptive categories – [[Description]] or [[Descriptive research]]
* Practical ideal type – [[Analysis]] (Gauging)
* Models of [[operations research]] – [[Decision making]]
* Formal hypothesis – [[Explanation]]  and [[Prediction]]

Note that Shields and Rangarajan (2013) do not claim that the above are the only framework-purpose pairing. Nor do they claim the system is applicable to [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] forms of empirical research. Rather, the conceptual framework-research purpose pairings they propose are useful and provide new scholars a point of departure to develop their own [[research design]].&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt;

Frameworks have also been used to explain [[conflict theory]] and the balance necessary to reach what amounts to resolution. Within these conflict frameworks, visible and invisible variables function under concepts of relevance. Boundaries form and within these boundaries, tensions regarding laws and chaos (or freedom) are mitigated. These frameworks often function like cells, with sub-frameworks, stasis, evolution and revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moorstein |first1=Mark |title=Frameworks, Conflict in Balance |publisher=[[iUniverse]] |isbn=978-0-5953-1824-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anomalistics|Anomalies]] may exist without adequate "lenses" or "filters" to see them and may become visible only when the tools exist to define them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn]]. (1996) ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''disquotational principle''' is a philosophical [[theorem]]{{Citation needed|reason=What/where is the proof?|date=January 2018}} which holds that a rational speaker will accept "''p''" if and only if he or she believes ''p''. The quotes indicate that the statement ''p'' [[use–mention distinction|is being treated as a sentence, and not as a proposition]]. This principle is presupposed by claims that hold that [[First-order_logic#Equality_and_its_axioms|substitution]] fails in certain [[intension]]al contexts.

==Overview==
Consider the following argument:
:(1) Sally accepts the assertion that "[[Cicero]] was a famous [[orator]]" while dissenting from the assertion that "Tully was a famous [[orator]]".
:(2) Cicero is Tully
:Therefore, (3) Sally believes that Tully was a famous orator.

To derive (3), we have to assume that when Sally accepts that "Cicero was a famous orator", she believes that Cicero was a famous orator. Then we can exchange Cicero for Tully, and derive (3). [[Bertrand Russell]] thought that this demonstrated the failure of substitutivity of identicals in [[intension]]al contexts.

In "A Puzzle about Belief,"&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. "A Puzzle about Belief." First appeared in, ''Meaning and Use''. ed., A. Margalit. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1979. pp. 239–283&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Kripke]] argues that the application of the disquotational theorem can yield a paradox on its own, without appeal to the substitution principle, and that this may show that the problem lies with the former, and not the latter. There are various formulations of this argument.

Suppose that, Pierre, a Frenchman, comes to believe that (1) "''Londres est jolie''" (London is pretty), without ever having visited the city. Later in life, Pierre ends up living in London. He finds no French speakers there (he does not speak English yet), and everyone refers to the city as "London," not ''Londres''. He finds this city decidedly unattractive, for the neighborhood he decides to live in is decidedly unattractive. Over time, he learns English, and formulates the belief that (2) "''London is not pretty''". Pierre never realizes that London is the English word for ''Londres''. Now with the disquotational principle, we can deduce from (1) that Pierre believes the proposition that ''Londres est jolie''. With a weak principle of translation (e.g., "a proposition in language A is the same as a semantically identical proposition in language B" [note that a proposition is not the same as a sentence]), we can now deduce that Pierre believes that London is pretty. But we can also deduce from (2) and the disquotational principle that Pierre believes that London is not pretty. These deductions can be made ''even though Pierre has made no logical blunders in forming his beliefs''. Without the disquotational principle, this contradiction could not be derived, because we would not be able to assume that (1) and (2) meant anything in particular.

This paradox can also be derived without appeal to another language. Suppose that Pierre assents to the proposition that "[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] had musical talent", perhaps having heard that this man was a famous pianist. With the disquotational principle, we can deduce that Pierre believes the proposition that Paderewski had musical talent. Now suppose that Pierre overhears a friend discussing the political exploits of a certain statesman, [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]], without knowing that the two Paderewskis are the same man. Pierre's background tells him that statesmen are generally not very gifted in music, and this leads him to the belief that Paderewski had no musical talent. The disquotation principle allows us to deduce that Pierre believes the proposition that Paderewski had no musical talent. Using this principle, we have now deduced that Pierre believes that Paderewski had musical talent, and does not believe that Paderewski had musical talent, ''even though Pierre's beliefs were formed logically''.

[[Andreas Cellarius]], German mathematician and cartographer (1596–1665), conceived an Atlas of the Universe, published in 1660, under the title of ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]''. Numerous illustrations of the solar system appear in this atlas by different authors known at that time. Referring to Ptolemy, Cellarius called the representation of this Ptolemaic conception of heaven as "Imago universi secundum Ptolaeum"

''Imago'' is a word in [[Latin]] which means'' 'image''' or even "representation". Therefore, the title expresses the "Picture of the Universe according to Ptolemy." The Latin expression was used in the Middle Ages to express the representation and size of the known world at that time.

''Imago Universi'' is also the title, in Latin, of a [[cosmography|cosmographic]] treatise, written in 2013 by the Spanish scientist Gabriel Barceló.

After analyzing the history of cosmology, the treatise delves into the prevailing scientific lack of explanation of the rotation of the heavenly bodies in the laws of dynamic behaviour of the sidereal system. The author proposes the application of the [[Theory of Dynamic Interactions]] (TID) to astrophysics, in particular, the dynamics of stellar systems and galaxies. This theory allows new comprehension of the dynamics of nature and understands the dynamic equilibrium of the universe, always subjected to rotational accelerations, but repetitive and persistent. The author also highlights that the orbiting always coincides with the intrinsic rotation of celestial bodies. Paradox incorporating the book, noting that this had not been found to date.

Abatement cost is the cost of reducing environmental negatives such as pollution. Marginal cost is an economic concept that measures the cost of an additional unit. The '''marginal abatement cost''' ('''MAC'''), in general, measures the cost of reducing one more unit of pollution.

Although marginal abatement costs can be negative, such as when the low carbon option is cheaper than the business-as-usual option, MACs often rise steeply as more pollution is reduced.

Marginal abatement costs are typically used on a '''marginal abatement cost curve''' (MACC) or '''MAC curve''', which shows the marginal cost of additional reductions in pollution.

== Usage ==
Carbon traders use MAC curves to derive the supply function for modelling carbon price fundamentals. Power companies may employ MAC curves to guide their decisions about long-term capital investment strategies to select among a variety of efficiency and generation options. Economists have used MAC curves to explain the economics of interregional carbon trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/globalchange/www/MITJPSPGC_Rpt40.pdf |title=Ellerman, A.D. and Decaux, A., Analysis of post-Kyoto {{CO2}}&amp;#125; emissions trading using marginal abatement curves, 1998. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy-makers use MAC curves as [[merit order]] curves, to analyze how much abatement can be done in an economy at what cost, and where policy should be directed to achieve the emission reductions.

However, MAC curves should not be used as abatement supply curves (or [[merit order]] curves) to decide which measures to implement in order to achieve a given emission-reduction target. Indeed, the options they list would take decades to implement, and it may be optimal to implement expensive but high-potential measures before introducing cheaper measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vogt-Schilb, A. and Hallegatte, S., 2014. Marginal abatement cost curves and the optimal timing of mitigation measures. |journal=Energy Policy |volume=66|pages= 645–653 |date= |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.11.045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The way that MAC curves are usually built has been criticized for lack of transparency and the poor treatment it makes of uncertainty, inter-temporal dynamics, interactions between sectors and ancillary benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Marginal abatement cost curves: a call for caution|date=|doi=10.1080/14693062.2011.582347 | volume=12|journal=Climate Policy|pages=219–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also concern regarding the biased ranking that occurs if some included options have negative costs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levihn|first=Fabian|date=2016-11-01|title=On the problem of optimizing through least cost per unit, when costs are negative: Implications for cost curves and the definition of economic efficiency|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544216312026|journal=Energy|volume=114|pages=1155–1163|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2016.08.089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Simon|date=2012-09-01|title=The ranking of negative-cost emissions reduction measures|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421512004843|journal=Energy Policy|series=Special Section: Frontiers of Sustainability|volume=48|pages=430–438|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2012.05.071}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=D.

==Examples of existing MAC curves==
Various economists, research organizations, and consultancies have produced MAC curves. Bloomberg New Energy Finance&lt;ref&gt;[http://carbon.newenergyfinance.com/download.php?n=BBNEF_CarbonMarkets_NAmerica_RN_2010_01_RN_USMACC.pdf&amp;f=fileName&amp;t=NCF_downloads Bloomberg New Energy Finance, US Marginal Abatement Cost Curve, 2010]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[McKinsey &amp; Company]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/ccsi/greenhousegas.asp McKinsey &amp; Company, Reducing US greenhouse gas emissions: how much at what cost? 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; have produced economy wide analyses on greenhouse gas emissions reductions for the [[United States]]. [[ICF International]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-500-2005-121/CEC-500-2005-121.PDF |title=ICF International, Emission reduction opportunities for non-{{CO2}}&amp;#125; greenhouse gases in California, 2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced a California specific curve following [[AB-32]] legislation as have Sweeney and Weyant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/group/peec/cgi-bin/docs/policy/research/September%2027%202008%20Discussion%20Draft%20-%20Analysis%20of%20Measures%20to%20Meet%20the%20Requirements%20of%20Californias%20Assembly%20Bill%2032.pdf Sweeney, J. and Weyant, J., Analysis of measures to meet the requirements of California’s Assembly Bill 32, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy]] produced several marginal abatement cost curves for Germany (also called Cost Potential Curves), depending on the perspective (end-user, utilities, society).&lt;ref&gt;[http://epub.wupperinst.org/files/5015/5015_EE_EDL_en.pdf Options and Potentials for Energy End-use Efficiency and Energy Services, Wuppertal Institute, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3805">In [[economics]], '''marginal concepts''' are associated with a ''specific change'' in the quantity used of a [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]], as opposed to some notion of the over-all significance of that class of good or service, or of some total quantity thereof.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== Marginality ==

Constraints are conceptualized as a ''border'' or ''margin''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910), Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;  The location of the margin for any individual corresponds to his or her ''endowment'', broadly conceived to include opportunities.  This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made both by others and by the individual himself or herself.

A value that holds true given particular constraints is a [[marginal value|''marginal'' value]].  A change that would be affected as or by a specific loosening or tightening of those constraints is a ''marginal'' change, as large as the smallest relevant division of that good or service.&lt;ref name="wieser_ein"&gt;von Wieser, Friedrich; ''Über den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  For reasons of tractability, it is often assumed in [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical analysis]] that goods and services are [[Continuum (theory)|continuously divisible]].  In such context, a marginal change may be an [[infinitesimal]] change or a [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]].  However, strictly speaking, the smallest relevant division may be quite large.

== Some important marginal concepts ==

The '''[[marginal use]]''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the good or service that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.&lt;ref name="wieser_ein" /&gt;

The '''[[marginal utility]]''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the [[utility]] of the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase in that good or service, or of the specific use that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.  In other words, marginal utility is the utility of the  [[marginal use]].

The '''[[marginal rate of substitution]]''' is the rate of substitution is the least favorable rate, at the margin, at which an agent is willing to exchange units of one good or service for units of another.

A '''[[marginal benefit]]''' is a benefit (howsoever ranked or measured) associated with a marginal change.

The term “'''[[marginal cost]]'''” may refer to an [[opportunity cost]] at the margin, or to marginal ''[[Money|pecuniary]]'' cost — that is to say marginal cost measured by forgone money.

Other marginal concepts include (but are not limited to):
* [[marginal product|marginal physical product]] (sometimes also known as “marginal product”)
* [[marginal rate of transformation]], the rate at which one output or result must be sacrificed in order to increase another output or result
* [[marginal revenue product]]
* [[marginal propensity to save]] and [[marginal propensity to consume|consume]]
* [[marginal tax rate]]

'''[[Marginalism]]''' is the use of marginal concepts to explain economic phenomena.

The related concept of [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] is the ratio of the incremental percentage change in one variable with respect to an incremental percentage change in another variable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12544">In economics, the '''marginal product of labor''' ('''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''') is the change in output that results from employing an added unit of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Sullivan | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin  | title = Economics: Principles in Action | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2003 | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ  | page = 108 | isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[marginal product]] of a [[factor of production]] is generally defined as the change in output associated with a change in that factor, holding other inputs into production constant.

The marginal product of labor is then the change in output (''Y'') per unit change in labor (''L''). In discrete terms the marginal product of labor is:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\Delta Y} {\Delta L}.&lt;/math&gt;

In continuous terms, the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the first [[derivative]] of the [[production function]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial Y} {\partial L}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Perloff173"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008. p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphically, the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the slope of the production function.

==Examples==
[[File:Marginal Product of Labor1 copy.png|frame|right|Marginal product of labor table (EDIT: Marginal Product of Labor at Labor = 7 is 4 not 3)]]

There is a factory which produces toys. When there are no workers in the factory, no toys are produced. When there is one worker in the factory, six toys are produced per hour. When there are two workers in the factory, eleven toys are produced per hour. There is a marginal product of labor of five when there are two workers in the factory compared to one. When the marginal product of labor is increasing, this is called [[increasing marginal returns]]. However, as the number of workers increases, the marginal product of labor may not increase indefinitely. When not [[scale (social sciences)|scale]]d properly, the marginal product of labor may go down when the number of employees goes up, creating a situation known as [[diminishing marginal returns]]. When the marginal product of labor becomes negative, it is known as [[negative marginal returns]].

==Marginal costs==

The marginal product of labor is directly related to [[Cost-of-production theory of value|costs of production]]. [[Cost]]s are divided between [[Fixed cost|fixed]] and [[variable cost]]s. Fixed costs are costs that relate to the fixed input, [[Capital (economics)|capital]], or ''rK'', where ''r'' is the rental cost of capital and ''K'' is the quantity of capital. Variable costs (VC) are the costs of the variable input, labor, or ''wL'', where ''w'' is the wage rate and ''L'' is the amount of labor employed. Thus, VC = wL . Marginal cost (MC) is the change in total cost per unit change in output or ∆C/∆Q. In the short run, production can be varied only by changing the variable input. Thus only variable costs change as output increases:  ∆C = ∆VC = ∆(wL). Marginal cost is ∆(Lw)/∆Q. Now, ∆L/∆Q is the reciprocal of the marginal product of labor  (∆Q/∆L). Therefore, marginal cost is simply the wage rate w divided by the marginal product of labor

:MC = ∆VC∕∆Q;
:∆VC = w∆L;
:∆L∕∆Q (the change in quantity of labor to effect a one unit change in output) = 1∕MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.
:Therefore MC = w ∕ MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;

Thus if the marginal product of labor is rising then marginal costs will be falling and if the marginal product of labor is falling marginal costs will be rising (assuming a constant wage rate).&lt;ref&gt;Pindyck, R. and D. Rubinfeld, ''Microeconomics'', 5th ed. Prentice-Hall 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation between MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;==

The average product of labor is the total product of labor divided by the number of units of labor employed, or ''Q/L''.&lt;ref name="Perloff173"/&gt; The average product of labor is a common measure of labor productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, W. and C. Snyder, ''Intermediate Microeconomics'', Thomson 2007, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, W., ''Microeconomic Theory'', 9th ed. Thomson 2005, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve is shaped like an inverted “u”. At low production levels the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tends to increase as additional labor is added. The primary reason for the increase is specialization and division of labor.&lt;ref name="Perloff176"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; At the point the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; reaches its maximum value  AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; equals the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Binger, B. and E. Hoffman, ''Microeconomics with Calculus'', 2nd ed. Addison-Wesley 1998, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this point the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; falls.

During the early stages of production MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. When the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is above the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will increase. Eventually the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' reaches it maximum value at the point of diminishing returns. Beyond this point MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will decrease. However, at the point of diminishing returns the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is still above the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will continue to increase until MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; equals AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. When MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is below AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will decrease.

Graphically, the ''AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' curve can be derived from the total product curve by drawing secants from the origin that intersect (cut) the total product curve. The slope of the secant line equals the average product of labor, where the slope = dQ/dL.&lt;ref name="Perloff176"/&gt; The slope of the curve at each intersection marks a point on the average product curve. The slope increases until the line reaches a point of tangency with the total product curve. This point marks the maximum average product of labor. It also marks the point where MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (which is the slope of the total product curve)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=Microeconomics|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|isbn=978-1429277914|authorlink=Paul Krugman|author2=Robin Wells |authorlink2=Robin Wells (economist) |page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; equals the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (the slope of the secant).&lt;ref&gt;Perloff, J: Microeconomics Theory &amp; Applications with Calculus page 177. Pearson 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this point the slope of the secants become progressively smaller as ''AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' declines. The MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve intersects the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve from above at the maximum point of the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve. Thereafter, the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve is below the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve.

==Diminishing marginal returns==

The falling MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is due to the law of diminishing marginal returns. The law states, "as units of one input are added (with all other inputs held constant) a point will be reached where the resulting additions to output will begin to decrease; that is marginal product will decline."&lt;ref name="Samuelson227"&gt;Samuelson, W. and S. Marks, ''Managerial Economics'', 4th ed. Wiley 2003, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; The law of diminishing marginal returns applies regardless of whether the production function exhibits increasing, decreasing or constant returns to scale. The key factor is that the variable input is being changed while all other factors of production are being held constant. Under such circumstances diminishing marginal returns are inevitable at some level of production.&lt;ref name="Varian1992"&gt;[[Hal Varian]], ''Microeconomic Analysis'', 3rd ed. Norton 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diminishing marginal returns differs from diminishing returns. Diminishing marginal returns means that the marginal product of the variable input is falling. Diminishing returns occur when the marginal product of the variable input is negative. That is when a unit increase in the variable input causes total product to fall. At the point that diminishing returns begin the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is zero.&lt;ref name="Perloff178"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and profit maximization==

The general rule is that a firm maximizes profit by producing that quantity of output where [[marginal revenue]] equals marginal costs. The [[profit maximization]] issue can also be approached from the input side. That is, what is the profit maximizing usage of the variable input? To maximize profits the firm should increase usage "up to the point where the input’s marginal revenue product equals its marginal costs". So, mathematically the profit maximizing rule is MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MC&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Samuelson227" /&gt; The marginal profit per unit of labor equals the marginal revenue product of labor minus the marginal cost of labor or Mπ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;MC&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;A firm maximizes profits where Mπ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.

The marginal revenue product is the change in total revenue per unit change in the variable input assume labor.&lt;ref name="Samuelson227" /&gt; That is, MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆TR/∆L. MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the product of marginal revenue and the marginal product of labor or MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MR × MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

*Derivation:
:MR = ∆TR/∆Q
:MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆Q/∆L
:MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MR × MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = (∆TR/∆Q) × (∆Q/∆L) = ∆TR/∆L

===Example===

*Assume that the production function is &lt;math&gt; Q = 90L - L^2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Samuelson227"/&gt;
	•	&lt;math&gt; MC_L = 30 &lt;/math&gt;

	•	Output price is $40 per unit.
:&lt;math&gt; MP_L = 90 - 2L &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = 40(90 - 2L) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = 3600 - 80L &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = MC_L &lt;/math&gt; (Profit Max Rule)
:&lt;math&gt; 3600 - 80L = 30 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 3570 = 80L &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; L = 44.625 &lt;/math&gt;
:44.625 is the profit maximizing number of workers.
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 90L - L^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 90(44.625) - (44.625)^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q= 4016.25 - 1991.39 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 2024.86 &lt;/math&gt;
:Thus, the profit maximizing output is 2025 units
	•	And the profit is
:&lt;math&gt; TR - TC = \Pi &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 40(2025) - 30(2025) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 81,000 - 60,750 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 20,250 &lt;/math&gt;

* Some might be confused by the fact that &lt;math&gt; L = 44.625 &lt;/math&gt; as intuition would say that labor should be discrete. Remember, however, that labor is actually a time measure as well. Thus, it can be thought of as a worker not working the entire hour.

==Marginal productivity ethics==

In the aftermath of the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]] in economics, a number of economists including [[John Bates Clark]] and [[Thomas Nixon Carver]] sought to derive an ethical theory of income distribution based on the idea that workers were morally entitled to receive a wage exactly equal to their marginal product. In the 20th century, marginal productivity ethics found few supporters among economists, being criticised not only by egalitarians but by economists associated with the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school]] such as [[Frank Knight]] (in ''The Ethics of Competition'') and the [[Austrian School]], such as [[Leland Yeager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1663&amp;chapter=37668&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=Can a Liberal Be an Equalitarian?

Yeager - Toward Liberty: Essays in Honor of Ludwig von Mises, vol. 2 |publisher=Online Library of Liberty |date=1971-09-29 |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, marginal productivity ethics were defended by [[George Stigler]].

The '''marginal propensity to import''' ('''MPI''') is the fractional change in [[imports|import]] expenditure that occurs with a change in [[disposable income]] (income after taxes and transfers).  For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and the marginal propensity to import is 0.2, then the household will spend 20 cents of that dollar on imported goods and services.

Mathematically, the marginal propensity to import (MPM) function is expressed as the [[derivative]] of the import (I) function with respect to disposable income (Y).&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{MPM}=\frac{\text{d}I}{\text{d}Y}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In other words, the marginal propensity to import is measured as the ratio of the change in imports to the change in income, thus giving us a figure between 0 and 1.  

Imports are also considered to be [[automatic stabiliser]]s that work to lessen fluctuations in [[real GDP]].

The UK government assumes that UK citizens have a high marginal propensity to import and thus will use a decrease in disposable income as a tool to control the current account on the balance of payments.

'''Marginal return''' is the rate of return for a [[Marginalism|marginal]] increase in investment; roughly, this is the additional [[Output (economics)|output]] resulting from a one-unit increase in the use of a variable [[Factors of production|input]], while other inputs are constant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2304">As defined by the [[Austrian School|Austrian School of economics]] the '''marginal use''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.&lt;ref name="weiser_ein"&gt;von Wieser, Friedrich; ''Über den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  The useful''ness'' of the marginal use thus corresponds to the [[marginal utility]] of the good or service.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch"&gt;Mc Culloch, James Huston; [http://www.mises.org/etexts/mcCulloch.pdf “The Austrian Theory of the Marginal Use and of Ordinal Marginal Utility”,] ''[[Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie]]'' 37 (1977) #3&amp;amp;4 (September).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the assumption that an agent is [[Rational choice theory|economically rational]], each increase would be put to the specific, feasible, previously unrealized use of greatest priority, and each decrease would result in abandonment of the use of lowest priority amongst the uses to which the good or service had been put.&lt;ref name="weiser_ein" /&gt;  And, in the absence of a complementarity across uses, [[Law of diminishing marginal utility|the “law” of diminishing marginal utility]] will obtain.&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen"&gt;[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Georgescu-Roegen, Nicholas]]; “Utility”, ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;

The Austrian School of economics explicitly arrives at its conception of marginal utility as the utility of the marginal use, and “Grenznutzen” (the Austrian School term from which “marginal utility” was originally derived in translation&lt;ref&gt;Streissler, E., “Wieser, Friedrich, Freiherr von”, [[The New Palgrave:  A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 4  (1987), p. 921.&lt;/ref&gt;) literally means ''border-use''; other schools usually do not make an explicit connection.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;

Mental representation is the mental imagery of things that are not actually present to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mckellar|first1=Peter|title=Imagination and thinking: A psychological analysis|date=1957|publisher=Oxford, England|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1958-00258-000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]], specifically in fields of [[metaphysics]] such as [[philosophy of mind]] and [[ontology]], a mental representation is one of the prevailing ways of [[explanation|explaining]] and [[description|describing]] the nature of [[idea]]s and [[concept]]s.

Mental representations (or mental imagery) enable representing things that have never been experienced as well as things that do not exist.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009"&gt;{{cite book|author = Robert J. Sternberg|url = https://books.google.com/?id=la6mSK9vyIgC|title = Cognitive Psychology|year = 2009|isbn = 9780495506294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Think of yourself traveling to a place you have never visited before, or having a third arm. These things have either never happened or are impossible and do not exist, yet our brain and mental imagery allows us to imagine them. Although visual imagery is more likely to be recalled, mental imagery may involve representations in any of the sensory modalities, such as hearing, smell, or taste. [[Stephen Kosslyn]] proposes that images are used to help solve certain types of problems. We are able to visualize the objects in question and mentally represent the images to solve it.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009" /&gt;

Mental representations also allow people to experience things right in front of them—though the process of how the brain interprets the [[Mental content|representational content]] is debated.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

== Representational theories of mind ==

[[Representationalism]] (also known as [[Direct and indirect realism|indirect realism]]) is the view that representations are the main way we access external reality. Another major prevailing [[philosophical theory]] posits that concepts are entirely [[abstract object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Ontology of Concepts—Abstract Objects or Mental Representations?|url=http://philosophy.dept.shef.ac.uk/papers/OntologyofConcepts.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Margolis|first1=Eric|last2=Laurence|first2=Stephen|authorlink2=Stephen Laurence|journal=Noûs|volume=41|issue=4|date=December 2007|pages=561–593|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representational theory of mind attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of [[idea]]s, [[concept]]s and other [[mental content]] in [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive science]] and [[experimental psychology]]. In contrast to theories of naive or [[direct realism]], the representational theory of mind postulates the actual existence of mental representations which act as intermediaries between the [[observation|observing]] subject and the [[object (philosophy)|objects]], processes or other entities observed in the external world. These intermediaries stand for or represent to the mind the objects of that world.

For example, when someone arrives at the belief that his or her floor needs sweeping, the representational theory of mind states that he or she forms a mental representation that represents the floor and its state of cleanliness.

The original or "classical" representational theory probably can be traced back to [[Thomas Hobbes]] and was a dominant theme in classical [[empiricism]] in general. According to this version of the theory, the mental representations were images (often called "ideas") of the objects or states of affairs represented. For modern adherents, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and many others, the representational system consists rather of an internal [[Language of thought hypothesis|language of thought]] (i.e., mentalese). The contents of thoughts are represented in symbolic structures (the formulas of Mentalese) which, analogously to natural languages but on a much more abstract level, possess a [[syntax]] and [[semantics]] very much like those of natural languages. For the Spanish logician and cognitive scientist Luis M. Augusto, at this abstract, formal level, the syntax of thought is the set of symbol rules (i.e., operations, processes, etc. on and with symbol structures) and the semantics of thought is the set of symbol structures (concepts and propositions). Content (i.e., thought) emerges from the meaningful co-occurrence of both sets of symbols. For instance, "8 x 9" is a meaningful co-occurrence, whereas "CAT x §" is not; "x" is a symbol rule called for by symbol structures such as "8" and "9", but not by "CAT" and "§".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Unconscious representations 2: Towards an integrated cognitive architecture.|last = Augusto|first = Luis M.|date = 2014|journal = Axiomathes |volume=24|pages=19–43|doi = 10.1007/s10516-012-9207-y|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of representationalism, strong and weak. Strong representationalism attempts to reduce phenomenal character to intentional content. On the other hand, weak representationalism claims only that phenomenal character supervenes on intentional content. Strong representationalism aims to provide a theory about the nature of phenomenal character, and offers a solution to the hard problem of consciousness. In contrast to this, weak representationalism does not aim to provide a theory of consciousness, nor does it offer a solution to the hard problem of consciousness.

Strong representationalism can be further broken down into restricted and unrestricted versions. The restricted version deals only with certain kinds of phenomenal states e.g. visual perception. Most representationalists endorse an unrestricted version of representationalism. According to the unrestricted version, for any state with phenomenal character that state’s phenomenal character reduces to its intentional content. Only this unrestricted version of representationalism is able to provide a general theory about the nature of phenomenal character, as well as offer a potential solution to the hard problem of consciousness. The successful reduction of the phenomenal character of a state to its intentional content would provide a solution to the hard problem of consciousness once a physicalist account of intentionality is worked out.

=== Problems for the unrestricted version ===
When arguing against the unrestricted version of representationalism people will often bring up phenomenal mental states that appear to lack intentional content. The unrestricted version seeks to account for all phenomenal states. Thus, for it to be true, all states with phenomenal character must have intentional content to which that character is reduced. Phenomenal states without intentional content therefore serve as a counterexample to the unrestricted version. If the state has no intentional content its phenomenal character will not be reducible to that state’s intentional content, for it has none to begin with.

A common example of this kind of state are moods. Moods are states with phenomenal character that are generally thought to not be directed at anything in particular. Moods are thought to lack directedness, unlike emotions, which are typically thought to be directed at particular things e.g. you are mad ''at'' your sibling, you are afraid ''of'' a dangerous animal. People conclude that because moods are undirected they are also nonintentional i.e. they lack intentionality or aboutness. Because they are not directed at anything they are not about anything. Because they lack intentionality they will lack any intentional content. Lacking intentional content their phenomenal character will not be reducible to intentional content, refuting the representational doctrine.

Though emotions are typically considered as having directedness and intentionality this idea has also been called into question. One might point to emotions a person all of a sudden experiences that do not appear to be directed at or about anything in particular. Emotions elicited by listening to music are another potential example of undirected, nonintentional emotions. Emotions aroused in this way do not seem to necessarily be about anything, including the music that arouses them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kind|first = Amy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses&lt;!--'Directedness' redirects here--&gt; ===
In response to this objection a proponent of representationalism might reject the undirected nonintentionality of moods, and attempt to identify some intentional content they might plausibly be thought to possess. The proponent of representationalism might also reject the narrow conception of intentionality as being directed at a particular thing, arguing instead for a broader kind of intentionality.

There are three alternative kinds of '''directedness'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;/[[intentionality]] one might posit for moods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Outward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content.
* Inward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
* Hybrid directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have both a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content and a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
In the case of outward directedness moods might be directed at either the world as a whole, a changing series of objects in the world, or unbound emotion properties projected by people onto things in the world. In the case of inward directedness moods are directed at the overall state of a person’s body. In the case of hybrid directedness moods are directed at some combination of inward and outward things.

=== Further objections ===
Even if one can identify some possible intentional content for moods we might still question whether that content is able to sufficiently capture the phenomenal character of the mood states they are a part of. Amy Kind contends that in the case of all the previously mentioned kinds of directedness (outward, inward, and hybrid) the intentional content supplied to the mood state is not capable of sufficiently capturing the phenomenal aspects of the mood states.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the case of inward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood does not seem tied to the state of one’s body, and even if one’s mood is reflected by the overall state of one’s body that person will not necessarily be aware of it, demonstrating the insufficiency of the intentional content to adequately capture the phenomenal aspects of the mood. In the case of outward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood and its intentional content do not seem to share the corresponding relation they should given that the phenomenal character is supposed to reduce to the intentional content. Hybrid directedness, if it can even get off the ground, faces the same objection.

== Philosophers ==
There is a wide debate on what kinds of representations exist. There are several philosophers who bring about different aspects of the debate. Such philosophers include Alex Morgan, Gualtiero Piccinini, and Uriah Kriegel—though this is not an exhaustive list.

=== Alex Morgan ===

There are "job description" representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That is representations that (1) represent something—have [[intentionality]], (2) have a special relation—the represented object does not need to exist, and (3) content plays a causal role in what gets represented:  e.g. saying "hello" to a friend, giving a glare to an enemy.

Structural representations are also important.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations are basically mental maps that we have in our minds that correspond exactly to those objects in the world (the intentional content). According to Morgan, structural representations are not the same as mental representations—there is nothing mental about them:  plants can have structural representations.

There are also internal representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations include those that involve future decisions, episodic memories, or any type of projection into the future.

=== Gualtiero Piccinini ===

In [[Gualtiero Piccinini]]'s forthcoming work, he discusses topics on natural and nonnatural mental representations. He relies on the natural definition of mental representations given by Grice (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Meaning|last = Grice|first = H.P.|date = 1957|journal = Philosophical Review |volume=66|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; where ''P entails that P''. e.g. Those spots mean measles, entails that the patient has measles. Then there are nonnatural representations:  ''P does not entail P''. e.g. The 3 rings on the bell of a bus mean the bus is full—the rings on the bell are independent of the fullness of the bus—we could have assigned something else (just as arbitrary) to signify that the bus is full.

=== Uriah Kriegel ===

There are also objective and subjective mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kriegel|first = Uriah|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 161–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objective representations are closest to tracking theories—where the brain simply tracks what is in the environment. If there is a blue bird outside my window, the objective representation is that of the blue bird. Subjective representations can vary person-to-person. For example, if I am colorblind, that blue bird outside my window will not ''appear'' blue to me since I cannot represent the blueness of blue (i.e. I cannot see the color blue). The relationship between these two types of representation can vary.

&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective varies, but the subjective does not:  e.g. brain-in-a-vat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjective varies, but the objective does not:  e.g. color-inverted world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in objective and none in the subjective:  e.g. thermometer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in subjective and none in the objective:  e.g. an agent that experiences in a void.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Eliminativists think that subjective representations don't exist. Reductivists think subjective representations are reducible to objective. Non-reductivists think that subjective representations are real and distinct.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

In the [[philosophy of science]], '''models of scientific inquiry''' have two functions: first, to provide a descriptive account of ''how'' scientific inquiry is carried out in practice, and second, to provide an explanatory account of ''why'' scientific inquiry succeeds as well as it appears to do in arriving at genuine knowledge.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The search for scientific knowledge ends far back into antiquity.  At some point in the past, at least by the time of Aristotle, philosophers recognized that a fundamental distinction should be drawn between two kinds of scientific knowledge—roughly, knowledge ''that'' and knowledge ''why''.  It is one thing to know ''that'' each planet periodically reverses the direction of its motion with respect to the background of fixed stars;  it is quite a different matter to know ''why''.  Knowledge of the former type is descriptive;  knowledge of the latter type is explanatory.  It is explanatory knowledge that provides scientific understanding of the world.  (Salmon, 2006, pg. 3)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Scientific inquiry refers to the diverse ways in which scientists study the natural world and propose explanations based on the evidence derived from their work."&lt;ref name=NRC-1996/&gt;

==Accounts of scientific inquiry==

===Classical model===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The classical model of scientific inquiry derives from [[Aristotle]], who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference, and also treated the compound forms such as reasoning by [[analogy]].

===Pragmatic model===
{{main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}
{{Expand section|date=February 2018}}

===Logical empiricism===
[[Wesley Salmon]] (1989)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt; began his historical survey of scientific explanation with what he called the ''received view'', as it was received from [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] in the years beginning with their ''Studies in the Logic of Explanation'' (1948) and culminating in Hempel's ''[[Aspects of Scientific Explanation and other Essays in the Philosophy of Science|Aspects of Scientific Explanation]]'' (1965).  Salmon summed up his analysis of these developments by means of the following Table.

{| class="wikitable" align="center" style="text-align:center; width:90%"
|-
! Laws / Explananda !! Particular Facts !! General Regularities
|-
! Universal Laws
| D-N

Deductive-Nomological
| D-N

Deductive-Nomological
|-
! Statistical Laws
| I-S

Inductive-Statistical
| D-S

Deductive-Statistical
|}

In this classification, a [[deductive-nomological]] (D-N) explanation of an occurrence is a valid deduction whose conclusion states that the outcome to be explained did in fact occur.  The deductive argument is called an ''explanation'', its premisses are called the ''explanans'' ([[Latin|L:]] ''explaining'') and the conclusion is called the ''explanandum'' ([[Latin|L:]] ''to be explained'').  Depending on a number of additional qualifications, an explanation may be ranked on a scale from ''potential'' to ''true''.

Not all explanations in science are of the D-N type, however.  An ''inductive-statistical'' (I-S) explanation accounts for an occurrence by subsuming it under statistical laws, rather than categorical or universal laws, and the mode of subsumption is itself inductive instead of deductive.  The D-N type can be seen as a limiting case of the more general I-S type, the measure of certainty involved being complete, or [[probability]] 1, in the former case, whereas it is less than complete, probability &amp;lt; 1, in the latter case.

In this view, the D-N mode of reasoning, in addition to being used to explain particular occurrences, can also be used to explain general regularities, simply by deducing them from still more general laws.

Finally, the ''deductive-statistical'' (D-S) type of explanation, properly regarded as a subclass of the D-N type, explains statistical regularities by deduction from more comprehensive statistical laws.  (Salmon 1989, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;.

Such was the ''received view'' of scientific explanation from the point of view of [[logical empiricism]], that Salmon says "held sway" during the third quarter of the last century (Salmon, p.&amp;nbsp;10)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;.

==Choice of a theory==
{{See also|Commensurability (philosophy of science)}}
During the course of history, one theory has succeeded another, and some have suggested further work while others have seemed content just to explain the phenomena. The reasons why one theory has replaced another are not always obvious or simple. The philosophy of science includes the question: ''What criteria are satisfied by a 'good' theory''. This question has a long history, and many scientists, as well as philosophers, have considered it. The objective is to be able to choose one theory as preferable to another without introducing [[cognitive bias]].&lt;ref name=Kuhn/&gt; Several often proposed criteria were summarized by Colyvan.&lt;ref name=Colyvan/&gt; A good theory:
# Is elegant (Formal elegance; no ''ad hoc'' modifications)
# Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements (simplicity/parsimony)
# Agrees with and explains all existing observations (unificatory/[[explanatory power]])
# Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can [[disprove]] or [[falsify]] the model if they are not borne out.
# Is fruitful: the emphasis by Colyvan is not only upon prediction and falsification, but also upon a theory's [[wikt:seminality|seminality]] in suggesting future work.

[[Stephen Hawking]] supports items 1–4, but does not mention fruitfulness.&lt;ref name=Hawking/&gt; On the other hand, Kuhn emphasizes the importance of seminality.&lt;ref name=Kuhn0/&gt;

The goal here is to make the choice between theories less arbitrary. Nonetheless, these criteria contain subjective elements, and are [[heuristics]] rather than part of [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=Simplicity/&gt; Also, criteria such as these do not necessarily decide between alternative theories. Quoting Bird:&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;
{{quote|"They [such criteria]  cannot determine scientific choice. First, which features of a theory satisfy these criteria may be disputable (''e.g.'' does simplicity concern the ontological commitments of a theory or its mathematical form?). Secondly, these criteria are imprecise, and so there is room for disagreement about the degree to which they hold. Thirdly, there can be disagreement about how they are to be weighted relative to one another, especially when they conflict." |Alexander Bird|Methodological incommensurability}}

It also is debatable whether existing scientific theories satisfy all these criteria, which may represent goals not yet achieved. For example, explanatory power over all existing observations (criterion 3) is satisfied by no one theory at the moment.&lt;ref name=Realism/&gt;
{{quote|Whatever might be the ultimate goals of some scientists, science, as it is currently practiced, depends on multiple overlapping descriptions of the world, each of which has a domain of applicability. In some cases this domain is very large, but in others quite small.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;|E.B. Davies |Epistemological pluralism, p. 4}}

The [[wikt:desiderata|desiderata]] of a "good" theory have been debated for centuries, going back perhaps even earlier than [[Occam's razor]],&lt;ref name=Desiderata/&gt; which often is taken as an attribute of a good theory. Occam's razor might fall under the heading of "elegance", the first item on the list, but too zealous an application was cautioned by [[Albert Einstein]]: "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt; It is arguable that ''parsimony'' and ''elegance'' "typically pull in different directions".&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;   The falsifiability item on the list is related to the criterion proposed by Popper as demarcating a scientific theory from a theory like astrology: both "explain" observations, but the scientific theory takes the risk of making predictions that decide whether it is right or wrong:&lt;ref name=Popper1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popper0/&gt;
{{quote|"It must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience."
"Those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazard of refutation do not take part in the game of science."
|Karl Popper|The logic of scientific discovery, p. 18 and p. 280}}
[[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that changes in scientists' views of reality not only contain subjective elements, but result from group dynamics, "revolutions" in scientific practice which result in [[paradigm shift]]s.&lt;ref name=Kuhn2/&gt; As an example, Kuhn suggested that the [[heliocentric]] "[[Copernican Revolution]]" replaced the [[geocentric]] views of [[Ptolemy]] not because of empirical failures, but because of a new "paradigm" that exerted control over what scientists felt to be the more fruitful way to pursue their goals.

==Aspects of scientific inquiry==

===Deduction and induction===
[[Deductive logic]] and [[inductive logic]] are quite different in their approaches.

'''Deductive logic''' is the reasoning of proof, or [[Logical consequence|logical implication]]. It is the logic used in mathematics and other [[axiomatic system]]s such as formal logic. In a deductive system, there will be [[axiom]]s (postulates) which are not proven. Indeed, they cannot be proven without circularity. There will also be primitive terms which are not defined, as they cannot be defined without circularity. For example, one can define a line as a set of points, but to then define a point as the intersection of two lines would be circular. Because of these interesting characteristics of [[formal system]]s, Bertrand Russell humorously referred to mathematics as "the field where we don't know what we are talking about, nor whether or not what we say is true". All theorems and corollaries are proven by exploring the implications of the axiomata and other theorems that have previously been developed. New terms are defined using the primitive terms and other derived definitions based on those primitive terms.

In a deductive system, one can correctly use the term "proof", as applying to a theorem. To say that a theorem is proven means that it is impossible for the axioms to be true and the theorem to be false. For example, we could do a simple [[syllogism]] such as the following:

# [[Arches National Park]] lies within the state of [[Utah]].
# I am standing in Arches National Park.
# Therefore, I am standing in the state of Utah.

Notice that it is not possible (assuming all of the trivial qualifying criteria are supplied) to be in Arches and not be in Utah. However, one can be in Utah while not in Arches National Park. The implication only works in one direction. Statements (1) and (2) taken together imply statement (3). Statement (3) does not imply anything about statements (1) or (2). Notice that we have not proven statement (3), but we have shown that statements (1) and (2) together imply statement (3). In mathematics, what is proven is not the truth of a particular theorem, but that the axioms of the system imply the theorem. In other words, it is impossible for the axioms to be true and the theorem to be false. The strength of deductive systems is that they are sure of their results. The weakness is that they are abstract constructs which are, unfortunately, one step removed from the physical world. They are very useful, however, as mathematics has provided great insights into natural science by providing useful models of natural phenomena. One result is the development of products and processes that benefit mankind.

Learning about the physical world requires the use of '''inductive logic'''. This is the logic of theory building. It is useful in such widely divergent enterprises as science and crime scene detective work. One makes a set of observations, and seeks to explain what one sees. The observer forms a hypothesis in an attempt to explain what he/she has observed. The hypothesis will have implications, which will point to certain other observations that would naturally result from either a repeat of the experiment or making more observations from a slightly different set of circumstances. If the predicted observations hold true, one feels excitement that they may be on the right track. However, the hypothesis has not been proven. The hypothesis implies that certain observations should follow, but positive observations do not imply the hypothesis. They only make it more believable. It is quite possible that some other hypothesis could also account for the known observations, and may do better with future experiments. The implication flows in only one direction, as in the syllogism used in the discussion on deduction. Therefore, it is never correct to say that a scientific principle or hypothesis/theory has been proven. (At least, not in the rigorous sense of proof used in deductive systems.)

A classic example of this is the study of gravitation. Newton formed a law for gravitation stating that the force of gravitation is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. For over 170 years, all observations seemed to validate his equation. However, telescopes eventually became powerful enough to see a slight discrepancy in the orbit of Mercury. Scientists tried everything imaginable to explain the discrepancy, but they could not do so using the objects that would bear on the orbit of Mercury. Eventually, Einstein developed his theory of [[general relativity]] and it explained the orbit of Mercury and all other known observations dealing with gravitation. During the long period of time when scientists were making observations that seemed to validate Newton's theory, they did not, in fact, prove his theory to be true. However, it must have seemed at the time that they did. It only took one counterexample (Mercury's orbit) to prove that there was something wrong with his theory.

This is typical of inductive logic. All of the observations that seem to validate the theory, do not prove its truth. But one counter-example can prove it false.  That means that deductive logic is used in the evaluation of a theory.  In other words, if A implies B, then not B implies not A.  Einstein's theory of General Relativity has been supported by many observations using the best scientific instruments and experiments. However, his theory now has the same status as Newton's theory of gravitation prior to seeing the problems in the orbit of Mercury. It is highly credible and validated with all we know, but it is not proven. It is only the best we have at this point in time.

Another example of correct scientific reasoning is shown in the current search for the [[Higgs boson]].  Scientists on the [[Compact Muon Solenoid]] experiment at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] have conducted experiments yielding data suggesting the existence of the Higgs boson. However, realizing that the results could possibly be explained as a background fluctuation and not the Higgs boson, they are cautious and waiting for further data from future experiments.  Said Guido Tonelli:

{{Quote|"We cannot exclude the presence of the [[Standard Model]] Higgs between 115 and 127 [[GeV]] because of a modest excess of events in this mass region that appears, quite consistently, in five independent channels [...] As of today what we see is consistent either with a background fluctuation or with the presence of the boson."}}

A brief overview of the '''scientific method''' would then contain these steps as a minimum:

# Make a set of observations regarding the phenomenon being studied.
# Form a hypothesis that might explain the observations.  (Inductive Step)
# Identify the implications and outcomes that must follow, if the hypothesis is to be true.
# Perform other experiments or observations to see if any of the predicted outcomes fail.
# If any predicted outcomes fail, the hypothesis is proven false since if A implies B, then not B implies not A.  (Deductive Logic)  It is then necessary to change the hypothesis and go back to step 3.  If the predicted outcomes are confirmed, the hypothesis is not proved, but rather can be said to be consistent with known data.

When a hypothesis has survived a sufficient number of tests, it may be promoted to a [[scientific theory]].  A theory is a hypothesis that has survived many tests and seems to be consistent with other established scientific theories.  Since a theory is a promoted hypothesis, it is of the same 'logical' species and shares the same logical limitations.  Just as a hypothesis cannot be proven but can be disproved, that same is true for a theory.  It is a difference of degree, not kind.

'''Arguments from analogy''' are another type of inductive reasoning. In arguing from analogy, one infers that since two things are alike in several respects, they are likely to be alike in another respect. This is, of course, an assumption. It is natural to attempt to find similarities between two phenomena and wonder what one can learn from those similarities. However, to notice that two things share attributes in several respects does not imply any similarities in other respects. It is possible that the observer has already noticed all of the attributes that are shared and any other attributes will be distinct. Argument from analogy is an unreliable method of reasoning that can lead to erroneous conclusions, and thus cannot be used to establish scientific facts.

Occam's razor, sometimes referred to as "ontological parsimony", is roughly stated as: Given a choice between two theories, the simplest is the best. This suggestion commonly is attributed to  William of Ockham in the 14th-century, although it probably predates him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20341">[[Daniel Dennett]]'s '''multiple drafts model of consciousness''' is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] theory of [[consciousness]] based upon [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], which views the [[mind]] in terms of [[information processing]]. The theory is described in depth in his book, ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'', published in 1991. As the title states, the book proposes a high-level explanation of consciousness which is consistent with support for the possibility of [[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI.]]

Dennett describes the theory as ''first-person [[operationalism]]''. As he states it:
{{quote|The Multiple Drafts model makes [the procedure of] "writing it down" in memory criterial for consciousness: that is ''what it is'' for the "given" to be "taken" ... There is no reality of conscious experience independent of the effects of various vehicles of content on subsequent action (and hence, of course, on memory).&lt;ref name="dennett1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel, C. |title=Consciousness Explained |year=1991 |publisher=Little, Brown &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The thesis of multiple drafts==
Dennett's thesis is that our modern understanding of consciousness is unduly influenced by the ideas of [[René Descartes]]. To show why, he starts with a description of the [[color phi phenomenon|phi illusion]]. In this experiment, two different coloured lights, with an angular separation of a few degrees at the eye, are flashed in succession. If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so, the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light. Furthermore, the light seems to change colour as it moves across the visual field. A green light will appear to turn red as it seems to move across to the position of a red light. Dennett asks how we could see the light change colour ''before'' the second light is observed.

Dennett claims that conventional explanations of the colour change boil down to either ''Orwellian'' or ''Stalinesque'' hypotheses, which he says are the result of Descartes' continued influence on our vision of the mind. In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then goes back and changes that memory in light of subsequent events. This is akin to George Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', where records of the past are routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This is akin to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[show trial]]s, where the verdict has been decided in advance and the trial is just a rote presentation.
{{quote|[W]e can suppose, both theorists have ''exactly'' the same theory of what happens in your brain; they agree about just where and when in the brain the mistaken content enters the causal pathways; they just disagree about whether that location is to be deemed pre-experiential or post-experiential. ... [T]hey even agree about how it ought to "feel" to subjects: Subjects should be unable to tell the difference between misbegotten experiences and immediately misremembered experiences. [p. 125, original emphasis.]}}

Dennett argues that there is no principled basis for picking one of these theories over the other, because they share a common error in supposing that there is a special time and place where unconscious processing becomes consciously experienced, entering into what Dennett calls the "[[Cartesian theatre]]". Both theories require us to cleanly divide a sequence of perceptions and reactions into before and after the instant that they reach the seat of consciousness, but he denies that there is any such moment, as it would lead to infinite regress. Instead, he asserts that there is no privileged place in the brain where consciousness happens. Dennett states that, "[t]here does not exist ... a process such as 'recruitment of consciousness' (into what?), nor any place where the 'vehicle's arrival' is recognized (by whom?)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/multdrft.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121095257/http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/multdrft.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 November 2005|title=Multiple Drafts...|date=21 November 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[[Cartesian materialism]] is the view that there is a crucial finish line or boundary somewhere in the brain, marking a place where the order of arrival equals the order of "presentation" in experience because ''what happens there'' is what you are conscious of. ... Many theorists would insist that they have explicitly rejected such an obviously bad idea. But ... the persuasive imagery of the Cartesian Theater keeps coming back to haunt us—laypeople and scientists alike—even after its ghostly dualism has been denounced and exorcized. [p. 107, original emphasis.]}}

With no theatre, there is no screen, hence no reason to re-present data after it has already been analysed. Dennett says that, "the Multiple Drafts model goes on to claim that the brain does not bother 'constructing' any representations that go to the trouble of 'filling in' the blanks. That would be a waste of time and (shall we say?) paint. The judgement is already in so we can get on with other tasks!"

According to the model, there are a variety of sensory inputs from a given event and also a variety of interpretations of these inputs. The sensory inputs arrive in the brain and are interpreted at different times, so a given event can give rise to a succession of discriminations, constituting the equivalent of multiple drafts of a story. As soon as each discrimination is accomplished, it becomes available for eliciting a behaviour; it does not have to wait to be presented at the theatre.

Like a number of other theories, the Multiple Drafts model understands conscious experience as taking time to occur, such that percepts do not instantaneously arise in the mind in their full richness. The distinction is that Dennett's theory denies any clear and unambiguous boundary separating conscious experiences from all other processing. According to Dennett, consciousness is to be found in the actions and flows of information from place to place, rather than some singular view containing our experience. There is no central experiencer who confers a durable stamp of approval on any particular draft.

Different parts of the neural processing assert more or less control at different times. For something to reach consciousness is akin to becoming famous, in that it must leave behind consequences by which it is remembered. To put it another way, consciousness is the property of having enough influence to affect what the mouth will say and the hands will do. Which inputs are "edited" into our drafts is not an exogenous act of supervision, but part of the self-organizing functioning of the network, and at the same level as the circuitry that conveys information bottom-up.

The conscious self is taken to exist as an abstraction visible at the level of the [[intentional stance]], akin to a body of mass having a "centre of gravity". Analogously, Dennett refers to the self as the "centre of narrative gravity", a story we tell ourselves about our experiences. Consciousness exists, but not independently of behaviour and behavioural disposition, which can be studied through [[heterophenomenology]].

The origin of this operationalist approach can be found in Dennett's immediately preceding work. Dennett (1988) explains consciousness in terms of ''access consciousness'' alone, denying the independent existence of what [[Ned Block]] has labeled ''phenomenal consciousness''.&lt;ref name="block1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Block, N. |title=On a confusion about a function of consciousness |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=18 |pages=227–287 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00038188}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that "Everything real has properties, and since I don't deny the reality of conscious experience, I grant that conscious experience has properties". Having related all consciousness to properties, he concludes that they cannot be meaningfully distinguished from our judgements about them. He writes: 
{{quote|The [[infallibilist]] line on [[qualia]] treats them as properties of one's experience one cannot in principle misdiscover, and this is a mysterious doctrine (at least as mysterious as papal infallibility) unless we shift the emphasis a little and treat qualia as logical constructs out of subjects' qualia-judgments: a subject's experience has the quale F if and only if the subject judges his experience to have quale F. We can then treat such judgings as constitutive acts, in effect, bringing the quale into existence by the same sort of license as novelists have to determine the hair color of their characters by fiat. We do not ask how Dostoevski knows that Raskolnikov's hair is light brown.&lt;ref name="dennett2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel C. |title=Quining Qualia |year=1988 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, once we've explained a perception fully in terms of how it affects us, there is nothing left to explain. In particular, there is no such thing as a perception which may be considered in and of itself (a [[quale]]). Instead, the subject's honest reports of how things seem to them are inherently authoritative on how things seem to them, but not on the matter of how things actually are.
{{quote|So when we look one last time at our original characterization of qualia, as ineffable, intrinsic, private, directly apprehensible properties of experience, we find that there is nothing to fill the bill. In their place are relatively or practically ineffable public properties we can refer to indirectly via reference to our private property-detectors—private only in the sense of idiosyncratic. And insofar as we wish to cling to our subjective authority about the occurrence within us of states of certain types or with certain properties, we can have some authority—not infallibility or incorrigibility, but something better than sheer guessing—but only if we restrict ourselves to relational, extrinsic properties like the power of certain internal states of ours to provoke acts of apparent re-identification. So contrary to what seems obvious at first blush, there simply are no qualia at all.&lt;ref name="dennett2"/&gt;}}

The key to the multiple drafts model is that, after removing qualia, explaining consciousness boils down to explaining the behaviour we recognise as conscious. Consciousness is as consciousness does.

==Critical responses==
Some of the criticism of Dennett's theory is due to the perceived tone of his presentation. As one grudging supporter admits, "there is much in this book that is disputable. And Dennett is at times aggravatingly smug and confident about the merits of his arguments ... All in all Dennett's book is annoying, frustrating, insightful, provocative and above all annoying" (Korb 1993).

Bogen (1992) points out that the brain is bilaterally symmetrical. That being the case, if Cartesian materialism is true, there might be ''two'' Cartesian theatres, so arguments against only one are flawed.&lt;ref name="bogen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bogen, J.E. |title=Descartes' fundamental mistake: Introspective singularity |year=1992 |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |issue=15 |pages=184–247 | doi = 10.1017/s0140525x00033914 |volume=17}} Commentary on Daniel C. Dennett and Marcel Kinsbourne (1992) ''Time and the observer: The where and when of consciousness in the brain.''&lt;/ref&gt; Velmans (1992) argues that the phi effect and the [[cutaneous rabbit illusion]] demonstrate that there is a delay whilst modelling occurs and that this delay was discovered by Libet.&lt;ref name="vel"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Velmans, M. |title=Is Consciousness Integrated? |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=15 |pages=229–230 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00068473}}(commentary on Dennett &amp; Kinsbourne "Time and the observer", BBS, 1992, 15(2): 183–201) Copyright Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been claimed that the argument in the multiple drafts model does not support its conclusion.&lt;ref name="bring"&gt;{{cite web |author=Bringsjord, S. |url=http://citeseer.ifi.unizh.ch/bringsjord96explaining.html |title=Explaining Phi Without Dennett's Exotica: Good Ol' Computation Suffices |&lt;!-- accessdate=1996 --&gt;}} {{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Straw man"===
Much of the criticism asserts that Dennett's theory attacks the wrong target, failing to explain what it claims to. Chalmers (1996) maintains that Dennett has produced no more than a theory of how subjects report events.&lt;ref name="chalmers"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chalmers, David |title=The Conscious Mind |year=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some even parody the title of the book as "Consciousness Explained Away", accusing him of [[greedy reductionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3005001 BBC.co.uk] – Some Modern Theories of Consciousness&lt;/ref&gt; Another line of criticism disputes the accuracy of Dennett's characterisations of existing theories:
{{quote|The now standard response to Dennett's project is that he has picked a fight with a [[straw man]]. Cartesian materialism, it is alleged, is an impossibly naive account of phenomenal consciousness held by no one currently working in cognitive science or the philosophy of mind. Consequently, whatever the effectiveness of Dennett's demolition job, it is fundamentally misdirected (see, e.g., Block, 1993, 1995; Shoemaker, 1993; and Tye, 1993).&lt;ref name="bando"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Brien, G.  |author2=Opie, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A defense of Cartesian Materialism |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |volume=59 |pages= 939–63 |doi=10.2307/2653563}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Unoriginality===
Multiple drafts is also attacked for making a claim to novelty. It may be the case, however, that such attacks mistake which features Dennett is claiming as novel. Korb states that, "I believe that the central thesis will be relatively uncontentious for most cognitive scientists, but that its use as a cleaning solvent for messy puzzles will be viewed less happily in most quarters." (Korb 1993) In this way, Dennett uses uncontroversial ideas towards more controversial ends, leaving him open to claims of unoriginality when uncontroversial parts are focused upon.

Even the notion of consciousness as drafts is not unique to Dennett. According to Hankins, Dieter Teichert suggests that [[Paul Ricoeur]]'s theories agree with Dennett's on the notion that "the self is basically a narrative entity, and that any attempt to give it a free-floating independent status is misguided." [Hankins] Others see [[Derrida]]'s (1982) representationalism as consistent with the notion of a mind that has perceptually changing content without a definitive present instant.&lt;ref name="derrida"&gt;{{cite book |author=Derrida, J. |title=Margins of Philosophy |publisher=The University of Chicago Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To those who believe that consciousness entails something more than behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as [[eliminativism|eliminativist]], since it denies the existence of [[qualia]] and the possibility of [[philosophical zombie]]s. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate: whether what we think of when we speak of perceptions and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.

===Information processing and consciousness===
The role of information processing in consciousness has been criticised by [[John Searle]] who, in his [[Chinese room]] argument,&lt;ref name="searle"&gt;Searle, J. (1980) "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070611104618/http://members.aol.com/NeoNoetics/MindsBrainsPrograms.html Minds, Brains and Programs]"&lt;/ref&gt; states that he cannot find anything that could be recognised as conscious experience in a system that relies solely on motions of things from place to place. Dennett sees this argument as misleading, arguing that consciousness is not to be found in a specific part of the system, but in the actions of the whole. In essence, he denies that consciousness requires something in addition to capacity for behaviour, saying that philosophers such as Searle, "just can't imagine how understanding could be a property that emerges from lots of distributed quasi-understanding in a large system" (p.&amp;nbsp;439).

==Definition==
Suppose that {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a [[compact space]] of [[Hausdorff dimension]] {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which is an element of a scale of compact spaces embedded in each other and parametrized by {{math|''t''}} ({{math|0 &lt; ''t'' &lt; ∞}}). Such scales are considered ''equivalent'' with respect to {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} if the compact spaces constituting them coincide for {{math|''t'' ≥ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. It is said that the compact space {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the ''hole'' in this equivalent set of scales, and {{math|−''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the negative dimension of the corresponding equivalence class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://static-content.springer.com/lookinside/art%3A10.1134%2FS0001434607010166/000.png|doi=10.1134/S0001434607010166|title=General notion of a topological space of negative dimension and quantization of its density|journal=Mathematical Notes|volume=81|pages=140|year=2007|last1=Maslov|first1=V. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
By the 1940s, the science of topology had developed and studied a thorough basic theory of topological spaces of positive dimension. Motivated by computations, and to some extent aesthetics, topologists searched
for mathematical frameworks that extended our notion of space to allow for negative dimensions. Such dimensions, as well as the [[Four-dimensional space|fourth]] and higher dimensions, are hard to imagine since we are not able to directly observe them. It wasn’t until the 1960s that a special topological framework was constructed—the category of [[Spectrum (topology)|spectra]]. A spectrum is a generalization of space that allows for negative dimensions. The concept of negative-dimensional spaces is applied, for example, to analyze [[Outline of linguistics|linguistic statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=math/0612543 |last1= Maslov |first1= V.

'''Negative capability''' was a phrase first used by  [[Romantic poet]] [[John Keats]] in 1817 to characterise the capacity of the greatest writers (particularly Shakespeare) to pursue a vision of artistic beauty even when it leads them into intellectual confusion and uncertainty, as opposed to a preference for philosophical certainty over artistic beauty.  The term has been used by poets and philosophers to describe the ability of the individual to perceive, think, and operate beyond any presupposition of a predetermined capacity of the human being.{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason=no citation offered.}}

==Keats: The poet's turn of phrase==
Keats used the phrase only briefly in a private letter, and it became known only after his correspondence was collected and published.  In a letter to his brothers, George and Thomas, on 21 December 1817, Keats described a conversation he had been engaged in a few days previously:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Li|first=Ou|title=Keats and Negative Capability|year=2009|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I had not a dispute but a disquisition with [[Charles Wentworth Dilke|Dilke]], upon various subjects; several things dove-tailed in my mind, and at once it struck me what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, especially in Literature, and which [[Shakespeare]] possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason—Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keats | first = John | title = The Complete Poetical Works and Letters of John Keats, Cambridge Edition | publisher = Houghton, Mifflin and Company | year = 1899 | page=277| isbn = 978-1-146-96754-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] was, by 1817, a frequent target of criticism by the younger poets of Keats's generation, often ridiculed for his infatuation with German idealistic philosophy.  Against Coleridge's obsession with philosophical truth, Keats sets up the model of Shakespeare, whose poetry articulated various points of view and never advocated a particular vision of truth.

Keats's ideas here, as was usually the case in his letters, were expressed tersely with no effort to fully expound what he meant, but passages from other letters enlarge on the same theme.  In a letter to J.H. Reynolds in February, 1818, he wrote:  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us—and if we do not agree, seems to put its hand in its breeches pocket. Poetry should be great &amp; unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself but with its subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keats | first = John | title = The Complete Poetical Works and Letters of John Keats, Cambridge Edition | publisher = Houghton, Mifflin and Company | year = 1899 | page=314| isbn = 978-1-146-96754-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another letter to Reynolds the following May, he contrived the metaphor of 'the chamber of maiden thought' and the notion of the 'burden of mystery', which together express much the same idea as that of negative capability:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I compare human life to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, the doors of the rest being as yet shut upon me—The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think—We remain there a long while, and notwithstanding the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of the thinking principle—within us—we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one's vision into the heart and nature of Man—of convincing ones nerves that the World is full of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness, and oppression—whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken'd and at the same time on all sides of it many doors are set open—but all dark—all leading to dark passages—We see not the balance of good and evil.  We are in a Mist—We are now in that state—We feel the 'burden of the Mystery,' To this point was Wordsworth come, as far as I can conceive when he wrote 'Tintern Abbey' and it seems to me that his Genius is explorative of those dark Passages.  Now if we live, and go on thinking, we too shall explore them.  he is a Genius and superior to us, in so far as he can, more than we, make discoveries, and shed a light in them—Here I must think Wordsworth is deeper than Milton[.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keats | first = John | title = The Complete Poetical Works and Letters of John Keats, Cambridge Edition | publisher = Houghton, Mifflin and Company | year = 1899 | page=326| isbn = 978-1-146-96754-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Keats understood Coleridge as searching for a single, higher-order truth or solution to the mysteries of the natural world. He went on to find the same fault in Dilke and Wordsworth. All these poets, he claimed, lacked objectivity and universality in their view of the human condition and the natural world. In each case, Keats found a mind which was a narrow private path, not a "thoroughfare for all thoughts". Lacking for Keats were the central and indispensable qualities requisite for flexibility and openness to the world, or what he referred to as negative capability.&lt;ref&gt;Wigod, Jacob D. 1952. "Negative Capability and Wise Passiveness." PMLA 67 (4) (1 June): 384–386&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept of Negative Capability is precisely a rejection of set philosophies and preconceived systems of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, N. (1966). Negative Capability in Keats's Diction. Keats-Shelley Journal, 15, 59-68. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/30209856&lt;/ref&gt; He demanded that the poet be receptive rather than searching for fact or reason, and to not seek absolute knowledge of every truth, mystery, or doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Goellnicht, Donald. "Negative Capability and Wise Passiveness" MA Thesis. (McMaster University, 1976), 5, 11–12. http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/opendissertations/4675.
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known why Keats settled on the phrase 'negative capability', but some scholars have hypothesized that Keats was influenced in his studies of medicine and chemistry, and that it refers to the [[electric polarity|negative pole]] of an [[electric current]] which is passive and receptive. In the same way that the negative pole receives the current from the positive pole, the poet receives impulses from a world that is full of mystery and doubt, which cannot be explained but which the poet can translate into art.&lt;ref&gt;Goellnicht, Donald. "Negative Capability and Wise Passiveness" MA Thesis. (McMaster University, 1976), 13. http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/opendissertations/4675.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unger: The thesis of negative capability==
[[Roberto Unger]] appropriated Keats' term in order to explain resistance to rigid social divisions and hierarchies. For Unger, ''negative capability'' is the "denial of whatever in our contexts delivers us over to a fixed scheme of division and hierarchy and to an enforced choice between routine and rebellion." It is thus through ''negative capability'' that we can further empower ourselves against social and institutional constraints, and loosen the bonds that entrap us in a certain social station.&lt;ref name="fn"&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=279–280, 632| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of negative capability can be seen at work in industrial innovation. In order to create an innovator's advantage and develop new forms of economic enterprise, the modern industrialist could not just become more efficient with surplus extraction based on pre-existing work roles, but rather needed to invent new styles of flexible labor, expertise, and capital management. The industrialist needed to bring people together in new and innovative ways and redefine work roles and workplace organization. The modern factory had to at once stabilize its productive environment by inventing new restraints upon labor, such as length of the work day and division of tasks, but at the same time could not be too severe or risk being at a disadvantage to competitors, e.g. not being able to shift production tasks or capacity. Those industrialists and managers who were able to break old forms of organizational arrangements exercised negative capability.&lt;ref name="fn 299"&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=299–301| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This thesis of ''negative capability'' is a key component in Unger's theory of [[false necessity]] and [[formative context]]. The theory of false necessity claims that our social worlds are the artifact of our own human endeavors. There is no pre-set institutional arrangement that our societies adhere to, and there is no necessary historical mold of development that they will follow. Rather we are free to choose and develop the forms and the paths that our societies will take through a process of conflicts and resolutions. However, there are groups of institutional arrangements that work together to bring out certain institutional forms, liberal democracy, for example. These forms are the basis of a social structure, and which Unger calls formative contexts. In order to explain how we move from one formative context to another without the conventional social theory constraints of historical necessity (e.g. feudalism to capitalism), and to do so while remaining true to the key insight of individual human empowerment and [[anti-necessitarian social thought]], Unger recognized that there are an infinite number of ways of resisting social and institutional constraints, which can lead to an infinite number of outcomes. This variety of forms of resistance and [[empowered democracy|empowerment]] (i.e. negative capability) make change possible.&lt;ref name="fn 35"&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=35–36, 164, 169, 278–80, 299–301| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This thesis of ''negative capability'' addresses the problem of [[agency (sociology)|agency]] in relation to [[social structure|structure]]. It recognizes the constraints of structure and its molding influence upon the individual, but at the same time finds the individual able to resist, deny, and transcend their context. Unlike other theories of [[structure and agency]], ''negative capability'' does not reduce the individual to a simple actor possessing only the dual capacity of compliance or rebellion, but rather sees him as able to partake in a variety of activities of self empowerment.&lt;ref name="fn 282"&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=282| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bion==
The twentieth-century British psychoanalyst [[Wilfred Bion]] elaborated on Keats's term to illustrate an attitude of openness of mind which he considered of central importance, not only in the psychoanalytic session, but in life itself.&lt;ref&gt;Joan and Neville Symington, ''The Clinical Thinking of Wilfrid Bion'' (1996) p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; For Bion, negative capability was the ability to tolerate the pain and confusion of not knowing, rather than imposing ready-made or omnipotent certainties upon an ambiguous situation or emotional challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Meg Harris Williams, ''The Aesthetic Development'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; His idea has been taken up more widely in the British Independent School,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 10 and p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt; as well as elsewhere in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychoanalysisdownunder.com.au/issues/8/papers/106]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the context of Zen ==
The notion of negative capability has been associated with the Zen philosophy.  Keats' man of negative capability had qualities that enabled him to "lose his self-identity, his 'imaginative identification' with and submission to things, and his power to achieve a unity with life". The Zen concept of [[satori]] is the outcome of passivity and receptivity, culminating in "sudden insight into the character of the real".  Satori is reached without deliberate striving. The antecedent stages to satori: quest, search, ripening and explosion. The "quest" stage is accompanied by a strong feeling of uneasiness, resembling the capacity to practice negative capability while the mind is in a state of "uncertainties, mysteries and doubts". In the explosive stage (akin to Keats' 'chief intensity'), a man of negative capability effects a "fellowship with essence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benton|first=R. P.|date=1966|title=Keats and Zen. Philosophy East and West|url=|journal=Philosophy East and West, 16(1/2), pp. 33–47|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Stanley Fish]] has expressed strong reservations about the attempt to apply the concept of negative capability to social contexts. He has written in critique of Unger's early work as being unable to chart a route for the idea to pass into reality, which leaves history closed and the individual holding onto the concept while kicking against air. Fish finds the capability Unger invokes in his early works unimaginable and unmanufacturable that can only be expressed outright in blatant speech, or obliquely in concept.&lt;ref&gt;S. Fish, "Unger and Milton", in ''Doing What Comes Naturally'' (1989): 430&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, Fish finds the idea of radical culture as an oppositional ideal in which context is continuously refined or rejected impracticable at best, and impossible at worst.&lt;ref&gt;H. Avram Veeser ed., ''The Stanley Fish Reader'' (Oxford 1999) p.216-7&lt;/ref&gt; Unger has addressed these criticisms by developing a full theory of historical process in which negative capability is employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NELF-A subunit is encoded by the gene [[WHSC2]] (Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 2).

NELF binds in a stable complex with [[DSIF]] and RNA polymerase II together, but not with either alone.  [[P-TEFb]] (positive transcription elongation factor b) inhibits the effect of NELF and DSIF on Pol II elongation, via its phosphorylation of [[serine]]-2 of the C-terminal domain of Pol II, and the SPT5 subunit of DSIF, causing dissociation of NELF.&lt;ref name=narita2003 /&gt;  NELF homologues exist in some [[metazoan]]s (e.g. insects and vertebrates) but have not been found in plants, yeast, or nematode (worms).&lt;ref name=narita2003 /&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[File:Negative room.png|thumb|Schematic of a network of rooms where air (shown in blue) flows in one direction from the corridor into the negative pressure room (green). Exhaust air is safely removed from the area through a ventilation system.]]
[[vacuum|Negative pressure]] is generated and maintained by a ventilation system that removes more exhaust air from the room than air is allowed into the room. Air is allowed into the room through a gap under the door (typically about one half-inch high). Except for this gap, the room should be as airtight as possible, allowing no air in through cracks and gaps, such as those around windows, light fixtures and electrical outlets. Leakage from these sources can compromise or eliminate room negative pressure.&lt;ref name="camil"/&gt;

==Smoke test==
A [[smoke testing (mechanical)#Infectious disease control|smoke test]] can help determine whether a room is under negative pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc.state.mn.us/DocPolicy2/Document/500.522.htm Title: Negative Pressure Isolation Rooms], Minnesota Department of Corrections, Issue date 2007-07-03. Retrieved 2010-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  A tube containing smoke is held near the bottom of the negative pressure room door, about 2 inches in front of the door. The smoke tube is held parallel to the door, and a small amount of smoke is then generated by gently squeezing the bulb. Care is taken to release the smoke from the tube slowly to ensure the velocity of the smoke from the tube does not overpower the air velocity. If the room is at negative pressure, the smoke will travel under the door and into the room. If the room is not a negative pressure, the smoke will be blown outward or will stay stationary.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}

In [[western astrology|astrology]], a '''negative''', '''ceptive''', '''dispassive''', '''yin''', '''nocturnal''' or '''feminine''' sign refers to any of the six even-numbered signs of the [[zodiac]]: [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]], [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]], [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] or [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]].

These signs constitute the [[earth sign|earth]] and [[water sign|water]] [[triplicity|triplicities]].

==Introduction to signs==
In astrology there are two groups: positive and negative. These two groups also
include six individual signs that are called zodiac signs. The negative signs associated
with the zodiac are Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces. The positive
signs associated with the zodiac are Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and
Aquarius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Rooij|first=Jan J. F.|title=Introversion-Extraversion: astrology versus psychology|journal=Department of Psychology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands|date=1993|volume=16|issue=6|pages=985–988|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886994902437|accessdate=November 3, 2011|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(94)90243-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The twelve signs are divided into two
groups based upon one's exact time and place of birth. The negative and positive signs
alternate, starting with Aries as positive and Taurus as negative and continuing this pattern through the list of zodiac signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Emerson|first=Michael|title=History of Astrology-Origins and Beginnings|url=http://www.astrology-insight.com/astrologyinformation.htm|publisher=Astrology insight|accessdate=December 5, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202075959/http://www.astrology-insight.com/astrologyinformation.htm|archivedate=December 2, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different types of sign terminology==
The signs negative and positive are referred to as a negative-sunsign or a
positive-sunsign. There are many terms used in astrology to differentiate the
two groups. In Chinese astrology, the two groups are categorized as yin and yang, corresponding respectively to negative and positive.  Standen explains that different astrologers may refer to signs by different names. For example, an astrologer may refer to positive signs as masculine and negative signs as feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raaj Sudhanshu|first=Rajendra|title=Positive &amp; Negative Sign|url=http://www.subhanshu.com/astrology/positive-negative-sign.htm|publisher=Subhanshu.com|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each sign is divided into two main
types: active and passive. As a general rule, the active type will be called masculine and the passive type will be called feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Standen|first=Anthony|title=Is There An Astrological Effect On Personality|journal=The Journal of Psychology|date=1975|volume=89|issue=2|pages=259–260|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/vjrl20|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative Zodiacs==
Zodiac signs associated with the negative are Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces. Note that there is no value judgment attached to the terms negative or positive. They may be likened to polarities in a magnet: one side is positive and one side is negative. Neither side is "good" nor "bad"—they are merely different.

==The “Sunsign Effect”==
The sunsign effect is a pattern of alternating high and low extraversion-scores for
the 12 signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Rooij|first=Jan J. F.|title=Introversion-Extraversion: astrology versus psychology|journal=Department of Psychology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands|date=1993|volume=16|issue=6|pages=985–988|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886994902437|accessdate=November 3, 2011|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(94)90243-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introvert is a person who gains energy when alone and spends it when with other people. Extravert is a person who gains energy from socialization, expending it when alone. Jan J.F. van Rooij did an experiment on Introversion-Extraversion: astrology
versus psychology, to see if those in the negative sunsign were introverted and those in
the positive sunsign were negative. Van Rooijs did this experiment on those with
astrological knowledge and on those with no astrological knowledge. His results showed
that negative sunsign people are not that responsive to the outer world and are
accordingly not influenced that easily by astrological information. They rely more on
their own ideas and feelings, thus proving his point that people who are born with the
negative sunsign are introverted, and those born with the positive sunsign are
extroverted.

==Element Associated with negative signs==
Earth and Water are the elements attached to those who are in the negative sign.
Earth is the element of Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. Water is the element of Cancer,
Scorpio, and Pisces. Elements are the basic traits of the signs. They reveal the
fundamental aspects of the personality.
“Water signs are attuned to waves of emotion, and often seem to have a built-in
sonar for reading a mood. This gives them a special sensitivity in relationships, knowing
when to show warmth and when to hold back. At their best, they are a healing force that
bring people together -- at their worst, they are psychic vampires, able to manipulate
and drain the life force of the closest to them”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Molly|title=The Water Element|url=http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=December 1, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017135609/http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|archivedate=October 17, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall explains that water signs are
more in tune with their emotions and are comfortable showing them. Water signs bring a
certain presence to a situation; they seek out the problem and fix it.
“Earth signs are sensual, meaning they engage with life through the five senses.
It takes time to sense the dense physical world, and earth signs can operate at a slower,
more thorough pace than the other elements. Theyʼre oriented toward whatʼs real, and
often this makes them very productive, able to create tangible results.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Molly|title=The Water Element|url=http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=December 1, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017135609/http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|archivedate=October 17, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Earth signs are described by Hall as earthy people. These signs focus on the things
that connect us to the earth: things which bring peace, as opposed to focusing on the material world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12822">'''Negative thermal expansion''' (NTE) is an unusual [[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] process in which some materials contract upon heating, rather than expand as most other materials do. Materials which undergo NTE have a range of potential [[engineering]], [[photonics|photonic]], [[Electronics|electronic]], and [[structural]] applications. For example, if one were to mix a '''negative thermal expansion''' material with a "normal" material which expands on heating, it could be possible to make a zero expansion [[composite material]].

== Origin of negative thermal expansion ==

There are a number of physical processes which may cause contraction with increasing temperature, including transverse vibrational modes, [[Rigid Unit Modes]] and [[phase transitions]].

Recently, Liu et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2011.07.001|title=Origin of negative thermal expansion phenomenon in solids|year=2011|last1=Liu|first1=Zi-Kui|last2=Wang|first2=Yi|last3=Shang|first3=Shun-Li|journal=Scripta Materialia|volume=65|issue=8|pages=664–667}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the NTE phenomenon originates from the existence of high pressure, small volume configurations with higher entropy, with their configurations present in the stable phase matrix through thermal fluctuations. They were able to predict both the colossal positive thermal expansion (In cerium) and zero and infinite negative thermal expansion (in {{chem|Fe|3|Pt}}) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep07043|pmid=25391631|pmc=4229665|title=Thermal Expansion Anomaly Regulated by Entropy|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=4|pages=7043|year=2014|last1=Liu|first1=Zi-Kui|last2=Wang|first2=Yi|last3=Shang|first3=Shunli|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E7043L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative thermal expansion in close-packed systems ==

Negative thermal expansion is usually observed in non-close-packed systems with directional interactions (e.g. [[ice]], [[graphene]], etc.) and complex compounds (e.g. {{Chem|Cu|2|O}}, {{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}, beta-quartz, some zeolites, etc.). However, in a paper,&lt;ref name=Rechtsman&gt;{{Citation
 | title =Negative thermal expansion in single-component systems with isotropic interactions

The following sufficient condition for potential giving rise to NTE behavior is proposed:

&lt;math&gt;
    \Pi'''(a) &gt;  0,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Pi &lt;/math&gt; is pair [[interatomic potential]], &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium distance. This condition is (i) necessary and sufficient in 1D and (ii) sufficient, but not necessary in 2D and 3D. ''An approximate'' necessary and sufficient condition is derived in a paper&lt;ref name=Kuzkin&gt;{{Citation
 | title = Comment on 'Negative Thermal Expansion in Single-Component Systems with Isotropic Interactions'
 | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry A
 | volume = 118

&lt;math&gt;
    \Pi'''(a)a &gt; -(d-1)\Pi''(a),
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; is the space dimensionality. Thus in 2D and 3D negative thermal expansion in close-packed systems with pair interactions is realized even when the third derivative of the potential is zero or even negative. Note that one-dimensional and multidimensional cases are qualitatively different. In 1D thermal expansion is cased by anharmonicity of [[interatomic potential]] only. Therefore, the sign of thermal expansion coefficient is determined by the sign of the third derivative of the potential. In multidimensional case the geometrical nonlinearity is also present, i.e. lattice vibrations are nonlinear even in the case of harmonic interatomic potential. This nonlinearity contributes to thermal expansion. Therefore, in multidimensional case both &lt;math&gt;\Pi''&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi'''&lt;/math&gt; are present in the condition for negative thermal expansion.

== Applications ==

There are many potential applications for materials with controlled thermal expansion properties, as thermal expansion causes many problems in engineering, and indeed in everyday life. One simple example of a thermal expansion problem is the tendency of [[dental fillings]] to expand by an amount different from the [[teeth]], for example when drinking a hot drink, causing [[toothache]]. If dental fillings were made of a [[composite material]] containing a mixture of materials with positive and negative thermal expansion then the overall expansion could be precisely tailored to that of [[tooth enamel]].

== Materials ==

Perhaps one of the most studied materials to exhibit ''negative thermal expansion'' is '''[[zirconium tungstate]]''' ({{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}).

[[Rubber elasticity]] shows NTE at normal temperatures, but the reason for the effect is rather different from that in most other materials.

Cubic [[Scandium trifluoride]] has this property which is explained by the quartic oscillation of the fluoride ions. The energy stored in the bending strain of the fluoride ion is proportional to the fourth power of the displacement angle, unlike most other materials where it is proportional to the square of the displacement. A fluorine atom is bound to two scandium atoms, and as temperature increases the fluorine oscillates more perpendicularly to its bonds. This draws the scandium atoms together throughout the material and it contracts.&lt;ref name="woo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-11-incredible-material-reveal-scandium-trifluoride.html|title=An incredible shrinking material: Engineers reveal how scandium trifluoride contracts with heat|last=Woo|first=Marcus|date=7 November 2011|publisher=Physorg|accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{chem|Sc|F|3}} exhibits this property from 10 to 1100 K above which it shows the normal positive thermal expansion.&lt;ref name="greve"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greve|first=Benjamin K.|author2=Kenneth L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10016">Nearly 78 years have passed since Paul L. Dysart, Jr. invented the Negative Volume Index and Positive Volume Index indicators. The indicators remain useful to identify primary market trends and reversals.

In 1936, Paul L. Dysart, Jr. began accumulating two series of advances and declines distinguished by whether volume was greater or lesser than the prior day's volume. He called the cumulative series for the days when volume had been greater than the prior day's volume the Positive Volume Index (PVI), and the series for the days when volume had been lesser the Negative Volume Index (NVI).

A native of Iowa, Dysart worked in Chicago's LaSalle Street during the 1920s. After giving up his [[Chicago Board of Trade]] membership, he published an advisory letter geared to short-term trading using advance-decline data. In 1933, he launched the ''Trendway'' weekly stock market letter and published it until 1969 when he died. Dysart also developed the 25-day Plurality Index, the 25-day total of the absolute difference between the number of advancing issues and the number of declining issues, and was a pioneer in using several types of volume of trading studies. Richard Russell, editor of Dow Theory Letters, in his January 7, 1976 letter called Dysart "one of the most brilliant of the pioneer market technicians."

==Dysart’s NVI and PVI==
The daily volume of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the NYSE Composite Index's advances and declines drove Dysart's indicators. Dysart believed that “volume is the driving force in the market.” He began studying market breadth numbers in 1931, and was familiar with the work of Leonard P. Ayres and James F. Hughes, who pioneered the tabulation of advances and declines to interpret stock market movements.

Dysart calculated NVI as follows: 1) if today's volume is less than yesterday's volume, subtract declines from advances, 2) add the difference to the cumulative NVI beginning at zero, and 3) retain the current NVI reading for the days when volume is greater than the prior day's volume. He calculated PVI in the same manner but for the days when volume was greater than the prior day's volume. NVI and PVI can be calculated daily or weekly.

Initially, Dysart believed that PVI would be the more useful series, but in 1967, he wrote that NVI had “proved to be the most valuable of all the breadth indexes.” He relied most on NVI, naming it AMOMET, the acronym of “'''A''' '''M'''easure '''O'''f '''M'''ajor '''E'''conomic '''T'''rend.”

Dysart's theory, expressed in his 1967 Barron's article, was that “if volume advances and prices move up or down in accordance [with volume], the move is assumed to be a good movement - if it is sustained when the volume subsides.” In other words, after prices have moved up on positive volume days, "if prices stay up when the volume subsides for a number of days, we can say that such a move is 'good'." If the market “holds its own on negative volume days after advancing on positive volume, the market is in a strong position.”

He called PVI the “majority” curve. Dysart distinguished between the actions of the “majority” and those of the “minority.” The majority tends to emulate the minority, but its timing is not as sharp as that of the minority. When the majority showed an appetite for stocks, the PVI was usually “into new high ground” as happened in 1961.

It is said that the two indicators assume that "smart" money is traded on quiet days (low volume) and that the crowd trades on very active days. Therefore, the negative volume index picks out days when the volume is lower than on the previous day, and the positive index picks out days with a higher volume.

==Dysart’s Interpretation of NVI and PVI==
Besides an article he wrote for Barron's in 1967, not many of Dysart's writings are available. What can be interpreted about Dysart's NVI is that whenever it rises above a prior high, and the DJIA is trending up, a “Bull Market Signal” is given. When the NVI falls below a prior low, and the DJIA is trending down, a “Bear Market Signal” is given. The PVI is interpreted in reverse.
However, not all movements above or below a prior NVI or PVI level generate signals, as Dysart also designated “bullish” and “bearish penetrations.” These penetrations could occur before or after a Bull or Bear Market Signal, and at times were called “reaffirmations” of a signal. In 1969, he articulated one rule: “signals are most authentic when the NVI has moved sideways for a number of months in a relatively narrow range.” Dysart cautioned that “there is no mathematical system devoid of judgment which will continuously work without error in the stock market.”

According to Dysart, between 1946 and 1967, the NVI “rendered 17 significant signals,” of which 14 proved to be right (an average of 4.32% from the final high or low) and 3 wrong (average loss of 6.33%). However, NVI “seriously erred” in 1963-1964 and in 1968, which concerned him. In 1969, Dysart reduced the weight he had previously given to the NVI in his analyses because NVI was no longer a “decisive” indicator of the primary trend, although it retained an “excellent ability to give us ‘leading’ indications of short-term trend reversals.”

A probable reason for the NVI losing its efficacy during the mid-1960s may have been the steadily higher NYSE daily volume due to the dramatic increase in the number of issues traded so that prices rose on declining volume. Dysart’s NVI topped out in 1955 and trended down until at least 1968, although the DJIA moved higher during that period.
Norman G. Fosback has attributed the “long term increase in the number of issues traded” as a reason for a downward bias in a cumulative advance-decline line. Fosback was the next influential technician in the story of NVI and PVI.

==Fosback’s Variations==
Fosback studied NVI and PVI and in 1976 reported his findings in his classic Stock Market Logic. He did not elucidate on the indicators’ background or mentioned Dysart except for saying that “in the past Negative Volume Indexes have always [his emphasis] been constructed using advance-decline data….” He posited, “There is no good reason for this fixation on the A/D Line. In truth, a Negative Volume Index can be calculated with any market index - the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500, or even ‘unweighted’ market measures.... Somehow this point has escaped the attention of technicians to date.”

The point had not been lost on Dysart, who wrote in Barron’s, “we prefer to use the issues-traded data [advances and declines] rather than the price data of any average because it is more all-encompassing, and more truly represents what’s happening in the entire market.” Dysart was a staunch proponent of using advances and declines.

Fosback made three variations to NVI and PVI:

1. He cumulated the daily percent change in the market index rather than the difference between advances and declines. On negative volume days, he calculated the price change in the index from the prior day and added it to the most recent NVI. His calculations are as follows:

If C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; denote the closing prices of today and yesterday, respectively, the NVI for today is calculated by

* adding NVI&lt;sub&gt;yesterday&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; - C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) / C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; to yesterday's NVI if today's volume is lower than yesterday's, adding zero otherwise,

and the PVI is calculated by:

* adding PVI&lt;sub&gt;yesterday&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; - C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) / C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; to yesterday's PVI if today's volume is higher than yesterday's, adding zero otherwise.

2. He suggested starting the cumulative count at a base index level such as 100.

3. He derived buy or sell signals by whether the NVI or PVI was above or below its one-year moving average.

Fosback's versions of NVI and PVI are what are popularly described in books and posted on Internet financial sites. Often reported are his findings that whenever NVI is above its one-year [[moving average (finance)|moving average]] there is a 96% (PVI - 79%) probability that a bull market is in progress, and when it is below its one-year moving average, there is a 53% (PVI - 67%) probability that a bear market is in place. These results were derived using a 1941-1975 test period. Modern tests might reveal different probabilities.

Today, NVI and PVI are commonly associated with Fosback's versions, and Dysart, their inventor, is forgotten. It cannot be said that one version is better than the other. While Fosback provided a more objective interpretation of these indicators, Dysart's versions offer value to identify primary trends and short-term trend reversals.

Although some traders use Fosback's NVI and PVI to analyze individual stocks, the indicators were created to track, and have been tested, on major market indexes. NVI was Dysart's most invaluable breadth index, and Fosback found that his version of “the Negative Volume Index is an excellent indicator of the primary market trend.” Traders can benefit from both innovations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9632">'''Pontryagin's maximum (or minimum) principle''' is used in [[optimal control]] theory to find the best possible control for taking a [[dynamical system]] from one state to another, especially in the presence of constraints for the state or input controls. It was formulated in 1956 by the Russian mathematician [[Lev Pontryagin]] and his students.&lt;ref&gt;See ref. below for first published work.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has as a special case the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] of the [[calculus of variations]].

The principle states, informally, that the ''control Hamiltonian'' must take an extreme value over controls in the set of all permissible controls. Whether the extreme value is maximum or minimum depends both on the problem and on the sign convention used for defining the Hamiltonian. The normal convention, which is the one used in [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]], leads to a maximum hence ''maximum principle'' but the sign convention used in this article makes the extreme value a minimum.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of values of permissible controls then the principle states that the optimal control &lt;math&gt;u^*&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t),t) \leq H(x^*(t),u,\lambda^*(t),t), \quad \forall u \in \mathcal{U}, \quad t \in [t_0, t_f]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x^*\in C^1[t_0,t_f]&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal state trajectory and &lt;math&gt;\lambda^* \in BV[t_0,t_f]&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal [[costate]] trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;More info on [[Smoothness#Order of continuity|C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Bounded variation|BV]] spaces&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was first successfully applied to minimum time problems where the input control is constrained, but it can also be useful in studying state-constrained problems.

Special conditions for the Hamiltonian can also be derived. When the final time &lt;math&gt;t_f&lt;/math&gt; is fixed and the Hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time &lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{\partial H}{\partial t} \equiv 0\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t)) \equiv \mathrm{constant}\,&lt;/math&gt;
and if the final time is free, then:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t)) \equiv 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
More general conditions on the optimal control are given below.

When satisfied along a trajectory, Pontryagin's minimum principle is a [[necessary condition]] for an optimum. The [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation]] provides a [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary and sufficient condition]] for an optimum, but this condition must be satisfied over the whole of the state space.

While the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation admits [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation#Extension to stochastic problems|a straightforward extension]] to stochastic optimal control problems, the minimum principle does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yong|first1=J.|last2=Zhou|first2=X. Y.|title=Stochastic Controls: Hamiltonian Systems and HJB Equations|date=1999|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maximization and minimization==

The principle was first known as ''Pontryagin's maximum principle'' and its proof is historically based on maximizing the Hamiltonian. The initial application of this principle was to the maximization of the terminal speed of a rocket. However, as it was subsequently mostly used for minimization of a performance index it has here been referred to as the ''minimum principle''.  Pontryagin's book solved the problem of minimizing a performance index.&lt;ref&gt;See p.13 of the 1962 book of Pontryagin et al. referenced below.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/math&gt;

==Formal statement of necessary conditions for minimization problem==
Here the necessary conditions are shown for minimization of a functional. Take &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to be the state of the [[dynamical system]] with input &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, such that
:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{x}=f(x,u), \quad x(0)=x_0, \quad u(t) \in \mathcal{U}, \quad t \in
[0,T]
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of admissible controls and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the terminal (i.e., final) time of the system. The control &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; must be chosen for all &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; to minimize the objective functional &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; which is defined by the application and can be abstracted as

:&lt;math&gt;
J=\Psi(x(T))+\int^T_0 L(x(t),u(t)) \,dt
&lt;/math&gt;

The constraints on the system dynamics can be adjoined to the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; by introducing time-varying [[Lagrange multipliers|Lagrange multiplier]] vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, whose elements are called the costates of the system. This motivates the construction of the [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; defined for all &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; by:
:&lt;math&gt;
H(x(t),u(t),\lambda(t),t)=\lambda^{\rm T}(t)f(x(t),u(t))+L(x(t),u(t)) \,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{\rm T}&lt;/math&gt; is the transpose of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

Pontryagin's minimum principle states that the optimal state trajectory &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;, optimal control &lt;math&gt;u^*&lt;/math&gt;, and corresponding Lagrange multiplier vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda^*&lt;/math&gt; must  minimize the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; so that

:&lt;math&gt;
(1) \qquad H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t),t)\leq H(x^*(t),u,\lambda^*(t),t) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

for all time &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; and for all permissible control inputs &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. It must also be the case that

:&lt;math&gt;
(2) \qquad \Psi_T(x(T))+H(T)=0 \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, the [[costate equations]]

:&lt;math&gt;
(3) \qquad -\dot{\lambda}^{\rm T}(t)=H_x(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda(t),t)=\lambda^{\rm T}(t)f_x(x^*(t),u^*(t))+L_x(x^*(t),u^*(t))
&lt;/math&gt;

must be satisfied. If the final state &lt;math&gt;x(T)&lt;/math&gt; is not fixed (i.e., its differential variation is not zero), it must also be that the terminal costates are such that

:&lt;math&gt;
(4) \qquad \lambda^{\rm T}(T)=\Psi_x(x(T)) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

These four conditions in (1)-(4) are the necessary conditions for an optimal control. Note that (4) only applies when &lt;math&gt;x(T)&lt;/math&gt; is free. If it is fixed, then this condition is not necessary for an optimum.

A '''principle''' is a concept or value that is a guide for behavior or evaluation. In [[law]], it is a [[Legal rule|rule]] that has to be or usually is to be followed, or can be desirably followed, or is an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in  nature or the way that a system is constructed. The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Alpa, Guido (1994) [http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/annlsurvey/vol1/iss1/2/ General Principles of Law], ''Annual Survey of International &amp; Comparative Law'', Vol. 1: Is. 1, Article 2. from [[Golden Gate University School of Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; A system may be explicitly based on and implemented from a document of principles as was done in IBM's [[IBM System/360 architecture|360/370]] ''Principles of Operation''.

Examples of principles are, [[entropy (disambiguation)|entropy]] in a number of fields, [[least action]] in physics, those in descriptive comprehensive and fundamental law: [[doctrine]]s or assumptions forming  normative rules of conduct, [[separation of church and state]] in statecraft, the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], [[wikt:fairness|fairness]] in ethics, etc.

In common English, it is a substantive and collective term referring to rule governance, the absence of which, being "unprincipled", is considered a character defect. It may also be used to declare that a reality has diverged from some ideal or norm as when something is said to be true only "in principle" but not in fact.

==As law==
===As moral law===
[[File:Socrates BM GR1973.03-27.16.jpg|thumb|[[Socrates]] preferred to face execution rather than betray his moral principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/socrates.html "The Ethics of Socrates."] ''Philosophy''.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;|upright=0.9]]
{{main|Ethics}}
A principle represents values that orient and rule the conduct of persons in a particular society.  To "act on principle" is to act in accordance with one's moral ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/jeff-flake-transcript-senate-speech.html "Full Transcript: Jeff Flake’s Speech on the Senate Floor."] ''New York Times''.  24 October 2017.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Principles are absorbed in childhood through a process of [[socialization]]. There is a presumption of liberty of individuals that is restrained.  Exemplary principles include [[First, do no harm]], the [[golden rule]] and the [[doctrine of the mean]].

===As a juridic law===
{{Main|Principle of legality}}
It represents a set of values that inspire the written norms that organize the life of a society submitting to the powers of an authority, generally the State. The law establishes a legal obligation, in a coercive way; it therefore acts as principle [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] of the action that limits the liberty of the individuals. See, for examples, the [[territorial principle]], [[homestead principle]], and [[precautionary principle]].

===As scientific law===
[[Archimedes principle]], relating buoyancy to the weight of displaced water, is an early example of a  [[law (principle)|law]] in science. Another early one developed by [[Malthus]] is the ''population principle'', now called the [[Malthusian principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Elwell, Frank W.  [http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/users/f/felwell/www/Theorists/Essays/Malthus1.htm "T. Robert Mathus's Principle ...."] ''Rogers State University''.  2013.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud also wrote on principles, especially the [[reality principle]] necessary to keep the id and [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] in check. Biologists use the [[principle of priority]] and [[principle of Binominal nomenclature]] for precision in naming [[species]]. There are many principles observed in physics, notably in [[cosmology]] which observes the [[mediocrity principle]], the [[anthropic principle]], the [[principle of relativity]] and the [[cosmological principle]]. Other well-known principles include the [[uncertainty principle]] in [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[pigeonhole principle]] and [[superposition principle]] in mathematics.

==As axiom or logical fundament==
===Principle of sufficient reason===
{{Main|Principle of sufficient reason}}
The principle states that every event has a rational explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/ "Principle of Sufficient Reason."] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.  7 September 2016.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following:

:For every entity ''x'', if ''x'' exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''x'' exists.
:For every event ''e'', if ''e'' occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''e'' occurs.
:For every proposition ''p'', if ''p'' is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''p'' is true.

However, one realizes that in every sentence there is a direct relation between the predicate and the subject. To say that "the Earth is round", corresponds to a direct relation between the subject and the predicate.

===Principle of non-contradiction===
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Portrait bust]] of Aristotle; an [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] copy of a lost [[bronze sculpture]] made by [[Lysippos]]]]
{{Main|Law of noncontradiction}}

===Principle of excluded middle===
{{Main|Law of excluded middle}}
The principle of the excluding third or "principium tertium exclusum" is a principle of the traditional logic formulated canonically by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] as: either ''A'' is ''B'' or ''A'' isn't ''B''. It is read the following way: either ''P'' is true, or its denial ¬''P'' is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/AAT3201.0001.001|title=Principia mathematica, by Alfred North Whitehead ... and Bertrand Russell.|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also known as "''tertium non datur''" ('A third (thing) is not). Classically it is considered to be one of the most important fundamental principles or laws of thought (along with the principles of identity, no contradiction and sufficient reason).

In [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[philosophy of language]], the '''principle of compositionality''' is the principle that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them. This principle is also called '''Frege's principle''', because [[Gottlob Frege]] is widely credited for the first modern formulation of it. However, the idea appears already among [[India]]n philosophers of grammar such as [[Yaska|Yāska]], and also in [[Plato]]'s work such as in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
Besides, the principle was never explicitly stated by Frege,&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier, Francis Jeffry. 2001. Did Frege believe Frege’s principle? ''Journal of Logic, Language, and Information'' 10:87–114.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was arguably already assumed by [[George Boole]]&lt;ref&gt;Boole, G. (1854). ''An investigation of the laws of thought: on which are founded the mathematical theories of logic and probabilities''. Walton and Maberly.&lt;/ref&gt; decades before Frege’s work.

==Overview==
The principle of compositionality states that in a meaningful sentence, if the [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] parts are taken out of the sentence, what remains will be the rules of composition. Take, for example, the sentence "Socrates was a man". Once the meaningful lexical items are taken away—"Socrates" and "man"—what is left is the pseudo-sentence, "S was a M". The task becomes a matter of describing what the connection is between S and M.

It is frequently taken to mean that every operation of the [[syntax]] should be associated with an operation of the semantics that acts on the meanings of the constituents combined by the syntactic operation. As a guideline for constructing semantic theories, this is generally taken, as in the influential work on the philosophy of language by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], to mean that every construct of the syntax should be associated by a clause of the [[T-schema]] with an operator in the semantics that specifies how the meaning of the whole expression is built from constituents combined by the syntactic rule. In some general mathematical theories (especially those in the tradition of [[Montague grammar]]), this guideline is taken to mean that the interpretation of a language is essentially given by a [[homomorphism]] between an algebra of syntactic representations and an algebra of semantic objects.

The principle of compositionality also exists in a similar form in the [[Denotational semantics#Compositionality|compositionality of programming languages]].

== Critiques ==

The principle of compositionality has been the subject of intense debate. Indeed, there is no general agreement as to how the principle is to be interpreted, although there have been several attempts to provide formal definitions of it. (Szabó, 2012)

Scholars are also divided as to whether the principle should be regarded as a factual claim, open to [[empirical]] testing; an [[Logical truth|analytic truth]], obvious from the nature of language and meaning; or a [[methodology|methodological]] principle to guide the development of theories of syntax and semantics. The Principle of Compositionality has been attacked in all three spheres, although so far none of the criticisms brought against it have been generally regarded as compelling. Most proponents of the principle, however, make certain exceptions for [[idiomatic]] expressions in natural language. (Szabó, 2012)

Further, in the context of the philosophy of language, the principle of compositionality does not explain all of meaning. For example, you cannot infer [[sarcasm]] purely on the basis of words and their composition, yet a phrase used sarcastically means something completely different from the same phrase uttered straightforwardly. Thus, some theorists argue that the principle has to be revised to take into account linguistic and extralinguistic [[Context principle|context]], which includes the tone of voice used, common ground between the speakers, the intentions of the speaker, and so on. (Szabó, 2012)

:''This article discusses the history of the principle of least action. For the application, please refer to [[action (physics)]].''
The '''principle of least action''' – or, more accurately, the '''principle of stationary action''' – is a [[variational principle]] that, when applied to the [[action (physics)|action]] of a [[mechanics|mechanical]] system, can be used to obtain the [[equations of motion]] for that system. In relativity, a different action must be minimized or maximized. The principle can be used to derive [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] [[equations of motion]], and even [[general relativity]] (see [[Einstein–Hilbert action]]). The physicist Paul Dirac&lt;ref&gt;P.A.M. Dirac, Physikalische Zeitschrift der Sowjetunion, Band 3, Heft 1, 64
(1933). A translated version can be found in; Julian S. Schwinger, Selected Papers on Electrodynamics, Dover Publications Inc.(1958), pp. 312.{{ISBN|9780883076484}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and after him Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman, demonstrated how this principle can also be used in quantum calculations.&lt;ref&gt;R. Feynman, Quantum Mechanics, And Path Integrals, McGraw-Hill Companies (1965), {{ISBN|0070206503}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. J. S. Schwinger, Quantum Kinematics and Dynamics, W. A. Benjamin Publishers (1970), {{ISBN|0738203033}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was historically called "least" because its solution requires finding the path that has the least value.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Chapter 19 of Volume II,  [[Richard Feynman|Feynman R]], [[Robert B. Leighton|Leighton R]], and [[Matthew Sands|Sands M.]] ''The Feynman Lectures on Physics ''. 3 volumes 1964, 1966.

The principle remains central in [[modern physics]] and [[mathematics]], being applied in [[thermodynamics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.aop.2008.04.007 |title=Thermodynamics based on the principle of least abbreviated action: Entropy production in a network of coupled oscillators |journal=Annals of Physics |volume=323 |issue=8 |pages=1844–58 |year=2008 |last1=García-Morales |first1=Vladimir |last2=Pellicer |first2=Julio |last3=Manzanares |first3=José A. |bibcode=2008AnPhy.323.1844G |arxiv=cond-mat/0602186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fluid mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Principle_of_least_action&lt;/ref&gt; the [[theory of relativity]], [[quantum mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1942PhDT.........5F |title=The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics |author1=Feynman |first1=Richard Phillips |year=1942 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[particle physics]], and [[string theory]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/LeastAction.pdf Principle of Least Action - damtp]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a focus of modern mathematical investigation in [[Morse theory]]. [[Maupertuis' principle]] and [[Hamilton's principle]] exemplify the principle of stationary action.

The action principle is preceded by earlier ideas in [[optics]]. In [[ancient Greece]], [[Euclid]] wrote in his ''Catoptrica'' that, for the path of light reflecting from a mirror, the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] equals the [[angle of reflection]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[Hero of Alexandria]] later showed that this path was the shortest length and least time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Scholars often credit [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] for formulating the principle of least action because he wrote about it in 1744&lt;ref name="mau44"&gt;P.L.M. de Maupertuis, ''[[s:fr:Accord de différentes loix de la nature qui avoient jusqu’ici paru incompatibles|Accord de différentes lois de la nature qui avaient jusqu'ici paru incompatibles.]]'' (1744) Mém. As. Sc. Paris p. 417. ([[s:Accord between different laws of Nature that seemed incompatible|English translation]])&lt;/ref&gt; and 1746.&lt;ref name="mau46"&gt;P.L.M. de Maupertuis, ''[[s:fr:Les loix du mouvement et du repos déduites d'un principe metaphysique|Le lois de mouvement et du repos, déduites d'un principe de métaphysique.]]'' (1746) Mém. Ac.

In 1933, [[Paul Dirac]] discerned the [[Path integral formulation#Quantum action principle|quantum mechanical underpinning]] of the principle in the [[Interference (wave propagation)#Quantum interference|quantum interference]] of amplitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dirac |first=Paul A.

==General statement==
[[File:Least action principle.svg|250px|thumb|As the system evolves, '''q''' traces a path through [[configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] (only some are shown). The path taken by the system (red) has a stationary action (''δS'' = 0) under small changes in the configuration of the system (''δ'''''q''').&lt;ref name=penrose&gt;{{cite book |author=R. Penrose| title=[[The Road to Reality]]| publisher= Vintage books| year=2007 | page = 474|isbn=0-679-77631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The starting point is the ''[[action (physics)|action]]'', denoted &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; (calligraphic S), of a physical system. It is defined as the [[integral (mathematics)|integral]] of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] ''L'' between two instants of [[time in physics|time]] ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - technically a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] of the ''N'' [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''q&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'') which define the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{q} : \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}^N &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}[\mathbf{q}, t_1, t_2] 
= \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}(t),\mathbf{\dot{q}}(t), t) dt &lt;/math&gt;

where the dot denotes the [[time derivative]], and ''t'' is time.

Mathematically the principle is&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, {{ISBN|0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Analytical Mechanics 2008"&gt;Analytical Mechanics, L.N. Hand, J.D. Finch, Cambridge University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-521-57572-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathcal{S} = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''δ'' (lowercase Greek [[Delta (letter)|delta]]) means a ''small'' change. In words this reads:&lt;ref name=penrose/&gt;

:''The path taken by the system between times t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and configurations q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the one for which the '''action''' is '''stationary (no change)''' to '''first order'''.''

In applications the statement and definition of action are taken together:&lt;ref&gt;Classical Mechanics, T.W.B. Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw-Hill (UK), 1973, {{ISBN|0-07-084018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}},t) dt = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

The action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term "path" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the coordinates in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).

==Origins, statements, and controversy==

===Fermat===
{{main article|Fermat's principle}}
In the 1600s, [[Pierre de Fermat]] postulated that "''light travels between two given points along the path of shortest time''," which is known as the '''principle of least time''' or '''[[Fermat's principle]]'''.&lt;ref name="Analytical Mechanics 2008"/&gt;

===Maupertuis===
{{main article|Maupertuis principle}}
Credit for the formulation of the '''principle of least action''' is commonly given to [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]], who felt that "Nature is thrifty in all its actions", and applied the principle broadly:

{{quote|The laws of movement and of rest deduced from this principle being precisely the same as those observed in nature, we can admire the application of it to all phenomena. The movement of animals, the vegetative growth of plants ... are only its consequences; and the spectacle of the universe becomes so much the grander, so much more beautiful, the worthier of its Author, when one knows that a small number of laws, most wisely established, suffice for all movements.|Pierre Louis Maupertuis&lt;ref&gt;Chris Davis. [http://www.idlex.freeserve.co.uk/idle/evolution/ref/leastact.html ''Idle theory''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615043538/http://www.idlex.freeserve.co.uk/idle/evolution/ref/leastact.html |date=2006-06-15 }} (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This notion of Maupertuis, although somewhat deterministic today, does capture much of the essence of mechanics.

In application to physics, Maupertuis suggested that the quantity to be minimized was the product of the duration (time) of movement within a system by the "[[vis viva]]",

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|title='''Maupertuis' principle'''
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\delta \int 2T(t)  dt=0&lt;/math&gt;
|border=2
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

which is the integral of twice what we now call the [[kinetic energy]] ''T'' of the system.

===Euler===

[[Leonhard Euler]] gave a formulation of the action principle in 1744, in very recognizable terms, in the ''Additamentum 2'' to his ''Methodus Inveniendi Lineas Curvas Maximi Minive Proprietate Gaudentes''. Beginning with the second paragraph:

{{cquote|Let the mass of the projectile be ''M'', and let its speed be ''v'' while being moved over an infinitesimal distance ''ds''.   The body will have a momentum ''Mv'' that, when multiplied by the distance ''ds'', will give {{nowrap|''Mv'' ''ds''}}, the momentum of the body integrated over the distance ''ds''.  Now I assert that the curve thus described by the body to be the curve (from among all other curves connecting the same endpoints) that minimizes
:&lt;math&gt;\int Mv\,ds&lt;/math&gt;
or, provided that ''M'' is constant along the path,
:&lt;math&gt;M\int v\,ds&lt;/math&gt;.|20px|20px|Leonhard Euler&lt;ref name="eul44" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Euler, [[s:la:Methodus inveniendi/Additamentum II|Additamentum II]] ([http://math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E065h external link]), ibid. ([[https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Translation:Methodus_inveniendi/Additamentum_II&amp;oldid=6399338| English translation]])&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Euler states, ∫''Mv''d''s'' is the integral of the momentum over distance travelled, which, in modern notation, equals the abbreviated or [[reduced action]]

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|title='''Euler's principle'''
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\delta\int p\,dq=0&lt;/math&gt;
|border=2
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

Thus, Euler made an equivalent and (apparently) independent statement of the variational principle in the same year as Maupertuis, albeit slightly later. Curiously, Euler did not claim any priority, as the following episode shows.

===Disputed priority===

Maupertuis' priority was disputed in 1751 by the mathematician [[Samuel König]], who claimed that it had been invented by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in 1707. Although similar to many of Leibniz's arguments, the principle itself has not been documented in Leibniz's works. König himself showed a ''copy'' of a 1707 letter from Leibniz to [[Jacob Hermann (mathematician)|Jacob Hermann]] with the principle, but the ''original'' letter has been lost. In contentious proceedings, König was accused of forgery,&lt;ref name="oco03" /&gt; and even the [[Frederick the Great|King of Prussia]] entered the debate, defending Maupertuis (the head of his Academy), while [[Voltaire]] defended König.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Euler, rather than claiming priority, was a staunch defender of Maupertuis, and Euler himself prosecuted König for forgery before the Berlin Academy on 13 April 1752.&lt;ref name="oco03" /&gt; The claims of forgery were re-examined 150 years later, and archival work by [[C.I. Gerhardt]] in 1898&lt;ref name="ger98" /&gt; and [[W. Kabitz]] in 1913&lt;ref name="kab13" /&gt; uncovered other copies of the letter, and three others cited by König, in the [[Bernoulli family|Bernoulli]] archives.

==Further development==

Euler continued to write on the topic; in his ''Reflexions sur quelques loix generales de la nature'' (1748), he called the quantity "effort". His expression corresponds to what we would now call [[potential energy]], so that his statement of least action in statics is equivalent to the principle that a system of bodies at rest will adopt a configuration that minimizes total potential energy.

===Lagrange and Hamilton===
{{main article|Hamilton's principle}}
Much of the calculus of variations was stated by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] in 1760&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=D. J. Struik|title=A Source Book in Mathematics, 1200-1800|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass|year=1969}} pp. 406-413&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kline|first=Morris|title=Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=1972|isbn=0-19-501496-0}} pp. 582-589&lt;/ref&gt; and he proceeded to apply this to problems in dynamics. In ''Méchanique Analytique'' (1788) Lagrange derived the general [[Lagrangian equations of motion|equations of motion]] of a mechanical body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lagrange|first=Joseph-Louis|title=Mécanique Analytique|year=1788}} p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1834 and 1835&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Hamilton, "On a General Method in Dynamics", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' [http://www.emis.de/classics/Hamilton/GenMeth.pdf Part I (1834) p.247-308]; [http://www.emis.de/classics/Hamilton/SecEssay.pdf Part II (1835) p. 95-144]. (''From the collection [http://www.emis.de/classics/Hamilton/ Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865): Mathematical Papers] edited by David R. Wilkins, School of Mathematics, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland. (2000); also reviewed as [http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Dynamics/ On a General Method in Dynamics]'')&lt;/ref&gt; applied the variational principle to the classical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]

:&lt;math&gt;L=T-V&lt;/math&gt;

to obtain the [[Euler–Lagrange equations]] in their present form.

===Jacobi and Morse===
In 1842, [[Carl Gustav Jacobi]] tackled the problem of whether the variational principle always found minima as opposed to other [[stationary points]] (maxima or stationary [[saddle points]]); most of his work focused on [[geodesics]] on two-dimensional surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;G.C.J. Jacobi, ''Vorlesungen über Dynamik, gehalten an der Universität Königsberg im Wintersemester 1842-1843''. A. Clebsch (ed.) (1866); Reimer; Berlin. 290 pages, available online [http://math-doc.ujf-grenoble.fr/cgi-bin/oeitem?id=OE_JACOBI__8_1_0  Œuvres complètes volume '''8'''] at [http://math-doc.ujf-grenoble.fr/OEUVRES/ Gallica-Math] from the [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ Gallica Bibliothèque nationale de France].&lt;/ref&gt; The first clear general statements were given by [[Marston Morse]] in the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;Marston Morse (1934). "The Calculus of Variations in the Large", ''American Mathematical Society Colloquium Publication'' '''18'''; New York.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to what is now known as [[Morse theory]]. For example, Morse showed that the number of [[conjugate points]] in a trajectory equalled the number of negative eigenvalues in the second variation of the Lagrangian.

===Gauss and Hertz===
Other extremal principles of [[classical mechanics]] have been formulated, such as [[Gauss's principle of least constraint]] and its corollary, [[Hertz's principle of least curvature]].

==Disputes about possible teleological aspects==

The  mathematical equivalence of the [[differential equation|differential]] [[equations of motion]] and their [[integral equation|integral]]
counterpart has important philosophical implications.  The differential equations are statements about quantities localized to a single point in space or single moment of time.  For example, [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;

states that the ''instantaneous'' force '''F''' applied to a mass ''m'' produces an acceleration '''a''' at the same ''instant''.  By  contrast, the action principle is not localized to a point; rather, it involves integrals over an interval of time and (for fields) an extended region of space.  Moreover, in the usual formulation of [[classical physics|classical]] action principles, the initial and final states of the system are fixed, e.g.,

:''Given that the particle begins at position x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ends at position x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at time t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the physical trajectory that connects these two endpoints is an [[extremum]] of the action integral.''

In particular, the fixing of the ''final'' state has been interpreted as giving the action principle a [[teleology|teleological character]] which has been controversial historically. However, according to W. Yourgrau and S. Mandelstam, ''the teleological approach... presupposes that the variational principles themselves have mathematical characteristics which they ''de facto'' do not possess''&lt;ref name="Stöltzner1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stöltzner|first=Michael|title=Inside Versus Outside: Action Principles and Teleology|year=1994|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-48649-4|pages=33–62 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-48647-0_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some critics maintain this apparent [[teleology]] occurs because of the way in which the question was asked. By specifying some but not all aspects of both the initial and final conditions (the positions but not the velocities) we are making some inferences about the initial conditions from the final conditions, and it is this "backward" inference that can be seen as a teleological explanation. Teleology can also be overcome if we consider the classical description as a limiting case of the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] formalism of [[Path integral formulation|path integration]], in which stationary paths are obtained as a result of interference of amplitudes along all possible paths.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The short story ''[[Story of Your Life]]'' by the speculative fiction writer [[Ted Chiang]] contains visual depictions of [[Fermat's Principle]] along with a discussion of its teleological dimension. [[Keith Devlin]]'s ''The Math Instinct'' contains a chapter, "Elvis the Welsh Corgi Who Can Do Calculus" that discusses the calculus "embedded" in some animals as they solve the "least time" problem in actual situations.

The '''psychotherapy and social action model''' is an approach to [[psychotherapy]] characterized by concentration on past and present personal, social, and political obstacles to [[mental health]]. In particular, the goal of this therapeutic approach is to acknowledge that individual symptoms are not unique, but rather shared by people similarly oppressed and marginalized. Ultimately, the psychotherapy and social action model aims to aid clients in overcoming [[mental illness]] through personal psychotherapy, group [[Coping (psychology)|coping]], and collective social action.

==Background==
	The psychotherapy and social action model was initially proposed by Sue Holland, a [[psychotherapist]] with a background in community action. Holland developed this framework in 1980 following her experience working with women coping with psychological disorders at a housing estate in West London.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, S. (1992). From social abuse to social action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women. In J. Ussher &amp; P. Nicholson (eds), Gender Issues in Clinical Psychology. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; At this estate, Holland observed the psychological difficulties experienced by women, noticing that their mental health was fundamentally tied to the social and economic obstacles they encountered as females in their society. In addition, Holland took issue with the way [[Depression (mood)]] was being treated at the shelter, believing that individualized treatment, especially with the use of psychotropic medication, was not successfully addressing the root of the dysfunction for these women. Instead, Holland posited a pathway from individual treatment to sociopolitical action that empowered women to deal with their mental dysfunction both privately and socially. As such, the psychotherapy and social action model is rooted in the ideals of both traditional psychotherapy and [[Feminism|feminist]] empowerment.

	Implementation of the model began with a three-year trial run and, according to Holland (1992), achieved its three initial goals, including providing private focused psychotherapy, promoting mental health, and fostering community continuity. There was initial evidence supporting the efficacy of the model in treating individual psychological dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, S. (1992). From social abuse to social action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women. In J. Ussher &amp; P. Nicholson (eds), Gender Issues in Clinical Psychology. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Model==

The square model derives from the sociological theory of the four paradigms for the analysis of social theory.&lt;ref&gt;Burrell, G. &amp; Morgan, G. (1979). Sociological Paradigms and Organisational Analysis. London: Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the frame of the model, the dichotomy of individual versus social approaches to personal well-being is represented. The two bottom cells of the square delineate the changing of individuals to conform to social convention while the two top cells of the square represent the changing of social structures as opposed to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Orford, J. (2008). Community Psychology: challenges, controversies and emerging consensus (Illustrated ed.). London: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

The four cells within the frame represent the four paradigms of social theory including functionalist, interpretive, radical humanist, and radical structuralist paradigms. [[Functional psychology|Functionalism]] here is rooted in regulation and objective thinking, and represents the individual, status-quo approach to mental health. The interpretive paradigm is characterized by an approach to understanding the social world through subjective experience, and represents psychoeducation within the psychotherapy framework. The radical humanist paradigm is defined by a radial approach to change with an emphasis on “transcending limitations of existing social arrangements.” (Burrell &amp; Morgan, 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;32). With respect to an approach to therapy, this stage is characterized by the adoption of a social self, such that healing occurs at a group or collective level. The radical structuralist paradigm concentrates on radical change through political or economic emancipation. This is the endpoint of therapy, at which time the client is empowered to challenge sociopolitical structures that foster the conditions perpetuating the manifestation of individual mental illness within an oppressed group.

Taken from her 1992 publication entitled, “From Social Abuse to Social Action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women,” Holland formulated her four step approach to mental health and social action for women in treatment for depression as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Holland, S. (1992). From social abuse to social action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women. In J. Ussher &amp; P. Nicholson (eds), Gender Issues in Clinical Psychology. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

===I. Patient on Pills===
At this stage, patients endorse the status-quo characterization of the “individualized patient.” As such, they treat their disorder passively with psychotropic medication and accept the label associated with their illness.

===II. Person-to-Person Psychotherapy===
This stage represents the first alternative to the status-quo treatment of psychiatric disorders: [[talk therapy]]. At this stage, clients and therapists are able to explore the meaning of their psychopathology and pinpoint the potential causes through individual therapy.

===III. Talking in Groups===
At this stage, the client is able to move past the personal challenges that are acknowledged and addressed in psychotherapy and discover that the challenges are universal amongst similarly marginalized individuals. Together, clients aim to acknowledge what is best for the collective.

===IV. Taking Action===
The final stage, as the name suggests, is the point at which the collective mobilizes to change the social structures enabling their common oppression. Having changed from an individual to a collective, the clients should feel empowered to undertake social change.

Included in this framework is the assumption that only some of the clients in this therapy will traverse all three stages. In Holland’s words, “…many will be content enough with the relief from symptoms and the freedom to get on with their personal lives which the individual therapy gives them.” (Holland, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;73). Thus, this framework is fluid based on the personal inclinations of the client throughout the therapeutic process.

The '''Records Continuum Model''' (RCM) was created in the 1990s by [[Monash University]] academic [[Frank Upward]] with input from colleagues [[Sue McKemmish]] and Livia Iacovino as a response to evolving discussions about the challenges of managing digital records and archives in the discipline of [[Archival science|Archival Science]].&lt;ref name="elis"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKemmish |first1=S. |last2=Upward |first2=F. H. |last3=Reed |first3=B. |year=2010 |chapter=Records Continuum Model |title=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences |edition=3rd |pages=4447–8 |url=http://doi.org/10.1081/E-ELIS3-120043719 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RCM was first published in Upward’s 1996 paper "Structuring the Records Continuum – Part One: Postcustodial principles and properties".&lt;ref name="upward1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1996 |title=Structuring the records continuum – part one: postcustodial principles and properties |journal=Archives &amp; Manuscripts |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=268–285 |url=http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/research/groups/rcrg/publications/recordscontinuum-fupp1.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upward describes the RCM within the broad context of a [[continuum (measurement)|continuum]] where activities and interactions transform documents into records, evidence and memory that are used for multiple purposes over time. Upward places the RCM within a post-custodial, [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] and [[Structuration theory|structuration]] conceptual framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1997 |title=Structuring the records continuum – part two: structuration theory and recordkeeping |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=10–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian academics and practitioners continue to explore, develop and extend the RCM and records continuum theory, along with international collaborators, via the Records Continuum Research Group (RCRG) at Monash University.

==Description==
The RCM is an abstract conceptual model that helps to understand and explore recordkeeping activities (as interaction) in relation to multiple contexts over space and time ([[spacetime]]).&lt;ref name="McK2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKemmish |first=S. |year=2001 |title=Placing records continuum theory and practice |journal=Archival Science |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=333–359 |url=http://doi.org/10.1007/BF02438901 }}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recordkeeping activities take place from before the records are created by identifying recordkeeping requirements in policies, systems, organizations, processes, laws, social mandates that impact on what is created and how it is managed over spacetime. In a continuum, recordkeeping processes, such as adding [[metadata]], fix documents so that they can be managed as evidence. Those records deemed as having continuing value are retained and managed as an archive. The implication of an RCM approach to records and archives is that systems and processes can be designed and put in place before records are even created. A continuum approach therefore highlights that records are both current and archival at the point of creation.&lt;ref name="curtin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://john.curtin.edu.au/society/australia/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013123845/http://john.curtin.edu.au/society/australia/ |archivedate=2014-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCM is represented as a series of concentric rings (dimensions of ''Create'', ''Capture'', ''Organize'' and ''Pluralize'') and crossed axes (transactionality, evidentiality, recordkeeping and identity) with each axis labelled with a description of the activity or interaction that occurs at that intersection. ''Create'', ''Capture'', ''Organize'' and ''Pluralize'' represent recordkeeping activities that occur within spacetime. Activities that occur in these dimensions across the axes are explained in the table below:&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The information in the table is drawn from {{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2005 |chapter=The Records Continuum |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |editor3-first=B. |editor3-last=Reed |editor4-first=F. |editor4-last=Upward |title=Archives: Recordkeeping in Society |pages=197–222 |place=Wagga Wagga, NSW |publisher=Centre for Information Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of the RCM is that it can help to map where on a continuum recordkeeping activities are or can be placed. The RCM can then be used to explore the conceptual and practical assumptions that underpin the practice, in particular the dualisms inherent in the usage and practice of the terms "records" and "archives".&lt;ref name="upward1"/&gt; This definition lends itself to a linear reading of the RCM – starting at ''Create'' as the initiating phase and working outwards towards ''Pluralization'' of recorded information. Another linear reading is to consider design first – the role that systems of ''Pluralization'' and ''Organization'' play in designing, planning and implementing recordkeeping and then considering the implications for ''Create'' and ''Capture''. However, these are just two of many ways to interpret the model as the dimensions and axes represent multiple realities that occur within spacetime, any of which can occur simultaneously, concurrently and sequentially in electronic or digital environments, and/or physical spaces.&lt;ref name="curtin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reed |first=B. |year=2005 |title=Reading the records continuum: interpretations and explorations |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=18–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By representing multiple realities, the RCM articulates the numerous and diverse perspectives that contribute to records and archives including individual, group, community, organizational, institutional and societal. These contexts reveal the need to take into account various stakeholders and co-contributors in relation to use, access and appraisal of records and archives. Over the lifespan of a record multiple decisions are made by various stakeholders of the records that include, but are not limited to records managers and archivists. Other stakeholders can be identified at various dimensions of interaction, including those involved in providing information (not only the person or organization who produced or captured it), as well as their family and community. Records are therefore not simply physical or digital representations of physical objects held and managed in an archive or repository, but are evidence of multiple perspectives, narratives and contexts that contributed to their formation.

The RCM is often described as being in contrast or at odds with the [[Records life-cycle|lifecycle]] records model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/r/records-continuum |title=Records Continuum |work=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology |publisher=Society of American Archivists |accessdate=5 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McK1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=McKemmish |first=S. |year=1997 |chapter=Yesterday, today and tomorrow: a continuum of responsibility |title=Proceedings of the Records Management Association of Australia 14th National Convention, 15–17 Sept 1997 |pages=18–36 |place=Perth, Australia |publisher=RMAA }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the RCM is inclusive of multiple ways of conceptualizing and performing recordkeeping, including a lifecycle approach, there are some significant differences. Firstly, where the lifecycle approach shows clearly demarcated phases in the management of records, a continuum approach conceptualizes elements as continuous with no discernable parts.&lt;ref name="McK1997"/&gt; Secondly, the lifecycle approach identifies clear conceptual and procedural boundaries between active or current records and inactive or historical records, but a continuum approach sees records processes as more integrated across spacetime. In the continuum it is recordkeeping processes that carry records forward through spacetime to enable their use for multiple purposes. What this means is that records are always "in a state of always becoming...",&lt;ref name="McK2001"/&gt; and able to contribute new contexts via the recordkeeping processes that occur with them. Archival records are therefore not just historical, but are able to be re-interpreted, re-created, and re-contextualized according to their place and use in spacetime.  In this way, archival institutions are nodes in the network of recorded information and its contexts, rather than the end point in a lifecycle stage for records that are managed as "relics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Acland |first=G. |year=1992 |title=Managing the record rather than the relic |journal=Archives &amp; Manuscripts |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=57–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory and influences ==
The RCM is a representation of what is commonly referred to as records continuum theory, as well as Australian continuum thinking and/or approaches.&lt;ref name="McK2001"/&gt; These ideas were evolved as part of an Australian approach to archival management espoused by Ian Maclean, Chief Archivist of the Commonwealth Archives Office in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s. Maclean, whose ideas and practices were the subject of the first RCRG publication in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKemmish |first1=S. |last2=Piggott |first2=M. |year=1994 |title=The Records Continuum: Ian Maclean and Australian Archives: first fifty years |publisher=Ancora Press |place=Clayton |isbn=086862019X }}&lt;/ref&gt; referred in a 1959 ''American Archivist'' article to a "continuum of (public) records administration" from administrative efficiency through recordkeeping to the safe keeping of a "cultural end-product".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maclean |first=I. |title=Australian experience in records and archives management |journal=American Archivist |year=1959 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=383–418 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maclean’s vision challenged the divide between current recordkeeping and archival practice. Fellow contemporary at the Commonwealth Archives Office Peter Scott is also included as a core influence on Australian records continuum theory with his development of the Australian Series System, a registry system that helped identify and document the complex and multiple "social, functional, provenancial, and documentary relationships" involved in managing records and recordkeeping processes over spacetime.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;

Further influences on the RCRG group include archival professionals and researchers like [[Archives &amp; Museum Informatics|David Bearman]] and his work on transactionality and systems thinking, and [[Terry Cook (archivist)|Terry Cook]]'s ideas about postcustodialism and macroappraisal.&lt;ref name="Upw2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2000 |title=Modelling the continuum as paradigm shift in recordkeeping and archiving processes, and beyond – a personal reflection |journal=Records Management Journal |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=115–39 |url=http://doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000007259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wider influencing ideas include those from philosophers and social theorists [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Jean-François Lyotard]], as well as sociologist [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]], with structuration theory being a core component of understanding social interaction over spacetime.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt; Canadian archivist Jay Atherton's critique of the division between records managers and archivists in the 1980s and use of the term "records continuum"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atherton |first=J. |title=From life cycle to continuum: some thoughts on the records management-archives relationship |journal=Archivaria |date=1985–1986 |volume=21 |pages=43–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; re-commenced the conversation MacLean began during his career and helped to bring his ideas and this term to Australian records continuum thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bwalya |first1=K. J. |last2=Mnjama |first2=N. M. |last3=Sebina |first3=P. M. I. M. |year=2014 |title=Concepts and Advances in Information Knowledge Management: Studies from Developing and Emerging Economies |publisher=Chandos Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atherton's use of the term records continuum has several significant differences in conception, application and heritage when compared to Australian records continuum thinking.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1994 |chapter=In Search of the Continuum: Ian Maclean's "Australian Experience" Essays on Recordkeeping |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |title=The Records Continuum: Ian Maclean and Australian Archives: first fifty years |publisher=Ancora Press |place=Clayton |isbn=086862019X |pages=110–130 |url=https://www.zotero.org/groups/records_continuum_research_group_publications/items/itemKey/5PX3PN3N/q/in%20search%20of%20the%20continuum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-custodiality as an archival concept plays a major role in how the RCM was conceived. This term was born from an identified and urgent need to address the complexities of computer technologies on records creation and management over time and space.&lt;ref name="U&amp;M1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Upward |first1=F. |last2=McKemmish |first2=S |year=1994 |title=Somewhere beyond custody: literature review |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=136–149 |url=https://www.zotero.org/groups/records_continuum_research_group_publications/items/itemKey/RHKH3WD5/q/somewhere%20beyond }}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-custodiality is discussed by Frank Upward and Sue McKemmish in 1994 as part of an exploration of changes in archival discourse commencing in the 1980s by Gerald Ham and expanded on by [[Terry Cook (archivist)|Terry Cook]] as part of a "post-custodial paradigm shift".&lt;ref name="U&amp;M1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ham |first=F. G. |year=1981 |title=Archival strategies for the post-custodial era |journal=American Archivist |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=207–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=T. |authorlink=Terry Cook (archivist) |year=1994 |title=Electronic records, paper minds: the revolution in information management and archives in the post-custodial and post-modernist era |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=300–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-custodiality in relation to the RCM is explored by Upward and McKemmish as an entry point into a wider conversation about records and recordkeeping being part of a process in which archival institutions have a part to play beyond that of the archival authority handling, [[Archival appraisal|appraisal]], describing and arranging physical objects in their custody.

Drawing from the above theoretical foundations, the RCM as a framework acknowledges the central role that recordkeeping activities have on the creation, capture, organization and ongoing management of records over time and throughout spaces such as organizations and institutional archives. Recordkeeping is a practice and a concept clearly defined in the archival and records literature by continuum writers as "a broad and inclusive concept of integrated recordkeeping and archiving processes for current, regulatory, and historical recordkeeping purposes".&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt; Recordkeeping refers to the activities performed on records that add new contexts such as capturing a record into a system, adding metadata, or selecting it for an archive. In the RCM records are therefore not defined according to their status as objects. Rather, records are understood as being part of a continuum of activity related to known (as well as potentially unknown) contexts. A record (as well as records, collections and archives) are therefore part of larger social, cultural, political, legal and archival processes. It is these contexts that are vital to understanding the role, value and evidential qualities of records in and across spacetime (past, present and potential future).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2005 |chapter=The Records Continuum |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |editor3-first=B. |editor3-last=Reed |editor4-first=F. |editor4-last=Upward |title=Archives: Recordkeeping in Society |pages=197–222 |place=Wagga Wagga, NSW |publisher=Centre for Information Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other information continuum models ==

The RCM is the most well-known of all the continuum models created, but does not exist in isolation. Several other complementary models have been created by RCM creator Frank Upward, and there are others created by continuum researchers that offer enhanced or alternative ways of understanding the continuum.

The series of continuum models created by Frank Upward include:&lt;ref name="Upw2000"/&gt;
* Information Systems (Data) Continuum Model (data modeling and data flow)
* Cultural Heritage Continuum Model (the stories the documents tell and the significance of those stories to others)
* Publication (Access) Continuum Model (the reach of accessibility and the way the document is issued)

Models created in collaboration:
* Information Continuum Model (Barbara Reed, Don Schauder, Frank Upward) (the technologies driving the system and classification methods)

Other models:
* Juridical contexts of the Records Continuum Model (Livia Iacovino)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iacovino |first=Livia |year=2006 |chapter=Legal and social relationships: an alternative Internet regulatory model |title=Recordkeeping, Ethics and Law |pages=253–300 |place=Dordrecht |publisher=Springer Netherlands |ISBN=978-1-4020-4691-9 |url=https://www.springer.com/law/book/978-1-4020-4691-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2069">{{distinguish|text=Schwinger's variational principle, ''[[Schwinger variational principle]]''}}

The '''Schwinger's quantum action principle''' is a [[variational method|variational]] approach to [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]]. This theory was introduced by [[Julian Schwinger]]. In this approach, the '''quantum action''' is an operator. Although it is superficially different from the [[path integral formulation]] where the action is a classical function, the modern formulation of
the two formalisms are identical.

Suppose we have two states defined by the values of a [[complete set of commuting operators]] at two times. Let the early and late states be &lt;math&gt;| A \rang&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| B \rang&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Suppose that there is a parameter in the Lagrangian which can be varied, usually a source for a field. The main equation of '''Schwinger's quantum action principle''' is:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \langle B|A\rangle = i \langle B| \delta S |A\rangle,\ &lt;/math&gt;

where the derivative is with respect to small changes in the parameter.

In the path integral formulation, the transition amplitude is represented by the sum
over all histories of &lt;math&gt;\exp(iS)&lt;/math&gt;, with appropriate [[boundary condition]]s representing the states &lt;math&gt;| A \rang&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| B \rang&lt;/math&gt;. The infinitesimal change in the amplitude is clearly given by Schwinger's formula. Conversely, starting from Schwinger's formula, it is easy to show that the fields obey canonical commutation relations and the classical equations
of motion, and so have a path integral representation. Schwinger's formulation was most significant because it could treat fermionic anticommuting fields with the same formalism as bose fields, thus implicitly introducing differentiation and integration
with respect to anti-commuting coordinates.

[[File:Blank stop sign octagon.svg|thumb|upright|A red [[octagon]] symbolizes "stop" even without the word.|alt=Silhouette of a red octagon]]

A '''symbol''' is a mark, sign  or word that indicates, signifies, or is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship. Symbols allow people to go beyond what is [[know]]n or seen by creating linkages between otherwise very different concepts and experiences. All communication (and data processing) is achieved through the use of symbols. Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs. For example, a red octagon may be a symbol for "STOP". On a map, a blue line might represent a river. [[Numeral system|Numerals]] are symbols for [[number]]s. [[Alphabet]]ic letters may be symbols for sounds. Personal names are symbols representing individuals. A red rose may symbolize love and compassion. The [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] 'x', in a mathematical equation, may symbolize the position of a particle in space.

In [[cartography]], an organized collection of symbols forms a [[Legend (map)#Map symbology|legend]] for a map.

==Etymology==
The word ''symbol'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] σύμβολον ''symbolon'', meaning "token,  watchword" from σύν ''syn'' "together" and βάλλω ''bállō'' " "I throw, put." The sense evolution in Greek is from "throwing things together" to "contrasting" to "comparing" to "token used in comparisons to determine if something is genuine." Hence, "outward sign" of something. The meaning "something which stands for something else" was first recorded in 1590, in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=symbol&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymological Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
In considering the effect of a symbol on the psyche, in his seminal essay ''The Symbol without Meaning'' [[Joseph Campbell]] proposes the following definition:
''A symbol is an energy evoking, and directing, agent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|title=Flight of the Wild Gander:- The Symbol without Meaning|year=2002|publisher=New World Library|location=California|isbn=1-57731-210-4|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, expanding on what he means by this definition Campbell says:

:"a symbol, like everything else, shows a double aspect. We must distinguish, therefore between the 'sense' and the 'meaning' of the symbol. It seems to me perfectly clear that all the great and little symbolical systems of the past functioned simultaneously on three levels: the corporeal of waking consciousness, the spiritual of dream, and the ineffable of the absolutely unknowable. The term 'meaning' can refer only to the first two but these, today, are in the charge of science – which is the province as we have said, not of symbols but of signs. The ineffable, the absolutely unknowable, can be only sensed. It is the province of art which is not 'expression' merely, or even primarily, but a quest for, and formulation of, experience evoking, energy-waking images: yielding what [[Sir Herbert Read]] has aptly termed a 'sensuous apprehension of being'.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Symbol without Meaning p153''&lt;/ref&gt;
Jared Elisha defined symbolism that is something that stands for another, it can be place, object, or a person

[[Heinrich Zimmer]] gives a concise overview of the nature, and perennial relevance, of symbols.

:"Concepts and words are symbols, just as visions, rituals, and images are; so too are the manners and customs of daily life. Through all of these a transcendent reality is mirrored. There are so many metaphors reflecting and implying something which, though thus variously expressed, is ineffable, though thus rendered multiform, remains inscrutable. Symbols hold the mind to truth but are not themselves the truth, hence it is delusory to borrow them. Each civilisation, every age, must bring forth its own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Heinrich Zimmer; edited by Joseph|title=Philosophies of India|year=1969|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|location=Princeton|isbn=0-691-01758-1|pages=1–2|edition=9. paperback print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Signs and Symbols, ''it is stated that ''A symbol ... is a visual image or sign representing an idea -- a deeper indicator of a universal truth.''&lt;ref&gt;Dorling Kindersley Limited. Signs and Symbols. p.6. {{ISBN|978-0-7566-3393-6}}. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbols are a means of complex communication that often can have multiple levels of meaning.&lt;ref name= "Womack"&gt;Womack, Mari. Symbols and Meaning: A Concise Introduction. California: AltaMira Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This separates symbols from [[sign]]s, as signs have only one meaning.

Human cultures use symbols to express specific ideologies and social structures and to represent aspects of their specific culture.  Thus, symbols carry meanings that depend upon one’s cultural background; in other words, the meaning of a symbol is not inherent in the symbol itself but is culturally learned.&lt;ref name="Womack" /&gt;

Symbols are the basis of all human understanding and serve as vehicles of conception for all human knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, Susanne K.  A Theory of Art, Developed From: Philosophy in a New Key. New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols facilitate understanding of the world in which we live, thus serving as the grounds upon which we make judgments.&lt;ref name="Catherine"&gt;Palczewski, Catherine, and Ice, Richard, and Fritch, John. Rhetoric in Civic Life. Pennsylvania: Strata Publishing, Inc., 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, people use symbols not only to make sense of the world around them, but also to [[Identification (psychology)|identify]] and cooperate in society through [[constitutive rhetoric]].

==Symbols and semiotics==

[[Semiotics]] is the study of signs, symbols, and signification as communicative behavior. Semiotics studies focus on the relationship of the signifier and the signified, also taking into account interpretation of visual cues, body language, sound, and other contextual clues.  Semiotics is linked with both [[linguistics]] and psychology.  Semioticians thus not only study what a symbol implies, but also how it got its meaning and how it functions to make meaning in society.  Symbols allow the human brain continuously to create meaning using sensory input and decode symbols through both [[denotation]] and [[connotation]].

==Psychoanalysis, rhetoric and archetypes==
Swiss psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]], who studied [[archetype]]s, proposed an alternative definition of symbol, distinguishing it from the term ''[[Sign (linguistics)|sign]]''. In Jung's view, a sign stands for something known, as a word stands for its referent. He contrasted this with ''symbol'', which he used to stand for something that is unknown and that cannot be made clear or precise.  An example of a symbol in this sense is [[Christ]] as a symbol of the [[archetype]] called ''[[Self in Jungian psychology|self]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Christ, A symbol of the self CW vol 9i Aion RKP 1958&lt;/ref&gt; For example, written languages are composed of a variety of different symbols that create words, p. . Through these written words humans communicate with each other. [[Kenneth Burke]] described ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' as a "[[Definition of man|symbol-using, symbol making, and symbol misusing animal]]" to suggest that a person creates symbols as well as misuses them. One example he uses to indicate what he means by the misuse of symbol is the story of a man who, when told that a particular food item was whale blubber, could barely keep from throwing it up. Later, his friend discovered it was actually just a dumpling. But the man's reaction was a direct consequence of the symbol of "blubber" representing something inedible in his mind. In addition, the symbol of "blubber" was created by the man through various kinds of [[learning]].

Burke goes on to describe symbols as also being derived from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work on [[Condensation (psychology)|condensation]] and [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]], further stating that symbols are not just relevant to the [[The Interpretation of Dreams|theory of dreams]] but also to "normal symbol systems". He says they'''{{clarify|date=December 2013}}'''&lt;!--What is "they"?--&gt; are related through "substitution", where one word, phrase, or symbol is substituted for another in order to change the meaning{{clarify|date=December 2013}}&lt;!--The meaning of what?--&gt;. In other words, if one person does not understand a certain word or phrase, another person may substitute a synonym or symbol in order to get the meaning across. However, upon learning the new way of interpreting a specific symbol, the person may change his or her already-formed ideas to incorporate the new information{{clarify|date=December 2013}}&lt;!--This is still not clear.  These last two sentences do not clearly support or explain the one before it--&gt;.

[[Jean Dalby Clift]] says that people not only add their own interpretations to symbols, they also create personal symbols that represent their own understanding of their lives: what she calls "core images" of the person.  She argues that symbolic work with these personal symbols or core images can be as useful as working with dream symbols in psychoanalysis or counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Dalby Clift, ''Core Images of the Self: A Symbolic Approach to Healing and Wholeness''.  Crossroad, 1992. {{page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Indick suggests that the symbols that are commonly found in myth, legend, and fantasy fulfil psychological functions and hence are why archetypes such as "the hero," "the princess" and "the witch" have remained popular for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130629202403/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6039-7 Indick, William. Ancient Symbology in Fantasy Literature: A Psychological Study. Jefferson: McFarland &amp;, 2012. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paul Tillich==

[[Paul Tillich]] argued that, while signs are invented and forgotten, symbols are born and die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, therefore, dead and living symbols. A living symbol can reveal to an individual hidden levels of meaning and transcendent or religious realities.  For Tillich a symbol always "points beyond itself" to something that is unquantifiable and mysterious; symbols open up the "depth dimension of reality itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbols are complex, and their meanings can evolve as the individual or culture evolves. When a symbol loses its meaning and power for an individual or culture, it becomes a dead symbol.
When a symbol becomes identified with the deeper reality to which it refers, it becomes idolatrous as the "symbol is taken for reality." The symbol itself is substituted for the deeper meaning it intends to convey. The unique nature of a symbol is that it gives access to deeper layers of reality which are otherwise inaccessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of context in symbolism==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2010}}
A symbol's [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] may be modified by various factors including popular usage, [[history]], and contextual [[intent (law)|intent]].

===Historical meaning===
The history of a symbol is one of many factors in determining a particular symbol's apparent meaning. Consequently, symbols with emotive power carry problems analogous to [[false etymologies]].

===Context===
The context of a symbol may change its meaning.  Similar five-pointed stars might signify a [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] officer or a member of the [[armed services]], depending upon the [[uniform]].

== Symbols in Cartography ==
[[File:Cartographic Symbols.jpg|thumb|The three categories of cartographic symbol shapes.]]
Symbols are used in cartography to communicate geographical information (generally as point, line, or area features).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Principles of map design |last=Tyner |first=Judith A. |date=2010|publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=9781606235447 |location=New York |oclc=437300476}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other symbols, visual variables such as size, shape, orientation, texture, and pattern provide meaning to the symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cartography : thematic map design |last=Dent |first=Borden D. |last2=Torguson |first2=Jeffrey |last3=Hodler |first3=T. W. |isbn=0072943823 |edition=6th |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |oclc=184827987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form, or shape, of a cartographic symbol is classified into one of three main groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=How maps work : representation, visualization, and design |last=MacEachren |first=Alan M. |date=1995 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=0898625890 |location=New York |oclc=31078855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pictorial/Representational''' - a shape or image that clearly resembles the geographic feature being symbolized and can be interpreted without a legend.

'''Associative''' - a mixture of pictorial and geometric elements that produce an easily recognizable shape.

'''Abstract/Geometric''' - completely arbitrary shapes chosen to represent a certain feature.

==Symbolic action==
A '''symbolic action''' is an action that has no, or little, practical effect but symbolizes, or signals, what the actor wants or believes.  The action conveys meaning to the viewers.

Symbolic action may overlap with [[symbolic speech]], such as the use of [[flag burning]] to express hostility or saluting the flag to express patriotism.&lt;ref name="Bagossy2008"&gt;Bagossy, Renate. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4LyziXxw238C&amp;pg=PA16 The Difficulty of the Amendment Process of the Constitution of the United States of America and Freedom of Speech and its limits]''. GRIN Verlag; 2008-08-11 [cited 5 November 2012]. {{ISBN|9783640129546}}. p. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to intense public criticism, businesses, organizations, and governments may take symbolic actions rather than, or in addition to, directly addressing the identified problems.&lt;ref name="Bednar2008"&gt;Bednar, Michael Kay. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7Fyefq5LV8sC How Symbolic Action Affects the Media as a Governance Mechanism]''. ProQuest; 2008. {{ISBN|9780549738817}}. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic actions are sometimes derided as [[slacktivism]].

A '''system of measurement''' is a collection of [[units of measurement]] and rules relating them to each other. Systems of measurement have historically been important, regulated and defined for the purposes of [[science]] and [[commerce]]. Systems of measurement in modern use include the [[metric system]], the [[imperial system]], and [[United States customary units]].

==History==
{{main article|History of measurement}}

The [[French Revolution]] gave rise to the [[metric system]], and this has spread around the world, replacing most customary units of measure. In most systems, [[length]] (distance), [[mass]], and [[time]] are ''base quantities''.

Later science developments showed that either [[electric charge]] or [[electric current]] could be added to extend the set of base quantities by which many other [[Metrology|metrological units]] could be easily defined. (However, electrical units are not necessary for such a set. [[Gaussian units]], for example, have only length, mass, and time as base quantities, and the ampere is defined in terms of other units.) Other quantities, such as [[Power (physics)|power]] and [[speed]], are derived from the base set: for example, speed is distance per unit time. Historically a wide range of units was used for the same type of quantity: in different contexts, length was measured in [[inch]]es, [[Foot (length)|feet]], [[yards]], [[fathom]]s, [[Rod (unit)|rods]], [[Chain (unit)|chains]], [[furlong]]s, [[mile]]s, [[nautical mile]]s, [[stadia (length)|stadia]], [[League (unit)|leagues]], with conversion factors which were not powers of ten. Such arrangements were satisfactory in their own contexts.

The preference for a more universal and consistent system (based on more rational base units) only gradually spread with the growth of science. Changing a measurement system has substantial financial and cultural costs which must be offset against the advantages to be obtained from using a more rational system. However pressure built up, including from scientists and engineers for conversion to a more rational, and also internationally consistent, basis of measurement.

In antiquity, ''systems of measurement'' were defined locally: the different units might be defined independently according to the length of a king's thumb or the size of his foot, the length of stride, the length of arm, or maybe the weight of water in a keg of specific size, perhaps itself defined in ''hands'' and ''knuckles''. The unifying characteristic is that there was some definition based on some standard. Eventually ''[[cubit]]s'' and ''[[yard|strides]]'' gave way to "customary units" to meet the needs of merchants and scientists.

In the metric system and other recent systems, a single basic unit is used for each base quantity. Often secondary units (multiples and submultiples) are derived from the basic units by multiplying by powers of ten, i.e. by simply moving the [[decimal point]]. Thus the basic metric unit of length is the [[metre]]; a distance of 1.234&amp;nbsp;m is 1,234&amp;nbsp;millimetres, or 0.001234&amp;nbsp;kilometres.

===Current practice===
{{main article|Metrication}}
Metrication is complete or nearly complete in almost all countries. [[US customary units]] are heavily used in the [[United States]] and to some degree in [[Liberia]]. Traditional [[Burmese units of measurement]] are used in [[Burma]]. U.S. units are used in limited contexts in Canada due to the large volume of trade; there is also considerable use of Imperial weights and measures, despite ''de jure'' Canadian conversion to metric.

A number of other jurisdictions have laws mandating or permitting other systems of measurement in some or all contexts, such as the United Kingdom – whose [[road signage legislation (UK)|road signage legislation]], for instance, only allows distance signs displaying [[imperial units]] (miles or yards)&lt;ref name=TSRGD&gt;{{cite web

In the United States, metric units are used almost universally in science, widely in the military, and partially in industry, but customary units predominate in household use. At retail stores, the liter is a commonly used unit for volume, especially on bottles of beverages, and milligrams, rather than grains, are used for medications. Some other standard non-[[SI]] units are still in international use, such as [[nautical mile]]s and [[knot (unit)|knots]] in aviation and shipping.

==Metric system==
{{Main article|Metric system|International System of Units}}
[[File:MetricImperialUSCustomaryUnits.jpg|thumb|upright|A baby bottle that measures in three measurement systems—metric, imperial (UK), and US customary.]]

[[Metric system]]s of units have evolved since the adoption of the first well-defined system in France in 1795. During this evolution the use of these systems has spread throughout the world, first to non-English-speaking countries, and then to English speaking countries.

Multiples and submultiples of metric units are related by powers of ten and their names are formed with [[SI prefix|prefixes]]. This relationship is compatible with the decimal system of numbers and it contributes greatly to the convenience of metric units.

In the early metric system there were two base units, the [[metre]] for length and the [[gram]] for mass. The other units of length and mass, and all units of area, volume, and derived units such as density were derived from these two base units.

[[Mesures usuelles]] ([[French language|French]] for ''customary measurements'') were a system of measurement introduced as a compromise between the metric system and traditional measurements. It was used in France from 1812 to 1839.

A number of variations on the metric system have been in use. These include [[gravitational metric system|gravitational systems]], the [[centimetre–gram–second system of units|centimetre–gram–second systems]] (cgs) useful in science, the [[metre–tonne–second system of units|metre–tonne–second system]] (mts) once used in the USSR and the [[metre–kilogram–second system of units|metre–kilogram–second system]] (mks).

The current international standard metric system is the [[International System of Units]] (''Système international d'unités'' or SI) It is an mks system based on the [[metre]], [[kilogram]] and [[second]] as well as the [[kelvin]], [[ampere]], [[candela]], and [[mole (unit)|mole]].

The SI includes two classes of units which are defined and agreed internationally. The first of these classes includes the seven [[SI base unit]]s for length, mass, time, temperature, electric current, luminous intensity and amount of substance. The second class consists of the [[SI derived unit]]s. These derived units are defined in terms of the seven base units. All other quantities (e.g. work, force, power) are expressed in terms of SI derived units.

==Imperial and US customary units==
{{Main article|Imperial and US customary measurement systems|Imperial units|US customary units}}
Both [[imperial unit]]s and [[United States customary units|US customary units]] derive from earlier [[English unit]]s. Imperial units were mostly used in the former [[British Empire]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], but in all these countries they have been largely supplanted by the metric system. They are still used for some applications in the United Kingdom but have been mostly replaced by the metric system in [[commerce|commercial]], [[scientific]], and [[industry|industrial]] applications.
US customary units, however, are still the main system of measurement in the [[United States]]. While some steps towards [[metrication]] have been made (mainly in the late 1960s and early 1970s), the customary units have a strong hold due to the vast industrial infrastructure and commercial development.

While imperial and US customary systems are closely related, there are a number of [[Comparison of the imperial and US customary measurement systems|differences between them]]. Units of length and area (the [[inch]], [[foot (unit)|foot]], [[yard]], [[mile]] etc.) are identical except for surveying purposes.{{clarify|date=July 2016}} The [[Avoirdupois]] units of mass and weight differ for units larger than a [[pound (mass)|pound]] (lb). The imperial system uses a stone of 14&amp;nbsp;lb, a long [[hundredweight]] of 112&amp;nbsp;lb and a long [[ton]] of 2240&amp;nbsp;lb. The stone is not used in the US and the hundredweights and tons are short: 100&amp;nbsp;lb and 2000&amp;nbsp;lb respectively.

Where these systems most notably differ is in their units of volume. A US [[fluid ounce]] (fl&amp;nbsp;oz), about 29.6 [[millilitre]]s (ml), is slightly larger than the imperial fluid ounce (about 28.4&amp;nbsp;ml). However, as there are 16&amp;nbsp;US&amp;nbsp;fl&amp;nbsp;oz to a US [[pint]] and 20&amp;nbsp;imp&amp;nbsp;fl&amp;nbsp;oz per imperial pint, the imperial pint is about 20% larger. The same is true of [[quart]]s, [[gallon]]s, etc. Six US gallons are a little less than five imperial gallons.

The [[Avoirdupois]] system served as the general system of mass and weight. In addition to this there are the [[Troy weight|Troy]] and the [[Apothecaries' system]]s. Troy weight was customarily used for [[precious metal]]s, [[black powder]] and [[gemstone]]s. The troy ounce is the only unit of the system in current use; it is used for precious metals. Although the troy ounce is larger than its Avoirdupois equivalent, the pound is smaller. The obsolete troy pound was divided into 12 ounces, rather than the 16 ounces per pound of the Avoirdupois system. The Apothecaries' system was traditionally used in [[pharmacology]], but has now been replaced by the metric system; it shared the same pound and ounce as the troy system but with different further subdivisions.

==Natural units==
[[Natural units]] are [[Physics|physical]] [[units of measurement]] defined in terms of universal [[physical constants]] in such a manner that selected physical constants take on the numerical value of one when expressed in terms of those units.  Natural units are so named because their definition relies on only properties of [[nature]] and not on any human construct. Various systems of natural units are possible.

Some other examples are as follows:
* [[Geometrized unit system|Geometric unit systems]] are useful in [[Theory of relativity|relativistic physics]]. In these systems the base physical units are chosen so that the [[speed of light]] and the [[gravitational constant]] are set equal to unity.
* [[Planck units]] are a form of geometric units obtained by also setting [[Boltzmann's constant]], the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force constant]] and the [[reduced Planck constant]] to unity. They are based only on properties of [[free space]] rather than any object or particle.
* [[Natural units#Stoney units|Stoney units]] are similar to Planck units but set the [[elementary charge]] to unity and allow Planck's constant to float (i.e. it is a number that has to be determined by experiment).
* [[Natural units#"Schrödinger" units|"Schrödinger" units]] are also similar to Planck units and also set the elementary charge to unity, but allow the speed of light to float.
* [[Atomic units]] are a system of units used in [[atomic physics]], particularly for describing the properties of [[electron]]s. The atomic units have been chosen such that several the constants relating to the electron are all equal to one. They are similar to "Schrödinger" units but set the [[electron mass]] to unity and allow the gravitational constant to float. The unit of [[energy]] in this system is the total energy of the [[electron]] in the [[Bohr atom]] and called the [[Hartree energy]]. The unit of length is the [[Bohr radius]].
* [[Natural units#Electronic system of units|Electronic units]] are similar to Stoney units but set the [[electron mass]] to unity and allow the gravitational constant to float. They are also similar to atomic units but set the speed of light to unity and allow Planck's constant to float.
* [[Natural units#Quantum electrodynamical system of units|Quantum electrodynamical units]] are similar to the electronic system of units except that the [[proton mass]] is normalised rather than the electron mass.

==Non-standard units==
[[List of unusual units of measurement|Non-standard measurement units]], sometimes found in books, newspapers etc., include:

===Area===
* The [[American football#Field and players|American football field]], which has a playing area {{convert|100|yd|m|1|lk=in}} long by {{convert|160|ft|m|1}} wide. This is often used by the [[United States|American]] public media for the sizes of large buildings or parks. It is used both as a unit of length ({{convert|100|yd|m|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}, the length of the playing field excluding goal areas) and as a unit of area ({{convert|57600|sqft|m2|abbr=on|disp=or}}), about {{convert|1.32|acre|ha|lk=on}}.
* British media also frequently uses the [[Association football pitch|football pitch]] for equivalent purposes, although [[soccer]] pitches are not of a fixed size, but instead can vary within defined limits ({{convert|100|-|130|yd|m|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} long, and {{convert|50|-|100|yd|m|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} wide, giving an area of {{convert|5000|to|13000|sqyd|m2|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}). However the [[UEFA Champions League]] field must be exactly {{convert|105|by|68|m|yd|2|abbr=on}} giving an area of {{convert|7140|m2|ha|abbr=on}} or {{convert|8539|sqyd|acre|abbr=on|lk=on}}. Example: [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/article2698634.ece HSS vessels are aluminium catamarans '''about the size of a football pitch'''... - Belfast Telegraph 23 June 2007]
* Larger areas are sometimes expressed as a multiple of the areas of certain American states, or subdivisions of the UK etc.

===Energy===
* A ton of [[TNT equivalent]], and its multiples the kiloton, the megaton, and the gigaton. Often used in stating the power of very energetic events such as [[explosion]]s and [[volcanic]] events and [[earthquakes]] and [[asteroid]] impacts. A [[gram]] of TNT as a unit of [[energy]] has been defined as 1000 thermochemical calories ({{convert|1000|cal|J|0|abbr=on|lk=on|disp=or}}).
* The [[Little Boy|atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima]]. Its force is often used in the [[public media]] and popular [[books]] as a unit of energy. (Its yield was roughly 13 kilotons, or 60 TJ.)
* One stick of [[dynamite]]

==Units of currency==
A unit of measurement that applies to [[money]] is called a [[unit of account]] in economics and unit of measure in accounting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fasri.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Johnso2007n--Unit-of-Acct-Paper.pdf Financial Accounting Standards Research Initiative: The Unit of Account Issue]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is normally a [[currency]] issued by a [[country]] or a fraction thereof; for instance, the [[United States dollar|US dollar]] and US cent ({{frac|100}} of a dollar), or the [[euro]] and euro cent.

[[ISO 4217]] is the international standard describing three letter codes (also known as the currency code) to define the names of currencies established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

The Circumplex Model is a graphical representation of emotional states. Fundamentally, it is a circle with pleasant on the left, unpleasant on the right, activation on the top, and deactivation on the bottom. All the other emotions are placed around the circle as combinations of these four basic states. It is based on the theory that people experience emotions as overlapping and ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2367156|year=2005|author1=Posner|first1=J|title=The circumplex model of affect: An integrative approach to affective neuroscience, cognitive development, and psychopathology|journal=Development and Psychopathology|volume=17|issue=3|pages=715–734|last2=Russell|first2=J.

It is of most interest in the business world, the workforce, or any other setting where the performance of a group is important. [[Joseph E McGrath]] enlarged the circumplex model to include group dynamics, based on the work of Shaw, Carter, Hackman, Steiner, Shiflett, Taylor, Lorge, Davis, Laughlin, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A CIRCUMPLEX MODEL OF GROUP TASK TYPES|url=https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/psyifp/aeechterhoff/wintersemester2011-12/vorlesungkommperskonflikt/mcgrath_groupinteractperfom_1984.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four quadrants in this model representing: generating a task, choosing correct procedure, conflict resolution, and execution, and again there are subtypes distributed around the circle. He used this model as a research tool to evaluate group task performance.

== Group dynamics ==
[[Group dynamics]] involve the influential actions, processes and changes that exist both within and between groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book

| last = Forsyth
| first = D. R.
| publisher = Wadsworth

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group dynamics also involve the scientific study of group processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through extensive research in the field of group dynamics, it is now well known that all groups, despite their innumerable differences, possess common properties and dynamics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social psychological researchers have attempted to organize these commonalities, in order to further understand the genuine nature of group processes.

For instance, social psychological research indicates that there are numerous goal-related interactions and activities that groups of all sizes undertake . These interactions have been categorized by [[Robert F. Bales]], who spent his entire life attempting to find an answer to the question, "What do people do when they are in groups?".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To simplify the understanding of group interactions, Bales concluded that all interactions within groups could be categorized as either a ''relationship interaction'' (or socioemotional interaction) or a ''task interaction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Just as Bales was determined to identify the basic types of '''interactions''' involved in groups, [[Joseph E. McGrath]] was determined to identify the various '''goal-related activities''' that are regularly displayed by groups. McGrath contributed greatly to the understanding of group dynamics through the development of his '''circumplex model of group tasks'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As intended, McGrath's model effectively organizes all group-related activities by distinguishing between four basic group goals. These goals are referred to as the circumplex model of group task's four quadrants, which are categorized based on the dominant performance process involved in a group's task of interest.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breakdown ===
The four quadrants are as follows: 
# '''''Generating''' ideas or plans''
# '''''Choosing''' a solution''
# '''''Negotiating''' a solution to a conflict'' 
# '''''Executing''' a task''

To further differentiate the various goal-related group activities, McGrath further sub-divides these four categories, resulting in eight categories in total. The breakdown of these categories is as follows:

1. &lt;u&gt;'''''Generating''' ideas or plans''&lt;/u&gt;
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 1&lt;/u&gt;''' – Planning tasks''
** E.g. Generating plans
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 2&lt;/u&gt;''' – Creativity tasks''
** E.g. Generating ideas
2. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Choosing''' a solution&lt;/u&gt;''
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 3&lt;/u&gt;''' – Intellective tasks''
** E.g. Solving problems with correct answers
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 4&lt;/u&gt;''' – Decision-making tasks''
** E.g. Deciding issues with no right answer
3. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Negotiating''' a solution to a conflict&lt;/u&gt;'' 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 5&lt;/u&gt;''' – Cognitive conflict tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of viewpoints 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 6&lt;/u&gt;''' – Mixed-motive tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of interest 
4. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Executing''' a task&lt;/u&gt;'' 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 7&lt;/u&gt;''' – Contests/battles/competitive tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of power 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 8&lt;/u&gt;''' – Performance/psychomotor tasks''
** E.g. Executing performance tasks

=== Details ===
According to [[Joseph E. McGrath|McGrath]] and [[Kravitz]] (1982),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the four most commonly represented tasks in the group dynamics literature are intellective tasks, decision-making tasks, cognitive conflict tasks and mixed-motive tasks.

The circumplex model of group tasks takes the organization of goal-related activities a step further by distinguishing between tasks that involve cooperation between group members, cooperation tasks (Types 1, 2, 3 and 8) and tasks that often lead to conflict between group members, conflict tasks (Types 4, 5, 6 and 7).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, McGrath's circumplex model of group tasks also distinguishes between tasks that require action (behavioural tasks) and tasks that require conceptual review (conceptual tasks). 'Behavioural tasks' include Types 1, 6, 7 and 8, while 'conceptual tasks' include Types 2, 3, 4 and 5.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Visual representation ==
The circumplex model of group tasks is, evidently, a very detailed and complex model. To allow for a more thorough understanding of its properties, a visual representation of the model has been developed. (Need a diagram of the model)

== Further explanation ==
Since the circumplex model of group tasks is quite detailed and complex, numerous social psychological researchers have attempted to describe the model in various ways to ensure readers obtain an optimal understanding of the model. For instance, according to Stratus and McGrath (1994),&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal
| last = Straus
| first = Susan G.
| last2 = McGrath
| first2 = Joseph E.
| date = 1994

| doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.79.1.87
| pmid = 
| access-date = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the four quadrants and the various task types with which they contain all relate to one another within a two-dimensional space. More specifically, [[Susan G. Stratus|Stratus]] and [[Joseph E. McGrath|McGrath]] (1994)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; states that the horizontal dimension of the circumplex model of group tasks visual representation reflect the extent to which a task entails cognitive versus behavioural performance requirements. Likewise, the vertical dimension of the circumplex model of group tasks visual representation reflects the extent and form of interdependence among members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
