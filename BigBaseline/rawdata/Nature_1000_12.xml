[[File:Kaskaskia Island 1993 flooding.jpg|thumb|[[Mississippi River]] at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]] during the [[Great Flood of 1993]].]]
A '''one-hundred-year flood''' is a [[flood]] event that has a 1% probability of occurring in any given year.

The 100-year flood is also referred to as the 1% flood, since its annual exceedance probability is 1%.&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;Holmes, R.R., Jr., and Dinicola, K. (2010) ''100-Year flood–it's all about chance '' [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/106/ U.S. Geological Survey General Information Product 106]&lt;/ref&gt;  For river systems, the 100-year flood is generally expressed as a flowrate.   Based on the expected 100-year flood flow rate, the flood [[water]] level can be mapped as an area of inundation.  The resulting [[floodplain]] map is referred to as the 100-year floodplain.  Estimates of the 100-year flood flowrate and other streamflow statistics for any stream in the United States are available.&lt;ref name="Ries"&gt;Ries, K.G., and others (2008) ''StreamStats: A water resources web application '' [http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2008/3067/ U.S. Geological Survey, Fact Sheet 2008-3067]  [http://water.usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/ Application home page] URL accessed 2015-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK The [[Environment Agency]] publishes a comprehensive map of all areas at risk of a 1 in 100 year flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?x=460730.0&amp;y=189442.0&amp;topic=floodmap&amp;ep=map&amp;scale=9&amp;location=OX10%200AJ&amp;lang=_e&amp;layerGroups=default&amp;distance=&amp;textonly=off|publisher=[[Environment Agency]]|title=Flood Map for Planning (Rivers and Sea)|access-date=25 August 2016|date=2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916225532/http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?x=460730.0&amp;y=189442.0&amp;topic=floodmap&amp;ep=map&amp;scale=9&amp;location=OX10%200AJ&amp;lang=_e&amp;layerGroups=default&amp;distance=&amp;textonly=off|archive-date=2016-09-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas near the coast of an ocean or large lake also can be flooded by combinations of [[tide]], [[storm surge]], and [[wind wave|waves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coastal Flooding|url=https://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/pages/coastal_flooding/cf_overview.jsp|website=FloodSmart|publisher=National Flood Insurance Program|accessdate=7 March 2016|ref=NFIP coastal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308052549/https://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/pages/coastal_flooding/cf_overview.jsp|archive-date=2016-03-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maps of the riverine or coastal 100-year floodplain may figure importantly in building permits, environmental regulations, and [[flood insurance]].

==Probability==
A common misunderstanding is that a 100-year flood is likely to occur only once in a 100-year period.  In fact, there is approximately a 63.4% chance of one or more 100-year floods occurring in any 100-year period. On the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany, the actual intervals between 100-year floods during 1501 to 2013 ranged from 37 to 192 years.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"&gt;Eychaner, J.H. (2015) ''Lessons from a 500-year record of flood elevations  '' [http://www.floods.org/ace-files/documentlibrary/publications/asfpmpubs-techrep7_2015.pdf Association of State Floodplain Managers, Technical Report 7] URL accessed 2015-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The probability '''P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''' that one or more floods occurring during any period will exceed a given flood threshold can be expressed, using the [[binomial distribution]], as

&lt;math&gt;P_{e}=1-\left[ 1-\left( \frac{1}{T} \right) \right]^{n}&lt;/math&gt;

where  '''T''' is the threshold [[return period]] (e.g. 100-yr, 50-yr, 25-yr, and so forth), and '''n''' is the number of years in the period. The [[probability of exceedance]] '''P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''' is also described as the natural, inherent, or hydrologic risk of failure.&lt;ref name="Mays"&gt;Mays, L.W (2005) ''Water Resources Engineering, chapter 10, Probability, risk, and uncertainty analysis for hydrologic and hydraulic design'' Hoboken: J. Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maidment"&gt;Maidment, D.R. ed.(1993) ''Handbook of Hydrology, chapter 18, Frequency analysis of extreme events''  New York: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[expected value]] of the number of 100-year floods occurring in any 100-year period is 1.

Ten-year floods have a 10% chance of occurring in any given year (P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; =0.10); 500-year have a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year (P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; =0.002); etc. The percent chance of an X-year flood occurring in a single year is 100/X. A similar analysis is commonly applied to [[coastal flood]]ing or rainfall data. The [[return period|recurrence interval]] of a storm is rarely identical to that of an associated riverine flood, because of rainfall timing and location variations among different [[drainage basin]]s.

The field of [[extreme value theory]] was created to model rare events such as 100-year floods for the purposes of civil engineering.  This theory is most commonly applied to the maximum or minimum observed stream flows of a given river. In desert areas where there are only ephemeral washes, this method is applied to the maximum observed rainfall over a given period of time (24-hours, 6-hours, or 3-hours). The extreme value analysis only considers the most extreme event observed in a given year. So, between the large spring runoff and a heavy summer rain storm, whichever resulted in more runoff would be considered the extreme event, while the smaller event would be ignored in the analysis (even though both may have been capable of causing terrible flooding in their own right).

==Statistical assumptions==

There are a number of [[Statistical assumption|assumptions]] which are made to complete the analysis which determines the 100-year flood. First, the extreme events observed in each year must be [[statistical independence|independent]] from year-to-year. In other words, the maximum river flow rate from 1984 cannot be found to be [[Statistical significance|significantly]] [[correlation and dependence|correlated]] with the observed flow rate in 1985.  1985 cannot be correlated with 1986, and so forth. The second assumption is that the observed extreme events must come from the same [[probability distribution function]]. The third assumption is that the probability distribution relates to the largest storm (rainfall or river flow rate measurement) that occurs in any one year. The fourth assumption is that the probability distribution function is stationary, meaning that the [[mean]] (average), [[standard deviation]] and [[Minima and maxima (introduction)|max/min]] values are not increasing or decreasing over time.  This concept is referred to as [[Stationary process|stationarity]].&lt;ref name="Maidment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B17C"&gt;{{cite book |last1=England |first1=John |last2=and seven others |title=Guidelines for determining flood flow frequency—Bulletin 17C |date=29 March 2018 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/tm4B5 |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first assumption is often but not always valid and should be tested on a case by case basis. The second assumption is often valid if the extreme events are observed under similar climate conditions. For example, if the extreme events on record all come from late summer thunder storms (as is the case in the southwest U.S.), or from snow pack melting (as is the case in north-central U.S.), then this assumption should be valid. If, however, there are some extreme events taken from thunder storms, others from snow pack melting, and others from hurricanes, then this assumption is most likely not valid. The third assumption is only a problem when trying to forecast a low, but maximum flow event (for example, an event smaller than a 2-year flood). Since this is not typically a goal in extreme analysis, or in civil engineering design, then the situation rarely presents itself. The final assumption about stationarity is difficult to test from data for a single site because of the large uncertainties in even the longest flood records&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt; (see next section). More broadly, substantial evidence of [[climate change]] strongly suggests that the probability distribution is also changing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5863/573.full |work=Science Magazine |title=Stationarity is Dead |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=2008-02-01 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that managing flood risks in the future will become even more difficult.&lt;ref name=IPPC&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2012) ''Managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation,'' [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPMbrochure_FINAL.pdf Summary for policymakers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719211442/http://ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPMbrochure_FINAL.pdf |date=2015-07-19 }}  Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 19 p.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest implication of this is that not all of the historical data are, or can be, considered valid as input into the extreme event analysis.

==Probability uncertainty==

When these assumptions are violated there is an ''unknown'' amount of uncertainty introduced into the reported value of what the 100-year flood means in terms of rainfall intensity, or flood depth. When all of the inputs are known the uncertainty can be measured in the form of a confidence interval. For example, one might say there is a 95% chance that the 100-year flood is greater than X, but less than Y.&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;

Direct statistical analysis&lt;ref name="B17C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACWI"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bulletin 17C |url=https://acwi.gov/hydrology/Frequency/b17c/ |publisher=Advisory Committee on Water Information |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to estimate the 100-year riverine flood is possible only at the relatively few locations where an annual series of maximum instantaneous flood discharges has been recorded. In the United States as of 2014, taxpayers have supported such records for at least 60 years at fewer than 2,600 locations, for at least 90 years at fewer than 500, and for at least 120 years at only 11.&lt;ref name="NWIS"&gt;[http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis ''National Water Information System database''] U.S. Geological Survey. URL accessed 2014-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt;  For comparison, the total area of the nation is about {{convert|3,800,000|sqmi|km2}}, so there are perhaps 3,000 stream reaches that drain watersheds of {{convert|1,000|sqmi|km2}} and 300,000 reaches that drain {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}}. In urban areas, 100-year flood estimates are needed for watersheds as small as {{convert|1|sqmi|km2}}. For reaches without sufficient data for direct analysis, 100-year flood estimates are derived from [[regression analysis|indirect statistical analysis]] of flood records at other locations in a hydrologically similar region or from other [[Hydrology#Modeling|hydrologic models]]. Similarly for coastal floods, [[tide gauge]] data exist for only about 1,450 sites worldwide, of which only about 950 added information to the global data center between January 2010 and March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obtaining Tide Gauge Data|url=http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/|website=Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level|publisher=PSMSL|accessdate=7 March 2016|ref=PSMSL_data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Passau flood scale Sept 2012.JPG|thumb|High-water scale 1501-2002 at [[Passau|Passau, Germany]], as of September 2012]]
Much longer records of flood elevations exist at a few locations around the world, such as the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany,  but they must be evaluated carefully for accuracy and completeness before any statistical interpretation.

For an individual stream reach, the uncertainties in any analysis can be large, so 100-year flood estimates have large individual uncertainties for most stream reaches.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|24}}  For the largest recorded flood at any specific location, or any potentially larger event, the recurrence interval always is poorly known.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|20,24}}  Spatial variability adds more uncertainty, because a flood peak observed at different locations on the same stream during the same event commonly represents a different recurrence interval at each location.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|20}}  If an extreme storm drops enough rain on one branch of a river to cause a 100-year flood, but no rain falls over another branch, the flood wave downstream from their junction might have a recurrence interval of only 10 years. Conversely, a storm that produces a 25-year flood simultaneously in each branch might form a 100-year flood downstream. During a time of flooding, news accounts necessarily simplify the story by reporting the greatest damage and largest recurrence interval estimated at any location. The public can easily and incorrectly conclude that the recurrence interval applies to all stream reaches in the flood area.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|7,24}}

==Observed intervals between floods==
Peak elevations of 14 floods as early as 1501 on the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany, reveal great variability in the actual intervals between floods.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|16–19}}  Flood events greater than the 50-year flood occurred at intervals of 4 to 192 years since 1501, and the 50-year flood of 2002 was followed only 11 years later by a 500-year flood. Only half of the intervals between 50- and 100-year floods were within 50 percent of the nominal average interval. Similarly, the intervals between 5-year floods during 1955 to 2007 ranged from 5 months to 16 years, and only half  were within 2.5 to 7.5 years.
[[File:Passau flood history.svg|thumb|left|Observed intervals between floods at Passau, 1501-2013]]

==Regulatory use==
In the United States, the 100-year flood provides the risk basis for [[flood insurance]] rates. Complete information on the [[National Flood Insurance Program]] (NFIP) is available [http://www.floodsmart.gov/ here.] A ''regulatory flood'' or ''base flood'' is routinely established for river reaches through a science-based rule-making process targeted to a 100-year flood at the historical average recurrence interval. In addition to historical flood data, the process accounts for previously established regulatory values, the effects of flood-control reservoirs, and changes in land use in the watershed. [[Coastal flood]] hazards have been mapped by a similar approach that includes the relevant physical processes. Most areas where serious floods can occur in the United States have been mapped consistently in this manner. On average nationwide, those 100-year flood estimates are well sufficient for the purposes of the NFIP and offer reasonable estimates of future flood risk, if the future is like the past.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|24}} Approximately 3% of the U.S. population lives in areas subject to the 1% annual chance coastal flood hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crowell|first1=Mark|last2=others|title=An estimate of the U.S. population living in 100-year coastal flood hazard areas|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|date=2010|volume=26|issue=2|pages=201–211|doi=10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-09-00076.1|url=http://www.floods.org/PDF/JCR_Est_US_Pop_100y_CFHA_2010.pdf|accessdate=6 March 2016|ref=Crowell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, removing homes and businesses from areas that flood repeatedly can protect people and reduce insurance losses, but in practice it is difficult for people to retreat from established neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="schwartz"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=Jen |title=Surrendering to rising seas |journal=Scientific American |date=1 August 2018 |volume=319 |issue=2 |pages=44-55 |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/surrendering-to-rising-seas/ |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adolf Dygasiński''' (March 7, 1839, [[Niegosławice, Pińczów County|Niegosławice]]–June 3, 1902, [[Grodzisk Mazowiecki]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] novelist, publicist and educator. In [[Polish literature]], he was one of the leading representatives of [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]]. 
==Life==
During his literary career, Dygasiński wrote forty-two short stories and novels. 
Since 1884 his works were being published in book-form and enjoyed considerable success. 
They were translated into Russian and German. 
In 1891, Dygasiński went on a trip to Brazil on a trail of Polish emigrants from [[Partitioned Poland]]. 
He produced a series of letters describing the tragic fate of Polish emigrees in South America. In the following years Dygasiński maintained a position of a tutor and coach for numerous wealthy landowning families. Late in life he settled in [[Warsaw]], where he died on June 6, 1902, and was buried at the local [[Powązkowski Cemetery]].

==Works== 
In his work Dygasiński often focused on topics of rural life and residents of small towns, highlighting the common fate of both, human and animal communities. Some of his most important work include: 

*Wilk, psy i ludzie (Wolf, dogs and humans; 1883) 
*Ogólne zasady pedagogiki dotyczące wykształcenia umysłu, uczuć, moralności i religijności (General principles of teaching in the education of mind, emotions, morality, and religion; 1883)

'''Bast fibre''' (also called '''phloem fibre''' or '''skin fibre''') is [[plant fibre]] collected from the [[phloem]] (the "inner bark", sometimes called "skin") or '''bast''' surrounding the stem of certain [[dicotyledon]]ous [[plant]]s. They support the conductive cells of the phloem and provide strength to the stem. Some of the economically important bast fibres are obtained from herbs cultivated in agriculture, as for instance [[flax]], [[hemp]], or [[ramie]], but also bast fibres from wild plants, as [[stinging nettle]], and trees such as [[Tilia|lime or linden]], [[wisteria]], and [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]] have been used in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Textiles in Daily Life: Proceedings of the Third Biennial Symposium of the Textile Society of America, September 24–26 1992 |chapter=A Wisteria Grain Bag And Other Tree Bast Fiber Textiles Of Japan |chapter-url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/tsaconf/569/ |author=Mary Dusenbury |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bast fibres are classified as soft fibres, and are flexible.&lt;ref name=Esau&gt;{{cite book |author=Esau, K. |date=12 January 1977  |title=Anatomy of seed plants |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-24520-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fibres from [[monocotyledon]]ous plants, called "leaf fibre", are classified as hard fibres and are stiff.&lt;ref name=Esau/&gt;

Since the valuable fibres are located in the phloem, they must often be separated from the [[xylem]] material ("woody core"), and sometimes also from the [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]. The process for this is called [[retting]], and can be performed by micro-organisms either on land (nowadays the most important) or in water, or by chemicals (for instance [[high pH]] and [[chelating]] agents) or by [[pectin]]olytic [[enzyme]]s. In the phloem, bast fibres occur in bundles that are glued together by [[pectin]] and [[calcium]] [[ion]]s. More intense retting separates the fibre bundles into elementary fibres, that can be several centimetres long. Often bast fibres have higher [[tensile strength]] than other kinds, and are used in high-quality [[textile]]s (sometimes in blends with cotton or synthetic fibres), [[rope]]s, [[yarn]], [[paper]], [[composite material]]s and [[burlap]]. An important property of bast fibres is that they contain a special structure, the ''fibre node'', that represents a weak point, and gives flexibility. Seed hairs, such as cotton, do not have nodes.

==Use of bast fibre==
Plants that have been used for bast fibre include [[flax]] (from which [[linen]] is made), [[hemp]], [[jute]], [[kenaf]], [[kudzu]], [[tilia|linden]], [[milkweed]], [[Urtica dioica|nettle]], [[okra]], [[paper mulberry]], [[ramie]], and [[roselle hemp]].

Bast fibres are processed for use in [[carpet]], [[yarn]], [[rope]], [[geotextile]] (netting or matting), traditional carpets, [[burlap|hessian or burlap]], [[paper]], sacks, etc. Bast fibres are also used in the [[non-woven]], moulding, and composite technology industries for the manufacturing of non-woven mats and carpets, composite boards as furniture materials, automobile door panels and headliners, etc.  From prehistoric times through at least the early twentieth century, [[bast shoe]]s were woven from bast strips in the forest areas of Eastern Europe.

Where no other source of [[tanbark]] was available, bast has also been used for [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] leather.&lt;ref name="HCC, Juchten"&gt;{{Cite web

The '''buttered toast phenomenon''' is an [[observation]] that [[butter]]ed [[toast]] tends to land butter-side down after it falls. It is used an [[idiom]] representing pessimistic outlooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/butter-side-down.html|title='Why does bread always fall buttered side down?' - the meaning and origin of this phrase|last=Martin|first=Gary|website=Phrasefinder|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various people have attempted to determine whether there is an actual tendency for bread to fall in this fashion, with varying results.

==Origins==

The phenomenon is said to be an old proverb from "the north country." Written accounts can be traced to the mid-19th century. The phenomenon is often attributed to a parodic poem of [[James Payn]] from 1884:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Apperson|first1=George Latimer|title=Dictionary of Proverbs|date=2005|publisher=Wordsworth Editions Ltd.|location=Ware|isbn=1840223111|pages=69–70|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7PMZJqSR4sAC&amp;dq=I%27ve+never+had+a+piece+of+toast+Particularly+long+and+wide%2C+But+fell+upon+the+sanded+floor%2C+And+always+on+the+buttered+side.&amp;q=buttered+toast#v=onepage&amp;q=buttered&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgaUQc8NbTYC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%C2%A0James+Payn+from+1884+butter+side+down&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eUG4bkloJ2&amp;sig=SAta2G677ttPbqmzrWIsGij9iIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE6L-pw7vUAhUR92MKHQOHAhcQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0James%20Payn%20from%201884%20butter%20side%20down&amp;f=false|title=The Facts on File Dictionary of Proverbs|last=Manser|first=Martin H.|date=2007|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|isbn=9780816066735|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I never had a slice of bread,&lt;br /&gt;
Particularly large and wide,&lt;br /&gt;

In the past, this has often been considered just a pessimistic belief. A study by the [[BBC]]'s television series ''[[Q.E.D. (BBC TV series)|Q.E.D.]]'' found that when toast is thrown in the air, it lands butter-side down just one-half of the time (as would be predicted by chance).&lt;ref name=Anthromurphic /&gt; However, several scientific studies have found that when toast is dropped from a table (as opposed to being thrown in the air), it does fall butter-side down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Breakfast at Murphy's (or why the toast lands butter-side down) |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1331810/Breakfast-at-Murphys-or-why-the-toast-lands-butter-side-down.html |accessdate=19 December 2012 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=27 May 2001 |first=Robert |last=Matthews |author-link=Robert Matthews (scientist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=R.

== Explanation ==

When toast falls out of one's hand, it does so at an angle, by nature of it having slipped from its previous position, then the toast rotates. Given that tables are usually between two and six feet (0.7 to 1.83 meters), there is enough time for the toast to rotate about one-half of a turn, and thus lands upside down relative to its original position. Since the original position is usually butter-side up, the toast lands butter-side down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Buttered Toast and Other Patterns |url=https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_july_98.html |date=July 1998 |website=[[Mathematical Association of America]] |first=Keith |last=Devlin |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the table is over 10 feet (3 meters) tall, the toast will rotate a full 360 degrees, and land butter-side up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite show |title=Butter Side Down |url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/butter-side-down/ |series=[[The Naked Scientists]] |network=[[BBC]] |date=16 December 2007 |first1=Ben |last1=Valsler |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, if the toast travels horizontally at over 3.6 miles per hour (1.6&amp;nbsp;m/s), the toast will not rotate enough to land butter-side down.&lt;ref name=Anthromurphic&gt;{{cite web |title=The Anthropomurphic Principle |url=http://www.whydomath.org/Reading_Room_Material/ian_stewart/anthro/anthro.html |website=Why Do Math? |publisher=[[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] |first=Ian |last=Stewart |date=1995 |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the phenomenon is caused by fundamental [[physical constant]]s.&lt;ref name="European-Journal"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Matthews |first=R A J |author-link=Robert Matthews (scientist) |title=Tumbling toast, Murphy's Law and the fundamental constants|journal=[[European Journal of Physics]] |date=18 July 1995 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=172–176 |doi=10.1088/0143-0807/16/4/005 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0143-0807/16/4/005 |accessdate=24 April 2013 |bibcode = 1995EJPh...16..172M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other factors==

The added weight of the butter has no effect on the falling process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why does a falling piece of toast always seem to land on the buttered side? |url=http://www.how-come.net/2009/08/17/why-does-a-falling-piece-of-toast-always-seem-to-land-on-the-buttered-side/ |publisher=How Come? |date=2009-08-17 |first=Kathy |last=Wollard |accessdate=21 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830231610/http://www.how-come.net/2009/08/17/why-does-a-falling-piece-of-toast-always-seem-to-land-on-the-buttered-side/ |archivedate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the butter spreads throughout the slice.&lt;ref name=Anthromurphic /&gt;

{{quote
|text=The mass of butter added to toast ( ~4g ) is small compared to the mass of the typical slice of toast (~35g), is spread thinly, and passes into the body of the toast. Its contribution to the total movement of inertia of the toast and rotational dynamics, thus its effect on the toast is negligible.

The following findings are from Mythbusters:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mythbusterstheexhibition.com/science-content/butter-side-up/#article|title=Mythbusters Museum|website=Mythbusters Museum|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Period of Rotation''': The usual scenario for a falling piece of toast is that a non-rotating slice slides or careens off a horizontal surface, such as a plate or table, over a fairly straight lip, which serves as a momentary fulcrum. In this scenario, the leading edge (or corner) is subject to the downward acceleration of gravity—without a countering force from the horizontal surface—sooner than the trailing edge (or corner). The interval where the leading edge of the toast is accelerating downward faster than the trailing edge imparts angular momentum. Once the toast begins to fall freely, air resistance governs any further change in angular momentum, with the toast serving as a complex airfoil (extremely difficult to analyze, especially if the toast has large, irregular holes). For a short fall, the initial angular momentum will dominate. The period of rotation is the time it takes for the toast to complete a full 360 degree spin. The problem for toast, in the typical case, is that the floor interrupts its fall somewhere in between a 90 degree and 270 toast rotation—this will cause the toast to go from butter-side-up to butter-side-down. With a higher the release point, there is a greater the chance for it to rotate beyond 270 degrees and consequently land butter-side-up. An even higher release point could cause the toast to rotate more than once, and again land butter-side down, but this is no longer a short fall at low velocity, and turbulence in this case should not be neglected. (Frisbee toast would resist the fulcrum torque due to [[gyroscopic effect]]s and probably not accord with this analysis.) 
* '''Moment of Inertia''': At the moment a piece of toast begins flipping towards the kitchen floor, it has inertia—it doesn’t want to stop flipping if it doesn’t have to. Its moment of inertia is determined by the speed at which the toast is flipping, combined with the size and mass of the toast. Most breakfast toast is about the same size and mass, unless you’re in Texas—home of the giant slices that carry the state name. But any way you slice it, the same rules apply. Add a little velocity to the spin as your breakfast goes sliding off your plate—give it a smack to add some inertia and see how it lands.
* '''Angular Momentum''': Just like a frisbee or a gyroscope, your toast gains stability when it spins. In fact, the faster it spins, the more stable it gets. This is angular momentum, or mass in motion around a single point, in action. Newton once claimed that a mass in motion likes to stay that way, and this is definitely true for toast. Once your toast is spinning, it wants to keep spinning—that is, until some other force acts on it, like the floor.

==In popular culture==
[[File:RamirezJelly.png|thumb|right|Ramirez's demonstration of the buttered toast phenomenon to prove that the devil is nearby.]]
In the 2010 [[M. Night Shyamalan]] film ''[[Devil (2010 film)|Devil]]'', a group of adults in an elevator become trapped by unknown forces. Slowly over the course of the film, people begin to die in the elevator as the power blinks on and off, pinning the people against each other and creating a false narrative that the others are murderers (However, it is common opinion that the name of the film spoiled this false narrative). In the film, supporting cast member and fictional security guard Ramirez, in his suspicion that there may be unholy forces at play, dropped a slice of toast with jelly on one side, and dropped it on the floor. The toast landed on the jelly-side, after which Ramirez coined the phrase "Jelly Side Down," and subsequently 'proved' that the devil was nearby. However, there is some dispute in the film about whether or not this did actually prove the devil was near.

This phenomenon was also demonstrated and parodied in the October 29, 2013 ''[[Nostalgia Critic]]'' review of ''Devil'', (Reuploaded on July 23, 2016 by [[Channel Awesome]] on YouTube) in which actor [[Doug Walker (actor)|Doug Walker]] plays a priest who uses multiple food items to determine whether or not the Devil is near. After the other items show no sign of the Devil, the priest tosses a piece of toast as the last test. The toast lands jelly side down which means the Devil is near and the end of the world is imminent. Everybody in the church screams and panics as the priest repeatedly shouts, "Jelly side down!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IPFmdbXvLvI|title=Devil - Nostalgia Critic season 6, episode 40|last=|first=|date=July 23, 2016|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 7, 2018|author=Doug and Rob Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coastal Hazards''' are physical phenomena that expose a coastal area to risk of property damage, loss of life and environmental degradation. Rapid-onset hazards last over periods of minutes to several days and examples include major cyclones accompanied by high winds, waves and surges or tsunamis created by [[submarine earthquake]]s and landslides. Slow-onset hazards develop incrementally over longer time periods and examples include erosion and gradual inundation.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, M. (2005) Encyclopaedia of Coastal Science, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
Since early civilisation, coastal areas have been attractive settling grounds for human population as they provided abundant marine resources, fertile agricultural land and possibilities for trade and transport. This has led to high population densities and high levels of development in many coastal areas and this trend is continuing into the 21st century. At present, about 1,2 billion people live in coastal areas globally, and this number is  predicted to increase to 1,8–5,2 billion by the 2080s due to a combination of population growth and coastal migration.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2007: http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/contents.html&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this increase follows major investments in infrastructure and the build environment.

The characteristics of coastal environments, however, pose some great challenges to human habitation. Coastlines are highly dynamic natural systems that interact with terrestrial, marine and atmospheric processes and undergo continuous change in response to these processes. Over the years, human society has often failed to recognize the hazards related to these dynamics &lt;ref&gt;Masselink &amp; Hughes, Coastal processes &amp; geomorphology, Arnold, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and this has led to major disasters and societal disruption to various degrees. Even today, coastal development is often taking place with little regard to the hazards present in these environments, although climate change is likely to increase the general hazard levels.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2014: http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/&lt;/ref&gt; Societal activities in coastal areas can also pose a hazard to the natural balance of coastal systems, thereby disrupting e.g. sensitive ecosystems and subsequently human livelihood.

Coastal hazard management has become an increasingly important aspect of coastal planning in order to improve the resilience of society to coastal hazards. Possible management options include hard engineering structures, soft protection measures, various accommodation approaches as well as a managed retreat from the coastline. For addressing coastal hazards, it is also important to have early warning systems and emergency management plans in place to be able to address sudden and potential disastrous hazards i.e. major flooding events. Events as the Hurricane Katrina affecting the southern USA in 2005 and the cyclone Nargis affecting Myanmar in 2008 provides clear examples of the importance of timely coastal hazard management.

== Coastal environments of the USA ==
There are many different types of environments along the coasts of the United States with very diverse features that affect, influence, and mold the near-shore processes that are involved.  Understanding these ecosystems and environments can further advance the mitigating techniques and policy-making efforts against natural and man-made coastal hazards in these vulnerable areas.  The five most common types of [[coastal zone]]s range from the northern ice-pushing, mountainous coastline of Alaska and Maine, the barrier island coasts facing the Atlantic, the steep, cliff-back [[Headlands and bays|headlands]] along the pacific coast, the marginal-sea type coastline of the Gulf region, and the coral reef coasts bordering Southern Florida and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Inman, Douglas L. "ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE IN THE COASTAL ZONE." Environmental Science in the Coastal Zone: Issues for Further Research. The National Academic Press. Web. 09 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2249&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ice-pushing/mountainous coastline'''

These coastal regions along the northernmost part of the nation were affected predominantly by, along with the rest of the Pacific Coast, continuous tectonic activity, forming a very long, irregular, ridged, steep and mostly mountainous coastline.  These environments are heavily occupied with permafrost and glaciers, which are the two major conditions affecting Alaska's Coastal Development.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Eric C. "Chapter 1.1 Alaska". ''Encyclopedia of the World's Coastal Landforms''. Dordrecht: Springer, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barrier island coastline'''

[[Barrier island]]s are a land form system that consists of fairly narrow strips of sand running parallel to the mainland and play a significant role in mitigating storm surges and oceans swells as natural storm events occur. The morphology of the various types and sizes of barrier islands depend on the wave energy, tidal range, basement controls, and sea level trends.  The islands create multiple unique environments of wetland systems including marshes, estuaries, and lagoons.&lt;ref&gt;"BarrierIslnd." Smithsonian Marine Station (SMS) at Fort Pierce. Web. 30 April 2012. &lt;http://www.sms.si.edu/IRLSpec/BarrierIslnd.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steep, cliff-backing abrasion coastline'''

The coastline along the western part of the nation consists of very steep, cliffed rock formations generally with vegetative slopes descending down and a fringing beach below.  The various sedimentary, metamorphic, and volcanic rock formations assembled along a tectonically disturbed environment, all with altering resistances running perpendicular, cause the ridged, extensive stretch of uplifted cliffs that form the peninsulas, lagoons, and valleys.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, B., and N. Sitar. "Processes of Coastal Bluff Erosion in Weakly Lithified Sands, Pacifica, California, USA." Geomorphology 97.3–4 (2008): 483–501. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marginal-sea type coastline'''

The southern banks of the United States border the Gulf of Mexico, intersecting numerous rivers, forming many inlets bays, and lagoons along its coast, consisting of vast areas of marsh and wetlands.  This region of landform is prone to natural disasters yet highly and continuously developed, with man-made structures attaining to water flow and control.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Eric C. "Chapter 1.1 Alaska". ''Encyclopedia of the World's Coastal Landforms''. Dordrecht: Springer, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coral reef coastline'''

[[Coral reef]]s are located off the shores of the southern Florida and Hawaii consisting of rough and complex natural structures along the bottom of the ocean floor with extremely diverse ecosystems, absorbing up to ninety percent of the energy dissipated from wind-generated waves.  This process is a significant buffer for the inner-lying coastlines, naturally protecting and minimizing the impact of storm surge and direct wave damage.  Because of the highly diverse ecosystems, these coral reefs not only provide for the shoreline protection, but also deliver an abundant amount of services to fisheries and  tourism, increasing its economic value.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, John. "Coral Reefs". Nature 40.1030 (1889): 294. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of Coastal Hazards ==

[[File:Hurricane Flooding.jpg|thumb|right|Hurricane Surge]]

'''Natural VS Human disasters'''

The population that lives along or near our coastlines are an extremely vulnerable population.  There are numerous issues facing our coastlines and there are two main categories that these hazards can be placed under, [[Natural disasters]] and Human disasters.  Both of these issues cause great damage to our coastlines and discussion is still ongoing regarding what standards or responses need to be met to help both the individuals who want to continue living along the coastline, while keeping them safe and not eroding more coastline away.  Natural disasters are disasters that are out of human control and are usually caused by the weather.  Disasters that include but are not limited to; [[storms]], [[tsunamis]], [[typhoons]], [[flooding]], [[tides]], [[waterspouts]], [[nor'easters]], and [[storm surge]].  Human disasters occur when humans are the main culprit behind why the disaster happened.  Some human disasters are but are not limited to; [[pollution]], [[trawling]], and human development. Natural and human disasters continue to harm the coastlines severely and they need to be researched in order to prepare/stop the hazards if possible.&lt;ref&gt;"Coastal hazards- natural," 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The populations that live near or along the coast experience many hazards and it affects millions of people.  Around ten million people globally feel the effects of coastal problems yearly and most are due to certain natural hazards like coastal flooding with storm surges and typhoons.&lt;ref&gt;Adger, N., &amp; Hughes, T.2005&lt;/ref&gt;  A major problem related to coastal regions deals with how the entire global environment is changing and in response, the coastal regions are easily affected.

'''Storms, Flooding and Erosion'''

Storms are one of the major hazards that are associated to coastal regions.  Storms, flooding, and erosion are closely associated and can happen simultaneously.  Tropical storms or Hurricanes especially can devastate coastal regions.  For example, Florida during [[Hurricane Andrew]] occurred in 1992 that caused extreme damage.  It was a category five hurricane that caused $26.5 billion in damages and even 23 individuals lost their lives from the storm.&lt;ref&gt;Adger, N., &amp; Hughes, T.2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Hurricane Katrina also caused havoc along the coast to show the extreme force a hurricane can do in a certain region.&lt;ref&gt;Burby, R. (n.d.). Hurricane katrina . Sage journals, Retrieved from http://ann.sagepub.com/content/604/1/171.short&lt;/ref&gt; The Chennai Floods of 2015, which affected many people, is an example of flooding due to cyclones. People across the whole state of Tamil Nadu felt its impact and even parts of Andhra Pradesh got affected. There was a loss of Rs.900 crore and 280 people died. Many cyclones like this happen across Asia but the media reports only minor hurricanes which hit the United States.

  In almost all cases, storms are the major culprit that causes flooding and erosion.  Flash flooding is caused by storms that occurs when a massive amount of rainfall comes down into an area over a short period of time.  Where as a storm surge, which is closely related to tropical storms, is when the wind collects and pushes water towards low pressure or inland and can rise rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;(2009).  Coastal hazards- natural disasters. Ocean science and stewardship, Retrieved from http://dels-old.nas.edu/oceans/coastal_hazards_part_2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an offshore rise of water and overall creates a higher sea level that rises and is pushed inland.  The amount of rise or fall of storm surge depends greatly on the amount and duration of wind and water in a specific location.  Also if it occurs during a high tide it can have an even greater effect on the coast.

Almost all storms with high wind and water cause erosion along the coast.  Erosion occurs when but not limited to; along shore currents, tides, sea level rise and fall, and high winds.  Larger amounts of erosion cause the coastline to erode away at a faster rate and can leave people homeless and leave less land to develop or keep for environmental reasons.  Coastal erosion has been increasing over the past few years and it is still on the rise which makes it a major coastline hazard.  In the United States, 45 percent of its coast line is along the Atlantic or Gulf coast and the erosion rate per year along the Gulf coast is at six feet a year.  The average rate of erosion along the Atlantic is around two to three feet a year.  Even with these findings, erosion rates in specific locations vary because of various environmental factors such as major storms that can cause major erosion upwards to 100 feet or more in only one day.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Homeland Security, FEMA or Federal Emergency Management Agency. (2000). Significant losses from coastal erosion anticipated along u.s. coastlines. Retrieved from website: http://www.fema.gov /news/newsrelease.fema?id=7708&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pollution, Trawling and Human Development'''
[[File:Loss of Property due to storms.jpg|thumb|right|North Carolina Homes being taken by the Atlantic Ocean 08-23-2011]]
Pollution, trawling, and human development are major human disasters that affect coastal regions.  There are two main categories related to pollution, [[point source pollution]], and [[nonpoint source pollution]].  Point source pollution is when there is an exact location such as a pipeline or a body of water that leads into the rivers and oceans.  Known dumping into the ocean is also another point source of pollution.  Nonpoint source pollution would pertain more to fertilizer runoff, and industrial waste.  Examples of pollution that affect the coastal regions are but are not limited to; fertilizer runoff, oil spills, and dumping of hazardous materials into the oceans.  More human acts that hurt the coastline are as follows; waste discharge, fishing, dredging, mining, and drilling.&lt;ref&gt;Inman, D. (n.d.). Types of coastal zones: similarities and differences. Retrieved from http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2249&amp;page=67&lt;/ref&gt;  Oil spills are one of the most hazardous dangers towards coastal communities.  They are hard to contain, difficult to clean up, and devastate everything.  The fish, animals such as birds, the water, and especially the coastline near the spill.  The most recent oil spill that had everybody concerned with oil spill was the [[BP oil spill]].

Trawling hurts the normal ecosystems in the water around the coastline.  It depletes all ecosystems on the ocean floor such as, flounder, shellfish, marsh etc.. It is simply a giant net that is drug across the ocean floor and destroys and catches anything in its path.  Human development is one of the major problems when facing coastal hazards.  The overall construction of buildings and houses on the coast line takes away the natural occurrences to handle the fluctuation in water and sea level rise.  Building houses in pre-flood areas or high risk areas that are extremely vulnerable to flooding are major concerns towards human development in coastal regions.  Having houses and buildings in areas that are known to have powerful storms that will create people to be in risk by living there.  Also pertaining to barrier islands, where land is at risk for erosion but they still continue to build there anyway.  More and more houses today are being taken by the ocean; look at picture above.

'''Coastal hazards &amp; climate change'''

The predicted climate change is adding an extra risk factor to human settlement in coastal areas. Whereas the natural dynamics that shape our coastlines have been relatively stable and predictable over the last centuries, much more rapid change is now expected in processes as sea level rise, ocean temperature and acidity, tropical storm intensity and precipitation/runoff patterns.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2013: Summary for Policymakers. In: Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Stocker, T.F., D. Qin, G.-K. Plattner, M. Tignor, S.K. Allen, J. Boschung, A. Nauels, Y. Xia, V. Bex and P.M. Midgley (eds.)]. 
Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA. http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The world's coastlines will respond to these changes in different ways and at different pace depending on their bio-geophysical characteristics, but generally society will have to recognize that past coastal trends cannot be directly projected into the future. Instead, it is necessary to consider how different coastal environments will respond to the predicted climate change and take the expected future hazards into account in the coastal planning processes.

== Policies ==

'''National Flood Insurance Program'''

The National Flood Insurance Program or [[NFIP]] was instituted in 1968 and offers home owners in qualifying communities an opportunity to rebuild and recover after flooding events following the decision by insurance companies to discontinue providing flood insurance. This decision was made on behalf of the private insurers after continually high and widespread flood losses. The goals of this program are to not only better protect individuals from flood, but to reduce property losses, and reduce the total amount disbursed for flood loses by the government. Only communities which have adopted and implemented mitigation policies that are compliant with or exceed federal regulations. The regulatory policies reduce risk to life and property located within floodplains. The NFIP also comprehensively mapped domestic floodplains increasing public awareness of risk.  The majority of structures were constructed after the mapping was completed and risk could be assessed. To reduce the cost to these owners, which constitute roughly 25% of the total policies the rates for insurance are subsidized.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration. National Flood Insurance Program: Program Description. U.S. Government Press, August 1, 2002 Retrieved from website: http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=1480&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coastal States Organization'''

The [[Coastal States Organization]] or COS was established in 1970 to represent 35 U.S. sub-federal governments on issues of coastal policies. CSO lobbies Congress on issues pertaining to Coastal Policy allowing states input on federal policy decisions. Funding, support, water quality, coastal hazards, and coastal zone management are the primary issues COS promotes. The strategic goals of COS are to provide information and assistance to members,evaluate and manage coastal needs, and secure long term funding for member states initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;About COS. (2012). Retrieved from http://www.coastalstates.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coastal Zone Management Act'''

In 1972 the [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] or CZMA works to streamline the policies which states create to a minimum federal standard for environmental protection. CZMA establishes the national policy for the development and implementation of regulatory programs for coastal land usage, which is supposed to be reflected in state legislation such as CAMA. CZMA also provides minimum building requirements to make the insurance provided through the NFIP less expensive for the government to operate by mitigating losses. Congress found that it was necessary to establish the minimum which programs should provide for. Each coastal state is required to have a program with 7 distinct parts: Identifying land uses,Identifying critical coastal areas, Management measures,Technical assistance, Public participation, Administrative coordination, State coastal zone boundary modification.&lt;ref&gt;(1972). 16 usc chapter 33 – coastal zone management.

'''The Coastal Area Management Act'''

The Coastal Area Management Act or CAMA is policy that was implemented by the state of North Carolina in 1974 to work in-tandem with the CZMA. It creates a cooperative program between the state and local governments. The State government operates in an advisory capacity and reviews decisions made by local government planners. The goal of this legislation was to create a management system capable of preserving the coastal environment, insure the preservation of land and water resources, balance the use of coastal resources and establish guidelines and standards for conservations, economic development, tourism, transportation, and the protection of common law.&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources, Division of Coastal Management.

== Management and planning ==

Due to the increasing urbanization along the coastlines, planning and management are essential to protecting the ecosystems and environment from depleting. [[Coastal management]] is becoming implemented more because of the movement of people to the shore and the hazards that come with the territory. Some of the hazards include movement of [[barrier island]]s, [[sea level rise]], [[hurricane]]s, [[nor'easter]]s, [[earthquake]]s, [[flooding]], [[erosion]], [[pollution]] and human development along the coast. The [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] (CZMA)  was created in 1972 because of the continued growth along the coast, this act introduced better management practices such as [[integrated coastal zone management]], [[adaptive management]] and the use [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]] strategies when planning. According to the Coastal Zone Management Act, the objectives are to remain balanced to "preserve, protect, develop, and where possible, to restore or enhance the resources of the nation's coastal zone".&lt;ref&gt;National oceanic and atmospheric administration. (2011). Retrieved from http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/czm/czm_act.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The development of the land can strongly affect the sea,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, J. Coastal zone management handbook. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ZHvKDJSg1PEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=management of coastal hazards&amp;ots=bwKAk06AoG&amp;sig=b9_iBP7OykljD0qtF9BkJutiEUw&lt;/ref&gt; for example the engineering of structures versus non-structures and the effects of erosion along the shore.

'''Integrated coastal zone management'''

Integrated coastal zone management means the integration of all aspects of the coastal zone; this includes environmentally, socially, culturally politically and economically to meet a sustainable balance all around. Sustainability is the goal to allow development yet protect the environment in which we develop. Coastal zones are fragile and do not do well with change so it is important to acquire sustainable development. The integration from all views will entitle a holistic view for the best implementation and management of that country, region and local scales. The five types of integration&lt;ref&gt;CICIN-SAIN, B. 1993. Sustainable Development and Integrated Coastal Management. Ocean and Coastal Management, 21, 11–43.&lt;/ref&gt; include integration among sectors, integration between land and water elements of the coastal zone, integration amount levels of government, integration between nations and integration among disciplines are all essential to meet the needs for implementation.
Management practices include
#maintaining the functional integrity of the coastal resource systems,without disrupting the environment
#reducing resource-use conflicts, by making sure resources are used adequately and sustainably,
#maintaining the health of the environment, which means to protect the ecosystems and natural cycle,
#facilitating the progress of multisectoral development, which means allowing developers to develop within standards.&lt;ref&gt;THIA-ENG, C. 1993. Essential Elements of Integrated Coastal Zone Management. Ocean and Coastal Management, 21, 81–108.&lt;/ref&gt;
These four management practices should be based on a bottom-up approach, meaning the approach starts from a local level which is more intimate to the specific environment of that area. After assessment from the local level, the state and federal input can be implemented. The bottom-up approach is key for protecting the local environments because there is a diversity of environments that have specific needs all over the world.

'''Adaptive management'''
[[File:Managing Coastal Hazards.gif|thumb|left| Managing Coastal Hazards Chart]]
Adaptive management is another practice of development adaptation with the environment. Resources are the major factor when managing  adaptively to a certain environment to accommodate all the needs of development and ecosystems. Strategies used must be flexible by either passive or active adaptive management include these key features:&lt;ref&gt;Elzinga, C.L., D. W. Salzer, J. W. Willoughby (1998). Measuring and Monitoring Plant Populations. Denver, CO: Bureau of Land Management. BLM Technical Reference 1730-1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*AIterative decision-making (evaluating results and adjusting actions on the basis of what has been learned)
*Feedback between monitoring and decisions (learning process)
*Explicit characterization of system uncertainty through multi-model inference (experimentation)
*Embracing risk and uncertainty as a way of building understanding (trial and error)
To achieve adaptive management is testing the assumptions to achieve a desired outcome, such as trial and error, find the best known strategy then monitoring it to adapt to the environment, and learning the outcomes of success and failures of a project.

'''Mitigation'''
[[File:Cape Hatteras Lighthouse Relocation due to high energy wave activity.jpg|thumb|right|Relocation of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, NC, Failure of groin to protect the coast]]
The purpose of [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]] is not only to minimize the loss of property damage, but minimize environmental damages due to development. To avoid impacts by not taking or limiting actions, to reduce or rectify impacts by rehabilitation or restoring the affected environments or instituting long-term maintenance operations and compensating for impacts by replacing or providing substitute environments for resources&lt;ref&gt;Race, Margret. , &amp; Christie, Donna, (n.d.). Coastal zone development: Mitigation and decision-making. 6(4), 317–328. Retrieved from http://www.springerlink.com/content/r078478127573341/fulltext.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Structural mitigation is the current solution to eroding beaches and movement of sand is the use of engineered structures along the coast have been short lived and are only an illusion of safety to the public that result in long term damage of the coastline.  Structural management deals with the use of the following: groins which are man-made solution to [[longshore drift|longshore current]] movements up and down the coast. The use of groins are efficient to some extent yet cause erosion and sand build up further down the beaches. Bulkheads are man-made structures that help protect the homes built along the coast and other bodies of water that actually induce erosion in the long run. Jetties are structures built to protect sand movement into the inlets where boats for fishing and recreation move through.
The use of nonstructural mitigation is the practice of using organic and soft structures for solutions to protect against coastal hazards. These include: artificial dunes, which are used to create dunes that have been either developed on or eroded. There needs to be at least two lines of dunes before any development can occur. Beach Nourishment is a major source of nonstructural mitigation to ensure that beaches are present for the communities and for the protection of the coastline. Vegetation is a key factor when protecting from erosion, specifically for to help stabilize dune erosion.

[[File:Castle_Union.jpg|thumb|[[Mushroom cloud]] with multiple condensation rings from the [[Castle Union]] 6.9 Mt hydrogen bomb test]]

A transient '''condensation cloud''', also called '''Wilson cloud''', is observable at large [[explosion]]s in [[humidity|humid]] air.

When a [[nuclear weapon]] or a large amount of a conventional [[explosive]] is detonated in sufficiently [[humidity|humid]] air, the "negative phase" of the [[shock wave]] causes a [[rarefaction]] (reduction in density) of the air surrounding the explosion, but not contained within it. This rarefaction results in a temporary cooling of that air, which causes a [[condensation]] of some of the water vapor contained in it. When the pressure and the temperature return to normal, the Wilson cloud dissipates.&lt;ref&gt;Glasstone, Samuel and Philip J. Dolan. ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', U.S. Dept. Of Defense/ Dept. Of Energy; 3rd Edition (1977), p. 631&lt;/ref&gt;

Since heat does not leave the affected air mass, this change of pressure is [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]], with an associated change of temperature. In humid air, the drop in temperature in the most rarefied portion of the shock wave can bring the air temperature below its [[dew point]], at which moisture condenses to form a visible [[cloud]] of microscopic water droplets. Since the pressure effect of the wave is reduced by its expansion (the same pressure effect is spread over a larger radius), the vapor effect also has a limited radius. Such vapor can also be seen in low pressure regions during [[g-force|high–g]] subsonic maneuvers of aircraft in humid conditions.

Scientists observing the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests in 1946 at [[Bikini Atoll]] named that transitory cloud a "Wilson cloud" because of its similarity to the appearance of the inside of a [[Wilson cloud chamber]], an instrument they would have been familiar with. (The cloud chamber effect is caused by a temporary reduction in pressure in a closed system and marks the tracks of electrically-charged [[sub-atomic particle]]s.) Analysts of later nuclear bomb tests used the more general term ''condensation cloud''.

The shape of the shock wave, influenced by different speed in different altitudes, and the temperature and humidity of different atmospheric layers determines the appearance of the Wilson clouds. During [[nuclear test]]s, '''condensation rings''' around or above the fireball are commonly observed. Rings around the fireball may become stable and form rings around the rising stem of the [[mushroom cloud]].

The lifetime of the Wilson cloud during nuclear [[air burst]]s can be shortened by the [[thermal radiation]] from the fireball, which heats the cloud above the dew point and evaporates the droplets.

The same kind of condensation cloud is sometimes seen above the wings of aircraft in a moist atmosphere. The top of a wing has a reduction of air pressure as part of the process of generating lift. This reduction in air pressure causes a cooling, just as above, and the condensation of water vapor. Hence, the small, transient clouds that appear.

The [[vapor cone]] of a [[transonic]] aircraft is another example of a condensation cloud.

'''Deistic evolution''' is a position in the [[origins debate]] which involves accepting the [[scientific]] evidence for [[evolution]] and age of the [[universe]] whilst advocating the view that a [[deist]]ic [[God]] created the universe but has not interfered since. The position is a counterpoint to [[theistic evolution]] and is endorsed by those who believe in both [[deism]] and the veracity of science.

==Various views on deistic evolution==

In ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8birAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT398&amp;dq=deistic+evolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAWoVChMI2NPFwPLdxgIViBo-Ch1TWwAE#v=onepage&amp;q=deistic%20evolution&amp;f=false Christian Theology]'', by Millard J. Erickson, 2013, is written:

{{quote|Although the term is rarely heard, deistic evolution is perhaps the best way to describe one variety of what is generally called theistic evolution. This is the view that God began the process of evolution, producing the first matter and implanting within the creation the laws its development has followed. Thus, he programmed the process and then withdrew from active involvement with the world, becoming, so to speak, Creator Emeritus. God is the Creator, the ultimate cause, but evolution is the means, the proximate cause. Thus, except for its view of the very beginning of matter, deistic evolution is identical to naturalistic evolution, for it denies that there is any direct activity by a personal God during the ongoing creative process.
Deistic evolution has little difficulty with the scientific data. There is a definite conflict, however, between deism's view of an absentee God and the biblical picture of a God who has been involved in a whole series of creative acts. In particular, both Genesis accounts of the origin of human beings indicate that God definitely and distinctly willed and acted to bring them into existence. In addition, deistic evolution conflicts with the scriptural doctrine of providence, according to which God is personally and intimately concerned with and involved in what is going on in the specific events within his entire creation.}}

The [[psychologist]] Steve Stewart-Williams&lt;ref&gt;[http://psy.swan.ac.uk/staff/stewart-williams/ Homepage for Dr Steve Stewart-Williams]&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''Darwin, God and the Meaning of Life'' (2010) states:

{{cquote|'''Deistic evolutionists hold that God created the universe and the laws of nature... but that once the ball was rolling, he ceased to intervene in the day-today running of the world or in the course of natural law. God was like the ether after Einstein: he no longer had any role to play in the universe'''.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Stewart-Williams ''Darwin, God and the Meaning of Life'' 2010 p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stewart-Williams further writes that deistic evolution strips [[God]] of what most religious believers consider central. Any deistic God is not around for [[prayer]]s, [[miracles]] or to intervene in people's lives and that because of this it is unpopular with [[monotheistic]] religions.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Stewart-Williams, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Deistic Evolution adheres to the concept of some form of God, but denies any personal God. A recent defender of deistic evolution was [[Michael Anthony Corey]], author of the book ''Back to Darwin: The Scientific Case for Deistic Evolution'' (1994).

Some scholars have written that [[Charles Darwin]] was an advocate of deistic evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Christian C. Young, Mark A. Largent ''Evolution and Creationism: A Documentary and Reference Guide'' 2007, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Deistic evolution is similarly the operative idea  in [[Pandeism]], which has been counted amongst the handful of spiritual beliefs which "are compatible with modern [[science]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|quote=Some of us think that postmodernity represents a similar change of dominant worldviews, one which could turn out to be just as singular as modernity by being a stunning amalgam of James and Weber. If we are correct, then the changed attitudes, assumptions, and values might work together to change ways of life which in turn transform our geographies of mind and being, that is, both the actual physical landscapes and the mental valuescapes we inhabit. One increasingly common outcome of this ongoing transformation, itself a symptom perhaps of post-industrial secular societies, is the movement away from self-denial toward a denial of the supernatural. This development promises to fundamentally alter future geographies of mind and being by shifting the locus of causality from an exalted Godhead to the domain of Nature. How this Nature is ultimately defined has broad repercussions for the, at times, artificial distinction between religious and secular worldviews. For Levine (2011), "secularism is a positive, not a negative, condition, not a denial of the  world of spirit and of religion, but an affirmation of the world we're living in now ... such a world is capable of bringing us to the condition of 'fullness' that religion has always promised" (Levine quoted in Wood 2011). For others, this "fullness" is present in more religious-oriented pantheistic or pandeistic belief systems with, in the latter case, the inclusion of God as the ever unfolding expression of a complex universe with an identifiable beginning but no teleological direction necessarily present.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theistic predeterminism==
Deistic evolution is not the same as [[theistic evolution]], yet they are sometimes confused. The difference rests on the difference between a theistic god that is interested in, if not actively involved in, the outcome of his creation and humanity specifically and a [[deism|deistic god]] that is either disinterested in the outcome, and holds no special place for humanity, or will not intervene. Often, there is no discernible difference between the two positions—the choice of terminology has more to do with the believer and her or his need for a god, than fitting into a mostly arbitrary dictionary or academic definition.

==Criticism from Christian Creationists==

Deistic evolution has been criticised by Christian [[creationists]] as being incompatible with [[Christianity]] since it contradicts a literal reading of the [[Bible]] and more importantly, leaves no role for the "Christian personal God".&lt;ref&gt;James K. A. Smith, Amos Yong ''Science and the Spirit: A Pentecostal Engagement With the Sciences'' p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liberty: a magazine of religious freedom: Volumes 86-88, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

M. J. Erickson wrote that deistic evolution is in conflict with the scriptural doctrine of providence according to which "God is personally and intimately concerned with and involved in what is going on in the specific events within his entire creation."&lt;ref&gt;Erickson M.J., "Christian Theology", 1985, Baker, Grand Rapids, MI, pp. 480-481&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles P. Grannan wrote in 1894, "Another baseless assumption of negative critics is that the general principles of Atheistic and Deistic evolution, admitted by many scientists to account for the origin of the various species of plants and animals, should also be applied to explain the origin of the Christian religion."&lt;ref&gt;"Higher Criticism and the Bible," by Charles P. Grannan, DD, PhD, in ''The American Catholic Quarterly Review'', 1894, Volume 19, Page 577.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Wesley Rishell criticized the concept in 1899, comparing it to the notion (false, in his view), that [[gravity]] was a property of matter instead of a continued action of God:

{{quote|If evolution is God's method of creating he is still at work. Theistic Deism and evolution is possible, but deistic evolution is a contradiction in terms. Again, it is all a mere supposition that God created the world and endowed it with forces which will of necessity work out his will. It is impossible for us to say that God put forth energy in the beginning and then ceased. It is, to say the least, as probable that gravitation is a divine force constantly exerted on matter in a certain way as that it is a divine force deposited in matter once for all.&lt;ref&gt;''The Foundations of the Christian Faith'' by Charles Wesley Rishell, 1899, Page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Science==

Deistic evolution does not oppose or contradict [[evolution]] or come into conflict with [[science]] as it says that a God started the process and then left it to natural processes. However deism is still a religious philosophy.

Stewart-Williams wrote regarding deistic evolution and science:

{{cquote|'''Deistic evolution eliminates any immediate conflict between science and belief in God. Anyone who believes that God's role was merely to create the laws of nature can accept the scientific worldview in its totality; they simply add the proviso that 'God did it' - i.e., that God is responsible for the world that science describes'''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is considerable room for this "[[god of the gaps]]" view, since scientific observation is entirely unable to shed any light on what happened during the [[Planck epoch]], the earliest 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds in the history of the universe. All development since this initial creative act merely follows laws and principles which He created:

*God created the universe, perhaps using the "big bang" about 15,000 million years ago as his method. He set up basic laws to govern the running of the universe, and then left the scene entirely. God has not been seen since. The earth coalesced about 4 or 5 thousand million years ago without any input from God. Later, elementary life forms formed, which evolved into the animals and plant life that we see today through purely natural forces. It is essentially identical to naturalistic evolution, excepts that it reserves one action for God: that of initially creating the matter of the universe. This belief is common among Deists. [http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_world3.htm]
*Although the term is rarely heard, deistic evolution is perhaps the best way to describe one variety of what is generally called theistic evolution. This is the view that God began the process of evolution, producing the first matter and implanting within the creation the laws which its devel- opment has followed. Thus, he programmed the process. Then he withdrew from active involvement with the world, becoming, so to speak, Creator emeritus. The progress of the created order is free of direct influence by God. He is the Creator of everything, but only the first living form was directly created. All the rest of God's creating has been done indirectly. God is the Creator, the ultimate cause, but evolution is the means, the proximate cause. Thus, except for its view of the very beginning of matter, deistic evolution is identical to naturalistic evolution for it denies that there is any direct activity by a personal God during the ongoing creative process. [http://www.asa3.org/archive/evolution/199505-10/0171.html]

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] disagrees with the doctrine of deistic evolution. In November 2005, Pope Benedict addressed a general audience of 25,000 in [[St. Peter's Square]]:

:When the Pontiff finished his address, he put his papers to one side and commented on the thought of St. Basil the Great, a Doctor of the Church, who said that some, "deceived by the atheism they bear within them, imagined the universe deprived of a guide and order, at the mercy of chance. I believe the words of this fourth-century Father are of amazing timeliness," said Benedict XVI. "How many are these 'some' today? Deceived by atheism, they believe and try to demonstrate that it is scientific to think that everything lacks a guide and order," he continued.

'''Despeciation''' is the loss of a unique species of animal due to its combining with another previously distinct species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Despeciation|url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=24093|work=Stedman's Medical Dictionary|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the opposite of [[Speciation]] and is much more rare.  It is similar to extinction in that there is a loss of a unique [[species]] but without the associated loss of a biological lineage.

==Example of three-spined sticklebacks==
[[Image:Gasterosteus aculeatus.jpg|thumb|left|The [[three-spined stickleback]] (''Gasterosteus aculeatus'')]]
For example, Taylor et al.'s genetic analysis of [[three-spined stickleback]]s across six lakes in southwestern [[British Columbia]] found two distinct species in 1977 and 1988 but only one combined species in data from 1997, 2000, and 2002.&lt;ref name=MolEcol&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Taylor EB, Boughman JW, Groenenboom M, Sniatynski M, Schluter D, Gow JL|title=Speciation in reverse: morphological and genetic evidence of the collapse of a three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) species pair.|journal=Mol Ecol|date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They concluded that external factors had imperiled the living conditions of the two species, thus eliminating the evolutionary specializations that had kept them unique.

In energy monitoring and targeting, a '''driving factor''' is something recurrent and measurable whose variation explains variation in energy consumption. The term ''independent variable'' is sometimes used as a synonym.

One of the most common driving factors is the weather, expressed usually as heating or cooling [[degree day]]s. In energy-intensive processes, production throughputs would usually be used. For electrical circuits feeding outdoor lighting, the number of hours of darkness can be employed. For a borehole pump, the quantity of water delivered would be used; and so on. What these examples all have in common is that on a weekly basis (say) numerical values can be recorded for each factor and one would expect particular streams of energy consumption to correlate with them either singly or in a multi-variate model.

Correlation is arguably more important than causality. Variation in the driving factor merely has to ''explain'' variation in consumption; it does not necessarily have to ''cause'' it, although that will in most scenarios be the case.

Driving factors differ from ''static'' factors, such as building floor areas, which determine energy consumption but change only rarely (if at all).

Received [[radiation]] is unevenly distributed over the planet, because the Sun heats equatorial regions more than polar regions. The atmosphere and ocean work non-stop to even out solar heating imbalances through [[evaporation]] of surface water, convection, rainfall, winds, and ocean circulation. Earth is very close to being in [[radiative equilibrium]], the situation where the incoming solar energy is balanced by an equal flow of heat to space; under that condition, global temperatures will be ''relatively'' stable. Globally, over the course of the year, the Earth system—land surfaces, oceans, and atmosphere—absorbs and then radiates back to space an average of about 240 watts of solar power per square meter. Anything that increases or decreases the amount of incoming or outgoing energy will change global temperatures in response.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2009"&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Earth's energy balance and heat fluxes depend on many factors, such as atmospheric composition (mainly aerosols and greenhouse gases), the [[albedo]] (reflectivity) of surface properties, cloud cover and vegetation and land use patterns.

Changes in surface temperature due to Earth's energy budget do not occur instantaneously, due to the [[inertia]] of the [[ocean]]s and the [[cryosphere]]. The net heat flux is buffered primarily by becoming part of the [[ocean heat content|ocean's heat content]], until a new equilibrium state is established between radiative forcings and the climate response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Energy budget==
[[File:Earth_heat_balance_Sankey_diagram.svg|thumb|250px|left|A [[Sankey diagram]] illustrating the Earth's energy budget described in this section &amp;mdash; line thickness is linearly proportional to relative amount of energy.&lt;ref name="energy_budget" /&gt;]]
In spite of the enormous transfers of energy into and from the Earth, it maintains a relatively constant temperature because, as a whole, there is little net gain or loss: Earth emits via atmospheric and terrestrial radiation (shifted to longer electromagnetic wavelengths) to space about the same amount of energy as it receives via insolation (all forms of electromagnetic radiation).

To quantify Earth's ''heat budget'' or ''heat balance'', let the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere be 100 units (100 units = about 1,360 watts per square meter facing the sun), as shown in the accompanying illustration. Called the [[albedo]] of Earth, around 35 units are reflected back to space: 27 from the top of clouds, 2 from snow and ice-covered areas, and 6 by other parts of the atmosphere. The 65 remaining units are absorbed: 14 within the atmosphere and 51 by the Earth’s surface. These 51 units are radiated to space in the form of terrestrial radiation: 17 directly radiated to space and 34 absorbed by the atmosphere (19 through latent heat of condensation, 9 via convection and turbulence, and 6 directly absorbed). The 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere (34 units from terrestrial radiation and 14 from insolation) are finally radiated back to space. These 65 units (17 from the ground and 48 from the atmosphere) balance the 65 units absorbed from the sun in order to maintain zero net gain of energy by the Earth.&lt;ref name="energy_budget"&gt;

===Incoming radiant energy (shortwave)===

The total amount of energy received per second at the top of [[Earth's atmosphere]] (TOA) is measured in [[watt]]s and is given by the [[solar constant]] times the cross-sectional area of the Earth. Because the surface area of a sphere is four times the cross-sectional surface area of a sphere (i.e. the area of a circle), the average TOA flux is one quarter of the solar constant and so is approximately 340&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Earth's radiation balance and its representation in CMIP5 models|publisher=Copernicus|year=2013|author1=Wild, Martin |author2=Folini, Doris |author3=Schär, Christoph |author4=Loeb, Norman |author5=Dutton, Ellsworth |author6=König-Langlo, Gert |bibcode=2013EGUGA..15.1286W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the absorption varies with location as well as with diurnal, seasonal and annual variations, the numbers quoted are long-term averages, typically averaged from multiple satellite measurements.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

Of the ~340&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar radiation received by the Earth, an average of ~77&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected back to space by clouds and the atmosphere and ~23&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected by the surface [[albedo]], leaving ~240&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar energy input to the Earth's energy budget. This gives the earth a mean net albedo of 0.29.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

===Earth's internal heat and other small effects===
The [[Earth's internal heat budget|geothermal heat flux]] from the Earth's interior is estimated to be 47 [[terawatt]]s.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Davies, J. H., &amp; Davies, D. R. (2010). Earth's surface heat flux. Solid Earth, 1(1), 5–24.&lt;/ref&gt; This comes to 0.087&amp;nbsp;watt/square metre, which represents only 0.027% of Earth's total energy budget at the surface, which is dominated by 173,000 terawatts of incoming [[solar radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN=978-0-470-94341-0|author=Archer, D.|year=2012|title=Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World energy consumption|Human production of energy]] is even lower, at an estimated 18 TW.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Photosynthesis]] has a larger effect: [[photosynthetic efficiency]] turns up to 2% of incoming sunlight into [[primary production|biomass]], for a total photosynthetic productivity of earth between ~1500–2250 TW (~1%+/-0.26% solar energy hitting the Earth's surface).&lt;ref name="PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pisciotta JM, Zou Y, Baskakov IV |title=Light-Dependent Electrogenic Activity of Cyanobacteria |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=e10821 |year=2010 |pmid=20520829 |pmc=2876029 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010821|bibcode=2010PLoSO...510821P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other minor sources of energy are usually ignored in these calculations, including accretion of [[interplanetary dust]] and [[solar wind]], light from stars other than the Sun and the thermal radiation from space. Earlier, [[Joseph Fourier]] had claimed that deep space radiation was significant in a paper often cited as the first on the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William M. Connolley's page about Fourier 1827: MEMOIRE sur les temperatures du globe terrestre et des espaces planetaires|url=http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/fourier_1827/|last=Connolley|first=William M.|authorlink=William Connolley|publisher=William M. Connolley|date=18 May 2003|accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longwave radiation===
{{main|Outgoing longwave radiation}}
Longwave radiation is usually defined as outgoing [[infrared]] energy leaving the planet. However, the atmosphere absorbs parts initially, or cloud cover can reflect radiation. Generally, heat energy is transported between the planet's surface layers (land and ocean) to the atmosphere, transported via [[evapotranspiration]] and [[latent heat]] fluxes or [[thermal conduction|conduction]]/[[convection]] processes.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;  Ultimately, energy is radiated in the form of longwave [[Infrared#Earth as an infrared emitter|infrared radiation]] back into space.

Recent satellite observations indicate additional precipitation, which is sustained by increased energy leaving the surface through evaporation (the latent heat flux), offsetting increases in longwave flux to the surface.&lt;ref name=SatObsEva /&gt;

==Earth's energy imbalance==
If the incoming energy flux is not equal to the outgoing energy flux, net heat is added to or lost by the planet (if the incoming flux is larger or smaller than the outgoing respectively).

===Indirect measurement===
An imbalance must show in something on Earth warming or cooling (depending on the direction of the imbalance), and the ocean being the larger [[thermal reservoir]] on Earth, is a prime candidate for measurements.

Earth's energy imbalance measurements provided by [[Argo (oceanography)|Argo floats]] have detected an accumulation of [[ocean heat content]] (OHC). The estimated imbalance was measured during a deep [[solar minimum]] of 2005–2010 to be 0.58 ± 0.15&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="Imbalance"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=James Hansen |author2=Makiko Sato |author3=Pushker Kharecha |author4=Karina von Schuckmann |publisher=NASA|date=January 2012|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=Earth's Energy Imbalance}}&lt;/ref&gt; This level of detail cannot be inferred directly from measurements of surface energy fluxes, which have combined uncertainties of the order of ± 17&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An update on Earth's energy balance in light of the latest global observations|url = http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v5/n10/full/ngeo1580.html|journal = Nature Geoscience|date = 2012-10-01|issn = 1752-0894|pages = 691–696|volume = 5|issue = 10|doi = 10.1038/ngeo1580|first = Graeme L.|last = Stephens|first2 = Juilin|last2 = Li|first3 = Martin|last3 = Wild|first4 = Carol Anne|last4 = Clayson|first5 = Norman|last5 = Loeb|first6 = Seiji|last6 = Kato|first7 = Tristan|last7 = L'Ecuyer|first8 = Paul W. |last8 = Stackhouse Jr.|first9 = Matthew|last9 = Lebsock|bibcode = 2012NatGe...5..691S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct measurement ===
Several [[satellite]]s indirectly measure the energy absorbed and radiated by Earth and by inference the energy imbalance. The [[NASA]] [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite|Earth Radiation Budget Experiment]] (ERBE) project involves three such satellites: the [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite]] (ERBS), launched October 1984; NOAA-9, launched December 1984; and NOAA-10, launched September 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icp.giss.nasa.gov/education/radforce/ Effect of the Sun's Energy on the Ocean and Atmosphere (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today NASA's satellite instruments, provided by CERES, part of the NASA's [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS), are designed to measure both solar-reflected and Earth-emitted radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= B.A. Wielicki |display-authors=etal |title=Mission to Planet Earth: Role of Clouds and Radiation in Climate |journal=Bull.

==Natural greenhouse effect==

{{See also|Greenhouse effect}}
The major [[atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] gases ([[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]) are transparent to incoming sunlight but are also transparent to outgoing thermal ([[infrared]]) radiation. However, [[water vapor#Water vapor in Earth.27s atmosphere|water vapor]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and other trace gases are opaque to many [[wavelength]]s of thermal radiation. The Earth's surface radiates the net equivalent of 17 percent of the incoming [[solar radiation|solar energy]] in the form of thermal infrared. However, the amount that directly escapes to space is only about 12 percent of incoming solar energy. The remaining fraction, 5 to 6 percent, is absorbed by the atmosphere by [[greenhouse gas]] [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"&gt;Edited quote from public-domain source: {{citation

[[File:CO2 H2O absorption atmospheric gases unique pattern energy wavelengths of energy transparent to others.png|500px|thumb|Atmospheric gases only absorb some wavelengths of energy but are transparent to others. The absorption patterns of water vapor (blue peaks) and carbon dioxide (pink peaks) overlap in some wavelengths. Carbon dioxide is not as strong a greenhouse gas as water vapor, but it absorbs energy in wavelengths (12–15 micrometres) that water vapor does not, partially closing the "window" through which heat radiated by the surface would normally escape to space. (Illustration NASA, Robert Rohde)&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page7.php|title=NASA: Climate Forcings and Global Warming|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy, their temperature rises. Those gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in all directions. Heat radiated upward continues to encounter greenhouse gas molecules; those molecules also absorb the heat, and their temperature rises and the amount of heat they radiate increases. The atmosphere thins with [[altitude]], and at roughly 5–6&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre]]s, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the overlying atmosphere is so thin that heat can escape to space.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt;

Because greenhouse gas molecules radiate infrared energy in all directions, some of it spreads downward and ultimately returns to the Earth's surface, where it is absorbed. The Earth's surface temperature is thus higher than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating. This supplemental heating is the natural greenhouse effect.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt; It is as if the Earth is covered by a blanket that allows high frequency radiation (sunlight) to enter, but slows the rate at which the low frequency infrared radiant energy emitted by the Earth leaves.

==Climate sensitivity==
{{Main|Radiative forcing}}
A change in the incident radiated portion of the energy budget is referred to as a [[radiative forcing]].

[[Climate sensitivity]] is the [[steady state]] change in the equilibrium temperature as a result of changes in the energy budget.

===Climate forcings and global warming===
[[File:NASA Hansen Aerosol effect on expected energy imbalance Earth budget.gif|right|300px|thumb|Expected Earth energy imbalance for three choices of aerosol climate forcing. Measured imbalance, close to 0.6 W/m², implies that aerosol forcing is close to −1.6 W/m². (Credit: NASA/GISS)&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;]]
Climate forcings are changes that cause temperatures to rise or fall, disrupting the energy balance. Natural climate forcings include changes in the Sun's brightness, [[Milankovitch cycles]] (small variations in the shape of Earth's orbit and its axis of rotation that occur over thousands of years) and volcanic eruptions that inject light-reflecting particles as high as the [[stratosphere]]. Man-made forcings include particle pollution ([[aerosols]]) that absorb and reflect incoming sunlight; [[deforestation]], which changes how the surface reflects and absorbs sunlight; and the rising concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which decreases the rate at which heat is radiated to space.

A forcing can trigger [[feedback]]s that intensify ([[positive feedback]]) or weaken ([[negative feedback]]) the original forcing. For example, [[Arctic sea ice decline|loss of ice]] at the poles, which makes them less reflective, causes greater absorption of energy and so increases the rate at which the ice melts, is an example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings" /&gt;

The observed planetary energy imbalance during the [[solar cycle 24|recent solar minimum]] shows that solar forcing of climate, although natural and significant, is overwhelmed by anthropogenic climate forcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=NASA GISS: Science Brief: Earth's Energy Imbalance|website=www.giss.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[NASA]] scientists reported that to stop [[global warming]] atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content would have to be reduced to 350&amp;nbsp;ppm or less, assuming all other climate forcings were fixed. The impact of anthropogenic [[aerosols]] has not been quantified, but individual aerosol types are thought to have substantial heating and cooling effects.&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;

Earth's internal heat budget is fundamental to the [[thermal history of the Earth]].  The '''flow of heat from Earth's interior to the surface''' is estimated at &lt;math&gt;47 \pm 2&lt;/math&gt; [[terawatt]]s (TW)&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Davies, J. H., &amp; Davies, D. R. (2010).

== Heat and early estimate of Earth's age ==

Based on calculations of Earth's cooling rate, which assumed constant conductivity in the Earth's interior, in 1862 [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (later made Lord Kelvin) estimated the age of the Earth at 98 million years,&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, William. (1864). [http://courses.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/Courses/EPS281r/Sources/Earth-age-and-thermal-history/more/Kelvin-1863-excerpts.pdf On the secular cooling of the earth], read 28 April 1862. ''Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'', 23, 157–170.&lt;/ref&gt; which contrasts with the age of 4.5 billion years obtained in the 20th century by [[radiometric dating]].&lt;ref name="Taylor, S. R. 2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Martin J. van Kranendonk|editor2=Vickie Bennett|editor3=Hugh R.H.

Contrary to the usual representation of Kelvin's argument, the observed thermal gradient of the Earth's crust would not be explained by the addition of radioactivity as a heat source. More significantly, [[mantle convection]] alters how heat is transported within the Earth, invalidating Kelvin's assumption of purely conductive cooling.

== Global internal heat flow ==
[[File:Heat flow of the inner earth.jpg|thumb|300px|Cross section of the Earth showing its main divisions and their approximate contributions to Earth's total internal heat flow to the surface, and the dominant heat transport mechanisms within the Earth.]]

Estimates of the total heat flow from Earth’s interior to surface span a range of 43 to 49 terawatts (TW) (a terawatt is 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; [[watt]]s).&lt;ref name=Dye&gt;Dye, S. T. (2012). Geoneutrinos and the radioactive power of the Earth. Reviews of Geophysics, 50(3).&lt;/ref&gt; One recent estimate is 47&amp;nbsp;TW,&lt;ref name=Davies /&gt; equivalent to an average heat flux of 91.6&amp;nbsp;mW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and is based on more than 38,000 measurements. The respective mean heat flows of continental and oceanic crust are 70.9 and 105.4&amp;nbsp;mW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Davies /&gt;

While the total internal Earth heat flow to the surface is well constrained, the relative contribution of the two main sources of Earth's heat, radiogenic and primordial heat, are highly uncertain because their direct measurement is difficult. Chemical and physical models give estimated ranges of 15–41&amp;nbsp;TW and 12–30&amp;nbsp;TW for [[radiogenic heat]] and [[primordial heat]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Dye /&gt; 

The [[structure of the Earth]] is a rigid outer [[Crust (geology)|crust]] that is composed of thicker [[continental crust]] and thinner [[oceanic crust]], solid but plastically flowing [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], a liquid [[outer core]], and a solid [[inner core]]. The [[viscosity|fluidity]] of a material is proportional to temperature; thus, the solid mantle can still flow on long time scales, as a function of its temperature&lt;ref name=Turcotte /&gt; and therefore as a function of the flow of Earth's internal heat. The [[Mantle convection|mantle convects]] in response to heat escaping from Earth's interior, with hotter and more buoyant mantle rising and cooler, and therefore denser, mantle sinking. This convective flow of the mantle drives the movement of Earth's [[Lithosphere|lithospheric plates]]; thus, an additional reservoir of heat in the lower mantle is critical for the operation of plate tectonics and one possible source is an enrichment of radioactive elements in the lower mantle.&lt;ref name=Arevalo&gt;Arevalo Jr, R., McDonough, W. F., &amp; Luong, M. (2009). The K/U ratio of the silicate Earth: Insights into mantle composition, structure and thermal evolution. Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 278(3), 361–369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth heat transport occurs by [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]], [[mantle convection]], [[Hydrothermal circulation|hydrothermal convection]], and volcanic [[advection]].&lt;ref name=Jaupart&gt;Jaupart, C., &amp; Mareschal, J. C. (2007). Heat flow and thermal structure of the lithosphere. Treatise on Geophysics, 6, 217–251.&lt;/ref&gt; Earth's internal heat flow to the surface is thought to be 80% due to mantle convection, with the remaining heat mostly originating in the Earth's crust,&lt;ref&gt;Korenaga, J. (2003). Energetics of mantle convection and the fate of fossil heat. Geophysical Research Letters, 30(8), 1437.&lt;/ref&gt; with about 1% due to volcanic activity, earthquakes, and mountain building.&lt;ref name=Turcotte&gt;{{cite book|author1=Donald L. Turcotte|author2=Gerald Schubert|title=Geodynamics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nCHlVuJ4FoC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;focus=viewport&amp;q=primordial|date=25 March 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66624-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, about 99% of Earth's internal heat loss at the surface is by conduction through the crust, and mantle convection is the dominant control on heat transport from deep within the Earth. Most of the heat flow from the thicker continental crust is attributed to internal radiogenic sources, in contrast the thinner oceanic crust has only 2% internal radiogenic heat.&lt;ref name=Turcotte /&gt; The remaining heat flow at the surface would be due to basal heating of the crust from mantle convection. Heat fluxes are negatively correlated with rock age,&lt;ref name=Davies /&gt; with the highest heat fluxes from the youngest rock at [[mid-ocean ridge]] spreading centers (zones of mantle upwelling), as observed in the [[:File:Earth heat flow.jpg|global map of Earth heat flow]].&lt;ref name=Davies /&gt;

== Radiogenic heat ==
[[File:Evolution of Earth's radiogenic heat-with total.svg|thumb|300px|The evolution of Earth's [[radiogenic heat]] flow over time.]]

The [[radioactive decay]] of elements in the Earth's mantle and crust results in production of daughter [[isotope]]s and release of [[Geoneutrino|geoneutrinos]] and heat energy, or [[radiogenic heat]]. Four radioactive isotopes are responsible for the majority of radiogenic heat because of their enrichment relative to other radioactive isotopes: [[uranium 238|uranium-238]] (&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U), [[uranium 235|uranium-235]] (&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U), [[thorium-232]] (&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th), and [[potassium-40]] (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K).&lt;ref name="Korenaga 2011"&gt;Korenaga, J. (2011). Earth's heat budget: Clairvoyant geoneutrinos. Nature Geoscience, 4(9), 581–582.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a lack of rock samples from below 200&amp;nbsp;km depth, it is difficult to determine precisely the radiogenic heat throughout the whole mantle,&lt;ref name="Korenaga 2011" /&gt; although some estimates are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-01-01|title=Geophysical and geochemical constraints on geoneutrino fluxes from Earth's mantle|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X12006097|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|language=en|volume=361|pages=356–366|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2012.11.001|issn=0012-821X|arxiv=1207.0853|bibcode=2013E&amp;PSL.361..356S}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Earth's core, [[geochemical]] studies indicate that it is unlikely to be a significant source of radiogenic heat due to an expected low concentration of radioactive elements partitioning into iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=McDonough|first=W.F.|title=Compositional Model for the Earth's Core|date=2003|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B0080437516020156|work=Treatise on Geochemistry|pages=547–568|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/b0-08-043751-6/02015-6|isbn=9780080437514|access-date=2018-08-03|bibcode=2003TrGeo...2..547M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiogenic heat production in the mantle is linked to the structure of [[mantle convection]], a topic of much debate, and it is thought that the mantle may either have a layered structure with a higher concentration of radioactive heat-producing elements in the lower mantle, or small reservoirs enriched in radioactive elements dispersed throughout the whole mantle.&lt;ref name="Korenaga 2008" /&gt;

Geoneutrino detectors can detect the decay of &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th and thus allow estimation of their contribution to the present radiogenic heat budget, while &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K is not detectable.  Regardless, &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K is estimated to contribute 4&amp;nbsp;TW of heating.&lt;ref name="Gando"&gt;Gando, A., Dwyer, D. A., McKeown, R. D., &amp; Zhang, C. (2011). Partial radiogenic heat model for Earth revealed by geoneutrino measurements. Nature Geoscience, 4(9), 647–651.&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the short [[Half-life|half-lives]] the decay of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K contributed a large fraction of radiogenic heat flux to the early Earth, which was also much hotter than at present.&lt;ref name=Arevalo /&gt; Initial results from measuring the geoneutrino products of [[radioactive decay]] from within the Earth, a [[proxy (statistics)|proxy]] for radiogenic heat, yielded a new estimate of half of the total Earth internal heat source being radiogenic,&lt;ref name=Gando /&gt; and this is consistent with previous estimates.&lt;ref name="Korenaga 2008"&gt;Korenaga, J. (2008). Urey ratio and the structure and evolution of Earth's mantle. Reviews of Geophysics, 46(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primordial heat ==

Primordial heat is the heat lost by the Earth as it continues to cool from its original formation, and this is in contrast to its still actively-produced radiogenic heat. The Earth core's heat flow—heat leaving the core and flowing into the overlying mantle—is thought to be due to primordial heat, and is estimated at 5–15&amp;nbsp;TW.&lt;ref name=Lay&gt;Lay, T., Hernlund, J., &amp; Buffett, B. A. (2008). Core–mantle boundary heat flow. Nature Geoscience, 1(1), 25-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of mantle primordial heat loss range between 7 and 15&amp;nbsp;TW, which is calculated as the remainder of heat after removal of core heat flow and bulk-Earth radiogenic heat production from the observed surface heat flow.&lt;ref name= Dye /&gt;

The early formation of the Earth's dense core could have caused superheating and rapid heat loss, and the heat loss rate would slow once the mantle solidified.&lt;ref name=Lay /&gt; Heat flow from the core is necessary for maintaining the convecting outer core and the geodynamo and [[Earth's magnetic field]], therefore primordial heat from the core enabled Earth's atmosphere and thus helped retain Earth's liquid water.&lt;ref name="Korenaga 2008" /&gt;

== Heat flow and plate tectonics ==
[[File:Tectonic evolution of Earth.jpg|thumb|300px|Earth's tectonic evolution over time from a molten state at 4.5&amp;nbsp;Ga,&lt;ref name="Taylor, S. R. 2007"/&gt; to a single-plate lithosphere,&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt; to modern [[plate tectonics]] sometime between 3.2&amp;nbsp;Ga&lt;ref&gt;Pease, V., Percival, J., Smithies, H., Stevens, G., &amp; Van Kranendonk, M.

'''Earth mass''' ({{Earth mass}}, where ⊕ is the standard [[astronomical symbol]] for planet [[Earth]]) is the unit of [[mass]] equal to that of Earth. 
The current best estimate for Earth mass is {{math|{{Earth mass}} {{=}} {{val|5.9722|e=24|u=kg}}}}, with a [[standard uncertainty]] of 
{{val|6|e=20|u=kg}} (relative uncertainty 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;"[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/static/files/2016/Astronomical_Constants_2016.pdf 2016 Selected Astronomical Constants]" in {{citation | title = The Astronomical Almanac Online | url = http://asa.usno.navy.mil/ | publisher = [[United States Naval Observatory|USNO]]–[[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office|UKHO]]}}.

It is equivalent to an [[average density]] of {{val|5,515|u=kg⋅m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

The Earth mass is a standard [[units of mass|unit of mass]] in [[astronomy]] that is used to indicate the masses of other [[planet]]s, including rocky [[terrestrial planet]]s and [[exoplanet]]s. One [[Solar mass]] is close to 333,000 Earth masses.
The Earth mass excludes the mass of the [[Moon]]. The mass of the Moon is about 1.2% of that of the Earth, so that the mass of the Earth+Moon system is close to {{val|6.0456|e=24|u=kg}}.

Most of the mass is accounted for by  [[iron]] and [[oxygen]] (c. 32% each), [[magnesium]] and [[silicon]] (c. 15% each), [[calcium]], [[aluminium]] and [[nickel]] (c. 1.5% each).

Precise measurement of the Earth mass is difficult, as it is equivalent to measuring the [[gravitational constant]], which is the fundamental [[physical constant]] known with least accuracy, due to the relative weakness of the [[gravitational force]].
The mass of the Earth was measured accurately in the [[Schiehallion experiment]] in the 1770s, and within 1% of the modern value in the [[Cavendish experiment]] of 1798.

== Unit of mass in astronomy==
{{see|Solar mass|Standard gravitational parameter|Gaussian gravitational constant}}
The mass of Earth is estimated to be:
:&lt;math&gt;M_\oplus=(5.9722\;\pm\;0.0006)\times10^{24}\;\mathrm{kg}&lt;/math&gt;,
which can be expressed in terms of [[solar mass]] as:
:&lt;math&gt;M_\oplus=\frac{1}{332\;946.0487\;\pm\;0.0007}\;\mathrm{M_\odot} \approx 3.003\times10^{-6}\;\mathrm{M_\odot} &lt;/math&gt;.

These methods are less precise than observations of artificial satellites.

The relative uncertainty of the geocentric gravitational constant is just  {{val|2|e=-9}}, however, {{Earth mass}} (the mass of the Earth in kilograms) can be found out only by dividing the ''G''{{Earth mass}} product by ''G'', and ''G'' is known only to a relative uncertainty of 
{{val|4|e=-5}} at best, so {{Earth mass}} will have the same uncertainty. 
For this reason and others, astronomers prefer to use the un-reduced ''G''{{Earth mass}} product, or mass ratios
(masses expressed in units of Earth mass or [[Solar mass]])  rather than mass in kilograms when referencing and comparing planetary objects.

== History of measurement ==
{{main|Gravitational_constant#History_of_measurement}}
[[File:Mendenhall gravimeter pendulums.jpg|thumb|Pendulums used in Mendenhall [[gravimeter]] apparatus, from 1897 scientific journal. The portable gravimeter developed in 1890 by [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall|Thomas C. Mendenhall]] provided the most accurate relative measurements of the local gravitational field of the Earth.]]
The mass of Earth is measured indirectly by determining other quantities such as Earth's density, gravity, or gravitational constant.
The first measurement in the 1770s [[Schiehallion experiment]] resulted in a value about 20% too low.
The [[Cavendish experiment]] of 1798 found the correct value within 1%.
Uncertainty was reduced to about 0.2% by the 1890s,&lt;ref name="Poynting_p50-56"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Poynting|first=J.H.|title=The Earth: its shape, size, weight and spin|publisher=Cambridge|date=1913 |pages=50–56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA50}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
to 0.1% by 1930,&lt;ref&gt;P. R. Heyl, [https://archive.org/details/redeterminationo56124heyl A redetermination of the constant of gravitation], ''National Bureau of Standards Journal of Research''  5 (1930), 1243&amp;ndash;1290.&lt;/ref&gt;
and to 0.01% (10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt;) by the 2000s.
The [[figure of the Earth]] has been known to better than four significant digits since the 1960s ([[World Geodetic System|WGS66]]), so that since that time, the uncertainty of the Earth mass is determined essentially by the uncertainty in measuring the [[gravitational constant]].

===Early estimates===
Before the direct measurement of the [[gravitational constant]],
estimates of the Earth mass were limited to estimating Earth's mean density from observation of the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and estimates on Earth's volume. Estimates on the volume of the earth in the 17th century were based on a circumference estimate of 60 miles to the degree of latitude, corresponding to a radius of about 5,500&amp;nbsp;km, resulting in an estimated volume of about one third smaller than the correct value.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie2"&gt;Mackenzie, A. Stanley, ''[https://archive.org/stream/lawsgravitation01newtgoog#page/n6/mode/2up The laws of gravitation; memoirs by Newton, Bouguer and Cavendish, together with abstracts of other important memoirs]'', American Book Company (1900 [1899]), p. 2.
&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=-3JkAAAAcAAJ&amp;hl=sl&amp;pg=RA3-PT186 
Zedler, Universal-Lexicon (1747) gives "26625660000 cubic miles" [2.66e+10] as the volume of the Earth
based on a diameter of 1720 miles. These are German miles, 1 mile = 7,532.5 m.
This corresponds to a radius of 6,478 km, overestimated by about 1.7%, for an overestimation of the volume by some 5%,
as "2.66e+9 cubic miles", but the volume calculation is off by a factor of ten, probably just an additional zero.
--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
The average density of the Earth was not accurately known. Earth was assumed to consist either mostly of water ([[Neptunism]]) or mostly of [[igneous rock]] ([[Plutonism]]), both suggesting average densities too low by several orders of magnitude,
consistent with a total mass of the order of {{val|e=24|u=kg}}.
[[Isaac Newton]] estimated, without access to reliable measurement,  that the density of Earth would be five or six times as great as the density of water,&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Isaac Newton thought it probable, that the mean density of the earth might be five or six times as great as the density of water; and we have now found, by experiment, that it is very little less than what he had  thought it to be: so much justness was even in the surmises of this wonderful man!" Hutton (1778), p. 783&lt;/ref&gt; which is surprisingly accurate (the modern value is 5.515).
Newton under-estimated the Earth's volume by about 30%, so that his estimate would be roughly equivalent to {{val|4.2|0.5|e=24|u=kg}}.
 
In the 18th century, knowledge of  [[Newton's law of gravitation]] permitted indirect estimates on the mean density of the Earth, 
via estimates of (what in modern terminology is known as) the [[gravitational constant]].
Early estimates on the mean density of the Earth were made by observing  the slight deflection of a pendulum near a mountain, as in the [[Schiehallion experiment]].  Newton considered the experiment in ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', but pessimistically concluded that the effect would be too small to be measurable.

An expedition from 1737 to 1740 by   [[Pierre Bouguer]] and [[Charles Marie de La Condamine]] attempted to determine the density of Earth by measuring the period of a pendulum (and therefore the strength of gravity) as a function of elevation.  The experiments were carried out in Ecuador and Peru, on [[Pichincha Volcano]] and mount [[Chimborazo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferreiro|first=Larrie|title=Measure of the Earth: The Enlightenment Expedition that Reshaped Our World|year=2011|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-01723-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bouguer wrote in a 1749 paper that they had been able to detect a deflection of 8&amp;nbsp;[[second of arc|seconds of arc]],
The accuracy was not enough for a definite estimate on the mean density of the Earth, but Bouguer stated that it was at least sufficient to prove that the Earth was not [[hollow Earth|hollow]].&lt;ref name="Poynting_p50-56"/&gt;

===Schiehallion experiment===
{{main|Schiehallion experiment}}
That a further attempt should be made on the experiment was proposed to the [[Royal Society]] in 1772 by [[Nevil Maskelyne]], [[Astronomer Royal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maskelyne|first=N.|date=1772|title=A proposal for measuring the attraction of some hill in this Kingdom |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=65|pages=495–499 |bibcode=1775RSPT...65..495M|doi=10.1098/rstl.1775.0049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the experiment would "do honour to the nation where it was made" and proposed [[Whernside]] in [[Yorkshire]], or the [[Blencathra]]-[[Skiddaw]] massif in [[Cumberland]] as suitable targets. The Royal Society formed the Committee of Attraction to consider the matter, appointing Maskelyne, [[Joseph Banks]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] amongst its members.&lt;ref name="Danson_p115"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Danson|first=Edwin |title=Weighing the World |publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2006|pages=115–116|isbn=978-0-19-518169-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UNH_Y7ERFeoC&amp;pg=PA146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee despatched the astronomer and surveyor [[Charles Mason]] to find a suitable mountain.

After a lengthy search over the summer of 1773, Mason reported that the best candidate was [[Schiehallion]], a peak in the central [[Scottish Highlands]].&lt;ref name="Danson_p115" /&gt; The mountain stood in isolation from any nearby hills, which would reduce their gravitational influence, and its symmetrical east–west ridge would simplify the calculations. Its steep northern and southern slopes would allow the experiment to be sited close to its [[centre of mass]], maximising the deflection effect.
[[Nevil Maskelyne]], [[Charles Hutton]] and [[Reuben Burrow]] performed the experiment, completed by 1776.
Hutton (1778) reported that the mean density of the Earth was estimated at 
&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{9}{5}&lt;/math&gt; that of Schiehallion mountain.&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutton|first=C. |date=1778 |title=An Account of the Calculations Made from the Survey and Measures Taken at Schehallien |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=68 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1778.0034|issue=0 |url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/68/689.citation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This corresponds to a mean density about 4{{frac|1|2}} higher than that of water (i.e., about {{val|4.5|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}), about 20% below the modern value,  but still significantly larger than the mean density of normal rock, suggesting for the first time that the interior of the Earth might be substantially 
composed of metal.
Hutton estimated  this metallic portion to occupy some {{frac|20|31}} (or 65%) of the diameter of the Earth (modern value 55%).&lt;ref name=Hutton783&gt;Hutton (1778), p. 783.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With a value for the mean density of the Earth, Hutton was able to set some values to [[Jérôme Lalande]]'s planetary tables, which had previously only been able to express the densities of the major solar system objects in relative terms.&lt;ref name="Hutton" /&gt;

===Cavendish experiment===
{{main|Cavendish experiment}}
The [[Henry Cavendish]] (1798) was the first to attempt to measure the gravitational attraction between two bodies directly in the laboratory.
Earth's mass could be then found by combining two equations; [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]], and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation#Modern form|Newton's law of universal gravitation]].

In modern notation, the mass of the Earth is derived from the [[gravitational constant]] and the mean [[Earth radius]] by
: &lt;math&gt; M_\oplus =\frac{ GM_\oplus}{ G } = \frac{ g R_\oplus^2}{G}.&lt;/math&gt;
Where "[[little g]]":
:&lt;math&gt;g = G\frac{M_\oplus}{R_\oplus^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Cavendish found a mean density of {{val|5.45|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, about 1% below the modern value.

===19th century===
[[File:Room in Which Mr. Baily Weighed the Earth.jpg|thumb|Experimental setup by [[Francis Baily]] and [[Henry Foster (scientist)|Henry Foster]] to determine the density of Earth using the Cavendish method.]]

While the mass of the Earth is implied by stating the Earth's radius and density, it was not usual to state the absolute mass explicitly 
prior to the introduction of  [[scientific notation]] using [[Power of 10|powers of 10]] in the later 19th century, &lt;!--reference for this? no history in [[scientific notation]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=i-1MAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA404  this] suggests that it wasn't common in the 1860s.--&gt; 
because the absolute numbers would have been too awkward. Ritchie (1850) gives the mass of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] as "11,456,688,186,392,473,000 lbs."&lt;!--5,114,592,940,535,782 tons--&gt; ({{val|1.1|e=19|u=lb}} = {{val|5.0|e=18|u=kg}}, modern value is {{val|5.15|e=18|u=kg}}) and states that "compared with the weight of the globe this mighty sum dwindles to insignificance".&lt;ref&gt;
Archibald Tucker Ritchie, ''The Dynamical Theory of the Formation of the Earth'' vol. 2 (1850), Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans, 1850, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EGdDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA280  p. 280].&lt;/ref&gt;

Absolute figures for the mass of the Earth are cited only beginning in the second half of the 19th century, mostly in popular rather than expert literature.
An early such figure was given as "14 [[1e24|quadrillion]] pounds" (''14 Quadrillionen Pfund'') [{{val|6.5|e=24|u=kg}}] in Masius (1859).
&lt;ref&gt;J.G.Mädler in: Masius, Hermann, ''Die gesammten Naturwissenschaften'', vol. 3 (1859), p. 562.
&lt;!--these are German pounds of 7680 German grains, here assuming the 1816 Prussian pound of  467.711 grams. see https://books.google.si/books?id=r0BEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA271 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe|Beckett]] (1871) cites the "weight of the earth" as "5842 [[1e18|quintillion]] [[long ton|tons]]" [{{val|5.936|e=24|u=kg}}].&lt;ref&gt;
Edmund Beckett Baron Grimthorpe, ''Astronomy Without Mathematics'' (1871), p. 254.
Max Eyth, ''Der Kampf um die Cheopspyramide: Erster Band'' (1906), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VoE5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA417  p. 417]
cites the "weight of the globe" (''Das Gewicht des Erdballs'') as "5273 quintillion tons".&lt;/ref&gt;
The "mass of the earth in gravitational measure" is stated as "9.81996×6370980&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;" in ''The New Volumes of the Encyclopaedia Britannica'' (Vol. 25, 1902) with a "logarithm of earth's mass" given as "14.600522" [{{val|3.98586|e=14}}]. This is the [[standard gravitational parameter|gravitational parameter]] in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; (modern value {{val|3.98600|e=14}}) and not the absolute mass.

Experiments involving pendulums continued to be performed in the first half of the 19th century. By the second half of the century, these were outperformed by repetitions of the Cavendish experiment, and the modern value of ''G'' (and hence, of the Earth mass) is still derived from high-precision repetitions of the Cavendish experiment.

In 1821, [[Francesco Carlini]] determined a density value of ρ = {{val|4.39|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}  through measurements made with pendulums in the [[Milan]] area. This value was refined in 1827 by [[Edward Sabine]] to {{val|4.77|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and then in 1841 by Carlo Ignazio Giulio to {{val|4.95|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. On the other hand, [[George Biddell Airy]] sought to determine ρ by measuring the difference in the period of a pendulum between the surface and the bottom of a mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The first tests took place in Cornwall between 1826 and 1828. The experiment was a failure due to a fire and a flood. Finally, in 1854, Airy got the value {{val|6.6|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} by measurements in a coal mine in Harton, Sunderland. Airy's method assumed that the Earth had a spherical stratification. Later, in 1883, the experiments conducted by Robert von Sterneck (1839 to 1910) at different depths in mines of Saxony and Bohemia provided the average density values ρ between 5.0 and {{val|6.3|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This led to the concept of isostasy, which limits the ability to accurately measure ρ, by either the deviation from vertical of a plumb line or using pendulums. Despite the little chance of an accurate estimate of the average density of the Earth in this way, [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall]] in 1880 realized a gravimetry experiment in Tokyo and at the top of [[Mount Fuji]]. The result was ρ = {{val|5.77|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Modern value===

The uncertainty in the modern value for the Earth's mass has been entirely due to the uncertainty in the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' since at least the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;"Since the geocentric gravitational constant [...] is now 
determined to a relative accuracy of 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;, our knowledge
of the mass of the earth is entirely limited by the low accuracy
of our knowledge of the Cavendish gravitational constant."
Sagitov (1970 [1969]), p. 718.&lt;/ref&gt;
''G'' is notoriously difficult to measure, and some high-precision measurements during the 1980s to 2010s have yielded mutually exclusive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schlamminger|first1=Stephan|title=Fundamental constants: A cool way to measure big G|journal=Nature|date=18 June 2014|doi=10.1038/nature13507|bibcode = 2014Natur.510..478S|volume=510|pages=478–480|pmid=24965646}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sagitov (1969) based on the measurement of ''G'' by Heyl and Chrzanowski (1942) cited a value of  {{earth mass}} {{=}} {{val|5.973|(3)|e=24|u=kg}} (relative uncertainty {{val|5|e=-4|}}).

Accuracy has improved only slightly since then. Most modern measurements are repetitions of the Cavendish experiment, with results (within standard uncertainty) ranging between  6.672 and 6.676 ×10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;  m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; kg&lt;sup&gt;−1 &lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; (relative uncertainty 3×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;) in results reported since the 1980s, although the  2014 [[NIST]] recommended value is close to 6.674×10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;  m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; kg&lt;sup&gt;−1 &lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; with a relative uncertainty below  10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;.
The ''Astronomical Almanach Online'' as of 2016 recommends a standard uncertainty of {{val|1|e=-4|}} for Earth mass, {{Earth mass}} {{val|5.9722|(6)|e=24|u=kg}}&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt;

== Variation ==
Earth's mass is variable, subject to both gain and loss due to the accretion of micrometeorites and cosmic dust 
and the loss of hydrogen and helium gas, respectively.
The combined effect is a net loss of material, estimated at {{val|5.5e7|u=kg}} (54,000 tons) per year. This amount is {{val|e=-17}} of the total earth mass.&lt;ref name="IJSRP" /&gt; The {{val|5.5e7|u=kg}} annual net loss is essentially due to 100,000 tons lost due to [[atmospheric escape]], and an average of 45,000 tons gained from in-falling dust and meteorites. This is well within the mass uncertainty of 0.01% ({{val|6|e=20|u=kg}}), so the estimated value of earth's mass is unaffected by this factor.

Mass loss is due to atmospheric escape of gases. About 95,000 tons of hydrogen per year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2013/pmpd1301.htm|title=Fantasy and Science Fiction: Science by Pat Murphy &amp; Paul Doherty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{val|3|u=kg|up=s}}) and 1,600 tons of helium per year&lt;ref name="techdaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scitechdaily.com/earth-loses-50000-tonnes-of-mass-every-year/|title=Earth Loses 50,000 Tonnes of Mass Every Year|work=SciTech Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; are lost through atmospheric escape.
The main factor in mass gain is in-falling material, [[cosmic dust]], [[meteors]], etc. are the most significant contributors to Earth's increase in mass.  The sum of material is estimated to be 37,000 to 78,000 tons annually.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-8694-8_5 Spacecraft Measurements of the Cosmic Dust Flux]", Herbert A.

Additional changes in mass are due to the [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass–energy equivalence principal]], although these changes are relatively negligible. An increase in mass has been ascribed to rising temperatures ([[global warming]]), estimated at 160 tonnes per years as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDonald|first1=Charlotte|title=Who, What, Why: Is the Earth getting lighter?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16787636|website=BBC Magazine|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 February 2016|date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another 16 tons per year are lost in the form of [[Rotational energy|rotational kinetic energy]] due to the deceleration of the rotation of Earth's inner core.{{citation needed|reason=needs reliable source to back up claim|date=February 2016}} This energy is transferred to the rotational energy of the solar system, and the trend might also be reversible, as rotation speed has been shown to fluctuate over decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tkalčić |first1=Hrvoje |last2=Young |first2=Mallory |last3=Bodin |first3=Thomas |last4=Ngo |first4=Silvie |last5=Sambridge |first5=Malcolm |title=The shuffling rotation of the Earth’s inner core revealed by earthquake doublets |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=6 |pages=497–502 |date=12 May 2013 |doi=10.1038/ngeo1813 |bibcode = 2013NatGe...6..497T }}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mass loss due to [[nuclear fission]] is estimated to amount to 16 tons per year.&lt;ref name="IJSRP" /&gt;

The '''earth pyramids of Ritten''' (German: ''Erdpyramiden am Ritten''; {{lang-it|Piramidi di terra del Renon}} {{IPA-it|piˈraːmidi di ˈtɛrra del reˈnon|}}) are a natural monument that is located on the [[Ritten]], a [[plateau]] not far from [[Bolzano]] in northern Italy. The [[earth pyramids of South Tyrol]] are a fairly widespread phenomenon which are existing in various locations.

&lt;!-- [[File:RittenLehmpyramiden.jpg|left|thumb|Another view of the Pyramids of the Ritten towards Mittelberg]] picture not upright, fj --&gt;
The original name in this area for these earth pyramids is ''Lahntürme'', i.e. landslide towers.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. Paul Stacul, ''Die erste Erwähnung der Südtiroler Erdpyramiden'' (''The first mention of the South Tyrolean earth pyramides''), in "[[Der Schlern]]", 51, 1977, pp. 675-678.&lt;/ref&gt; They are rather unusual formations of their kind which originate from morainic rocks of glacial origin. The columns of the pyramids may be more or less elongated, and the higher they are the thinner they get, ending usually with a stone cover. These earth pyramids are not static, they are constantly evolving, because their life cycle foresees a continuous [[erosion]], or even a final collapse leaving room for new formations.

In [[South Tyrol]] there are other natural monuments like this such as the [[earth pyramids of Platten]], but the ones of Ritten are considered the parents of them all.

The '''[[Hoodoo (geology)|earth pyramids]]''' in [[South Tyrol]] are a special natural phenomenon that comes about in particular terrain, usually after a landslide or an unhinging of the earth.

The main cause of the formation of earth pyramids is the continuous alternation of periods of torrential rain and
drought. These phenomena, in particularly friable terrain, over the years, increasingly erode the ground and form such earth pyramids. Usually the pyramids are formed in terrain very well sheltered from wind so that they cannot be damaged by it.

Moreover, the life of the earth pyramids is strongly dependent on the climate which reigns during the time in which it is shaped by the rock that covers it.

There are several earth pyramids that can be safely visited. Among the most famous and admired the
following are the most outstanding:
* the [[earth pyramids of Ritten]], a [[plateau]] above [[Bolzano]], which are divided into three distinct groups near the villages Klobenstein, Oberbozen, and Unterinn;
* the [[earth pyramids of Platten]] near [[Percha]] in the [[Puster Valley]].

Other, less famous, earth pyramids are:
* in [[Terenten]], [[Puster Valley]];
* in [[Mölten]];
* in [[Jenesien]] near Bolzano;
* in the hinterland of [[Merano]]: in [[Tirol, South Tyrol|Tirol]], [[Kuens]], and [[Riffian, South Tyrol|Riffian]];
* in [[Karneid]] and Steinegg, one of its hamlets.
* in Neustift in the Rigger valley.
* in [[Segonzano]] in the Cembra valley in the adjoinig province Trentino (not South Tyrol any more).

Energy resources bring with them great social and economic promise, providing financial growth for communities and energy services for local economies. However, the infrastructure which delivers energy services can break down in an '''energy accident''', sometimes causing much damage, and '''energy fatalities''' can occur, and with many systems often deaths will happen even when the systems are working as intended.

Historically, [[coal mining]] has been the most dangerous energy activity and the list of historical [[coal]] [[Mining accident|mining disasters]] is a long one. [[Underground mining]] hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse and [[gas]] explosions. [[Open cut mining]] hazards are principally mine wall failures and vehicle collisions. In the US alone, more than 100,000 coal miners have been killed in accidents over the past century,&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125676950 "Former Miner Explains Culture Of Mining.]" NPR: National Public Radio. April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; with more than 3,200 dying in 1907 alone.&lt;ref name="Coal Mining Steeped in History"&gt;"[http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Mine/story?id=1475697 Coal Mining Steeped in History]". ABC News. January 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], 279 ''major'' energy accidents occurred from 1907 to 2007 and they caused 182,156 deaths with $41 billion in property damages, with these figures not including deaths from smaller accidents.&lt;ref name=bksenpol&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]]. A preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, 1907–2007, ''[[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]'' 36 (2008), pp. 1802–1820.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by far the greatest energy fatalities that result from energy generation by humanity, is the creation of [[air pollution]]. The most lethal of which, [[particulate matter]], which is primarily generated from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s and [[biomass]] is (counting outdoor air pollution effects only) estimated to cause 2.1 million deaths annually.&lt;ref name="spaceref.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceref.com/earth/fine-particulate-matter-map-shows-premature-mortality-due-to-air-polution.html |title=

According to [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], while responsible for less than 1 percent of the total number of energy accidents, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] facilities claimed 94 percent of reported immediate fatalities. Results on immediate fatalities are dominated by one disaster in which  Typhoon Nina in 1975 washed out the [[Shimantan Dam]] (Henan Province, China) and 171,000 people perished.&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; While the other major accident that involved greater than 1000 immediate deaths followed the rupture of the [[1998 Jesse pipeline explosion|NNPC petroleum pipeline]] in 1998 and the resulting explosion.&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; The other singular accident described by Sovacool is the ''predicted'' latent death toll of greater than 1000, as a result of the 1986 [[steam explosion]] at the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear reactor]] in the Ukraine. With approximately 4000 deaths in total, to eventually result in the decades ahead due to the [[radio-isotope]] pollution released.

In the oil and gas industry, the need for improved [[safety culture]] and training within companies is evidenced by the finding that workers new to a company are more likely to be involved in fatalities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Coal mining accidents resulted in 5,938 immediate deaths in 2005, and 4746 immediate deaths in 2006 in China alone according to the [[World Wildlife Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pozon|first=Ina|author2=Puanani Mench|title=Coming Clean: The future of coal in the Asia-Pacific region|journal=WWF|year=2006|url=http://wwf.panda.org/index.cfm?uNewsID=112520|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mining is the most dangerous occupation in China, the death rate for every 100 tons of coal mined is 100 times that of the death rate in the US and 30 times that achieved in South Africa. Moreover, 600,000 Chinese coal miners, as of 2004, were suffering from [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis]] (known as "black lung") a disease of the lungs caused by long-continued inhalation of coal dust. And the figure increases by 70,000 miners every year in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-11/13/content_391242.htm|title= Coal mining: Most deadly job in China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, coal mining has been a very dangerous activity and the list of historical [[coal]] [[mining disasters]] is a long one. In the US alone, more than 100,000 coal miners were killed in accidents over the past century,&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; with more than 3,200 dying in 1907 alone.&lt;ref name="Coal Mining Steeped in History"/&gt; In the decades following this peak, an annual death toll of 1,500 miner fatalities occurred every year in the US until approximately the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/FactSheets/MSHAFCT2.HTM|title= Injury Trends in Mining }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mining fatalities in the US between 1990 and 2012 have continued to decline, with fewer than 100 each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/FactSheets/MSHAFCT10.HTM|title= Mine Safety and Health at a Glance}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See more [[Coal mining disasters in the United States]])

In the United States, in the 2000s, after three decades of regulation on the [[Environmental impact of the coal industry]], including regulations in the 1970s and 1990s from the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], an act created to cut down on pollution related deaths from fossil fuel usage, US [[coal]] fired power plants were estimated, in the 2000s, to continue to cause between 10,000 and 30,000 latent, or air pollution related deaths per year, due to the emissions of [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]] and directly emitted [[particulate matter]] that result when coal is burnt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/rpp/RFF-DP-12-25.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Health Organization]] in 2012, urban outdoor air pollution, from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s and [[biomass]] is estimated to cause 3 million deaths worldwide per year and indoor air pollution from biomass and fossil fuel burning is estimated to cause approximately 4.3 million premature deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/|title= Air quality and health}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 a team of researchers estimated the number of premature deaths caused by particulate matter in outdoor air pollution as 2.1 million, occurring annually.&lt;ref name="spaceref.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iopscience.iop.org"/&gt;

==Economic costs==
Benjamin Sovacool says that while hydroelectric plants were responsible for the most fatalities,{{Contradict-inline|reason=The table in the Fatalities section above attributes a far higher number of fatalities to fossil fuels|date=June 2017}} [[nuclear power]] plants rank first in terms of their economic cost, accounting for 41 percent of all property damage. Oil and hydroelectric follow at around 25 percent each, followed by natural gas at 9 percent and coal at 2 percent.&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; Excluding Chernobyl and the Shimantan Dam, the three other most expensive accidents involved the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] (Alaska), The [[Prestige oil spill]] (Spain), and the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]] (Pennsylvania).&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; However analysis presented in the international Journal, ''Human and Ecological Risk Assessment'' found that coal, oil, [[Liquid petroleum gas]] and hydro accidents have cost more than nuclear power accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10807030802387556|title=A Comparative Analysis of Accident Risks in Fossil, Hydro, and Nuclear Energy Chains|journal=Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: an International Journal|volume=14|issue=5|pages=947|year=2008|last1=Burgherr|first1=Peter|last2=Hirschberg|first2=Stefan}} See also [http://gabe.web.psi.ch/pdfs/_2012_LEA_Audit/TA01.pdf], p. 968 onwards.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern-day U.S. regulatory agencies frequently implement regulations on conventional pollution if one life or more is predicted saved per $6 million to $8 million of economic costs incurred.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times.

[[File:Generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity.svg|thumb|300px|Physical components of a generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity (but not [[district heating|district heat]]) to end-users]]

An '''energy system''' is a system primarily designed to supply [[#Energy-services|energy-services]] to [[end user|end-users]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}  Taking a structural viewpoint, the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] defines an energy system as "all components related to the production, conversion, delivery, and use of energy".&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}  The field of [[energy economics]] includes [[energy market]]s and treats an energy system as the technical and economic systems that satisfy [[consumer demand]] for energy in the forms of [[heat]], [[fuel]]s, and [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}

The first two definitions allow for demand-side measures, including [[daylighting]], retrofitted [[building insulation]], and [[passive solar building design]], as well as socio-economic factors, such as aspects of [[energy demand management]] and even [[telecommuting]], while the third does not.  Neither does the third account for the [[Informal sector|informal economy]] in traditional [[biomass]] that is significant in many [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name="van-ruijven-etal-2008"/&gt;

The analysis of energy systems thus spans the disciplines of [[engineering]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  Merging ideas from both areas to form a coherent description, particularly where [[macroeconomic]] dynamics are involved, is challenging.&lt;ref name="boehringer-and-rutherford-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herbst-etal-2012"/&gt;

The concept of an energy system is evolving as new regulations, technologies, and practices enter into service – for example, [[emissions trading]], the development of [[smart grid]]s, and the greater use of [[energy demand management]], respectively.

== Treatment ==

{{see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling}}
&lt;!-- {(see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling|Open energy system models}} --&gt;

From a structural perspective, an energy system is like any [[System|general system]] and is made up of a set of interacting component parts, located within an environment.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster-system"/&gt;  These components derive from ideas found in [[engineering]] and [[economics]].  Taking a process view, an energy system "consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework".&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|423}}  The identification of the components and behaviors of an energy system depends on the circumstances, the purpose of the analysis, and the questions under investigation.  The concept of an energy system is therefore an [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstraction]] which usually precedes some form of computer-based investigation, such as the construction and use of a suitable [[energy modeling|energy model]].&lt;ref name="anandarajah-etal-2009"/&gt;

Viewed in engineering terms, an energy system lends itself to representation as a [[flow network]]: the [[Glossary of graph theory#vertex|vertices]] map to engineering components like [[power station]]s and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and the [[Glossary of graph theory#edge|edges]] map to the interfaces between these components.  This approach allows collections of similar or adjacent components to be aggregated and treated as one to simplify the model.  Once described thus, flow network algorithms, such as [[minimum-cost flow problem|minimum cost flow]], may be applied.&lt;ref name="quelhas-etal-2007"/&gt;  The components themselves can be treated as simple [[dynamical systems]] in their own right.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;

Conversely, relatively pure economic modeling may adopt a sectorial approach with only limited engineering detail present.  The sector and sub-sector categories published by the [[International Energy Agency]] are often used as a basis for this analysis.  A 2009 study of the UK residential energy sector contrasts the use of the technology-rich [[Markal model]] with several UK sectoral housing stock models.&lt;ref name="kannan-and-strachan-2007"/&gt;

International [[statistical study of energy data|energy statistics]] are typically broken down by carrier, sector and sub-sector, and country.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"/&gt;  Energy carriers ({{abbr|aka|also known as}} energy products) are further classified as [[primary energy]] and [[primary energy#Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)|secondary]] (or intermediate) energy and sometimes final (or end-use) energy.  Published energy datasets are normally adjusted so that they are internally consistent, meaning that all energy stocks and flows must [[Energy balance (energy economics)|balance]].  The IEA regularly publishes energy statistics and energy balances with varying levels of detail and cost and also offers mid-term projections based on this data.&lt;ref name="iea-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iea-2016b"/&gt;  The notion of an energy carrier, as used in [[energy economics]], is distinct and different from the definition of [[energy]] used in physics.

Energy systems can range in scope, from local, municipal, national, and regional, to global, depending on issues under investigation.  Researchers may or may not include demand side measures within their definition of an energy system.  The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] does so, for instance, but covers these measures in separate chapters on transport, buildings, industry, and agriculture.{{efn|The IPCC chapter on agriculture is titled: Agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU).}}&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|516}}

Household consumption and investment decisions may also be included within the ambit of an energy system.  Such considerations are not common because consumer behavior is difficult to characterize, but the trend is to include human factors in models.  Household decision-taking may be represented using techniques from [[bounded rationality]] and [[Agent-based model|agent-based behavior]].&lt;ref name="wittmann-and-bruckner-2009"/&gt;  The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) specifically advocates that "more attention should be paid to incorporating behavioral considerations other than price- and income-driven behavior into economic models [of the energy system]".&lt;ref name="aaas-2011"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

== Energy-services ==

{{see also|Energy conservation|Efficient energy use}}

The concept of an energy-service is central, particularly when defining the purpose of an energy system:

{{quote|It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}}}

Energy-services can be defined as amenities that are either furnished through energy consumption or could have been thus supplied.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2005"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  More explicitly:

{{quote|Demand should, where possible, be defined in terms of energy-service provision, as characterized by an appropriate intensity{{efn|The term ''intensity'' refers to quantities which do not scale with component size.  See [[intensive and extensive properties]].}} – for example, air [[temperature]] in the case of space-heating or [[lux]] levels for [[illuminance]]. This approach facilitates a much greater set of potential responses to the question of supply, including the use of energetically-passive techniques – for instance, retrofitted [[Building insulation|insulation]] and [[daylighting]].&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2003"/&gt;{{rp|156}}}}

A consideration of energy-services per capita and how such services contribute to human welfare and individual quality of life is paramount to the debate on [[sustainable energy]].  People living in poor regions with low levels of energy-services consumption would clearly benefit from greater consumption, but the same is not generally true for those with high levels of consumption.&lt;ref name="haas-etal-2008"/&gt;

The notion of energy-services has given rise to [[energy service company|energy-service companies]] (ESCo) who contract to provide energy-services to a client for an extended period.  The ESCo is then free to choose the best means to do so, including investments in the thermal performance and [[HVAC]] equipment of the buildings in question.&lt;ref name="duplessis-etal-2012"/&gt;

== ISO 13600, 13601, 13602 on technical energy systems ==

ISO{{nnbsp}}13600, ISO{{nnbsp}}13601, and ISO{{nnbsp}}13602 form a set of [[international standard]]s covering technical energy systems (TES).&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-main"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-corrigendum-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13601-1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13602-2002"/&gt;  Although withdrawn prior to 2016, these documents provide useful definitions and a framework for formalizing such systems.  The standards depict an energy system broken down into supply and demand sectors, linked by the flow of tradable energy commodities (or energywares).  Each sector has a set of inputs and outputs, some intentional and some harmful byproducts.  Sectors may be further divided into subsectors, each fulfilling a dedicated purpose.  The demand sector is ultimately present to supply energyware-based services to consumers (see [[#Energy-services|energy-services]]).

 | quote = In energy economics, energy systems are usually defined as technical and economic systems meeting the energy demand.  "However, the energy demand is not a fixed quantity but is subject to various influences, e.g., prices, regulations, and consumer preferences. Thus, the definition of energy systems should provide a much broader, socioeconomic view and refer to the technical and economic side of energy supply as well as the socioeconomic phenomena occurring in a society, which uses energy to enhance its standard of living; furthermore the impact on the natural environment is important. ... It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means. (page 941)

 | quote = The energy system consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework.  Energy is a vital component in the economic and social well-being of a nation and must be considered explicitly in the formulation of regional, national, and international policy.  As the importance of energy in policy making has become apparent, research and analysis in the field of energy system modeling and forecasting has grown rapidly.  The field has evolved from one almost exclusively the domain of planning groups in the major sectors of the energy industry and of government regulatory agencies to one in which many Federal and State agencies are active in the development and application of energy models and forecasts.  Energy system models are now used extensively for regional, national and international forecasting and for policy formulation and analysis.

[[File:Red Knot from The Crossley ID Guide Eastern Birds.jpg|thumb|A species plate from ''The Crossley ID Guide: Eastern Birds'', illustrating different plumages of the [[red knot]]]]
A '''field guide''' is a [[book]] designed to help the reader identify [[wildlife]] (plants or animals) or other objects of natural occurrence (e.g. [[mineral]]s). It is generally designed to be brought into the 'field' or local area where such objects exist to help distinguish between similar objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.illinois.edu/bix/fieldguides/index.html The International Field Guides Database]. Diane Schmidt. Accessed September 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Field guides are often designed to help users distinguish animals and plants that may be similar in appearance but are not necessarily closely related.

It will typically include a description of the objects covered, together with paintings or photographs and an index. More serious and scientific field identification books, including those intended for students, will probably include [[identification key]]s to assist with identification, but the publicly accessible field guide is more often a browsable picture guide organized by family, colour, shape, location or other descriptors.

==History==
Popular interests in identifying things in nature probably were strongest in bird and plant guides. Perhaps the first popular field guide to plants in the United States was the 1893 ''How to Know the Wildflowers'' by "Mrs. William Starr Dana" ([[Frances Theodora Parsons]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 1890, [[Florence Augusta Merriam Bailey|Florence Merriam]] published ''Birds Through an Opera-Glass'', describing 70 common species.  Focused on living birds observed in the field, the book is considered the first in the tradition of modern, illustrated bird guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrow|first=Mark V.|title=A Passion for Birds: American Ornithology after Audubon|date=1998|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691044026|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, now writing as Florence Merriam Bailey (having married the zoologist [[Vernon Orlando Bailey|Vernon Bailey]]), she published ''Handbook of Birds of the Western United States''.  By contrast, the ''Handbook'' is designed as a comprehensive reference for the lab rather a portable book for the field. It was arranged by [[taxonomic order]] and had clear descriptions of [[species]] size, distribution, feeding, and nesting habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kofalk|first=Harriet|title=No Woman Tenderfoot: Florence Merriam Bailey, Pioneer Naturalist|date=1989|publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University Press]]|location=College Station, TX|isbn=0-89096-378-9|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point into the 1930s, features of field guides were introduced by [[Chester A. Reed]] and others such as changing the size of the book to fit the pocket, including colour plates, and producing guides in uniform editions that covered subjects such as garden and woodland flowers, mushrooms, insects, and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunlap|first=Thomas R.|title=In the Field, Among the Feathered: A History of Birders &amp; Their Guides|date=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780199734597|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, [[Roger Tory Peterson]], using his fine skill as an artist, changed the way modern field guides approached identification. Using color plates with paintings of similar species together – and marked with arrows showing the differences – people could use his bird guide in the field to compare species quickly to make identification easier. This technique, the "[[Peterson Identification System]]", was used in most of Peterson's Field Guides from [[animal tracks]] to [[seashell]]s and has been widely adopted by other publishers and authors as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Today, each field guide has its own range, focus and organization.  Specialist publishers such as Croom Helm, along with organisations like the [[Audubon Society]],  the [[RSPB]], the [[Field Studies Council]], [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], [[HarperCollins]], and many others all produce quality field guides.

==Principles==

It is somewhat difficult to generalise about how field guides are intended to be used, because this varies from one guide to another, partly depending on how expert the targeted reader is expected to be.

For general public use, the main function of a field guide is to help the reader identify a bird, plant, rock, butterfly or other natural object down to at least the popular naming level. To this end some field guides employ simple keys and other techniques: the reader is usually encouraged to scan illustrations looking for a match, and to compare similar-looking choices using information on their differences. Guides are often designed to first lead readers to the appropriate section of the book, where the choices are not so overwhelming in number.

Guides for students often introduce the concept of [[identification key]]s. Plant field guides such as ''Newcomb's Wildflower Guide'' (which is limited in scope to the wildflowers of northeastern North America) frequently have an abbreviated key that helps limit the search.&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newcomb|first1=Lawrence|title=Newcomb's Wildflower Guide|date=1977|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-316-60442-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insect guides tend to limit identification to Order or Family levels rather than individual species, due to their diversity.

Many taxa show variability and it is often difficult to capture the constant features using a small number of photographs. Illustrations by artists or post processing of photographs help in emphasising specific features needed to for reliable identification. Peterson introduced the idea of lines to point to these key features. He also noted the advantages of illustrations over photographs:

{{quote|A drawing can do much more than a photograph to emphasize the field marks. A photograph is a record of a fleeting instant; a drawing is a composite of the artist's experience. The artist can edit out, show field marks to best advantage, and delete unnecessary clutter. He can choose position and stress basic color and pattern unmodified by transitory light and shade. ... The artist has more options and far more control .... Whereas a photograph can have a living immediacy a good drawing is really more instructive.  (This passage was written not by Roger Tory Peterson, but by his wife, Virginia Marie Peterson, in the preface to one of Peterson's field guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Roger Tory|title=A Field Guide to the Birds: Eastern and Central North America|date=1989|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|pages=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This passage was also quoted by Law and Lynch (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lists, Field Guides, and the Descriptive Organization of Seeing: Birdwatching as an Exemplary Observational Activity|author1=Law, John  |author2=Michael Lynch|journal= Human Studies|volume= 11|issue= 2/3|date=1988|pages=271–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;)}}

Field guides aid in improving the state of knowledge of various taxa. By making the knowledge of experienced museum specialists available to amateurs, they increase the gathering of information by amateurs from a wider geographic area and increasing the communication of these findings to the specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pearson, D. L.  |author2=Shetterly, J. A. |date=2006|title=How do published field guides influence interactions between amateurs and professionals in entomology? |journal=American Entomologist |volume=52|issue=4|pages=246–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely recognized flags associated with Earth are the [[flag of the United Nations]] and the [[Earth Day]] flag.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Listed below are some of the unofficial contenders for a Flag of Earth:

==John McConnell's "Earth Day" flag==
[[File:Earth Day Flag.png|thumb|350px|The Earth Day flag, John McConnell's latest proposal]]
[[File:EarthFlag1.svg|thumb|350px|McConnell's original design]]

A flag designed by [[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]] in 1969 for the first [[Earth Day]] is a dark blue field [[Charge (heraldry)|charged]] with ''[[The Blue Marble]]'', a famous [[NASA]] photo of the [[Earth]] as seen from [[outer space]]. The first edition of McConnell's flag used [[screen-printing]] and used different colors: ocean and land were blue and the clouds were white. McConnell presented his flag to the United Nations as a symbol for consideration.&lt;ref name="Weir"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weir|title=Peace, Justice, Care of Earth|year=2007|publisher=Press On Publishing|isbn=0971749124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the political views of its creator and its having become a symbol of Earth Day, the flag is associated with [[Environmentalism|environmental awareness]], and the celebration of the global community.&lt;ref name="Weir"/&gt; It was offered for sale originally in the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]'', and is the only flag which was endorsed by McConnell.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthflag.net |title=Authentic Earth Flag |publisher=Earthflag.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Blue Marble'' image was placed in the public domain, and the public nature of this image was the basis of a legal battle that resulted in the invalidation of a trademark and copyright that was originally issued to the Earth Day flag through its original promotional entity, World Equity, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabberone.com/Trademarks/CopyrightLaw/Copyrightability/articles/EarthFlagVsAlamoFlag_A.shtml|title=Copyright Law - Copyrightability - Articles - Copyright Protection Not Available for Earth Flag|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This does not invalidate the official history of McConnell's flag, only the official documentation that was issued on it.&lt;ref name="Weir"/&gt;

===One Flag in Space===
The One Flag in Space initiative is an offshoot of the Space Generation Congress (SGC), the Space Generation Advisory Council's yearly world meeting. It promotes usage of the ''Blue Marble'' flag for [[space exploration]] (it does not explicitly mention it being McConnell's design).

==United Nations flag==
[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|350px|The [[Flag of the United Nations]]]]

Adopted in 1946, the [[flag of the United Nations]] has been used to indicate world unity, although it technically only represents the [[United Nations]] itself. It has a geographical representation of the planet, and its high visibility usage makes it a well-known contender for representing Earth. During the planning for NASA's moon landings of the 1960s, it was suggested that a UN flag be used in place of the flag of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Platoff |first=Anne |title=Where No Flag Has Gone Before: Political and Technical Aspects of Placing a Flag on the Moon (NASA Contractor Report 188251) |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |date=August 2003 |url=https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/flag/flag.htm |accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James William van Kirk, a minister from Youngstown, Ohio, designed in 1913 a [[peace flag]] with [[Rainbow flag|rainbow stripes]], stars and a globe. With this flag, he twice made a peace tour through Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Corien Glaudemans, 'Een vredesapostel uit Ohio', in: ''Den Haag Centraal'', 16 oktober 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Peace Congress]] adopted this flag as its World Peace Flag.&lt;ref&gt;Devere Allen, "The Fight for Peace". 1940. p.553.&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed by [[Pierre de Coubertin]] in 1914 and adopted in [[Olympic games]] since 1920, the [[Olympic flag]] represents all mankind and has a white bar with 5 interlocking rings of 5 colors. The five rings represent the five [[continent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_1303.pdf|title=The Olympic symbols|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six colors (including the white color of the background) represent all of the world's nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_1303.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===James W. Cadle's "Flag of Earth"===
[[File:Flag of Earth.svg|thumb|350px|Flag of Earth by James Cadle]]
Another Earth flag was created around the same time in 1970 by a farmer from [[Homer, Illinois]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flagofearth.org/flown.html|title=The Flag of Earth - Flown|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; named James W. Cadle. Cadle's version of the Earth flag consists of a blue circle representing Earth in the center of the flag, a segment of a large yellow circle representing the sun and a small white circle for the moon, all on a black background. It is particularly popular amongst [[SETI]] researchers and is used by SETI worldwide. {{cn|date=June 2018}} The flag flies at the [[Ohio State University Radio Observatory]] and was lowered to [[half mast]] when [[Carl Sagan]] died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlkop/sagan.html |title=Carl Sagan |publisher=Xs4all.nl |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flag of Earth Co. International was also founded by Cadle which sold the flag.

===Oskar Pernefeldt's "International Flag of the Planet Earth"===
[[File:International Flag of Planet Earth.svg|thumb|350px|Oskar Pernefeldt’s proposal]]
In 2015 a Swedish artist, Oskar Pernefeldt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Flag of the Planet Earth|url=http://www.flagofplanetearth.com/#intro-shift|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the "International Flag of the Planet Earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Here’s what the flag of Planet Earth could look like | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/05/21/heres-what-the-flag-of-planet-earth-could-look-like/ | accessdate=23 May 2015 | publisher=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was conceived to be used in space expeditions and it has two main purposes: 
# To be used while representing planet Earth.
# To remind the people of Earth that we share this planet, no matter of national boundaries. That we should take care of each other and the planet we live on.

The creators predict that it will be eventually used in Mars landing in 2025 or in a future colony on that planet. The flag is used by space research groups with intent to implanting a base on [[Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2017/11/pesquisador-brasileiro-visita-estacao-no-deserto-que-simula-planeta-marte.html Pesquisador brasileiro visita estação no deserto que simula planeta Marte], [[Fantástico]], November 12, 2017, 4 minutes and 26 seconds of video&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the flag consists of seven rings intersecting each other and a deep-blue-sea in the background. The rings are centered on the flag forming a flower in the middle, representing life on Earth. The intersection of the rings represent that all things on Earth are linked directly or indirectly. The rings are organized in a [[Borromean rings]]–like fashion, representing not only the [[seven continents]], but how no part of Earth can be removed without the whole structure collapsing. Finally, the deep-blue represents the ocean and the importance of water for life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nusigma {{!}} This Could Become the Official Flag of Planet Earth|url = http://nusigma.in/official-flag-of-planet-earth/|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160210114338/http://nusigma.in/official-flag-of-planet-earth/|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2016-02-10|website = nusigma.in|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The One World Flag is a concept published in 2018 by the German activist and visual artist Thomas Mandl. The design of the flag consists of a blue circle on a translucent blank background. Through the usage of [[Sheer fabrics]], the environment blends into the flag background and thus becomes an integral part of the flag design representing the ever-changing nature of culture, society, politics, and environment of the planet earth. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.br.de/puls/themen/welt/one-world-flag-thomas-mandl-interview-100.html|title=One World, one flag|publisher=Bavarian Broadcasting, BR|accessdate=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=March 2011}}
[[File:Annual Average Temperature Map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of annual average temperatures as a function of location.]]

The five main [[latitude]] regions of the Earth's surface comprise '''geographical zones''', divided by the major [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]]. The differences between them relate to [[climate]]. They are as follows: 

#The [[Arctic|North frigid zone]], between the [[Arctic Circle]] 66.5° N and the [[North Pole]] 90° N. Covers 4.12% of Earth's surface.
#The [[North temperate zone]], between the  [[Tropic of Cancer]] 23.5° N and the Arctic Circle 66.5° N. Covers 25.99% of Earth's surface.
#The [[Tropics|Torrid zone]], between the Tropic of Cancer 23.5° N and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] 23.5° S. Covers 39.78% of Earth's surface.
#The [[South temperate zone]], between the Tropic of Capricorn 23.5° S and the [[Antarctic Circle]] 66.5° S. Covers 25.99% of Earth's surface.
#The [[Antarctic|South frigid zone]], from Antarctic Circle 66.5° S and the [[South Pole]] 90° S. Covers 4.12% of Earth's surface.

{{legend|#ffcc00|Subtropical}} 
{{legend|#ef8888|Tropical}} ]]

On the basis of latitudinal extent, the globe is divided into three broad heat zones.

==Torrid Zone==

The Torrid is also known as the [[Tropics]]. The zone is bounded on the north by the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and on the south by the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]; these latitudes mark the northern and southern extremes in which the sun seasonally passes directly overhead. This happens annually, but in the region between, the sun passes overhead twice a year.

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], in the sun's apparent northward migration after the March [[equinox]], it passes overhead once, then after the [[June solstice]], at which time it reaches the [[Tropic of Cancer]], it passes over again on its apparent southward journey. After the September equinox the sun passes into the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. It then passes similarly over the southern tropical regions until it reaches the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] at the [[December solstice]], and back again as it returns northwards to the [[Equator]].

==Temperate Zones==

In the two Temperate Zones also known as tropical zone not, consisting of the [[tepid]] [[latitudes]], the Sun is never directly overhead, and the climate is mild, generally ranging from warm to cool. The four annual seasons, [[Spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]] and [[winter]], occur in these areas. The North Temperate Zone includes [[Europe]], [[Northern Asia]], and [[North America|North]] and [[Central America]]. The South Temperate Zone includes Southern [[Australasia]], southern [[South America]], and [[Southern Africa]].

==Frigid Zones==

The two Frigid Zones, or [[polar regions of Earth|polar region]]s, experience the [[midnight sun]] and the [[polar night]] for part of the year - at the edge of the zone there is one day at the winter solstice when the Sun is invisible, and one day at the summer solstice when the sun remains above the horizon for 24 hours. In the center of the zone (the [[Geographical pole|pole]]) the day is one year long with six months of daylight and six months of night. The Frigid Zones are the coldest regions of Earth and are generally covered in ice and snow.It receives slanting rays of the sun as this region lies farthest from the equator. Summer season in this region lies lasts for about 2 to 3 months and there is almost 24 hour sunlight during summer.

==History==
The concept of a geographical zone was first hypothesized by the ancient Greek scholar [[Parmenides]]&lt;ref&gt;Strab. 2,2,1-2 in: A. H. Coxon and R. D. McKirahan (eds), The Fragments of Parmenides: A Critical Text With Introduction, and Translation, the Ancient Testimonia and a Commentary, 2nd edn (Phronesis: Supplementary Volumes 3; Assen, Dover (NH), 2009), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; and lastingly modified by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]], [[Corpus Aristotelicum#Bekker numbers|Bekker numbers]] 362a33-362b29&lt;/ref&gt; Both philosophers theorized the Earth divided into three types of climatic zones based on their distance from the equator.

Like Parmeneides, thinking that the area near the equator was too hot for habitation, Aristotle dubbed the region around the equator (from 23.5° N to 23.5° S) the "Torrid Zone." Both philosophers reasoned the region from the Arctic Circle to the pole to be permanently frozen. This region, thought uninhabitable, was called the "Frigid Zone." The only area believed to be habitable was the northern "Temperate Zone" (the southern one not having been discovered), lying between the "Frigid Zones" and the "Torrid Zone". However, humans have inhabited almost all climates on Earth, including inside the Arctic Circle.

As knowledge of the Earth's geography improved, a second "Temperate Zone" was discovered south of the equator, and a second "Frigid Zone" was discovered around the [[Antarctic]]. Although Aristotle's map was oversimplified, the general idea was correct. Today, the most commonly used climate map is the [[Köppen climate classification]], developed by Russian climatologist of German descent and amateur botanist [[Wladimir Köppen]] (1846–1940), which divides the world into five major climate regions, based on average annual precipitation, average monthly precipitation, and average monthly temperature.

'''Grayite''', ThPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; • (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), is a [[thorium]] [[phosphate]] mineral of the Rabdophane group first discovered in 1957 by S.H.U. Bowie in Rhodesia. It is of moderate hardness occurring occasionally in [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]]s of [[hexagonal]] crystals occasionally but more commonly in microgranular/cryptocrystalline masses. Due to its [[thorium]] content, grayite displays some radioactivity although it is only moderate and the mineral displays powder XRD peaks without any metamict-like effects. The color of grayite is most commonly observed as a light to dark reddish brown but has also been observed as lighter yellows with grayish tints. It has a low to moderate hardness with a [[Mohs hardness]] of 3-4 and has a [[specific gravity]] of 3.7-4.3. It has been found in both intrusive igneous and sedimentary environments.&lt;ref&gt;[Bowie, S.H.U. (1957) Summary of progress for 1956, Geologic Survey of Great Britain, pg. 67]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Formations including grayite were originally documented in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in 1957 and subsequently around the globe. Some of these locales include the states of Wyoming and Colorado as well as Madagascar. Grayite has often been found in pegmatitic environments amongst other thorium minerals, particularly monazite ((Ce,La)PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Recent work has shown widespread occurrences in Wisconsin pegmatitic environments. Other notable finds of pegmatitic grayite occur in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[Nikola Zidarov and Ognyan Petrov, 2011, "Grayite From Sredna Gora Pegmatites -- First Find in Bulgaria", Comptes rendus de l’Acade'mie bulgare des Sciences, Vol 64, No12, pp.1719-1726]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;["Thirty-Sixth Rochester Mineralogical Symposium: Contributed Papers In Specimen Mineralogy—Part 1." Rocks &amp; Minerals 85.2 (2010): 160-164. EBSCO. 1 Dec. 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; Grayite has also been found in sedimentary environments with an observation of high concentrations in cracks raising the possibility of the mineral as a precipitate from fluid mobilized ions. Formation of grayite and other rhabdophane minerals in this context has been documented in literature.&lt;ref&gt;[Alfons Berger, Edwin Gnos, Emilie Janots, Alain Fernandez, Jörg Giese, Formation and composition of rhabdophane, bastnäsite and hydrated thorium minerals during alteration: Implications for geochronology and low-temperature processes, Chemical Geology, Volume 254, Issues 3–4, 15 September 2008, Pages 238-248 in Chemical Geology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;J.R. Dooley, Jr., and John C. Hathaway, 1961, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P0ZSAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PT339#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Two Occurrences of Thorium-bearing Minerals with Rhabdophane-like Structures], USGS Professional Paper 424-C, pg. 339-341&lt;/ref&gt;

==As member of rhabdophane group==
Grayite is isostructural with members of the Rhabdophane group such as brockite and rhabdrophane. While previous work has identified grayite as a pseudohexagonal orthorhombic member of the rhabdophane group along with ningyoite, more contemporary work seems to maintain a hexagonal crystal structure.&lt;ref&gt;[Frances G. Fisher and Robert Meyrowitz, 1961, "Brockite, a New Calcium Thorium Phosphate from the Wet Mountains, Colorado", American Mineralogist, Vol. 47, pg 1336-1335.]&lt;/ref&gt; These hydrated phosphate minerals often include radioactive elements such as thorium, uranium, and cerium. Powder XRD analysis produces peaks matching those of rhabdophane.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Relationship with monazite==
In the identification of new hydrated phosphate minerals related to rhabdophane XRD peak information is usually recorded through different sample preparation methods. Besides standard powder XRD, samples are often heated to ~850&amp;nbsp;°C so that the structure changes. The peak information is analyzed again and upon doing this hydrated thorium phosphate minerals will show a monazite-like structure indicating a possible alteration relationship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter''''' is a 2011 book by [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Terrence Deacon]]. The book covers topics in [[biosemiotics]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[Abiogenesis|the origins of life]]. Broadly, the book seeks to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistically]] explain "[[aboutness]]", that is, concepts like [[intentionality]], meaning, [[normative|normativity]], purpose, and [[function (biology)|function]]; which Deacon groups together and labels as [[ententional]] phenomena.

==Core Ideas==
Deacon's first book, ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'' focused on the [[Origin of language|evolution of human language]]. In that book, Deacon notes that much of the mystery surrounding language origins comes from a profound confusion on the nature of [[semiotic]] processes themselves. Accordingly, the focus of ''Incomplete Nature'' shifts from [[Human evolution|human origins]] to the [[origin of life]] and [[semiosis]]. ''Incomplete Nature'' can be viewed as a sizable contribution to the growing body of work positing that the problem of [[consciousness]] and the problem of the [[origin of life]] are inexorably linked.&lt;ref&gt;Slanted Truths: Essays on Gaia, Symbiosis and Evolution. Lynn Margulis, Dorion Sagan, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind. Evan Thompson. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Deacon tackles these two linked problems by going back to basics. The book expands upon the classical conceptions of [[work (physics)|work]] and [[information]]  in order to give an account of [[entention]]ality that is consistent with [[eliminative materialism]] and yet does not seek to explain away or pass off as [[Epiphenomenon|epiphenominal]] the non-physical properties of [[life]].

==Constraints==
A central thesis of the book is that absence can still be efficacious. Deacon makes the claim that just as the concept of [[zero]] revolutionized mathematics, thinking about life, mind, and other [[ententional]] phenomena in terms of constraints (i.e., what is absent) can similarly help us overcome the artificial dichotomy of the [[mind body problem]]. A good example of this concept is the hole that defines the hub of a wagon wheel. The hole itself is not a physical thing, but rather a source of constraint that helps to restrict the conformational possibilities of the wheel's components, such that, on a global scale, the property of rolling emerges.  Constraints which produce [[emergence|emergent]] phenomena may not be a process which can be understood by looking at the make-up of the constituents of a pattern. Emergent phenomena are difficult to study because their complexity does not necessarily decompose into parts. When a pattern is broken down, the constraints are no longer at work; there is no hole, no absence to notice. Imagine a hub, a hole for an axle, produced only when the wheel is rolling, thus breaking the wheel may not show you how the hub emerges.

==Orthograde and contragrade==
Deacon notes that the apparent patterns of [[causality]] exhibited by living systems seem to be in some ways the inverse of the causal patterns of non-living systems.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In an attempt to find a solution to the philosophical problems associated with [[teleology|teleological]] explanations, Deacon returns to [[Aristotle's]] [[four causes]] and attempts to modernize them with [[thermodynamic]] concepts.

[[File:Orthograde and contragrade.jpg|450px|A cartoon characterization of the asymmetry implicit in thermodynamic change from a constrained ("ordered") state to a less constrained ("disordered") state, which tends to occur spontaneously (an orthograde process), contrasted with the reversed direction of change, which does not tend to occur spontaneously (a contragrade process), and so only tends to occur in response to the imposition of highly constrained external work (arrows in the image on the right).]]

'''Orthograde''' changes are caused internally. They are spontaneous changes. That is, orthograde changes are generated by the spontaneous elimination of asymmetries in a thermodynamic system in disequilibrium. Because orthograde changes are driven by the internal geometry of a changing system, orthograde causes can be seen as analogous to [[Aristotle's]] [[formal cause]]. More loosely, [[Aristotle's]] [[final cause]] can also be considered orthograde, because goal oriented actions are caused from within.&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contragrade''' changes are imposed from the outside. They are non-spontaneous changes. Contragrade change is induced when one thermodynamic system interacts with the orthograde changes of another thermodynamic system. The interaction drives the first system into a higher energy, more asymmetrical state. Contragrade changes do [[work (physics)|work]]. Because contragrade changes are driven by external interactions with another changing system, contragrade causes can be seen as analogous to [[Aristotle's]] [[efficient cause]].&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homeodynamics, morphodynamics, and teleodynamics==
Much of the book is devoted to expanding upon the ideas of classical [[thermodynamics]], with an extended discussion about how consistently [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|far from equilibrium systems]] can interact and combine to produce novel [[emergence|emergent]] properties. 
[[File:Homomorphoteleo.jpg|thumb|400px]]

Deacon defines three hierarchically nested levels of thermodynamic systems: '''Homeodynamic''' systems combine to produce '''morphodynamic''' systems which combine to produce '''teleodynamic''' systems. Teleodynamic systems can be further combined to produce higher orders of [[self organization]].

===Homeodynamics===
Homeodynamic systems are essentially equivalent to classical [[thermodynamic systems]] like a gas under pressure or solute in solution, but the term serves to emphasize that homeodynamics is an abstract process that can be realized in forms beyond the scope of [[thermodynamics|classic thermodynamics]]. For example, the diffuse brain activity normally associated with emotional states can be considered to be a homeodynamic system because there is a general state of equilibrium which its components (neural activity) distribute towards.&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp.561 "Experience should have clear equilibrium-tending, dissipative, and self-organizing characteristics, besides those that are intentional. These are inseparable dynamical features that literally constitute experience."&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a homeodynamic system is any collection of components that will spontaneously eliminate constraints by rearranging the parts until a maximum [[entropy]] state (disorderliness) is achieved.

===Morphodynamics===
A morphodynamic system consists of a coupling of two homeodynamic systems such that the constraint dissipation of each complements the other, producing macroscopic order out of microscopic interactions. Morphodynamic systems require constant perturbation to maintain their structure, so they are relatively rare in nature. The paradigm example of a morphodynamic system is a [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]]. Other common examples are [[Snowflake#formation|snowflake formation]], [[whirlpools]] and the [[stimulated emission]] of [[laser]] light.

[[File:Benard cell.jpg|thumb|500px|Benard Cell]]
'''Maximum entropy production:''' The organized structure of a morphodynamic system forms to facilitate maximal entropy production. In the case of a [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]], heat at the base of the liquid produces an uneven distribution of high energy molecules which will tend to diffuse towards the surface. As the temperature of the heat source increases, [[density]] effects come into play. Simple [[diffusion]] can no longer dissipate energy as fast as it is added and so the bottom of the liquid becomes hot and more [[buoyant]] than the cooler, denser liquid at the top. The bottom of the liquid begins to rise, and the top begins to sink - producing [[convection]] currents.

'''Two systems:''' The significant heat differential on the liquid produces two homeodynamic systems. The first is a diffusion system, where high energy molecules on the bottom collide with lower energy molecules on the top until the added kinetic energy from the heat source is evenly distributed. The second is a convection system, where the low density fluid on the bottom mixes with the high density fluid on the top until the density becomes evenly distributed. The second system arises when there is too much energy to be effectively dissipated by the first, and once both systems are in place, they will begin to interact.

'''Self organization:''' The convection creates currents in the fluid that disrupt the pattern of heat diffusion from bottom to top. Heat begins to diffuse into the denser areas of current, irrespective of the vertical location of these denser portions of fluid. The areas of the fluid where diffusion is occurring most rapidly will be the most viscous because molecules are rubbing against each other in opposite directions. The convection currents will shun these areas in favor of parts of the fluid where they can flow more easily. And so the fluid spontaneously segregates itself into cells where high energy, low density fluid flows up from the center of the cell and cooler, denser fluid flows down along the edges, with diffusion effects dominating in the area between the center and the edge of each cell.

'''Synergy and constraint:''' What is notable about morphodynamic processes is that order spontaneously emerges explicitly because the ordered system that results is more efficient at increasing entropy than a chaotic one. In the case of the [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]], neither diffusion nor convection on their own will produce as much entropy as both effects coupled together. When both effects are brought into interaction, they constrain each other into a particular geometric form because that form facilitates minimal interference between the two processes. The orderly hexagonal form is stable as long as the energy differential persists, and yet the orderly form more effectively degrades the energy differential than any other form. This is why morphodynamic processes in nature are usually so short lived. They are self organizing, but also self undermining.

===Teleodynamics===
A teleodynamic system consists of coupling two morphodynamic systems such that the self undermining quality of each is constrained by the other. Each system prevents the other from dissipating all of the energy available, and so long term organizational stability is obtained. Deacon claims that we should pinpoint the moment when two morphodynamic systems reciprocally constrain each other as the point when [[ententional]] qualities like [[Function (biology)|function]], [[purpose]] and [[normative|normativity]] emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature pg. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

====Autogenesis====
Deacon explores the properties of teleodynamic systems by describing a chemically plausible model system called an autogen. Deacon emphasizes that the specific autogen he describes is not a proposed description of the first life form, but rather a description of the kinds of thermodynamic synergies that the first living creature likely possessed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24896328 The transition from constraint to regulation at the origin of life.] Frontiers in Bioscience. Terrence W. Deacon, Alok Srivastava, and J. Augustus Bacigalupi&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Autogenesis.jpg|thumb|500px|Autogen pg 339]]

'''Reciprocal catalysis:''' An autogen consists of two self [[Catalysts|catalyzing]] cyclical morphodynamic chemical reactions, similar to a [[chemoton]]. In one reaction, organic molecules react in a looped series, the products of one reaction becoming the reactants for the next. This looped reaction is self amplifying, producing more and more reactants until all the substrate is consumed. A side product of this reciprocally catalytic loop is a [[lipid]] that can be used as a reactant in a second reaction. This second reaction creates a boundary (either a [[microtubule]] or some other closed [[capsid]] like structure), that serves to contain the first reaction. The boundary limits [[diffusion]]; it keeps all of the necessary [[catalysts]] in close proximity to each other. In addition, the boundary prevents the first reaction from completely consuming all of the available substrate in the environment.

'''The first self:''' Unlike an isolated morphodynamic process whose organization rapidly eliminates the energy gradient necessary to maintain its structure, a teleodynamic process is self-limiting and self preserving. The two reactions complement each other, and ensure that neither ever runs to equilibrium - that is completion, cessation, and [[death]]. So, in a teleodynamic system there will be structures that embody a preliminary sketch of a [[biological function]]. The internal reaction network functions to create the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] for the boundary reaction, and the boundary reaction functions to protect and constrain the internal reaction network. Either process in isolation would be [[abiotic]] but together they create a system with a [[normative]] status dependent on the functioning of its component parts.

&lt;!--
======Autogenesis and Autopoesis======
Deacon's model of an autogen bears a striking resemblance to the [[autopoesis|autopoetic]] theory proposed by [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela|Fransisco Varela]] in 1973. However, Deacon takes pains to differentiate teleodynamics from autopoesis.

Deacon notes that autopoiesis is an update on the [[Kantian]] reciprocal production of parts conception of organisms. The problem with this approach is that is assumes the two most critical features necessary for life (and teleodynamics): (1) how the network of co-producing components is maintained as a "unity" in such a way that its coherent organization can be reconstituted or reproduced in a new system, and (2) how this unit "self" maintains itself far-from-equilibrium. [[Autopoiesis]] is an abstract description of what must be true of an organism, without outlining how these defining properties are accomplished. Indeed, as stated, [[autopoiesis]] describes morphodynamic processes, though without an account of the thermodyanamics involved. But morphodynamic processes don't spontaneously hold together, indeed, they are organized in a way that maximally destroys the conditions that produce them because they are entirely driven by extrinsic dynamics. Essentially, [[autopoesis]] is a description of the processes defining life, while autogenesis describes how they are dynamically achieved.&lt;ref&gt;The transition from constraint to regulation at the origin of life. Frontiers in Bioscience (in press, pg 4-5). Terrence W. Deacon, Alok Srivastava, and J. Augustus Bacigalupi&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

==Work==
As with other concepts in the book, in his discussion of [[work (physics)|work]] Deacon seeks to generalize the [[Newtonian mechanics#Work and energy|Newtonian]] conception of work such that the term can be used to describe and differentiate mental phenomena - to describe "that which makes daydreaming effortless but metabolically equivalent problem solving difficult."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg.365&lt;/ref&gt;  Work is generally described as "activity that is necessary to overcome resistance to change. Resistance can be either active or passive, and so work can be directed towards enacting change that wouldn't otherwise occur or preventing change that would happen in its absence."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; Using the terminology developed earlier in the book, work can be considered to be "the organization of differences between orthograde processes such that a locus of contragrade process is created. Or, more simply, work is a spontaneous change inducing a non-spontaneous change to occur."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg.371&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermodynamic work===

A thermodynamic systems capacity to do work depends less upon the total energy of the system and more upon the geometric distribution of its components. A glass of water at 20 degrees Celsius will have the same amount of energy as a glass divided in half with the top [[fluid]] at 30 degrees and the bottom at 10, but only in the second glass will the top half have the capacity to do work upon the bottom. This is because work occurs at both [[macroscopic]] and [[microscopic]] levels. Microscopically, there is constant work being performed on one molecule by another when they collide. But the potential for this microscopic work to additively sum to macroscopic work depends on there being an asymmetric distribution of particle speeds, so that the average collision pushes in a focused direction. Microscopic work is [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary but not sufficient]] for macroscopic work. A global property of asymmetric distribution is also required.

===Morphodynamic work===

By recognizing that asymmetry is a general property of work - that work is done as asymmetric systems spontaneously tend towards symmetry, Deacon abstracts the concept of work and applies it to systems whose symmetries are vastly more complex than those covered by [[classical thermodynamics]]. In a morphodynamic system, the tendency towards symmetry produces not global [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]], but a complex geometric form like a hexagonal [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Benard cell]] or the [[resonant frequency]] of a flute. This tendency towards convolutedly symmetric forms can be harnessed to do [[work (physics)|work]] on other morphodynamic systems, if the systems are properly coupled.

'''Resonance example:''' A good example of morphodynamic work is the induced [[resonance]] that can be observed by singing or playing a flute next to a string instrument like a harp or guitar. The vibrating air emitted from the flute will interact with the taut strings. If any of the strings are tuned to a [[resonant frequency]] that matches the note being played, they too will begin to vibrate and emit sound.

'''Contragrade change:''' When energy is added to the flute by blowing air into it, there is a spontaneous (orthograde) tendency for the system to dissipate the added energy by inducing the air within the flute to vibrate at a specific frequency. This orthograde morphodynamic form generation can be used to induce contragrade change in the system coupled to it - the taught string. Playing the flute does work on the string by causing it to enter a high energy state that could not be reached spontaneously in an uncoupled state.

'''Structure and form:''' Importantly, this is not just the macro scale propagation of random micro vibrations from one system to another. The global geometric structure of the system is essential. The total energy transferred from the flute to the string matters far less than the patterns it takes in transit. That is, the [[amplitude]] of the coupled note is irrelevant, what matters is its [[frequency]]. Notes that have a higher or lower frequency than the resonant frequency of the string will not be able to do morphodynamic work.

===Teleodynamic work===

Work is generally defined to be the interaction of two orthograde changing systems such that contragrade change is produced.&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; In teleodynamic systems, the spontaneous orthograde tendency is not to equilibriate (as in homeodynamic systems), nor to self simplify (as in morphodynamic systems) but rather to tend towards self-preservation. Living organisms spontaneously tend to [[Healing|heal]], to [[Reproduction|reproduce]] and to pursue resources towards these ends.  Teleodynamic work acts on these tendencies and pushes them in a contragrade, non-spontaneous direction. 
[[File:Reading 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Reading exemplifies the logic of teleodynamic work. A passive source of cognitive constraints is potentially provided by the letterforms on a page. A literate person has structured his or her sensory and cognitive habits to use such letterforms to reorganize the neural activities constituting thinking. This enables us to do teleodynamic work to shift mental tendencies away from those that are spontaneous (such as daydreaming) to those that are constrained by the text. Artist: [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]] (1682–1754).]]

'''Evolution as work:''' [[Natural selection]], or perhaps more accurately, [[adaptation]], can be considered to be a ubiquitous form of teleodynamic work. The othograde self-preservation and reproduction tendencies of individual organisms tends to undermine those same tendencies in conspecifics. This competition produces a constraint that tends to mold organisms into forms that are more adapted to their environments – forms that would otherwise not spontaneously persist.

For example, in a population of New Zealand [[wrybill]] who make a living by searching for grubs under rocks, those that have a bent beak gain access to more calories. Those with bent beaks are able to better provide for their young, and at the same time they remove a disproportionate quantity of grubs from their environment, making it more difficult for those with straight beaks to provide for their own young. Throughout their lives, all the [[wrybill]]s in the population do work to structure the form of the next generation. The increased efficiency of the bent beak causes that morphology to dominate the next generation. Thus an asymmetry of beak shape distribution is produced in the population - an asymmetry produced by teleodynamic work.

'''Thought as work:''' Mental problem solving can also be considered teleodynamic work. Thought forms are spontaneously generated, and task of problem solving is the task of molding those forms to fit the context of the problem at hand. Deacon makes the link between evolution as teleodynamic work and thought as teleodynamic work explicit. "The experience of being sentient is what it feels like to ''be'' evolution."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg 550&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emergent causal powers====

By conceiving of work in this way, Deacon claims "we can begin to discern ''a basis for a form of causal openness'' in the universe."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg.379&lt;/ref&gt; While increases in complexity in no way alter the laws of physics, by juxtaposing systems together, pathways of spontaneous change can be made available that were inconceivably improbable prior to the systems coupling. The causal power of any complex living system lies not solely in the underlying [[quantum mechanics]] but also in the global arrangement of its components. A careful arrangement of parts can constrain possibilities such that phenomena that were formerly impossibly rare can become improbably common.

==Information==
One of the central purposes of Incomplete Nature is to articulate a theory of biological [[information]]. The first formal [[Information Theory|theory of information]] was articulated by [[Claude E. Shannon|Claude Shannon]] in 1948 in his work [[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]. Shannon's work is widely credited with ushering in the [[information age]], but somewhat paradoxically, it was completely silent on questions of [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and [[reference]], i.e., what the information is ''about.'' As an engineer, Shannon was concerned with the challenge of reliably transmitting a message from one location to another. The meaning and content of the message was largely irrelevant. So, while Shannon information theory has been essential for the development of devices like [[computers]], it has left open many philosophical questions regarding the nature of information. Incomplete Nature seeks to answer some of these questions.

===Shannon information===
Shannon's key insight was to recognize a link between [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] and [[information]]. [[Entropy]] is often defined as a measurement of disorder, or randomness, but this can be misleading. For Shannon's purposes, the entropy of a system is the number of possible states that the system has the capacity to be in. Any one of these potential states can constitute a message. For example, a typewritten page can bear as many different messages as there are different combinations of characters that can be arranged on the page. The information content of a message can only be understood against the background context of all of the messages that could have been sent, but weren't. Information is produced by a reduction of entropy in the message medium. 
[[File:Information Shannon Boltzmann Darwin.jpg|thumb|500px|Three nested conceptions of information]]

===Boltzmann entropy===
Shannon's information based conception of entropy should be distinguished from the more classic [[thermodynamic]] conception of entropy developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and others at the end of the nineteenth century. While Shannon entropy is static and has to do with the set of all possible messages/states that a signal bearing system might take, Boltzmann entropy has to do with the tendency of all dynamic systems to tend towards equilibrium. That is, there are many more ways for a collection of particles to be well mixed than to be segregated based on velocity, mass, or any other property. Boltzmann entropy is central to the theory of work developed earlier in the book because entropy dictates the direction in which a system will spontaneously tend.

===Significant information===
Deacon's addition to Shannon information theory is to propose a method for describing not just how a message is transmitted, but also how it is interpreted. Deacon weaves together Shannon entropy and Boltzmann entropy in order to develop a theory of interpretation based in teleodynamic work. Interpretation is inherently normative. Data becomes information when it has significance for its interpreter. Thus interpretive systems are teleodynamic - the interpretive process is designed to perpetuate itself. "The interpretation of something as information indirectly reinforces the capacity to do this again."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

Janet Lembke's first book was ''Bronze and Iron: Old Latin Poetry from Its Beginnings to 100 B.C.'' (1973), but beyond  translations and essays about classics, there were more than a dozen books on nature, works for which the author acquired a base of admirers. Her articles were printed in [[The New York Times]], ''[http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/ Sierra Magazine]'' ([[The Sierra Club]]), [[Oxford American]], [[Audubon (magazine)|Audubon]], [[Raleigh News and Observer]], [[Southern Review]] and other publications. The writing style was eclectic and personal, meditative and detailed, and though she was at least once accused of "taking poetic license too far"&lt;ref name="bryn_mawr"&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2005/2005-08-06.html Criticism of Lembke's translation of ''The Georgics'']. ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in her translation of ''Georgics'', readers were often charmed and seduced by her way of weaving scientific fact, history and culture, with personal anecdote, mythological allusion and poetic feeling. "The author's ability to pull together disparate elements in her writing is impressive, and her passionate connection with the natural world is displayed in line after line," wrote [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref name="skinnydipping_nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/books/in-short-nonfiction-040029.html|title=SKINNY DIPPING And Other Immersions in Water, Myth, and Being Human.

Among Janet Lembke's noted titles were ''Because the Cat Purrs: How We Relate to Other Species and Why It Matters'' (2008); ''Skinny Dipping: And Other Immersions in Water, Myth, and Being Human'' (2004); ''Dangerous Birds'' (1996); ''River Time'' (1997); ''Despicable Species: On Cowbirds, Kudzu, Hornworms, and Other Scourges'' (1999); and ''The Quality of Life: Living Well, Dying Well'' (2004)-- a sober and unflinching account of the death of the author's mother. At the time of her own death at age 80 in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], [[Virginia (state)|Virginia]], Janet Lembke was working on a memoir, ''I Married an Arsonist''. She had married twice, and had four children and six grandchildren.&lt;ref name="janet_obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsleader.com/article/20130905/OBITUARIES/309050008 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140110102633/http://www.newsleader.com/article/20130905/OBITUARIES/309050008 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 January 2014 |title=Obituary: Janet N.

'''Life extension''' is the idea of extending the human [[life expectancy|lifespan]], either modestly &amp;ndash; through improvements in medicine &amp;ndash; or dramatically by increasing the [[maximum lifespan]] beyond its generally settled limit of 125 years.&lt;ref name=turner&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner BS |title=Can We Live Forever? A Sociological and Moral Inquiry |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2009 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to achieve such dramatic changes, however, does not currently exist.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt;

Some researchers in this area, and "life extensionists", "immortalists" or "longevists" (those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves), believe that future breakthroughs in tissue [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]], [[stem cell]]s, [[regenerative medicine]], [[molecular]] repair, [[gene therapy]], pharmaceuticals, and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] replacement (such as with artificial organs or [[xenotransplantation]]s) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans (agerasia&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|agerasia}}&lt;/ref&gt;) through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition. The ethical ramifications, if life extension becomes a possibility, are debated by [[bioethicist]]s.

The sale of purported anti-aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry. For example, the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the US market generated about $50&amp;nbsp;billion of revenue a year in 2009.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt; The use of such products has not been proven to be effective or safe.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holliday&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10522-008-9170-6 |pmid=18726707 |title=The extreme arrogance of anti-aging medicine |journal=Biogerontology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=223–8 |year=2008 |last1=Holliday |first1=Robin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PositionStatement"/&gt;&lt;ref name= EMBOSENS/&gt;

==Average and maximum lifespan==
{{Main|Senescence}}
During the process of [[aging]], an organism accumulates damage to its [[macromolecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cells]], [[biological tissue|tissues]], and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. Specifically, aging is characterized as and thought to be caused by "genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2013 | title = The hallmarks of aging | journal = Cell | volume = 153 | issue = 6| pages = 1194–1217 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.039 | pmid = 23746838 | pmc = 3836174 | author1 = López-Otín | first1 = C | last2 = Blasco | first2 = M. A. | last3 = Partridge | first3 = L | last4 = Serrano | first4 = M | last5 = Kroemer | first5 = G }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxidation]] damage to cellular contents caused by [[free radicals]] is believed to contribute to aging as well.&lt;ref name="Halliwell B 2007"&gt;Halliwell B, Gutteridge JMC (2007). Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, USA, {{ISBN|019856869X}}, {{ISBN|978-0198568698}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 1383772 | volume=275 | issue=3–6 | title=Oxidative and other DNA damages as the basis of aging: a review | date=September 1992 | pages=305–15 | doi=10.1016/0921-8734(92)90034-M | journal=Mutation Research/DNAging| author1=Holmes | first1=G. E. | last2=Bernstein | first2=C | last3=Bernstein | first3=H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest a human has ever been proven to live is 122 years, the case of [[Jeanne Calment]] who was born in 1875 and died in 1997, whereas the maximum lifespan of a [[wildtype]] [[mouse]], commonly used as a model in research on aging, is about three years.&lt;ref name="Mouse Genome Informatics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/other/mouse_facts1.shtml|title=Mouse Facts|publisher=informatics.jax.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of [[DNA repair]], [[antioxidant]] defenses, [[energy metabolism]], [[proteostasis]] maintenance, and recycling mechanisms such as [[autophagy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senescence.info/causes_of_aging.html|title=What Causes Aging? Damage-Based Theories of Aging|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Average lifespan in a population is lowered by [[infant mortality|infant]] and [[child mortality]], which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems. Later in life, vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age-related [[chronic disease]] such as [[cancer]] or [[cardiovascular disease]] play an increasing role in mortality. Extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care, [[vaccinations]], good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]].

[[Maximum lifespan]] is determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s and by environmental factors. Widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as [[nematode]]s, fruit flies, and mice include [[caloric restriction]], [[gene manipulation]], and administration of pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2012 | title = Aging biology: a new frontier for drug discovery | journal = Expert Opin Drug Discov | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 217–229 | doi = 10.1517/17460441.2012.660144 | pmid = 22468953 | author1 = Verdaguer | first1 = E | last2 = Junyent | first2 = F | last3 = Folch | first3 = J | last4 = Beas-Zarate | first4 = C | last5 = Auladell | first5 = C | last6 = Pallàs | first6 = M | last7 = Camins | first7 = A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another technique uses evolutionary pressures such as breeding from only older members or altering levels of extrinsic mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = The evolution of late life | journal = Ageing Res Rev. | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 14–32 | doi = 10.1016/j.arr.2005.06.003 | pmid = 16085467 | author1 = Rauser | first1 = C.

==Strategies ==
{{See also|Ageing#Prevention and reversal}}

===Diets and supplements===
Much life extension research focuses on nutrition—[[diet (nutrition)|diets]] or [[dietary supplement|supplements]]— although there is little evidence that they have an effect. The many diets promoted by anti-aging advocates are often contradictory. {{original research inline|date=January 2015}}

In some studies [[calorie restriction]] has been shown to extend the life of mice, yeast, and rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref name=redmanCR&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = Metabolic and behavioral compensations in response to caloric restriction: implications for the maintenance of weight loss | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 2| page = e4377 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004377 | pmid=19198647 | pmc=2634841 | author=[[Leanne Redman|Redman LM]], Heilbronn LK, Martin CK, de Jonge L, Williamson DA, Delany JP, Ravussin E| bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.4377R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=source6&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holloszy JO|author2= Fontana L | year = 2007 | title = Caloric restriction in humans | journal = Exp Gerontol | volume = 42 | issue = 8| pages = 709–12 | doi=10.1016/j.exger.2007.03.009 | pmid=17482403 | pmc=2020845}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more recent study did not find calorie restriction to improve survival in rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref name=mattisonCR&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2012 | title = Impact of caloric restriction on health and survival in rhesus monkeys from the NIA study | journal = Nature | volume = 489 | issue = 7415| pages = 318–321 | doi=10.1038/nature11432 | pmid=22932268 | pmc=3832985 | author=Mattison JA, Roth GS, Beasley TM, ''et al.''| bibcode=2012Natur.489..318M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans the long-term health effects of moderate caloric restriction with sufficient nutrients are unknown.&lt;ref name='Spindler, 2010'&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spindler |first1=Stephen R. |title=The Future of Aging |pages=367–438 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/978-90-481-3999-6_12 |chapter=Biological Effects of Calorie Restriction: Implications for Modification of Human Aging |isbn=978-90-481-3998-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[free-radical theory]] of [[aging]] suggests that [[antioxidant]] supplements might extend human life. However, evidence suggest that [[beta-Carotene|β-carotene]] supplements and high doses of vitamin&amp;nbsp;E increase mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bjelakovic, Goran|author2= Nikolova, Dimitrinka|author3= Lotte Gluud, Lise|author4= Simonetti Rosa G.|author5= Gluud Christian | year = 2007 | title = Mortality in Randomized Trials of Antioxidant Supplements for Primary and Secondary Prevention, a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 8| pages = 842–857 | doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842 | pmid=17327526}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resveratrol]] is a [[Sir2|sirtuin]] stimulant that has been shown to extend life in animal models, but the effect of resveratrol on lifespan in humans is unclear as of 2011.&lt;ref name=Fer2011&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fernández AF|author2= Fraga MF | title = The effects of the dietary polyphenol resveratrol on human healthy aging and lifespan | journal = Epigenetics | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 870–4 | date = Jul 2011 | pmid = 21613817 | doi = 10.4161/epi.6.7.16499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hormone treatment===
The anti-aging industry offers several [[hormone therapies]]. Some of these have been criticized for possible dangers and a lack of proven effect. For example, the [[American Medical Association]] has been critical of some anti-aging hormone therapies.&lt;ref name=AMA&gt;{{Cite news |first=Bruce |last=Japsen |date=15 June 2009 |title=AMA report questions science behind using hormones as anti-aging treatment |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-06-15/news/0906140132_1_anti-aging-hormones-ama-council |work=[[The Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[growth hormone]] (GH) decreases with age, the evidence for use of growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy is mixed and based mostly on animal studies. There are mixed reports that GH or [[IGF-1]] modulates the aging process in humans and about whether the direction of its effect is positive or negative.&lt;ref name=AgingMaleRev&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sattler FR | title = Growth hormone in the aging male | journal = Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 541–55 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 24054930 | doi = 10.1016/j.beem.2013.05.003 | quote = In animal models, alterations in GH/IGF-1 signaling with reductions in these somatotrophs appear to increase life span. &amp;nbsp;... Administration of IGF-1Eb (mechanogrowth factor) stimulates proliferation of myoblasts and induces muscle hypertrophy. Increases in GH and IGF-1 during adolescence are beneficial for brain and cardiovascular function during the aging process and GH administration during adolescence is vasoprotective and increases life-span.&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;... Studies relating GH and IGF-1 status to longevity provide inconsistent evidence as to whether decreased (somatopause) or high levels (e.g. acromegaly) of these hormones are beneficial or detrimental to longevity.&amp;nbsp;... It is difficult to reconcile the largely protective effects of GH/IGF-1 deficiency on longevity in animals with the inconsistent or deleterious effects of low levels or declining GH/IGF-1 during human aging.| pmc = 3940699 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The extension of life has been a desire of humanity and a mainstay motif in the history of scientific pursuits and ideas throughout history, from the Sumerian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and the Egyptian [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Smith medical papyrus]], all the way through the [[Taoists]], [[Ayurveda]] practitioners, [[alchemists]], [[hygienist]]s such as [[Luigi Cornaro]], Johann Cohausen and [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]], and philosophers such as [[Francis Bacon]], [[René Descartes]], [[Benjamin Franklin]] and Nicolas [[Condorcet]]. However, the beginning of the modern period in this endeavor can be traced to the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th century, to the so-called "[[fin-de-siècle]]" (end of the century) period, denoted as an "end of an epoch" and characterized by the rise of scientific optimism and therapeutic activism, entailing the pursuit of life extension (or life-extensionism). Among the foremost researchers of life extension at this period were the Nobel Prize winning biologist [[Elie Metchnikoff]] (1845-1916) -- the author of the cell theory of immunity and vice director of Institut Pasteur in Paris, and [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]] (1817-1894) -- the president of the French Biological Society and one of the founders of modern endocrinology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Ilia|title=A History of Life-Extensionism in the Twentieth Century|date=2014|publisher=Longevity History|isbn=1500818577|url=http://www.longevityhistory.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] claims that science has been tied to a cultural narrative of conquering death since the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. He cites [[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626) as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life, noting Bacon's novel ''[[New Atlantis]]'', wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life. [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691), founding member of the [[Royal Society]], also hoped that science would make substantial progress with life extension, according to Hughes, and proposed such experiments as "to replace the blood of the old with the blood of the young". Biologist [[Alexis Carrel]] (1873–1944) was inspired by a belief in indefinite human lifespan that he developed after experimenting with [[Cell (biology)|cells]], says Hughes.&lt;ref name="HughesTranshumanism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=James|author-link=James Hughes (sociologist)|title=Leadership in Science and Technology: A Reference Handbook|date=October 20, 2011|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|isbn=1452266522|page=587|chapter=Transhumanism|editor1-last=Bainbridge|editor1-first=William|editor1-link=William Sims Bainbridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the [[American Aging Association]] was formed under the impetus of [[Denham Harman]], originator of the [[free radical theory]] of [[aging]]. Harman wanted an organization of [[biogerontologist]]s that was devoted to research and to the sharing of information among scientists interested in extending human lifespan.

In 1976, futurists Joel Kurtzman and Philip Gordon wrote ''No More Dying. The Conquest Of Aging And The Extension Of Human Life'', ({{ISBN|0-440-36247-4}}) the first popular book on research to extend human lifespan. Subsequently, Kurtzman was invited to testify before the House Select Committee on Aging, chaired by [[Claude Pepper]] of Florida, to discuss the impact of life extension on the Social Security system.

[[Saul Kent]] published ''The Life Extension Revolution'' ({{ISBN|0-688-03580-9}}) in 1980 and created a [[nutraceutical]] firm called the [[Life Extension Foundation]], a non-profit organization that promotes dietary supplements. The Life Extension Foundation publishes a periodical called ''Life Extension Magazine''. The 1982 bestselling book ''[[Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach]]'' ({{ISBN|0-446-51229-X}}) by [[Durk Pearson]] and [[Sandy Shaw (writer)|Sandy Shaw]] further popularized the phrase "life extension".

Regulatory and legal struggles between the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and the Life Extension Foundation included seizure of merchandise and court action. In 1991, [[Saul Kent]] and Bill Faloon, the principals of the Foundation, were jailed. The LEF accused the FDA of perpetrating a "Holocaust" and "seeking gestapo-like power" through its regulation of drugs and marketing claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Ty |last=Clevenger |date=Summer 2000 |title=Internet pharmacies: cyberspace versus the regulatory state |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3048/is_2_15/ai_n28816595/ |journal=Journal of Law and Health |accessdate=17 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918191534/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3048/is_2_15/ai_n28816595/ |archivedate=18 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] published "The Immortal Cell: One Scientist's Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging," by [[Michael D. West]]. West emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=West, Michael D. |title=The Immortal Cell: One Scientist's Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZnuAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978-0-385-50928-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modern life extensionists include writer [[Gennady Stolyarov II|Gennady Stolyarov]], who insists that death is "the enemy of us all, to be fought with medicine, science, and technology";&lt;ref name="stolyarov"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Stolyarov|first1 = Gennady|title = Death is Wrong|date = November 25, 2013|publisher = Rational Argumentator Press|isbn = 978-0615932040|url = http://rationalargumentator.com/Death_is_Wrong_Second_Edition_Full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosopher [[Zoltan Istvan]], who proposes that the "transhumanist must safeguard one's own existence above all else";&lt;ref name="istvan"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Istvan|first1=Zoltan|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zoltan-istvan/the-three-laws-of-transhu_b_5853596.html |title=The Morality of Artificial Intelligence and the Three Laws of Transhumanism |publisher=Huffington Post |date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; futurist [[George Dvorsky]], who considers aging to be a problem that desperately needs to be solved;&lt;ref name=aja&gt;{{cite web|title=Futurist: 'I will reap benefits of life extension'|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/fault-lines/articles/2015/5/7/futurist-itll-start-to-become-ridiculous-not-to-talk-about-curing-aging.html|website=Al Jazeera America|date=May 7, 2015|quote=To Dvorsky, aging is a problem that’s desperately in need of solving.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recording artist [[Steve Aoki]], who has been called "one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension".&lt;ref name=tez&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tez|first1=Riva Melissa|title=Steve Aoki, Dan Bilzerian, a giraffe and the search for eternal life|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/steve-aoki-dan-bilzerian-a-giraffe-and-the-search-for-eternal-life|website=i-D|publisher=VICE|date=May 11, 2015|quote=Unknown to most, Steve is both an undeniable champion of life expansion as well as one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension.

===Scientific research===

In 1991, the [[American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine]] (A4M) was formed. The [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] recognizes neither anti-aging medicine nor the A4M's professional standing.&lt;ref name="NYTPoison"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Alex |last= Kuczynski |date=12 April 1998 |title=Anti-Aging Potion Or Poison? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/12/style/anti-aging-potion-or-poison.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Aubrey de Grey]] and [[David Gobel]] formed the [[Methuselah Foundation]], which gives financial grants to anti-aging research projects. In 2009, de Grey and several others founded the [[SENS Research Foundation]], a California-based scientific research organization which conducts research into aging and funds other anti-aging research projects at various universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sens.org/files/pdf/2011_Research_Report.pdf research report 2011]. Sens Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Google]] announced [[Calico (company)|Calico]], a new company based in San Francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/03/tech/innovation/google-calico-aging-death/|title=How Google's Calico aims to fight aging and 'solve death'|author=Arion McNicoll, Arion |date=3 October 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is led by [[Arthur D.

Barron]], [[David Botstein]], and [[Cynthia Kenyon]]. In 2014, biologist [[Craig Venter]] founded Human Longevity Inc., a company dedicated to scientific research to end aging through genomics and cell therapy. They received funding with the goal of compiling a comprehensive human genotype, microbiome, and phenotype database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/human-longevity-inc-hli-launched-to-promote-healthy-aging-using-advances-in-genomics-and-stem-cell-therapies-248379091.html|title=Human Longevity Inc.

Aside from private initiatives, aging research is being conducted in university laboratories, and includes universities such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. University researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/05/health/young-blood-mice-aging/|title=Young blood makes old mice more youthful|author=Landau, Elizabeth |date=5 May 2014|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/gdf11-protein-aging-mice-harvard/31929/ "Harvard researchers find protein that could reverse the aging process"].

==Ethics and politics ==
Politics relevant to the substances of life extension pertain mostly to communications and availability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;!--Need some clarification here. The title implies the discussion is on the politics/ethics of all life extension practices, not just marketing of pharma/surgery--&gt;

In the [[United States]], product claims on food and drug labels are strictly regulated. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] ([[freedom of speech]]) protects third-party publishers' rights to distribute fact, opinion and speculation on life extension practices. Manufacturers and suppliers also provide informational publications, but because they market the substances, they are subject to monitoring and enforcement by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), which polices claims by marketers. What constitutes the difference between truthful and false claims is hotly debated and is a central controversy in this arena.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}&lt;!--This is just the opening paragraph, describing the political arena and stage of conflict. More to follow.--&gt;

===Scientific controversy===
Some critics dispute the portrayal of aging as a disease. For example, [[Leonard Hayflick]], who determined that [[fibroblast]]s are limited to around 50&amp;nbsp;cell divisions, reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of [[entropy]]. Hayflick and fellow [[biogerontologist]]s [[S. Jay Olshansky|Jay Olshansky]] and Bruce Carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to what they see as unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti-aging [[dietary supplement|supplements]].&lt;ref name="PositionStatement"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Position statement on human aging |journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences |volume=57 |issue=8 |pages=B292–7 |date=1 August 2002 |pmid=12145354 |doi=10.1093/gerona/57.8.B292|author1=Olshansky |first1=S. J. |last2=Hayflick |first2=L |last3=Carnes |first3=B. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This may be a good place to link into the broader social debate on life extension ethics. Hayflick is not the only one to object to the portrayal/treatment of aging as a disease. Many doctors, social scientists, feminists, etc. do too--&gt;

===Consumer motivations ===
Research by Sobh and Martin (2011) suggests that people buy anti-aging products to obtain a hoped-for self (e.g., keeping a youthful skin) or to avoid a feared-self (e.g., looking old). The research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped-for self, it is expectations of success that most strongly drive their motivation to use the product. The research also shows why doing badly when trying to avoid a feared self is more motivating than doing well. When product use is seen to fail it is more motivating than success when consumers seek to avoid a feared-self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2011 | title = Feedback Information and Consumer Motivation.

===Political parties===
Though many scientists state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imminst.org/cureaging/ |title=Scientists' Open Letter on Aging |publisher=Imminst.org |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; that life extension and radical life extension are possible, there are still no international or national programs focused on radical life extension. There are political forces staying for and against life extension. By 2012, in Russia, the United States, Israel, and the Netherlands, the Longevity political parties started. They aimed to provide political support to radical life extension research and technologies, and ensure the fastest possible and at the same time soft transition of society to the next step – life without aging and with radical life extension, and to provide access to such technologies to most currently living people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php |title=A Single-Issue Political Party for Longevity Science |publisher=Fightaging.org |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silicon Valley===
Some tech innovators and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have invested heavily into anti-aging research. This includes [[Larry Ellison]] (founder of [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]), [[Peter Thiel]] (former [[Paypal]] CEO),&lt;ref&gt;Veritas Forum Q&amp;A with Peter Thiel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQHrJvwnOzo&amp;list=PLCNNepS_4NcyOSlUdWOcTUCeUbK8nuywQ&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Page]] (co-founder of [[Google]]), and [[Peter Diamandis]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/silicon-valleys-quest-to-live-forever&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentators===
[[Leon Kass]] (chairman of the US [[President's Council on Bioethics]] from 2001 to 2005) has questioned whether potential exacerbation of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] problems would make life extension unethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Simon |last=Smith |date=3 December 2002 |title=Killing Immortality |url=http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040607195722/http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4 |archivedate=7 June 2004 |publisher=Betterhumans |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states his opposition to life extension with the words:
{{Quote|"simply to covet a prolonged life span for ourselves is both a sign and a cause of our failure to open ourselves to procreation and to any higher purpose ... [The] desire to prolong youthfulness is not only a childish desire to eat one's life and keep it; it is also an expression of a childish and [[narcissistic]] wish incompatible with devotion to posterity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Leon |last=Kass |authorlink= Leon Kass |year=1985 |title=Toward a more natural science: biology and human affairs |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-02-918340-3 |oclc=11677465 |page= 316}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Harris, former editor-in-chief of the Journal of Medical Ethics, argues that as long as life is worth living, according to the person himself, we have a powerful moral imperative to save the life and thus to develop and offer life extension therapies to those who want them.&lt;ref&gt;Harris J. (2007) ''Enhancing Evolution: The ethical case for making better people''. Princeton University Press, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transhumanist]] [[philosopher]] [[Nick Bostrom]] has argued that any technological advances in life extension must be equitably distributed and not restricted to a privileged few.&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"&gt;{{Cite news |first=John |last=Sutherland |date=9 May 2006 |title=The ideas interview: Nick Bostrom |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/may/09/academicexperts.genetics |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 17 July 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an extended metaphor entitled "The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant", Bostrom envisions death as a monstrous dragon who demands human sacrifices. In the fable, after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed, the dragon is finally killed. Bostrom argues that political inaction allowed many preventable human deaths to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Bostrom, N |title=The fable of the dragon tyrant |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=273–7 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15863685 |pmc=1734155 |doi= 10.1136/jme.2004.009035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overpopulation concerns===

Controversy about life extension is due to fear of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and possible effects on society.&lt;ref name="Superlongevity Without Overpopulation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2005/02/superlongevity-without-overpopulation-1.php|title=Superlongevity Without Overpopulation|work=Fight Aging!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biogerontologist [[Aubrey De Grey]] counters the overpopulation critique by pointing out that the therapy could postpone or eliminate [[menopause]], allowing women to space out their pregnancies over more years and thus ''decreasing'' the yearly population growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-ethics-of-anti-aging-by-peter-singer|title=Peter Singer on Should We Live to 1,000? – Project Syndicate|work=Project Syndicate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the philosopher and futurist [[Max More]] argues that, given the fact the worldwide population growth rate is slowing down and is projected to eventually stabilize and begin falling, superlongevity would be unlikely to contribute to overpopulation.&lt;ref name="Superlongevity Without Overpopulation"/&gt;

===Opinion polls===

A Spring 2013 [[Pew Research]] poll in the United States found that 38% of Americans would want life extension treatments, and 56% would reject it. However, it also found that 68% believed most people would want it and that only 4% consider an "ideal lifespan" to be more than 120 years. The median "ideal lifespan" was 91 years of age and the majority of the public (63%) viewed medical advances aimed at prolonging life as generally good. 41% of Americans believed that radical life extension (RLE) would be good for society, while 51% said they believed it would be bad for society.&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt; One possibility for why 56% of Americans claim they would reject life extension treatments may be due to the cultural perception that living longer would result in a longer period of decrepitude, and that the elderly in our current society are unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Magalhães JP | year = 2014 | title = The scientific quest for lasting youth: prospects for curing aging | journal = Rejuvenation Res | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 458–67 | doi = 10.1089/rej.2014.1580 | pmid = 25132068 | pmc = 4203147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious people are no more likely to oppose life extension than the unaffiliated,&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/|title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans’ Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension|date=6 August 2013|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some variation exists between religious denominations.

==Aging as a disease==
Mainstream medical organizations and practitioners do not consider aging to be a disease. [[David Sinclair (biologist)|David Sinclair]] says: "I&amp;nbsp;don't see aging as a disease, but as a collection of quite predictable diseases caused by the deterioration of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hayden EC | year = 2007 | title = A new angle on 'old' | journal = Nature | volume = 450 | issue = 7170| pages = 603–603 | doi = 10.1038/450603a | pmid=18046373| bibcode = 2007Natur.450..603H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main arguments used are that aging is both inevitable and universal while diseases are not.&lt;ref&gt;Hamerman D. (2007) ''Geriatric Bioscience: The link between aging &amp; disease''. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not everyone agrees. Harry R. Moody, director of academic affairs for [[AARP]], notes that what is normal and what is disease strongly depend on a historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moody HR|title=Who's afraid of life extension?|journal= Generations|volume=25|issue= 4 |year=2002|pages= 33–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Gems, assistant director of the Institute of Healthy Ageing, argues that aging should be viewed as a disease.&lt;ref name=Gems1&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gems D | year = 2011 | title = Aging: To Treat, or Not to Treat? The possibility of treating aging is not just an idle fantasy | journal = American Scientist | volume = 99 | issue = 4| pages = 278–80 | doi = 10.1511/2011.91.278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the universality of aging, David Gems notes that it is as misleading as arguing that [[Basenji]] are not dogs because they do not bark.&lt;ref name=Gems2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gems D | year = 2011 | title = Tragedy and delight: the ethics of decelerated ageing | journal = Philos Trans R Soc B | volume = 366 | issue = 1561| pages = 108–112 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0288| pmc = 3001315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the universality of aging he calls it a "special sort of disease". Robert M. Perlman, coined the terms "aging syndrome" and "disease complex" in 1954 to describe aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Perlman RM | year = 1954 | title = The aging syndrome | journal = J Am Geriatr Soc | volume = 2 | pages = 123–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion whether aging should be viewed as a disease or not has important implications. One view is, this would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the United States of America, it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the FDA. Anti-aging now falls under the regulations for cosmetic medicine which are less tight than those for drugs.&lt;ref name=Gems2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 15197284| year = 2004| author1 = Mehlman| first1 = M.

==Research==
Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan in humans could be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues, reversal of harmful epigenetic changes, or the enhancement of enzyme [[telomerase]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rando TA|author2= Chang HY|authorlink2=Howard Y.

Research geared towards life extension strategies in various organisms is currently under way at a number of academic and private institutions. Since 2009, investigators have found ways to increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by 10-fold; the record in nematodes was achieved through [[genetic engineering]] and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and [[caloric restriction]].&lt;ref name=Shmookle&gt;{{cite journal | date = 2009 | title = Extreme-longevity mutations orchestrate silencing of multiple signaling pathways| journal = Biochim Biophys Acta | volume = 1790 | issue = 10| pages = 1075–83 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.05.011 | pmid = 19465083 | pmc=2885961| author1 = Shmookler Reis| first1 = R. J.| last2 = Bharill| first2 = P| last3 = Tazearslan| first3 = C| last4 = Ayyadevara| first4 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 review of longevity research noted: "Extrapolation from worms to mammals is risky at best, and it cannot be assumed that interventions will result in comparable life extension factors. Longevity gains from dietary restriction, or from mutations studied previously, yield smaller benefits to Drosophila than to nematodes, and smaller still to mammals. This is not unexpected, since mammals have evolved to live many times the worm's lifespan, and humans live nearly twice as long as the next longest-lived primate. From an evolutionary perspective, mammals and their ancestors have already undergone several hundred million years of natural selection favoring traits that could directly or indirectly favor increased longevity, and may thus have already settled on gene sequences that promote lifespan. Moreover, the very notion of a "life-extension factor" that could apply across taxa presumes a linear response rarely seen in biology."&lt;ref name=Shmookle/&gt;

===Anti-aging drugs===

There are a number of chemicals intended to slow the aging process currently being studied in [[animal model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Childs et al. (2015). [http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v21/n12/full/nm.4000.html Cellular senescence in aging and age-related disease: from mechanisms to therapy] Nature Medicine {{doi|10.1038/nm.4000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of research is related to the observed effects of a [[calorie restriction]] (CR) diet, which has been shown to extend lifespan in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last2 = Shanmuganayagam| first1 = M. | first2 = D.| last1 = Anderson| title = Caloric restriction and aging: studies in mice and monkeys| last3 = Weindruch | first3 = R.| journal = Toxicologic pathology| volume = 37| issue = 1| pages = 47–51| year = 2009| pmid = 19075044| doi = 10.1177/0192623308329476| pmc = 3734859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on that research, there have been attempts to develop drugs that will have the same effect on the aging process as a caloric restriction diet, which are known as [[Caloric restriction mimetic]] drugs.  Some drugs that are already approved for other uses have been studied for possible longevity effects on laboratory animals because of a possible CR-mimic effect; they include [[rapamycin]],&lt;ref name=source25&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = Rapamycin fed late in life extends lifespan in genetically heterogeneous mice | journal = Nature | volume = 460 |pages = 392–5 | doi=10.1038/nature08221 | pmid=19587680 | pmc=2786175 | author=Harrison DE, Strong R, Sharp ZD, ''et al.''| bibcode=2009Natur.460..392H }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[metformin]] and other [[geroprotector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2005 | title = Identification of Potential Caloric Restriction Mimetics by Microarray Profiling | journal = Physiological Genomics | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 343–50 | pmid = 16189280 | doi=10.1152/physiolgenomics.00069.2005 | author=Dhahbi JM, Mote PL, Fahy GM, Spindler SR}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MitoQ]], [[resveratrol]] and [[pterostilbene]] are [[dietary supplements]] that have also been studied in this context.&lt;ref name=Kaeberlein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaeberlein|first=Matt|title=Resveratrol, pterostilbene and rapamycin:are they anti-aging drugs?|journal=BioEssays|year=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=96–99|doi=10.1002/bies.200900171|pmid=20091754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Low Dose of Dietary Resveratrol Partially Mimics Caloric Restriction and Retards Aging Parameters in Mice | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 3| issue = 6| pages = e2264| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0002264 | pmid=18523577 | pmc=2386967 | year=2008 | author=Barger JL, Kayo T, Vann JM, ''et al.''| bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2264B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23691264 | doi=10.1155/2013/575482 | volume=2013 | title=A review of pterostilbene antioxidant activity and disease modification | pmc=3649683 | year=2013 | journal=Oxid Med Cell Longev | page=575482 | author=McCormack D, McFadden D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other attempts to create anti-aging drugs have taken different research paths. One notable direction of research has been research into the possibility of using the enzyme [[telomerase]] in order to counter the process of [[telomere shortening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Telomeres and Telomerase Basic Science Implications for Aging | journal = American Geriatrics Society | volume = 49 | issue = 8| pages = 1105–1109 | doi = 10.1046/j.1532-5415.2001.49217.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are potential dangers in this, since some research has also linked telomerase to cancer and to tumor growth and formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0147| pmid = 16179494| title = Telomerase and Cancer: Kirk A.

===Nanotechnology===
Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated [[Cell (biology)|cell]] repair machines, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical molecular [[computers]], in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]]. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=[[The Singularity Is Near]] |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical [[nanomachines]] (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Cloning and body part replacement===
Some life extensionists suggest that [[therapeutic cloning]] and [[stem cell]] research could one day provide a way to generate cells, body parts, or even entire bodies (generally referred to as [[reproductive cloning]]) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient. Recently, the US Department of Defense initiated a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Donald |last=Melanson |date=April 22, 2008 |title=DoD establishes institute tasked with regrowing body parts |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/04/22/dod-establishes-institute-tasked-with-regrowing-body-parts/ |publisher=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex biological structures, such as mammalian joints and limbs, have not yet been replicated. Dog and primate brain transplantation experiments were conducted in the mid-20th century but failed due to [[transplant rejection|rejection]] and the inability to restore nerve connections. As of 2006, the implantation of bio-engineered bladders grown from patients' own cells has proven to be a viable treatment for bladder disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Roxanne |last=Khamsi |date=April 4, 2006 |title=Bio-engineered bladders successful in patients |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8939-bioengineered-bladders-successful-in-patients.html |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of body part replacement and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life-extension technologies.

The use of human [[stem cells]], particularly [[embryonic stem cells]], is controversial. Opponents' objections generally are based on interpretations of religious teachings or ethical considerations.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Proponents of stem cell research point out that cells are routinely formed and destroyed in a variety of contexts. Use of stem cells taken from the umbilical cord or parts of the adult body may not provoke controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Christine |last=White |date=19 August 2005 |title=Umbilical stem cell breakthrough |url=http://www.stemcellnews.com/articles/stem-cells-umbilical-breakthrough.htm |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=17 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720054316/http://www.stemcellnews.com/articles/stem-cells-umbilical-breakthrough.htm |archivedate=20 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversies over cloning are similar, except general public opinion in most countries stands in opposition to [[reproductive cloning]]. Some proponents of therapeutic cloning predict the production of whole bodies, lacking consciousness, for eventual brain transplantation.

===Cyborgs===
{{Main|Cyborg}}
Replacement of biological (susceptible to diseases) organs with mechanical ones could extend life. This is the goal of the [[2045 Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;David Segal for the New York Times. 1 June 2013 [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/business/dmitry-itskov-and-the-avatar-quest.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 This Man Is Not a Cyborg. Yet.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryonics===
{{Main|Cryonics}}
For cryonicists (advocates of [[cryopreservation]]), storing the body at low temperatures after death may provide an "ambulance" into a future in which advanced medical technologies may allow resuscitation and repair. They speculate [[cryogenic]] temperatures will minimize changes in biological tissue for many years, giving the medical community ample time to cure all disease, rejuvenate the aged and repair any damage that is caused by the [[cryopreservation]] process.

Many cryonicists do not believe that [[legal death]] is "[[Medical definition of death|real death]]" because stoppage of [[heart rate|heartbeat]] and [[breath]]ing—the usual medical criteria for legal death—occur before biological death of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the body. Even at room [[temperature]], cells may take hours to die and days to [[decompose]]. Although [[neurological]] damage occurs within 4–6 minutes of cardiac arrest, the irreversible [[neurodegenerative disease|neurodegenerative]] processes do not manifest for hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Neuronal necrosis after middle cerebral artery occlusion in Wistar rats progresses at different time intervals in the caudoputamen and the cortex |journal=Stroke |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=636–42; discussion 643 |date=1995 |pmid=7709411 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.26.4.636 |author=Garcia JH, Liu KF, Ho KL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryonicists {{who|date=July 2017}}state that rapid cooling and [[heart|cardio]]-[[lung|pulmonary]] support applied immediately after certification of death can preserve [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[biological tissue|tissues]] for long-term preservation at [[cryogenic]] [[temperature]]s. People, particularly children, have survived up to an hour without heartbeat after submersion in ice water. In one case, full recovery was reported after 45 minutes underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Full recovery after 45 min accidental submersion |journal=Intensive Care Medicine |volume=28 |issue=4 |page=524 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11967613 |doi=10.1007/s00134-002-1245-2 |author=Perk L, Borger van de Burg F, Berendsen HH, van't Wout JW}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate rapid preservation of cells and tissue, cryonics "standby teams" are available to wait by the bedside of patients who are to be cryopreserved to apply cooling and cardio-pulmonary support as soon as possible after declaration of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcor.org/BecomeMember/standby.html |title=Comprehensive Member Standby |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[mammal]] has been successfully cryopreserved and brought back to life, with the exception of [[embryo cryopreservation|frozen human embryos]]. Resuscitation of a postembryonic human from [[cryonics]] is not possible with current science. Some scientists still support the idea based on their expectations of the [[technological singularity|capabilities of future science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imminst.org/cryonics_letter/ |title=Scientists' Open Letter on Cryonics |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcor.org/AboutCryonics/index.html |title=Advances in Cryonics |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategies for engineered negligible senescence===
{{Main|Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence|Genetics of aging}}
Another proposed life extension technology would combine existing and predicted future biochemical and genetic techniques. SENS proposes that rejuvenation may be obtained by removing aging damage via the use of [[stem cell]]s and [[tissue engineering]], [[telomere]]-lengthening machinery, [[allotopic expression]] of [[mitochondrial]] proteins, targeted ablation of cells, [[immunotherapy|immunotherapeutic]] clearance, and novel [[lysosome|lysosomal]] [[hydrolases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Aubrey |last=de Grey |authorlink=Aubrey de Grey |author2=Michael Rae |title=[[Ending Aging|Ending Aging: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime]] |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |year=2007 |location=[[New York City]] |isbn= 978-0-312-36706-0 |oclc=132583222}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic editing===
{{Main|Genome editing}}
[[Genome editing]], in which [[nucleic acid]] polymers are delivered as a [[Biologic medical product|drug]] and are either [[gene expression|expressed]] as proteins, interfere with the expression of proteins, or correct genetic mutations, has been proposed as a future strategy to prevent aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Neuroendocrinology of Aging: The Potential of Gene Therapy as an Interventive Strategy |journal=Gerontology |date=2001-01-08 |first=Rodolfo G. |last=Goya |author2=Federico Bolognani |author3=Claudia B.

A large array of genetic modifications have been found to increase lifespan in model organisms such as yeast, nematode worms, fruit flies, and mice. As of 2013, the longest extension of life caused by a single gene manipulation was roughly 50% in mice and 10-fold in [[nematode]] worms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks1155| pmid = 23193293| pmc = 3531213| title = Human Ageing Genomic Resources: Integrated databases and tools for the biology and genetics of ageing| journal = Nucleic Acids Research| volume = 41| issue = Database issue| pages = D1027–33| year = 2012| last1 = Tacutu | first1 = R.| last2 = Craig | first2 = T.| last3 = Budovsky | first3 = A.| last4 = Wuttke | first4 = D.| last5 = Lehmann | first5 = G.| last6 = Taranukha | first6 = D.| last7 = Costa | first7 = J.| last8 = Fraifeld | first8 = V.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fooling genes===
In ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] describes an approach to life-extension that involves "fooling genes" into thinking the body is young.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |origyear=1976|year=2006 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn= 978-0-19-929115-1 | pages = 41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins attributes inspiration for this idea to [[Peter Medawar]]. The basic idea is that our bodies are composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes, some when we are young and others when we are older. Presumably, these genes are activated by environmental factors, and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore, to extend life, we should be able to prevent these genes from switching on, and we should be able to do so by "identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |origyear=1976|year=2006 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn= 978-0-19-929115-1 | page = 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind uploading===
{{Main|Mind uploading}}
One hypothetical future strategy that, as some suggest,{{who|date=July 2017}} "eliminates" the complications related to a physical body, involves the copying or transferring (e.g. by progressively replacing neurons with transistors) of a conscious mind from a biological brain to a non-biological computer system or computational device. The basic idea is to scan the structure of a particular brain in detail, and then construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Anders|last=Sandberg| author1-link=Anders Sandberg|first2=Nick|last2=Boström| author2-link=Nick Bostrom|title=Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap|quote=''The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.''|url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Reports/2008-3.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2013|series= Technical Report #2008‐3|year=2008| publisher = Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not an exact copy of one's mind constitutes actual life extension is matter of debate.

Some scientists believe that the dead may one day be "resurrected" through simulation technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bostrom |first=Nick|title=Are You Living in a Computer Simulation? |date=19 January 2010 |work= |publisher= |url=http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Young blood injection===
{{see|Young blood transfusion}}
Some clinics currently offer injection of blood products from young donors. The alleged benefits of the treatment, none of which have been demonstrated in a proper study, include a longer life, darker hair, better memory, better sleep, curing heart diseases, diabetes and Alzheimer.&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603242/questionable-young-blood-transfusions-offered-in-us-as-anti-aging-remedy/|title=Questionable "Young Blood" Transfusions Offered in U.S. as Anti-Aging Remedy|last=Maxmen|first=Amy|date=January 13, 2017|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=natpost&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/world/why-a-silicon-valley-company-is-pumping-old-people-full-of-young-blood-for-us8000|title=This anti-aging startup says US$8,000 worth of young blood can help you live longer|last=Kirkey|first=Sharon|date=November 2, 2017|work=National Post|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=indep&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/teenagers-blood-transfusion-ambrosia-san-francisco-jesse-karmazin-a7902916.html|title=Teenagers' blood being sold for £6,200 a shot|last=Osborne|first=Samuel|date=August 20, 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2017/aug/21/ambrosia-the-startup-harvesting-the-blood-of-the-young|title=Ambrosia: the startup harvesting the blood of the young|last=Haynes|first=Gavin|date=August 21, 2017|website=The Guardian|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/blood-transfusions-from-teenagers-start-up-charging-8000-apiece.html|title=This start-up is offering $8,000 blood transfusions from teens to people who want to fight aging|last=Farr|first=Christina|date=May 31, 2017|work=CNBC|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach is based on [[parabiosis]] studies such as Irina Conboy do on mice, but Conboy says young blood does not reverse aging (even in mice) and that those who offer those treatments have misunderstood her research.&lt;ref name=natpost/&gt;&lt;ref name=indep/&gt; Neuroscientist Tony Wyss-Coray, who also studied blood exchanges on mice as recently as 2014, said people offering those treatments are "basically abusing people's trust"&lt;ref name=vanfair/&gt;&lt;ref name=indep/&gt; and that young blood treatments are "the scientific equivalent of fake news".&lt;ref name=quartz&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/996190/ambrosia-says-a-transfusion-of-young-blood-plasma-lowered-disease-markers-in-a-human-trial/|title=A startup that charges $8,000 for young blood transfusions swears they’re worth every penny|last=Foley|first=Katherine Ellen|date=June 1, 2017|work=Quartz|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment appeared in HBO's Silicon Valley fiction series.&lt;ref name=vanfair&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/this-anti-aging-start-up-is-paying-thousands-of-dollars-for-teen-blood|title=This anti-aging start-up is charging thousands of dollars for teen blood|last=Kosoff|first=Maya|date=June 1, 2017|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liquid slugging''' is the phenomenon of liquid entering the cylinder of a [[reciprocating compressor]], a common cause of failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2815&amp;context=icec |date=2006 |title=The Detection of Liquid Slugging Phenomena in Reciprocating Compressors via Power Measurements |author1=Christopher R. Laughman |author2=Peter R. Armstrong |author3=Leslie K. Norford |website=Docs.lib.purdue.edu |accessdate=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under normal conditions, the intake and output of a compressor cylinder is entirely vapor or gas, when a liquid accumulates at the suction port liquid slugging can occur. As more of the practically incompressible liquid enters, strain is placed upon the system leading to a variety of failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rses.org/assets/rses_journal/0515_Compressors.pdf|title=Why Compressors Fail|last=|first=|date=|website=RSES Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Archangel Michael, St Pancras New Church, London.JPG|thumb|300px|Onyx sculpture in the grounds of [[St Pancras New Church]], London]] 
This is a geographical '''list of [[rock (geology)|natural stone]]''' used for decorative purposes in [[construction]] and [[monumental sculpture]] produced in various countries.

The [[dimension stone|dimension-stone]] industry classifies stone based on appearance and hardness as either "granite", "marble" or "slate".

The granite of the dimension-stone industry along with truly granitic rock also includes gneiss, gabbro, anorthosite and even some sedimentary rocks.

Natural stone is used as architectural stone (construction, flooring, cladding, counter tops, curbing, etc.) and as raw block and monument stone for the funerary trade. Natural stone is also used in custom stone engraving. The engraved stone can be either decorative or functional. Natural memorial stones are used as [[natural burial]] markers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44733">This is a '''list of herbaria''', organized first by continent where the herbarium is located, then within each continent by size of the collection. A [[herbarium]] (''plural'' "herbaria") is a collection of preserved [[plant]] specimens. These specimens may be whole plants or plant parts: these will usually be in a dried form, mounted on a sheet, but depending upon the material may also be kept in alcohol or other preservative. The same term is often used in [[mycology]] to describe an equivalent collection of preserved [[fungi]] and in [[phycology]] to describe a collection of [[algae]].

To preserve their form and color, plants collected in the field are spread flat on sheets of newsprint and dried, usually in a plant press, between blotters or absorbent paper. The specimens, which are then mounted on sheets of stiff white paper, are labeled with all essential data, such as date and place found, description of the plant, altitude, and special habitat conditions. The sheet is then placed in a protective case. As a precaution against insect attack, the pressed plant is frozen or poisoned and the case disinfected.

Most herbaria utilize a standard system of organizing their specimens into herbarium cases. Specimen sheets are stacked in groups by the [[species]] to which they belong and placed into a large lightweight [[File folder|folder]] that is labelled on the bottom edge. Groups of species folders are then placed together into larger, heavier folders by [[genus]]. The genus folders are then sorted by taxonomic [[family (biology)|family]] according to the standard system selected for use by the herbarium and placed into pigeonholes in herbarium cabinets. Herbaria are essential for the study of [[plant taxonomy]], the study of geographic distributions, and the stabilizing of nomenclature. Herbaria also preserve an historical record of change in [[vegetation]] over time. In some cases, plants become [[Extinction|extinct]] in one area, or may become extinct altogether. In such cases, specimens preserved in an herbarium can represent the only record of the plant's original distribution. Environmental scientists make use of such data to track changes in [[climate]] and human impact.

{{See also|Invasive species in the British Isles|List of invasive species in Portugal}}

This is a '''list of [[invasive species]] in [[Europe]]'''. A species is regarded as invasive if it has become introduced to a location, area, or region where it did not previously occur naturally (i.e., is not a [[native species]]) and becomes capable of establishing a breeding population in the new location. An invasive species will be one that thrives in its new environment and negatively influences the ecology and biodiversity of that ecosystem.

The term '''invasive species''' refers to a subset of those species defined as [[introduced species]]. If a species has been introduced but remains local, and is not problematic to agriculture or to the local biodiversity, then it cannot be considered to be invasive, and does not belong on this list.

'''Living systems''' are open self-organizing life forms that interact with their environment. These systems are maintained by flows of information, [[energy flow (ecology)|energy]] and matter.

Some scientists have proposed in the last few decades that a general living systems theory is required to explain the nature of [[life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Woodruff | first = T. Sullivan | authorlink = |author2=John Baross  | title = Planets and Life: The Emerging Science of Astrobiology | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | date = October 8, 2007 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}
Cleland and Chyba wrote a chapter in Planets and Life: "In the absence of such a theory, we are in a position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define 'water' in the absence of molecular theory." [...] "Without access to living things having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of living systems".&lt;/ref&gt; Such a general theory, arising out of the [[Ecology|ecological]] and [[Biology|biological sciences]], attempts to map general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break things down into components, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patterns, Flows, and Interrelationship |url=http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |accessdate=2009-06-27 |first=Molly Young |last=Brown |date=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108122526/http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Living systems theory is a general theory about the existence of all living systems, their [[structure]], [[interaction]], [[behavior]] and [[developmental biology|development]]. This work is created by [[James Grier Miller]], which was intended to formalize the concept of life. According to Miller's original conception as spelled out in his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''Living Systems'', a "living system" must contain each of twenty "critical subsystems", which are defined by their functions and visible in numerous systems, from simple cells to organisms, countries, and societies. In ''Living Systems'' Miller provides a detailed look at a number of systems in order of increasing size, and identifies his subsystems in each. 
Miller considers living systems as a subset of all [[system]]s. Below the level of living systems, he defines [[space]] and [[time]], [[matter]] and [[energy]], [[information]] and [[entropy]], levels of [[organization]], and physical and conceptual factors, and above living systems ecological, planetary and solar systems, galaxies, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Seppänen, 1998, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Living systems according to Parent (1996) are by definition "open self-organizing [[system]]s that have the special characteristics of life and interact with their [[social environment|environment]]. This takes place by means of information and material-energy exchanges. Living systems can be as simple as a single [[cell (biology)|cell]] or as complex as a supranational [[organization]] such as the European Union. Regardless of their [[complexity]], they each depend upon the same essential twenty subsystems (or processes) in order to survive and to continue the propagation of their species or types beyond a single generation".&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Parent, [http://projects.isss.org/the_living_systems_theory_of_james_grier_miller ''The Living Systems Theory of James Grier Miller''], Primer project ISSS, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller said that systems exist at eight "nested" hierarchical levels: cell, organ, organism, group, organization, community, society, and supranational system. At each level, a system invariably comprises twenty critical subsystems, which process matter–energy or information except for the first two, which process both matter–energy and information: reproducer and boundary.

The processors of matter–energy are: 
* ingestor, distributor, converter, producer, storage, extruder, motor, supporter

The processors of information are:
* input transducer, internal transducer, channel and net, timer (added later), decoder, associator, memory, decider, encoder, output transducer.

==Miller's living systems theory==
James Grier Miller in 1978 wrote a 1,102-page volume to present his living systems theory. He constructed a general theory of living [[system]]s by focusing on concrete systems—nonrandom accumulations of matter–energy in physical space–time organized into interacting, interrelated [[subsystem]]s or components. Slightly revising the original model a dozen years later, he distinguished eight "nested" hierarchical levels in such complex structures. Each level is "nested" in the sense that each higher level contains the next lower level in a nested fashion.

His central thesis is that the systems in existence at all eight levels are [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]] composed of twenty critical subsystems that process inputs, throughputs, and outputs of various forms of matter–energy and information. Two of these subsystems—reproducer and boundary—process both matter–energy and information. Eight of them process only matter–energy. The other ten process information only. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;All nature is a continuum. The endless complexity of life is organized into patterns which repeat themselves—theme and variations—at each level of system. These similarities and differences are proper concerns for science. From the ceaseless streaming of protoplasm to the many-vectored activities of supranational systems, there are continuous flows through living systems as they maintain their highly organized steady states.&lt;ref&gt;(Miller, 1978, p. 1025)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Seppänen (1998) says that Miller applied [[general systems theory]] on a broad scale to describe all aspects of living systems.&lt;ref&gt;Seppänen 1998, pp. 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topics in living systems theory===
Miller's theory posits that the mutual interrelationship of the components of a system extends across the hierarchical levels. Examples: Cells and organs of a living system thrive on the food the organism obtains from its suprasystem; the member countries of a supranational system reap the benefits accrued from the communal activities to which each one contributes. Miller says that his eclectic theory "ties together past discoveries from many disciplines and provides an outline into which new findings can be fitted".&lt;ref&gt;(Miller, 1978, p. 1025)&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller says the concepts of space, time, matter, energy, and information are essential to his theory because the living systems exist in space and are made of matter and energy organized by information. Miller's theory of living systems employs two sorts of spaces: physical or geographical space, and conceptual or abstracted spaces. Time is the fundamental "fourth dimension" of the physical space–time continuum/spiral. Matter is anything that has mass and occupies physical space. Mass and energy are equivalent as one can be converted into the other. Information refers to the degrees of freedom that exist in a given situation to choose among signals, symbols, messages, or patterns to be transmitted.

Other relevant concepts are system, structure, process, type, level, echelon, suprasystem, subsystem, transmissions, and steady state. A system can be conceptual, concrete or abstracted. The structure of a system is the arrangement of the subsystems and their components in three-dimensional space at any point of time. Process, which can be reversible or irreversible, refers to change over time of matter–energy or information in a system. Type defines living systems with similar characteristics. Level is the position in a hierarchy of systems. Many complex living systems, at various levels, are organized into two or more echelons. The suprasystem of any living system is the next higher system in which it is a subsystem or component. The totality of all the structures in a system which carry out a particular process is a subsystem. Transmissions are inputs and outputs in concrete systems. Because living systems are open systems, with continually altering fluxes of matter–energy and information, many of their equilibria are dynamic—situations identified as steady states or flux equilibria.

Miller identifies the comparable matter–energy and information processing critical subsystems. Elaborating on the eight hierarchical levels, he defines society, which constitutes the seventh hierarchy, as "a large, living, concrete system with [community] and lower am levels of living systems as subsystems and components".&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1978, p. 747.&lt;/ref&gt; Society may include small, primitive, totipotential communities; ancient city–states, and kingdoms; as well as modern nation–states and empires that are not supranational systems. Miller provides general descriptions of each of the subsystems that fit all eight levels.

A supranational system, in Miller's view, "is composed of two or more societies, some or all of whose processes are under the control of a decider that is superordinate to their highest echelons".&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1978, p. 903&lt;/ref&gt; However, he contends that no supranational system with all its twenty subsystems under control of its decider exists today. The absence of a supranational decider precludes the existence of a concrete supranational system. Miller says that studying a supranational system is problematical because its subsystems
&lt;blockquote&gt;...tend to consist of few components besides the decoder. These systems do little matter-energy processing. The power of component societies [nations] today is almost always greater than the power of supranational deciders. Traditionally, theory at this level has been based upon intuition and study of history rather than data collection. Some quantitative research is now being done, and construction of global-system models and simulations is currently burgeoning.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1978, p. 1043.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the supranational system level, Miller's emphasis is on international organizations, associations, and groups comprising representatives of societies (nation–states). Miller identifies the subsystems at this level to suit this emphasis. Thus, for example, the reproducer is "any multipurpose supranational system which creates a single purpose supranational organization" (p.&amp;nbsp;914); and the boundary is the "supranational forces, usually located on or near supranational borders, which defend, guard, or police them" (p.&amp;nbsp;914).

===Strengths of Miller's theory===
Not just those specialized in international communication, but all communication science scholars could pay particular attention to the major contributions of living systems theory (LST) to social systems approaches that [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Kenneth D. Bailey]], (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out:
* The specification of the twenty critical subsystems in any living system.
* The specification of the eight hierarchical levels of living systems.
* The emphasis on cross-level analysis and the production of numerous cross-level hypotheses.
* Cross-subsystem research (e.g., formulation and testing of hypotheses in two or more subsystems at a time).
* Cross-level, cross-subsystem research.

Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]] says that LST, perhaps the "most integrative" social systems theory, has made many more contributions that may be easily overlooked, such as: providing a detailed analysis of types of systems; making a distinction between concrete and abstracted systems; discussion of physical space and time; placing emphasis on information processing; providing an analysis of entropy;  recognition of totipotential systems, and partipotential systems; providing an innovative approach to the structure–process issue; and introducing the concept of joint subsystem—a subsystem that belongs to two systems simultaneously; of dispersal—lateral, outward, upward, and downward; of inclusion—inclusion of something from the environment that is not part of the system; of artifact—an animal-made or human-made inclusion; of adjustment process, which combats stress in a system; and of critical subsystems, which carry out processes that all living systems need to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth D. Bailey 2006, pp.292–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

LST's analysis of the twenty interacting subsystems, [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]] adds, clearly distinguishing between matter–energy-processing and information-processing, as well as LST's analysis of the eight interrelated system levels, enables us to understand how social systems are linked to biological systems. LST also analyzes the irregularities or "organizational pathologies" of systems functioning (e.g., system stress and strain, feedback irregularities, information–input overload). It explicates the role of entropy in social research while it equates [[negentropy]] with information and order. It emphasizes both structure and process, as well as their interrelations.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth D. bailey, 1994, pp. 209–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
It omits the analysis of subjective phenomena, and it overemphasizes concrete Q-analysis (correlation of objects) to the virtual exclusion of R-analysis (correlation of variables). By asserting that societies (ranging from [[Totipotent#Totipotency|totipotential]] communities to nation-states and non-supranational systems) have greater control over their subsystem components than supranational systems have, it dodges the issue of transnational power over the contemporary social systems. Miller's supranational system bears no resemblance to the modern world-system that [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] (1974) described, although both of them were looking at the same living (dissipative) structure.

'''Marxism''' is a method of [[socioeconomic]] analysis that views [[Social class|class]] relations and [[social conflict]] using a [[Historical materialism|materialist interpretation of historical development]] and takes a [[dialectic]]al view of social transformation. It originates from the works of 19th-century German philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].

Marxism uses a methodology, now known as [[historical materialism]], to analyze and critique the development of [[capitalism]] and the role of [[class struggle]]s in systemic economic change.

According to Marxist theory, class conflict arises in [[Capitalism|capitalist societies]] due to contradictions between the material interests of the oppressed [[proletariat]]—a class of wage labourers employed to produce goods and services—and the [[bourgeoisie]]—the [[ruling class]] that owns the [[means of production]] and extract their wealth through appropriation of the [[surplus product]] ([[Profit (economics)|profit]]) produced by the proletariat.

This class struggle that is commonly expressed as the revolt of a society's [[productive forces]] against its [[relations of production]], results in a period of short-term crises as the bourgeoisie struggle to manage the intensifying [[alienation of labor]] experienced by the proletariat, albeit with varying degrees of [[class consciousness]]. This crisis culminates in a [[proletarian revolution]] and eventually leads to the establishment of [[socialism]]—a socioeconomic system based on [[social ownership]] of the means of production, [[To each according to his contribution|distribution based on one's contribution]] and [[Production for use|production organized directly for use]]. As the productive forces continued to advance, Marx hypothesized that socialism would ultimately transform into a [[communist society]]; a classless, stateless, humane society based on [[common ownership]] and the underlying principle: "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]]".

Marxism has developed into many different branches and schools of thought, though now there is no single definitive Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0-8018-3480-6|page=130|quote=The German Marxists extended the theory to groups and issues Marx had barely touched.

== Overview ==
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883)]]
Marxism analyzes the material conditions and the economic activities required to fulfill human material needs to explain [[social phenomena]] within any given society.

It assumes that the form of economic organization, or [[mode of production]], influences all other social phenomena—including social relations, political institutions, legal systems, cultural systems, aesthetics, and ideologies. The economic system and these social relations form a [[base and superstructure]].

As [[forces of production]], i.e. [[technology]], improve, existing forms of social organization become obsolete and hinder further progress. As [[Karl Marx]] observed: "At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or—this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms—with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution".&lt;ref&gt;''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' (1859). Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; These inefficiencies manifest themselves as social contradictions in society in the form of [[class struggle]].&lt;ref name="ComparingEconomic"&gt;''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'' (2003) by Gregory and Stuart. p. 62. ''Marx's Theory of Change''. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], this struggle materializes between the minority (the [[bourgeoisie]]) who own the [[means of production]] and the vast majority of the population (the [[proletariat]]) who produce goods and services. Starting with the conjectural premise that [[social change]] occurs because of the struggle between different [[Social class|classes]] within society who are under contradiction against each other, a Marxist would conclude that [[capitalism]] exploits and oppresses the proletariat, therefore capitalism will inevitably lead to a [[proletarian revolution]].

[[Marxian economics]] and its proponents view capitalism as economically unsustainable and incapable of improving the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|falling rates of profit]] by cutting employee's wages, social benefits and pursuing military aggression. The [[Socialist mode of production|socialist system]] would succeed capitalism as humanity's mode of production through workers' [[revolution]]. According to Marxian [[crisis theory]], [[socialism]] is not an inevitability, but an economic necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Free will, non-predestination and non-determinism are emphasized in Marx's famous quote "Men make their own history". ''The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte'' (1852).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a socialist society, [[private property]]—in the form of the means of production—would be replaced by co-operative ownership. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but on the criteria of satisfying human needs—that is, [[Production for use|production would be carried out directly for use]]. As [[Friedrich Engels]] said: "Then the capitalist mode of appropriation in which the product enslaves first the producer, and then appropriator, is replaced by the mode of appropriation of the product that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production; upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as means to the maintenance and extension of production on the other, direct individual appropriation, as means of subsistence and of enjoyment".&lt;ref&gt;''Socialism, Utopian and Scientific'' (1882). Chapter three.&lt;/ref&gt;

The materialist theory of history&lt;ref&gt;Evans, p. 53; Marx's account of the theory is the Preface to ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/index.htm]. Another exposition of the theory is in ''The German Ideology''. It, too, is available online from [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology marxists.org].&lt;/ref&gt; analyses the underlying causes of societal development and change from the perspective of the collective ways that humans make their living. All constituent features of a society (social classes, political pyramid, ideologies) are assumed to stem from economic activity, an idea often portrayed with the metaphor of the [[base and superstructure]].

The base and superstructure metaphor describes the totality of social relations by which humans produce and re-produce their social existence. According to Marx: "The sum total of the forces of production accessible to men determines the condition of society" and forms a society's economic base. The base includes the material forces of production, that is the labour and material means of production and relations of production, i.e., the social and political arrangements that regulate production and distribution. From this base rises a superstructure of legal and political "forms of social consciousness" of political and legal institutions that derive from the economic base that conditions the superstructure and a society's dominant ideology. Conflicts between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production provokes social revolutions and thus the resultant changes to the economic base will lead to the transformation of the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm Preface], Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas and Engels: ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' (1877), Introduction [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/introduction.htm General]
&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship is reflexive, as at first the base gives rise to the superstructure and remains the foundation of a form of social organization, hence that formed social organization can act again upon both parts of the base and superstructure so that the relationship is not static but a [[dialectic]], expressed and driven by conflicts and contradictions. As Engels clarified: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes".&lt;ref&gt;''The Communist Manifesto'' (1847). Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx considered class conflicts as the driving force of human history since these recurring conflicts have manifested themselves as distinct transitional stages of development in Western Europe. Accordingly, Marx designated human history as encompassing four stages of development in relations of production:&lt;ref&gt;Marx does not claim to have produced a master-key to history as historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the ''marche generale'', imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself". Letter to editor of the Russian newspaper paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'' (1877). He explains that his ideas are based upon a concrete study of the actual conditions in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Primitive communism]]: as in co-operative tribal societies.
# [[Slave]] society: a development of tribal to city-state; aristocracy is born.
# [[Feudalism]]: aristocrats are the ruling class; merchants evolve into capitalists.
# [[Capitalism]]: capitalists are the ruling class, who create and employ the proletariat.

=== Criticism of capitalism ===
{{further|Opposition to capitalism|Criticism of capitalism}}
According to the Marxist theoretician and [[revolutionary]] [[Vladimir Lenin]], "the principal content of Marxism" was "Marx's economic doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Len67|Lenin 1967 (1913)]]. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx believed that the capitalist bourgeois and their economists were promoting what he saw as the lie that "the interests of the capitalist and of the worker are&amp;nbsp;... one and the same", therefore he believed that they did this by purporting the concept that "the fastest possible growth of productive [[Capital (economics)|capital]]" was best not only for the wealthy capitalists but also for the workers because it provided them with employment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mar49|Marx 1849]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploitation is a matter of [[surplus labour]]—the amount of labour one performs beyond what one receives in goods. Exploitation has been a socioeconomic feature of every class society and is one of the principal features distinguishing the social classes. The power of one social class to control the [[means of production]] enables its exploitation of the other classes.

In capitalism, the [[labor theory of value|labour theory of value]] is the operative concern; the [[Value (economics)|value]] of a [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodity]] equals the socially necessary labour time required to produce it. Under that condition, [[surplus value]] (the difference between the value produced and the value received by a labourer) is synonymous with the term "surplus labour", thus capitalist exploitation is realised as deriving surplus value from the worker.

In pre-capitalist economies, exploitation of the worker was achieved via physical coercion. In the capitalist mode of production, that result is more subtly achieved and because workers do not own the means of production, they must voluntarily enter into an exploitive work relationship with a capitalist in order to earn the necessities of life. The worker's entry into such employment is voluntary in that they choose which capitalist to work for. However, the worker must work or starve, thus exploitation is inevitable and the "voluntary" nature of a worker participating in a capitalist society is illusory.
&lt;!-- Production, not circulation. Marx emphasised that capitalism (''per se'') does not cheat the worker. --&gt;

[[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]] is the estrangement of people from their humanity (&lt;small&gt;German:&lt;/small&gt; ''Gattungswesen'', "species-essence", "species-being"), which is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and so generate alienated labourers.&lt;ref&gt;"Alienation" entry, ''A Dictionary of Sociology''&lt;/ref&gt; In Marx's view, alienation is an objective characterization of the worker's situation in capitalism—his or her self-awareness of this condition is not prerequisite.

=== Social classes ===
{{main|Marxian class theory}}
{{see also|Social class|Class conflict|Classless society|Three-component theory of stratification}}
Marx distinguishes social classes on the basis of two criteria: ownership of [[means of production]] and control over the [[labour power]] of others. Following this criterion of class based on property relations, Marx identified the [[social stratification]] of the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] with the following social groups:
* [[Proletariat]]: "[...] the class of modern wage labourers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their [[labour power]] in order to live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engels|first1=Friedrich|authorlink1=Friedrich Engels|title=Manifesto of the Communist Party|date=1888|location=London|pages=Footnote|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#a1|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions enabling the bourgeoisie to [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploit]] the proletariat because the workers' labour generates a [[surplus value]] greater than the workers' [[wages]].
* [[Bourgeoisie]]: those who "own the means of production" and buy labour power from the proletariat, thus exploiting the proletariat. They subdivide as bourgeoisie and the petite bourgeoisie.
** [[Petite bourgeoisie]] are those who work and can afford to buy little labour power i.e. small business owners, peasant landlords, trade workers and the like. Marxism predicts that the continual reinvention of the means of production eventually would destroy the petite bourgeoisie, degrading them from the middle class to the proletariat.
* [[Lumpenproletariat]]: the outcasts of society such as the criminals, vagabonds, beggars, or prostitutes without any [[Political consciousness|political]] or [[class consciousness]]. Having no interest in international or national economics affairs, Marx claimed that this specific sub-division of the proletariat would play no part in the eventual social revolution.
* [[Landlords]]: a historically important social class who retain some wealth and power.
* [[Peasantry]] and [[farmers]]: a scattered class incapable of organizing and effecting socio-economic change, most of whom would enter the proletariat while some would become landlords.

[[Class consciousness]] denotes the awareness—of itself and the social world—that a social class possesses and its capacity to rationally act in their best interests, hence class consciousness is required before they can effect a successful revolution and thus the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].

Without defining [[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|ideology]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCarney: ''[http://marxmyths.org/joseph-mccarney/article.htm Ideology and False Consciousness]'', April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Marx used the term to describe the production of images of social reality. According to Engels, "ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a [[false consciousness]]. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces".&lt;ref&gt;Engels: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm Letter] to [[Franz Mehring]], (London 14 July 1893), Donna Torr, translator, in ''Marx and Engels Correspondence'', International Publishers, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ruling class controls the society's means of production, the superstructure of society (the ruling social ideas), are determined by the best interests of the ruling class. In ''The German Ideology'', he says "[t]he ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society, is, at the same time, its ruling intellectual force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm|title=Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''The German Ideology''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[political economy]]" initially referred to the study of the material conditions of economic production in the capitalist system. In Marxism, political economy is the study of the means of production, specifically of capital and how that manifests as economic activity.

{{quote box|quote=Marxism taught me what society was. I was like a blindfolded man in a forest, who doesn't even know where north or south is. If you don't eventually come to truly understand the history of the class struggle, or at least have a clear idea that society is divided between the rich and the poor, and that some people subjugate and exploit other people, you're lost in a forest, not knowing anything.|source=— Cuban revolutionary and Marxist–Leninist politician [[Fidel Castro]] on discovering Marxism, 2009&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cas09|Castro and Ramonet 2009]]. p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;|align=right|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7}}
This new way of thinking was invented because socialists believed that common ownership of the "means of production" (that is the industries, the land, the wealth of nature, the trade apparatus, the wealth of the society, etc.) will abolish the exploitative working conditions experienced under capitalism. Through working class revolution, the state (which Marxists see as a weapon for the subjugation of one class by another) is seized and used to suppress the hitherto ruling class of capitalists and by implementing a commonly-owned, democratically controlled workplace create the society of communism, which Marxists see as true democracy. An economy based on co-operation on human need and social betterment, rather than competition for profit of many independently acting profit seekers, would also be the end of class society, which Marx saw as the fundamental division of all hitherto existing history.

Marx saw work, the effort by humans to transform the environment for their needs, as a fundamental feature of human kind. [[Capitalism]], in which the product of the worker's labor is taken from them and sold at market rather than being part of the worker's life, is therefore alienating to the worker. Additionally, the worker is compelled by various means (some nicer than others) to work harder, faster and for longer hours. While this is happening, the employer is constantly trying to save on labor costs: pay the workers less, figure out how to use cheaper equipment, etc. This allows the employer to extract the largest mount of work (and therefore potential wealth) from their workers. The fundamental nature of capitalist society is no different from that of slave society: one small group of society exploiting the larger group.

Through [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]], the [[profit motive]] is eliminated and the motive of furthering human flourishing is introduced.

== Revolution, socialism and communism ==
[[File:Madrid may day375.jpg|thumb|Leftist protester wielding a [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] with a [[raised fist]], both are symbols of revolutionary socialism.]]
According to [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist theory]], the overthrow of capitalism by a [[Revolutionary socialism|socialist revolution]] in contemporary society is inevitable. While the inevitability of an eventual socialist revolution is a controversial debate among many different Marxist schools of thought, all Marxists believe socialism is a necessity, if not inevitable. Marxists believe that a socialist society is far better for the majority of the populace than its capitalist counterpart. Prior to the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]] of 1917, Lenin wrote: "The socialization of production is bound to lead to the conversion of the means of production into the property of society&amp;nbsp;... This conversion will directly result in an immense increase in productivity of labour, a reduction of working hours, and the replacement of the remnants, the ruins of small-scale, primitive, disunited production by collective and improved labour".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Len67|Lenin 1967 (1913)]]. p. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the 1905 revolution and the failure of socialist movements to resist the outbreak of World War One led to renewed theoretical effort and valuable contributions from Lenin and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] towards an appreciation of Marx's [[crisis theory]] and efforts to formulate a theory of imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;Samezo Kuruma (September 1929).

== Classical Marxism ==
{{main|Classical Marxism}}
"Classical Marxism" denotes the collection of socio-eco-political theories expounded by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. "Marxism", as [[Ernest Mandel]] remarked, "is always open, always critical, always self-critical". As such, classical Marxism distinguishes between "Marxism" as broadly perceived and "what Marx believed", thus in 1883 Marx wrote to the French labour leader [[Jules Guesde]] and to Marx's son-in-law [[Paul Lafargue]]—both of whom claimed to represent Marxist principles—accusing them of "revolutionary phrase-mongering" and of denying the value of reformist struggle.

From Marx's letter derives the paraphrase:&lt;blockquote&gt;"If that is Marxism, then I am not a Marxist".&lt;ref&gt;"Accusing Guesde and Lafargue of 'revolutionary phrase-mongering' and of denying the value of reformist struggles, Marx made his famous remark that, if their politics represented Marxism, 'ce qu'il y a de certain c'est que moi, je ne suis pas Marxiste' ('what is certain is that I myself am not a Marxist')". See [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/05/parti-ouvrier.htm "Programme of the French Worker's Party"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall|first=Stuart|author2=Dave Morely|author3=Kuan-Hsing Chen|title=Stuart Hall: Critical Dialogues in Cultural Studies|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-08803-9|page=418|accessdate=4 March 2013|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EPENAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA418|quote=I have no hesitation in saying that this represents a gigantic crudification and simplification of Marx's work – the kind of simplification and reductionism which once led him, in despair, to say "if that is marxism, then I am not a marxist"}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;American Marxist scholar [[Hal Draper]] responded to this comment by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;"There are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike".&lt;ref&gt;Not found in search function at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/index.htm Draper Arkiv].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;On the other hand, the book ''Communism: The Great Misunderstanding'' argues that the source of such misrepresentations lies in ignoring the philosophy of Marxism, which is dialectical materialism. In large, this was due to the fact that ''[[The German Ideology]]'', in which Marx and Engels developed this philosophy, did not find a publisher for almost one hundred years.

[[File:Gordon Childe.jpg|thumb|One of the 20th century's most prominent Marxist academics, the Australian archaeologist [[V. Gordon Childe]]]]
Marxism has been adopted by a large number of academics and other scholars working in various disciplines.

The [[Archaeological theory|theoretical development]] of [[Marxist archaeology]] was first developed in the Soviet Union in 1929, when a young archaeologist named Vladislav I. Ravdonikas (1894–1976) published a report entitled "For a Soviet history of material culture". Within this work, the very discipline of archaeology as it then stood was criticised as being inherently bourgeois, therefore anti-socialist and so, as a part of the academic reforms instituted in the Soviet Union under the administration of Premier [[Joseph Stalin]], a great emphasis was placed on the adoption of Marxist archaeology throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. pp. 326–40.&lt;/ref&gt; These theoretical developments were subsequently adopted by archaeologists working in capitalist states outside of the Leninist bloc, most notably by the Australian academic [[V. Gordon Childe]] (1892–1957), who used Marxist theory in his understandings of the development of human society.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre81|Green 1981]]. p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxist sociology]] is the study of [[sociology]] from a Marxist perspective.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;Allan G. Johnson, ''The Blackwell dictionary of sociology: a user's guide to sociological language'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2000, {{ISBN|0-631-21681-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V1kiW7x6J1MC&amp;pg=PA183 p. 183-84 (Google Books)].&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist sociology is "a form of [[conflict theory]] associated with&amp;nbsp;... Marxism's objective of developing a [[Positivism (sociology)|positive]] ([[empirical]]) science of [[capitalist]] [[society]] as part of the mobilization of a revolutionary [[working class]]".&lt;ref name="encofsoc"&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/marxist-sociology-eos-03/ "Marxist Sociology"], ''Encyclopedia of Sociology'', Macmillan Reference, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Sociological Association]] has a section dedicated to the issues of Marxist sociology that is "interested in examining how insights from Marxist [[methodology]] and Marxist analysis can help explain the complex dynamics of modern society".&lt;ref name="section"&gt;[http://www2.asanet.org/sectionmarxist/about.html About the Section on Marxist Sociology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109001255/http://www2.asanet.org/sectionmarxist/about.html |date=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the thought of [[Karl Marx]], Marxist sociology emerged during the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. As well as Marx, [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] are considered seminal influences in [[History of sociology|early sociology]]. The first Marxist school of sociology was known as [[Austro-Marxism]], of which [[Carl Grünberg]] and [[Antonio Labriola]] were among its most notable members. During the 1940s, the [[Western Marxist]] school became accepted within Western academia, subsequently fracturing into several different perspectives such as the [[Frankfurt School]] or [[critical theory]]. Due to its former state-supported position, there has been a backlash against Marxist thought in [[post-communist]] states (see [[sociology in Poland]]) but it remains dominant in the sociological research sanctioned and supported by those communist states that remain (see [[sociology in China]]).

[[Marxian economics]] refers to a school of economic thought tracing its foundations to the critique of classical [[political economy]] first expounded upon by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0801834806|page=130|quote=Marxian theory (singular) gave way to Marxian theories (plural).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxian economics concerns itself with the analysis of [[Crisis theory|crisis]] in [[capitalism]], the role and distribution of the [[surplus product]] and [[surplus value]] in various types of [[economic system]]s, the nature and origin of [[Value (economics)|economic value]], the impact of class and class struggle on economic and political processes, and the process of [[Evolutionary economics|economic evolution]]. Although the Marxian school is considered [[heterodox economics|heterodox]], ideas that have come out of Marxian economics have contributed to mainstream understanding of the global economy. Certain concepts of Marxian economics, especially those related to [[capital accumulation]] and the [[business cycle]], such as [[creative destruction]], have been fitted for use in capitalist systems.

[[Marxist historiography]] is a school of [[historiography]] influenced by Marxism.  The chief tenets of Marxist historiography are the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes. Marxist historiography has made contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]]. [[Friedrich Engels]]' most important historical contribution was ''Der deutsche Bauernkrieg'' (''The [[German Peasants' War]]''), which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. ''The German Peasants' War'' indicate the Marxist interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and attempts a dialectical analysis. Engels' short treatise ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' (1870s) was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics. Marx's most important works on social and political history include ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[The German Ideology]]'', and those chapters of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' dealing with the historical emergence of [[Capitalism|capitalists]] and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] from [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] English society. Marxist historiography suffered in the [[Soviet Union]], as the government requested overdetermined historical writing. Notable histories include the ''Short Course History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ([[Bolshevik]])'', published in the 1930s to justify the nature of Bolshevik party life under [[Joseph Stalin]]. A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. Thompson's ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' is one of the works commonly associated with this group. [[Eric Hobsbawm]]'s ''Bandits'' is another example of this group's work. [[C. L. R. James]] was also a great pioneer of the 'history from below' approach. Living in Britain when he wrote his most notable work ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'' (1938), he was an [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] Marxist and so outside of the CPGB. In India, B. N. Datta and [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] are considered the founding fathers of  Marxist historiography. Today, the senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R. S. Sharma]], [[Irfan Habib]], [[Romila Thapar]], [[D. N. Jha]] and [[K. N. Panikkar]], most of whom are now over 75 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Bottomore, T. B. 1983. A Dictionary of Marxist thought. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxist literary criticism]] is a loose term describing [[literary criticism]] based on socialist and dialectic theories. Marxist criticism views literary works as reflections of the social institutions from which they originate. According to Marxists, even literature itself is a social institution and has a specific ideological function, based on the background and ideology of the author. Notable marxist literary critics include [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Terry Eagleton]] and [[Fredric Jameson]]. [[Marxist aesthetics]] is a theory of [[aesthetics]] based on, or derived from, the theories of [[Karl Marx]]. It involves a [[dialectical]] and [[materialist]], or [[dialectical materialist]], approach to the application of Marxism to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art, beauty, etc. Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. Some notable Marxist aestheticians include [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Mikhail Lifshitz]], [[William Morris]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Georg Lukács]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Raymond Williams]].

According to a 2007 survey of American professors by [[Neil Gross]] and Solon Simmons, 17.6% of social science professors and 5.0% of humanities professors identify as Marxists, while between 0 and 2% of professors in all other disciplines identify as Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gross |first1=Neil |last2=Simmons |first2=Solon |title=The Social and Political Views of American Professors |date=2007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.147.6141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels ===
{{main|Karl Marx|Friedrich Engels}}
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich Engels]]]]
Karl Marx (5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a [[German philosopher]], political economist and socialist revolutionary who addressed the matters of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the working class, the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] and historical materialism. He is famous for analysing history in terms of class struggle, summarised in the initial line introducing ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848): "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".&lt;ref&gt;''The Communist Manifesto (1847). Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich Engels (28 November 1820 – 5 August 1895) was a German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] who together with Marx co-developed communist theory. Marx and Engels first met in September 1844. Discovering that they had similar views of philosophy and socialism, they collaborated and wrote works such as ''Die heilige Familie'' (''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''). After Marx was deported from France in January 1845, they moved to Belgium, which then permitted greater [[freedom of expression]] than other European countries. In January 1846, they returned to Brussels to establish the Communist Correspondence Committee.

In 1847, they began writing ''The Communist Manifesto'' (1848), based on Engels' ''The Principles of Communism''. Six weeks later, they published the 12,000-word pamphlet in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled them and they moved to [[Cologne]], where they published the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', a politically [[Political radicalism|radical]] newspaper. By 1849, they had to leave Cologne for London. The Prussian authorities pressured the British government to expel Marx and Engels, but Prime Minister [[Lord John Russell]] refused.

After Marx's death in 1883, Engels became the editor and translator of Marx's writings. With his ''[[Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]'' (1884)&amp;nbsp;– analysing [[Monogamy|monogamous]] [[marriage]] as guaranteeing male social domination of women, a concept analogous, in communist theory, to the capitalist class's economic domination of the working class—Engels made [[intellectual]]ly significant contributions to [[feminist theory]] and [[Marxist feminism]].

=== Late 20th century===
[[File:Fidel Castro - UN General Assembly 1960.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fidel Castro]] at the UN General Assembly, 1960]]
In 1959, the [[Cuban Revolution]] led to the victory of [[Fidel Castro]] and his [[July 26 Movement]]. Although the revolution was not explicitly [[socialist]], upon victory Castro ascended to the position of Prime Minister and adopted the [[Leninist]] model of socialist development, forging an alliance with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Col03|Coltman 2003]] and [[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]].&lt;/ref&gt; One of the leaders of the revolution, the Argentine Marxist revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] (1928–1967), subsequently went on to aid revolutionary socialist movements in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo-Kinshasa]] and Bolivia, eventually being killed by the Bolivian government, possibly on the orders of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), though the CIA agent sent to search for Guevara, Felix Rodriguez, expressed a desire to keep him alive as a possible bargaining tool with the Cuban government. He would posthumously go on to become an internationally recognised icon.

In the People's Republic of China, the [[Maoist]] government undertook the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 through to 1976 to ameliorate capitalist elements of Chinese society and achieve socialism. However, upon [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, his rivals seized political power and under the Premiership of [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1978–1992), many of Mao's Cultural Revolution era policies were revised or abandoned and much of the state sector privatised.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of most of those socialist states that had professed a [[Marxist–Leninist]] ideology. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the emergence of the [[New Right]] and [[neoliberal]] capitalism as the dominant ideological trends in western politics—championed by U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and U.K. Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]—led the west to take a more aggressive stand against the Soviet Union and its Leninist allies. Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union the reformist [[Mikhael Gorbachev]] became Premier in March 1985 and sought to abandon Leninist models of development towards [[social democracy]]. Ultimately, Gorbachev's reforms, coupled with rising levels of popular [[ethnic nationalism]] in the Soviet Union, led to the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|state's dissolution]] in late 1991 into a series of constituent nations, all of which abandoned Marxist–Leninist models for socialism, with most converting to capitalist economies.

=== 21st century ===
[[File:Hugo-Chavéz Vota.jpg|thumb|[[Hugo Chavez]] casting a vote in 2007 ]]
[[File:VISITA DE ESTADO - XI JINPING (30930224182).jpg|thumb|right|[[Xi Jinping]] in 2016]]
At the turn of the 21st century, China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam remained the only officially Marxist–Leninist states remaining, although a Maoist government led by [[Prachanda]] was elected into power in Nepal in 2008 following a long guerrilla struggle.

The early 21st century also saw the election of socialist governments in several Latin American nations, in what has come to be known as the "[[pink tide]]". Dominated by the Venezuelan government of [[Hugo Chávez]], this trend also saw the election of [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia, [[Rafael Correa]] in Ecuador and [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua. Forging political and economic alliances through international organisations like the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]], these socialist governments allied themselves with Marxist–Leninist Cuba and although none of them espoused a Leninist path directly, most admitted to being significantly influenced by Marxist theory.

For Italian Marxist Gianni Vattimo in his 2011 book ''[[Hermeneutic Communism]]'', "this new weak communism differs substantially from its previous Soviet (and current Chinese) realization, because the South American countries follow democratic electoral procedures and also manage to decentralize the state bureaucratic system through the [[Bolivarian missions]]. In sum, if weakened communism is felt as a specter in the West, it is not only because of media distortions but also for the alternative it represents through the same democratic procedures that the West constantly professes to cherish but is hesitant to apply".&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala. ''Hermeneutic Communism: From Heidegger to Marx'' Columbia University Press. 2011. p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese President]] [[Xi Jinping]] has announced a deepening commitment of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] to the ideas of Marx. At an event celebrating the 200th anniversary of Marx's birth, Xi said “We must win the advantages, win the initiative, and win the future. We must continuously improve the ability to use Marxism to analyse and solve practical problems...” also adding “powerful ideological weapon for us to understand the world, grasp the law, seek the truth, and change the world,”. Xi has further stressed the importance of examining and continuing the tradition of the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] and embrace its revolutionary past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-marx-china/no-regrets-xi-says-marxism-still-totally-correct-for-china-idUSKBN1I50ET|title=No regrets: Xi says Marxism still 'totally correct' for China|first=Christian|last=Shepherd|publisher=|newspaper=Reuters|date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/17/asia/xi-jinping-marxism-china-intl/index.html|title=At the height of his power, China's Xi Jinping moves to embrace Marxism|first=Steven Jiang|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1270109/chinas-communist-party-and-xi-jinping-are-celebrating-the-200th-birthday-of-karl-marx-with-a-vengeance/|title=China's huge celebrations of Karl Marx are not really about Marxism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{main|Criticisms of Marxism}}
{{see also|Criticisms of socialism|Criticisms of communist party rule}}
Criticisms of Marxism have come from various political ideologies and academic disciplines. These include general criticisms about lack of internal consistency, criticisms related to historical materialism, that it is a type of historical determinism, the necessity of suppression of individual rights, issues with the implementation of communism and economic issues such as the distortion or absence of price signals and reduced incentives. In addition, empirical and epistemological problems are frequently identified.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=popper&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl|title =Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-28594-0|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Maynard Keynes. Essays in Persuasion. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. 1991. p. 300 {{ISBN|978-0-393-00190-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Marxists have criticised the academic [[institution]]alisation of Marxism for being too shallow and detached from political action. For instance, Zimbabwean [[Trotskyist]] [[Alex Callinicos]], himself a professional academic, stated: "Its practitioners remind one of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], who in the Greek legend fell in love with his own reflection&amp;nbsp;... Sometimes it is necessary to devote time to clarifying and developing the concepts that we use, but indeed for Western Marxists this has become an end in itself. The result is a body of writings incomprehensible to all but a tiny minority of highly qualified scholars".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cal10|Callinicos 2010]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there are intellectual critiques of Marxism that contest certain assumptions prevalent in Marx's thought and Marxism after him, without exactly rejecting Marxist politics.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|date=1973|title=The Mirror of Production}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contemporary supporters of Marxism argue that many aspects of Marxist thought are viable, but that the corpus is incomplete or outdated in regards to certain aspects of economic, political or [[social theory]]. They may therefore combine some Marxist concepts with the ideas of other theorists such as [[Max Weber]]—the [[Frankfurt School]] is one example.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David (1980), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=Fredric|editor1-last=Nealon|editor1-first=Jeffrey|editor2-last=Irr|editor2-first=Caren|title=Rethinking the Frankfurt School: Alternative Legacies of Cultural Critique|date=2002|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany|pages=11–30|chapter=The Theoretical Hesitation: Benjamin's Sociological Predecessor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General criticisms ===
Philosopher and historian of ideas [[Leszek Kołakowski]] pointed out that "Marx's theory is incomplete or ambiguous in many places, and could be 'applied' in many contradictory ways without manifestly infringing its principles". Specifically, he considers "the laws of dialectics" as fundamentally erroneous, stating that some are "truisms with no specific Marxist content", others "philosophical dogmas that cannot be proved by scientific means" and some just "nonsense". He believes that some Marxist laws can be interpreted differently, but that these interpretations still in general fall into one of the two categories of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Main Currents of Marxism|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W. W. Norton and Company|year=2005|isbn=9780393329438|location=New York|pages=662, 909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Okishio's theorem]] shows that if capitalists use cost-cutting techniques and real wages do not increase, the rate of profit must rise, which casts doubt on Marx's view that the rate of profit would tend to fall.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990, chapter 7, sects. II–IV. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegations of inconsistency have been a large part of Marxian economics and the debates around it since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Kliman argues that this undermines Marx's critiques and the correction of the alleged inconsistencies, because internally inconsistent theories cannot be right by definition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kliman states that "Marx’s value theory would be ''necessarily wrong'' if it were internally inconsistent. Internally inconsistent theories may be appealing, intuitively plausible and even obvious, and consistent with all available empirical evidence––but they cannot be right. It is necessary to reject them or correct them. Thus the alleged proofs of inconsistency trump all other considerations, disqualifying Marx’s theory at the starting gate. By doing so, they provide the principal justification for the suppression of this theory as well as the suppression of, and the denial of resources needed to carry out, present-day research based upon it. This greatly inhibits its further development. So does the very charge of inconsistency. What person of intellectual integrity would want to join a research program founded on (what he believes to be) a theory that is internally inconsistent and therefore false?" (Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's "Capital": A Refutation of the Myth of Inconsistency,'' Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2007, p. 3, emphasis in original). However, in his book, Kliman presents an interpretation where these inconsistencies can be eliminated. The connection between the inconsistency allegations and the lack of study of Marx’s theories was argued further by [[John Cassidy (journalist)|John Cassidy]] ("The Return of Karl Marx," ''The New Yorker'', Oct. 20 &amp; 27, 1997, p. 252): "His mathematical model of the economy, which depended on the idea that labor is the source of all value, was riven with internal inconsistencies and is rarely studied these days."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistemological and empirical critiques ===
Marx's predictions have been criticized because they have allegedly failed, with some pointing towards the GDP per capita increasing generally in capitalist economies compared to less market oriented economics, the capitalist economies not suffering worsening economic crises leading to the overthrow of the capitalist system and communist revolutions not occurring in the most advanced capitalist nations, but instead in undeveloped regions.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's "Capital"'', Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, p. 208, emphases in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG|title=GDP per capita growth (annual %)|date=2016|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', [[philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]], criticized the [[explanatory power]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of historical materialism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org|title=Science as Falsification|last=Popper|first=Sir Karl|date=1963|website=stephenjaygould.org.|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper believed that Marxism had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a genuinely predictive theory. When these predictions were not in fact borne out, Popper argues that the theory avoided [[Falsifiability|falsification]] by the addition of ad hoc hypotheses that made it compatible with the facts. Because of this, Popper asserted, a theory that was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into [[pseudoscientific]] dogma.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge|last=Popper|first=Sir Karl|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-28594-0|pages=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialist critiques ===
[[Democratic socialist]]s and social democrats reject the idea that socialism can be accomplished only through extra-legal class conflict and a proletarian revolution. The relationship between Marx and other socialist thinkers and organizations—rooted in Marxism's "scientific" and anti-utopian socialism, among other factors—has divided Marxists from other socialists since Marx's life.

After Marx's death and with the emergence of Marxism, there have also been dissensions within Marxism itself—a notable example is the splitting of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] into [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]]. [[Orthodox Marxist]]s became opposed to a less dogmatic, more innovative, or even [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] Marxism.

=== Anarchist and libertarian critiques ===
{{main|Libertarian socialism|Libertarian Marxism}}
[[Anarchism]] has had a strained relationship with Marxism since Marx's life. Anarchists and many non-Marxist libertarian socialists reject the need for a [[Dictatorship of the proletariat|transitory state phase]], claiming that socialism can only be established through decentralized, non-coercive organization. Anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] criticized Marx for his authoritarian bent.&lt;ref name=Bakunin1872&gt;{{citation|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|title=Letter to ''La Liberté'', quoted in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971|date=5 October 1872|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/la-liberte.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrases "barracks socialism" or "[[barracks communism]]" became a shorthand for this critique, evoking the image of citizens' lives being as regimented as the lives of [[conscript]]s in a [[barracks]].&lt;ref name="Sperber_2013"&gt;{{citation|last=Sperber|first=Jonathan|year=2013|title=Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBpSh9JYAKcC|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co|postscript=.|isbn=9780871403544}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] is critical of Marxism's dogmatic strains and the idea of Marxism itself, but still appreciates Marx's contributions to political thought. Unlike some anarchists, Chomsky does not consider Bolshevism "Marxism in practice", but he does recognize that Marx was a complicated figure who had conflicting ideas, while he also acknowledges the latent authoritarianism in Marx he also points to the libertarian strains that developed into the [[council communism]] of [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Anton Pannekoek]]. However, his commitment to libertarian socialism has led him to characterize himself as an anarchist with radical Marxist leanings (see [[political positions of Noam Chomsky]]).

Libertarian Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the [[anti-authoritarian]] aspects of Marxism. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as [[left communism]], emerged in opposition to [[Marxism–Leninism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]], Otto Ruhl ''Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils''. Red and Black, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and its derivatives such as [[Stalinism]], [[Ceaușism]] and [[Maoism]]. Libertarian Marxism is also often critical of [[reformist]] positions, such as those held by [[social democrats]]. Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' and ''[[The Civil War in France]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Screpanti, Libertarian communism: Marx Engels and the Political Economy of Freedom, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the [[working class]] to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or [[State (polity)|state]] to mediate or aid its liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Draper, Hal.

Vol 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with anarchism, libertarian Marxism is one of the main currents of [[libertarian socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam.

=== Economic critiques ===
Other critiques come from an economic standpoint. [[Vladimir Karpovich Dmitriev]] writing in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;V. K. Dmitriev, 1974 (1898), ''Economic Essays on Value, Competition and Utility''. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ladislaus Bortkiewicz|Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz]] writing in 1906–1907&lt;ref&gt;Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1952 (1906–1907), "Value and Price in the Marxian System", ''International Economic Papers'' 2, 5–60; Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1984 (1907), "On the Correction of Marx's Fundamental Theoretical Construction in the Third Volume of ''Capital''". In Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk 1984 (1896), ''Karl Marx and the Close of his System'', Philadelphia: Orion Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent critics have alleged that Marx's [[value theory]] and law of the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] are internally inconsistent. In other words, the critics allege that Marx drew conclusions that actually do not follow from his theoretical premises. Once these alleged errors are corrected, his conclusion that aggregate price and profit are determined by and equal to aggregate value and surplus value no longer holds true. This result calls into question his theory that the exploitation of workers is the sole source of profit.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990, chapter 12, sect. III. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Marxism and socialism have received considerable critical analysis from multiple generations of [[Austrian School|Austrian economists]] in terms of scientific methodology, economic theory and political implications.&lt;ref&gt;Sennholz, Hans F. [https://mises.org/daily/3910/What-We-Can-Know-About-the-World "What We Can Know About The World"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Mises, Ludwig. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Omnipotent_Government.html?id=QoOMaqfdpT4C "Omnipotent Government"].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]], subjective value theory was rediscovered by [[Carl Menger]], a development that fundamentally undermined the British cost theories of value. The restoration of subjectivism and [[praxeological]] methodology previously used by classical economists including [[Richard Cantillon]], [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] and [[Frédéric Bastiat]] led Menger to criticise [[historicist]] methodology in general. Second-generation Austrian economist [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]] used praxeological and subjectivist methodology to attack the law of value fundamentally. Non-Marxist economists have regarded his criticism as definitive, with [[Gottfried Haberler]] arguing that Böhm-Bawerk's critique of Marx's economics was so thorough and devastating that as of the 1960s no Marxian scholar had conclusively refuted it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gottfried Haberler]] in [[Milorad M. Drachkovitch]] (ed.), ''Marxist Ideology in the Contemporary World – Its Appeals and Paradoxes'' (New York: Praeger, 1966), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Third-generation Austrian [[Ludwig von Mises]] rekindled debate about the [[economic calculation problem]] by identifying that without price signals in capital goods, all other aspects of the market economy are irrational. This led him to declare that "rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist [[commonwealth]]".&lt;ref name="Mises"&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth|accessdate=9 August 2008|last=Von Mises|first=Ludwig|authorlink=Ludwig von Mises|date=1990|format=PDF|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|url=https://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]] argue that Marx's economic theory was fundamentally flawed because it attempted to simplify the economy into a few general laws that ignored the impact of institutions on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acemoglu |first1=Daron |last2=Robinson |first2=James A. |title=The Rise and Decline of General Laws of Capitalism |journal=NBER Working Paper Series |date=December 2014 |url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w20766.pdf |accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Memetics''' (also referred to colloquially as '''memeology''') is the study of information and culture based on an analogy with [[Darwinian evolution]]. Proponents describe memetics as an approach to [[evolutionary model]]s of cultural [[information transfer]]. Critics regard memetics as a [[pseudoscience]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} Memetics describes how an idea can propagate successfully, but doesn't necessarily imply a concept is factual.&lt;ref name="Science, Imitation and Memetics"&gt;Kantorovich, Aharon (2013) [http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9912/ An Evolutionary View of Science: Imitation and Memetics.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[meme]] was coined in [[Richard Dawkins]]' 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]],'' but Dawkins later distanced himself from the resulting field of study.&lt;ref name="misunderstanding"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burman | first1 = J. T. | year = 2012 | title = The misunderstanding of memes: Biography of an unscientific object, 1976–1999 | url = | journal = [[Perspectives on Science]] | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 75–104 | doi = 10.1162/POSC_a_00057 }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogous to a [[gene]], the meme was conceived as a "unit of culture" (an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour, etc.) which is "hosted" in the minds of one or more individuals, and which can reproduce itself in the sense of jumping from the mind of one person to the mind of another. Thus what would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt a belief is seen as an idea-replicator reproducing itself in a new host. As with genetics, particularly under a [[Gene-centered view of evolution|Dawkinsian]] interpretation, a meme's success may be due to its contribution to the effectiveness of its host.

The [[Usenet newsgroup]] alt.memetics started in 1993 with peak posting years in the mid to late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://groups.google.com/group/alt.memetics/about?hl=en&amp;pli=1 |title=Google groups, About alt.memetics |first= |last= |work=groups.google.com |date=2012 |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal of Memetics'' was published electronically from 1997 to 2005.&lt;ref name="MemeticsIssues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/issues.html|title=Index to all JoM-EMIT Issues|accessdate=2009-10-27|work=Journal of Memetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976), the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] used the term ''[[meme]]'' to describe a unit of human [[Cultural learning|cultural transmission]] analogous to the [[gene]], arguing that replication also happens in [[culture]], albeit in a different sense. Bella Hiscock outlined a similar hypothesis in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cloak | first1 = F.T. | year = 1975 | title = Is a cultural ethology possible? | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/x724552557812338 | journal = Human Ecology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 161–182 | doi=10.1007/bf01531639}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Dawkins referenced. [[Cultural evolution]] itself is a much older topic, with a history that dates back at least as far as [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s era.

Dawkins (1976) proposed that the meme is a unit of information residing in the brain and is the mutating [[self-replication|replicator]] in human [[Sociocultural evolution|cultural evolution]]. It is a pattern that can influence its surroundings – that is, it has causal agency – and can propagate. This proposal resulted in debate among sociologists, biologists, and scientists of other disciplines. Dawkins himself did not provide a sufficient explanation of how the replication of units of information in the brain controls human behaviour and ultimately culture, and the principal topic of the book was genetics. Dawkins apparently did not intend to present a comprehensive theory of ''memetics'' in ''The Selfish Gene'', but rather coined the term ''meme'' in a speculative spirit. Accordingly, different researchers came to define the term "unit of information" in different ways.

The modern memetics movement dates from the mid-1980s. A January 1983 "[[Metamagical Themas]]" column&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=o8jzWF7rD6oC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=On+viral+sentences+and+self-replicating+structures|title= Metamagical themas: questing for the ... - Google Books|publisher= Books.google.com|date= 1996-04-04| accessdate= 2010-02-18|isbn = 978-0-465-04566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Douglas Hofstadter]], in ''Scientific American'', was influential – as was his 1985 book of the same name. "Memeticist" was coined as analogous to "geneticist" – originally in ''The Selfish Gene.'' Later Arel Lucas suggested that the discipline that studies memes and their connections to human and other carriers of them be known as "memetics" by analogy with "genetics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=o8jzWF7rD6oC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=%22arel+lucas%22+memetics+themas|title= Metamagical themas: questing for the ... - Google Books|publisher = Books.google.com|date=1996-04-04|accessdate= 2010-02-18|isbn= 978-0-465-04566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins' ''The Selfish Gene'' has been a factor in attracting the attention of people of disparate intellectual backgrounds. Another stimulus was the publication in 1991 of ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' by Tufts University philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], which incorporated the meme concept into a [[theory of mind|theory of the mind]]. In his 1991 essay "[[Viruses of the Mind]]", Richard Dawkins used memetics to explain the phenomenon of religious belief and the various characteristics of organised religions. By then, memetics had also become a theme appearing in fiction (e.g. Neal Stephenson's ''[[Snow Crash]]'').

The idea of ''language as a virus'' had already been introduced by [[William S. Burroughs]] as early as 1962 in his book ''[[The Ticket That Exploded]]'', and later in ''[[The Electronic Revolution]]'', published in 1970 in ''[[The Job: Interviews with William S. Burroughs|The Job]]''. [[Douglas Rushkoff]] explored the same concept in [http://www.rushkoff.com/media-virus/ ''Media Virus: Hidden Agendas in Popular Culture''] in 1995.

However, the foundation of memetics in its full modern incarnation originated in the publication in 1996 of two books by authors outside the academic mainstream: ''Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme'' by former [[Microsoft]] executive turned motivational speaker and professional poker-player, [[Richard Brodie (programmer)|Richard Brodie]], and ''Thought Contagion: How Belief Spreads Through Society'' by [[Aaron Lynch (writer)|Aaron Lynch]], a mathematician and philosopher who worked for many years as an engineer at [[Fermilab]]. Lynch claimed to have conceived his theory totally independently of any contact with academics in the cultural evolutionary sphere, and apparently was not even aware of Dawkins' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' until his book was very close to publication.

Around the same time as the publication of the books by Lynch and Brodie the e-journal [http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/ Journal of Memetics – ''Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission''] appeared on the web. It was first hosted by the Centre for Policy Modelling at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] but later taken over by [[Francis Heylighen]] of the [[CLEA]] research institute at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]. The e-journal soon became the central point for publication and debate within the nascent memeticist community. (There had been a short-lived paper-based memetics publication starting in 1990, the ''Journal of Ideas'' edited by Elan Moritz.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1991"&gt;[http://archsix.com/omega23.com/Journal_of_Ideas/ The Journal of Ideas, {{ISSN|1049-6335}}, Contents Online]&lt;/ref&gt;) In 1999, [[Susan Blackmore]], a psychologist at the [[University of the West of England]], published ''[[The Meme Machine]]'', which more fully worked out the ideas of Dennett, Lynch, and Brodie and attempted to compare and contrast them with various approaches from the cultural evolutionary mainstream, as well as providing novel, and controversial, memetics-based theories for the evolution of language and the human sense of individual selfhood.

=== The term "meme" ===
The term "meme" derives from the [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] μιμητής (''mimētḗs''), meaning "imitator, pretender". The similar term "mneme" was used in 1904, by the German evolutionary biologist [[Richard Semon]], best known for his development of the [[engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] theory of [[memory]], in his work ''Die mnemischen Empfindungen in ihren Beziehungen zu den Originalempfindungen'', translated into English in 1921 as ''The Mneme'' {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Until [[Daniel Schacter]] published ''Forgotten Ideas, Neglected Pioneers: Richard Semon and the Story of Memory'' in 2000, Semon's work had little influence, though it was quoted extensively in [[Erwin Schrödinger]]’s prescient 1956 [[Tarner Lecture]] “[[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|Mind and Matter]]”. Richard Dawkins (1976) apparently coined the word "meme" independently of Semon, writing this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"'Mimeme' comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like 'gene'. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme. If it is any consolation, it could alternatively be thought of as being related to 'memory', or to the French word même." {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Maturity===
In 2005, the ''Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission'' ceased publication and published a set of articles on the future of memetics. The website states that although "there was to be a relaunch...after several years nothing has happened".&lt;ref name="JoMFrontpage"&gt;{{cite web|title= Journal of Memetics - Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission|url= http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/|work= Journal of Memetics|accessdate= 17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Blackmore]] has left the University of the West of England to become a freelance science-writer and now concentrates more on the field of consciousness and cognitive science. Derek Gatherer moved to work as a computer programmer in the pharmaceutical industry, although he still occasionally publishes on memetics-related matters. [[Richard Brodie (programmer)|Richard Brodie]] is now climbing the world professional poker rankings. [[Aaron Lynch (writer)|Aaron Lynch]] disowned the memetics community and the words "meme" and "memetics" (without disowning the ideas in his book), adopting the self-description "thought contagionist". He died in 2005.

[[Susan Blackmore]] (2002) re-stated the definition of meme as: whatever is copied from one person to another person, whether habits, skills, songs, stories, or any other kind of information. Further she said that memes, like genes, are replicators in the sense as defined by Dawkins.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins, R.]] (1982) [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/dawkins_replicators.html "Replicators and Vehicles"] King's College Sociobiology Group, eds., ''Current Problems in Sociobiology'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;45–64. "A replicator may be defined as any entity in the universe of which copies are made."
&lt;/ref&gt;
That is, they are information that is copied. Memes are copied by [[imitation]], teaching and other methods. The copies are not perfect: memes are copied with variation; moreover, they compete for space in our memories and for the chance to be copied again. Only some of the variants can survive. The combination of these three elements (copies; variation; competition for survival) forms precisely the condition for [[Darwinian evolution]], and so memes (and hence human cultures) evolve. Large groups of memes that are copied and passed on together are called [[co-adapted]] meme complexes, or ''[[memeplexes]]''. In Blackmore's definition, the way that a meme replicates is through imitation. This requires [[Human brain|brain]] capacity to generally imitate a model or selectively imitate the model. Since the process of social learning varies from one person to another, the imitation process cannot be said to be completely imitated. The sameness of an idea may be expressed with different memes supporting it. This is to say that the [[mutation]] rate in memetic evolution is extremely high, and mutations are even possible within each and every iteration of the imitation process. It becomes very interesting when we see that a social system composed of a complex network of microinteractions exists, but at the macro level an order emerges to create culture.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Internalists and externalists==
The memetics movement split almost immediately into two. The first group were those who wanted to stick to Dawkins' definition of a meme as "a unit of [[cultural transmission]]". Gibron Burchett, another memeticist responsible for helping to research and co-coin the term [[memetic engineering]], along with Leveious Rolando and Larry Lottman, has stated that a meme can be defined, more precisely, as "a unit of [[cultural]] [[information]] that can be copied, located in the brain". This thinking is more in line with Dawkins' second definition of the meme in his book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]''. The second group wants to redefine memes as observable [[cultural artifact]]s and behaviors. However, in contrast to those two positions, Blackmore does not reject either concept of external or internal memes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackmore|first=Susan|authorlink=Susan Blackmore |date=2003|title=Consciousness in meme machines|journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies|publisher=Imprint Academic|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two schools became known as the "internalists" and the "externalists." Prominent internalists included both Lynch and Brodie; the most vocal externalists included Derek Gatherer, a geneticist from [[Liverpool John Moores University]], and William Benzon, a writer on cultural evolution and music. The main rationale for externalism was that internal brain entities are not observable, and memetics cannot advance as a science, especially a [[quantitative research|quantitative]] science, unless it moves its emphasis onto the directly quantifiable aspects of culture. Internalists countered with various arguments: that brain states will eventually be directly observable with advanced technology, that most cultural anthropologists agree that culture is about [[belief]]s and not artifacts, or that artifacts cannot be replicators in the same sense as mental entities (or DNA) are replicators. The debate became so heated that a 1998 Symposium on Memetics, organised as part of the 15th International Conference on [[Cybernetics]], passed a motion calling for an end to definitional debates. McNamara demonstrated in 2011 that functional connectivity profiling using neuroimaging tools enables the observation of the processing of internal memes, "i-memes", in response to external "e-memes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=Adam|title=Can we Measure Memes?|journal=Frontiers in Evolutionary Neuroscience|date=2011|doi=10.3389/fnevo.2011.00001|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnevo.2011.00001/full|pmc=3118481|pmid=21720531|volume=3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An advanced statement of the internalist school came in 2002 with the publication of ''The Electric Meme'', by Robert Aunger, an anthropologist from the [[University of Cambridge]]. Aunger also organised a conference in Cambridge in 1999, at which prominent sociologists and anthropologists were able to give their assessment of the progress made in memetics to that date. This resulted in the publication of ''Darwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Science'', edited by Aunger and with a foreword by Dennett, in 2001&lt;ref&gt;Aunger, Robert. "Darwinizing culture: The status of memetics as a science." (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticism==
{{POV check|section|date=July 2018}}

This evolutionary model of cultural information transfer is based on the concept that units of information, or "memes", have an independent existence, are self-replicating, and are subject to selective evolution through environmental forces.&lt;ref name=Polichak/&gt; Starting from a proposition put forward in the writings of [[Richard Dawkins]], this model has formed the basis of a new area of study, one that looks at the self-replicating units of culture. It has been proposed that just as memes are analogous to genes, memetics is analogous to genetics.

Critics contend that some proponents' assertions are "untested, unsupported or incorrect."&lt;ref name="Polichak"&gt;James W. Polichak, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&amp;pg=PA664 "Memes as Pseudoscience"], in Michael Shermer, ''Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. P. 664f.&lt;/ref&gt; Luis Benitez-Bribiesca, a critic of memetics, calls it "a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[dogma]]" and "a dangerous idea that poses a threat to the serious study of [[consciousness]] and cultural evolution" among other things. As factual criticism, he refers to the lack of a ''code script'' for memes, as the DNA is for genes, and to the fact that the meme mutation mechanism (i.e., an idea going from one brain to another) is too unstable (low replication accuracy and high mutation rate), which would render the evolutionary process chaotic.&lt;ref&gt;Benitez-Bribiesca, Luis (2001): ''[http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/339/33905206.pdf Memetics: A dangerous idea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704104711/http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/339/33905206.pdf |date=2009-07-04 }}''. Interciecia 26: 29–31, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, has been demonstrated (e.g. by Daniel C. Dennett, in ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'') to not be the case, in fact, due to the existence of self-regulating correction mechanisms (vaguely resembling those of gene transcription) enabled by the redundancy and other properties of most meme expression languages, which do stabilize information transfer. (E.g. spiritual narratives—including music and dance forms—can survive in full detail across any number of generations even in cultures with oral tradition only.) Memes for which stable copying methods are available will inevitably get selected for survival more often than those which can only have unstable mutations, therefore going extinct. (Notably, Benitez-Bribiesca's claim of "no code script" is also irrelevant, considering the fact that there is nothing preventing the information contents of memes from being coded, encoded, expressed, preserved or copied in all sorts of different ways throughout their life-cycles.)

Another criticism comes from [[semiotics]], (e.g., Deacon,&lt;ref&gt;[[Terrence Deacon]], The trouble with memes (and what to do about it). ''The Semiotic Review of Books'' 10(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Kull&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kull | first1 = Kalevi | authorlink = Kalevi Kull | year = 2000 | title = Copy versus translate, meme versus sign: development of biological textuality | url = | journal = European Journal for Semiotic Studies | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 101–120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) stating that the concept of meme is a primitivized concept of [[Sign (semiotics)|Sign]]. Meme is thus described in memetics as a sign without its triadic nature. In other words, meme is a degenerate sign, which includes only its ability of being copied. Accordingly, in the broadest sense, the objects of copying are memes, whereas the objects of translation and interpretation are signs.
&lt;!-- This last paragraph could be better explained. I'm fimiliar with the subject but was confused. "Tdiadic nature" "degenerate sign" the article would benefit from clarification of these terms. This may not be the proper place to put this but I don't know if there is a discussion page for this article. --&gt;

[[Mary Midgley]] criticises memetics for at least two reasons:&lt;ref&gt;Midgley, Mary. The Solitary Self: Darwin and the Selfish Gene. Acumen, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-84465-253-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; "One, culture is not best understood by examining its smallest parts, as culture is pattern-like, comparable to an ocean current. Many more factors, historical and others, should be taken into account than only whatever particle culture is built from. Two, if memes are not thoughts (and thus not cognitive phenomena), as Daniel C. Dennett insists in "[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]", then their [[Ontology|ontological]] status is open to question, and memeticists (who are also [[reductionism|reductionists]]) may be challenged whether memes even exist. Questions can extend to whether the idea of "meme" is itself a meme, or is a true concept. Fundamentally, memetics is an attempt to produce knowledge through organic metaphors, which as such is a questionable research approach, as the application of metaphors has the effect of hiding that which does not fit within the realm of the metaphor. Rather than study actual reality, without preconceptions, memetics, as so many of the socio-biological explanations of society, believe that saying that the apple is like an orange is a valid analysis of the apple."&lt;ref&gt;Stepan, Nancy L. Race and Gender: The Role of Analogy in Science. In Goldberg, David Theo (ed.) The Anatomy of Racism. University of Minnesota Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Jenkins]], Joshua Green, and Sam Ford, in their book ''Spreadable Media'' (2013), criticize Dawkins' idea of the meme, writing that "while the idea of the meme is a compelling one, it may not adequately account for how content circulates through participatory culture." The three authors also criticize other interpretations of memetics, especially those which describe memes as "self-replicating", because they ignore the fact that "culture is a human product and replicates through human agency."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = New York University Press| isbn = 978-0-8147-4350-8 | last1 = Jenkins| first1 = Henry| last2 = Ford| first2 = Sam| last3 = Green| first3 = Joshua| title = Spreadable Media| location = New York ; London| series = Postmillennial pop| date = 2013|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other critics, Maria Kronfeldner has criticized memetics for being based on an allegedly inaccurate analogy with the gene; alternately, she claims it is "heuristically trivial", being a mere redescription of what is already known without offering any useful novelty.&lt;ref&gt;Kronfeldner, Maria. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Darwinian_Creativity_and_Memetics.html?id=VxZOYgEACAAJ] Darwinian Creativity and Memetics. Acumen, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New developments==
{{synthesis|date=June 2015}}
Dawkins  in ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' responded that there are actually two different types of memetic processes (controversial and informative). The first is a type of cultural idea, action, or expression, which does have high variance; for instance, a student of his who had inherited some of the mannerisms of [[Wittgenstein]]. However, he also describes a self-correcting meme, highly resistant to mutation. As an example of this, he gives [[origami]] patterns in elementary schools – except in rare cases, the meme is either passed on in the exact sequence of instructions, or (in the case of a forgetful child) terminates. This type of meme tends not to evolve, and to experience profound mutations in the rare event that it does.

Another definition, given by [[Hokky Situngkir]], tried to offer a more rigorous formalism for the meme, ''memeplexes'', and the ''[[deme (biology)|deme]]'', seeing the meme as a cultural unit in a cultural [[complex system]]. It is based on the Darwinian [[genetic algorithm]] with some modifications to account for the different patterns of evolution seen in genes and memes. In the method of memetics as the way to see culture as a [[complex adaptive system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cogprints.org/4772/|title=On Selfish Memes: culture as complex adaptive system|author=Situngkir, Hokky|date=16 Mar 2006|accessdate= 2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; he describes a way to see memetics as an alternative methodology of cultural [[evolution]]. However, there are as many possible definitions that are credited to the word "meme". For example, in the sense of [[computer simulation]] the term ''[[memetic algorithm]]'' is used to define a particular computational viewpoint.

The possibility of quantitative analysis of memes using [[functional neuroimaging|neuroimaging]] tools and the suggestion that such studies have already been done was given by McNamara (2011).&lt;ref name="mcnamara"&gt;{{harvnb|McNamara|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This author proposes hyperscanning (concurrent scanning of two communicating individuals in two separate MRI machines) as a key tool in the future for investigating memetics.

Velikovsky (2013) proposed the "holon" as the structure of the meme,&lt;ref name="StoryAlity"&gt;{{cite web|title=Holonic Structure of the Meme - The Unit of Culture|url=http://storyality.wordpress.com/2013/12/12/storyality-100-the-holonic-structure-of-the-meme-the-unit-of-culture/|work=StoryAlity academic weblog, JT Velikovsky|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; synthesizing the major theories on memes of [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]], [[E. O. Wilson]], [[Frederick Turner (poet)]] and [[Arthur Koestler]].{{clarify|date=June 2015}}

Proponents of memetics as described in the Journal of Memetics (out of print since 2005&lt;ref name=JOM&gt;{{cite web|title=Journal of Memetics|url=http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ) – ''Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission'' believe that 'memetics' has the potential to be an important and promising analysis of culture using the framework of evolutionary concepts. 
[[Keith Henson]] in ''Memetics and the Modular-Mind'' (Analog Aug. 1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Keith Henson  View profile More options|url = http://groups.google.ca/group/alt.mindcontrol/msg/103e03bce6100cac?hl=en&amp;|title=Promise Keepers: Is it a Cult? - alt.mindcontrol &amp;#124; Google Groups|publisher=Groups.google.ca|date=1997-10-05|accessdate=2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; makes the case that memetics needs to incorporate [[evolutionary psychology]] to understand the psychological traits of a meme's host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://human-nature.com/nibbs/02/cults.html|title=Sex, Drugs, and Cults by H.

DiCarlo ({{year needed|date=June 2015}}) has developed the idea of 'memetic equilibrium' to describe a cultural compatible state with [[Homeostasis|biological equilibrium]]. In "Problem Solving and Neurotransmission in the Upper Paleolithic" (in press{{clarify|date=June 2015}}), diCarlo argues that as human consciousness evolved and developed, so too did our ancestors' capacity to consider and attempt to solve environmental problems in more conceptually sophisticated ways. Understood in this way, problem solving amongst a particular group, when considered satisfactory, often produces a feeling of environmental control, stability, in short—memetic equilibrium. 
But the pay-off is not merely practical, providing purely functional utility—it is biochemical and it comes in the form of neurotransmitters. The relationship between a gradually emerging conscious awareness and sophisticated languages in which to formulate representations combined with the desire to maintain biological equilibrium, generated the necessity for equilibrium to fill in conceptual gaps in terms of understanding three very important aspects in the Upper Paleolithic: causality, morality, and mortality. The desire to explain phenomena in relation to maintaining survival and reproductive stasis, generated a normative stance in the minds of our ancestors—Survival/Reproductive Value (or S-R Value).

Houben (2014) has argued on several occasions that the  exceptional resilience of [[Shrauta|Vedic ritual]] and its interaction with a changing ecological and economic environment over several millennia can be profitably dealt with in a ‘cultural evolution’ perspective in which the Vedic mantra is the ‘meme’ or unit of cultural replication.&lt;ref&gt;Jan E.M.

==Applications==
Research methodologies that apply memetics go by many names: Viral marketing, cultural evolution, the history of ideas, social analytics, and more.  Many of these applications do not make reference to the literature on memes directly but are built upon the evolutionary lens of idea propagation that treats semantic units of culture as self-replicating and mutating patterns of information that are assumed to be relevant for scientific study.  For example, the field of public relations is filled with attempts to introduce new ideas and alter social discourse.  One means of doing this is to design a meme and deploy it through various media channels.  One historic example of applied memetics is the PR campaign conducted in 1991 as part of the build-up to the first Gulf War in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prwatch.org/books/tsigfy10.html PR Watch]&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of memetics to a difficult complex social system problem, environmental [[sustainability]], has recently been attempted at thwink.org&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thwink.org/sustain/general/Memetics.htm thwink.org].&lt;/ref&gt; Using meme types and memetic infection in several stock and flow simulation models, Jack Harich has demonstrated several interesting phenomena that are best, and perhaps only, explained by memes. One model, The Dueling Loops of the Political Powerplace,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thwink.org/sustain/articles/005/DuelingLoops_Paper.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the fundamental reason corruption is the norm in politics is due to an inherent structural advantage of one feedback loop pitted against another. Another model, The Memetic Evolution of Solutions to Difficult Problems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thwink.org/sustain/articles/007/MemeticEvolutionOfSolutions.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; uses memes, the [[evolutionary algorithm]], and the [[scientific method]] to show how complex solutions evolve over time and how that process can be improved. The insights gained from these models are being used to engineer memetic solution elements to the sustainability problem.

Another application of memetics in the sustainability space is the crowdfunded Climate Meme Project&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121208023214/http://www.climatememe.org/]&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by Joe Brewer and Balazs Laszlo Karafiath in the spring of 2013. This study was based on a collection of 1000 unique text-based expressions gathered from Twitter, Facebook, and structured interviews with climate activists. The major finding was that the global warming meme is not effective at spreading because it causes emotional duress in the minds of people who learn about it.  Five central tensions were revealed in the discourse about [climate change], each of which represents a resonance point through which dialogue can be engaged.  The tensions were Harmony/Disharmony (whether or not humans are part of the natural world), Survival/Extinction (envisioning the future as either apocalyptic collapse of civilization or total extinction of the human race), Cooperation/Conflict (regarding whether or not humanity can come together to solve global problems), Momentum/Hesitation (about whether or not we are making progress at the collective scale to address climate change), and Elitism/Heretic (a general sentiment that each side of the debate considers the experts of its opposition to be untrustworthy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcoexist.com/1681526/using-memes-to-improve-climate-change-communication Using Memes to Improve Climate Change Communication]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Cullen, in his book ''Contagious Ideas'',&lt;ref name="Contagious Ideas"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Cullen | first1 = Ben | title = Contagious Ideas: On evolution, culture, archaeology, and Cultural Virus Theory | publisher = [[Oxbow Books]] | date = 2000 | location =Oxford and Oakville | isbn = 1-84217-014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought the idea of the meme into the discipline of archaeology. He coined the term "Cultural Virus Theory", and used it to try to anchor archaeological theory in a neo-Darwinian paradigm. Archaeological memetics could assist the application of the meme concept to material culture in particular.

[[Francis Heylighen]] of the [[Center Leo Apostel for Interdisciplinary Studies]] has postulated what he calls "memetic selection criteria". These criteria opened the way to a specialized field of ''applied memetics'' to find out if these selection criteria could stand the test of [[quantitative research|quantitative analyses]]. In 2003 Klaas Chielens carried out these tests in a Masters thesis project on the testability of the selection criteria.

In ''Selfish Sounds and Linguistic Evolution'',&lt;ref name="Selfish Sounds"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ritt | first1 = Nikolaus | title = Selfish Sounds and Linguistic Evolution: A Darwinian Approach to Language Change | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | date = July 5, 2004 | location = New York | accessdate = | isbn = 978-0-521-82671-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian linguist Nikolaus Ritt has attempted to operationalise memetic concepts and use them for the explanation of long term sound changes and change conspiracies in early English. It is argued that a generalised Darwinian framework for handling cultural change can provide explanations where established, speaker centred approaches fail to do so. The book makes comparatively concrete suggestions about the possible material structure of memes, and provides two empirically rich case studies.

Australian academic S.J. Whitty has argued that [[project management]] is a memeplex with the language and stories of its practitioners at its core.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv.php?pid=UQ:8801&amp;dsID=sjw_ijpm_05.pdf A Memetic Paradigm of Project Management] (International Journal of Project Management, 23 (8) 575-583)&lt;/ref&gt; This radical approach sees a project and its management as an illusion; a human construct about a collection of feelings, expectations, and sensations, which are created, fashioned, and labeled by the human brain. Whitty's approach requires project managers to consider that the reasons for using project management are not consciously driven to maximize profit, and are encouraged to consider project management as naturally occurring, self-serving, evolving process which shapes organizations for its own purpose.

Swedish political scientist Mikael Sandberg argues against "[[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]]" interpretations of institutional and technological evolution and studies creative innovation of [[information technologies]] in governmental and private organizations in Sweden in the 1990s from a memetic perspective.&lt;ref&gt;"The Evolution of IT Innovations in Swedish Organizations: A Darwinian Critique of ‘Lamarckian’ Institutional Economics", '''Journal of Evolutionary Economics''', vol. 17, No. 1 (Feb 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing the effects of active ("Lamarckian") IT strategy versus user–producer interactivity (Darwinian co-evolution), evidence from Swedish organizations shows that co-evolutionary interactivity is almost four times as strong a factor behind IT creativity as the "Lamarckian" IT strategy.

==Terminology==
*'''[[Memeplex]]''' – (an abbreviation of meme-complex) is a collection or grouping of memes that have evolved into a mutually supportive or [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Blackmore, Susan, 1999, The Meme Machine, Oxford University Press, Oxford, {{ISBN|0-19-850365-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, a meme-complex is a set of ideas that reinforce each other. Meme-complexes are roughly analogous to the symbiotic collection of individual [[gene]]s that make up the genetic codes of biological organisms. An example of a memeplex would be a [[religion]].
*'''[[Meme pool]]''' – a population of interbreeding memes.
*'''[[Memetic engineering]]''' – The process of deliberately creating memes, using engineering principles.
*'''[[Memetic algorithms]]''' – an approach to [[evolutionary computation]] that attempts to emulate cultural evolution in order to solve [[optimization problem]]s.
*'''Memotype''' – is the actual information-content of a meme.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Grant. ''A Memetic Lexicon''. Montreal. 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Memeoid''' – is a [[neologism]] for people who have been taken over by a meme to the extent that their own survival becomes inconsequential. Examples include [[kamikaze]]s, [[suicide bomber]]s and [[cult]] members who commit mass suicide. The term was apparently coined by H. [[Keith Henson]] in "Memes, L5 and the Religion of the Space Colonies," ''L5 News'', September 1985 pp.&amp;nbsp;5–8,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfpm.org/~majordom/memetics/2000/16177.html Two early meme papers of historical interest (1a)]&lt;/ref&gt; and referenced in the expanded second edition of [[Richard Dawkins]]' book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;330). But in the strict sense all people are essentially ''memeoid'', since no distinction can be made if one uses language, or memes use their host. In ''[[The Electronic Revolution]]'' [[William S. Burroughs]] writes: "the word has not been recognised as a virus because it has achieved a state of stable symbiosis with the host."
*'''Memetic equilibrium''' – refers to the cultural equivalent of species biological equilibrium. It is that which humans strive for in terms of personal value with respect to cultural artefacts and ideas. The term was coined by Christopher diCarlo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christopher W. diCarlo |title=How Problem Solving and Neurotransmission in the Upper Paleolithic led to The Emergence and Maintenance of Memetic Equilibrium in Contemporary World Religions |url=http://www.politicsandculture.org/2010/04/27/how-problem-solving-and-neurotransmission-in-the-upper-paleolithic-led-to-the-emergence-and-maintenance-of-memetic-equilibrium-in-contemporary-world-religions/ |journal=Politics and Culture |issue=Special Evolutionary Issue |date=April 27, 2010 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Atheism and Irreligion Sidebar}}
'''Metaphysical naturalism''' (also called '''ontological naturalism''', '''philosophical naturalism''', '''scientific materialism''' and '''antisupernaturalism''') is a philosophical worldview, which holds that there is nothing but [[natural]] elements, principles, and relations of the kind studied by the [[natural sciences]].  [[Methodological naturalism]] is a philosophical basis for science, for which metaphysical naturalism provides only one possible [[ontology|ontological]] foundation. Broadly, the corresponding theological perspective is [[religious naturalism]] or [[spiritual naturalism]]. More specifically, metaphysical naturalism rejects the [[supernatural]] concepts and explanations that are part of many [[religions]].

==Definition==

According to [[Steven Schafersman]], geologist and president of [[Texas Citizens for Science]], metaphysical naturalism is a philosophy that maintains that; 1. Nature encompasses all that [[existence|exists]] throughout [[spacetime|space and time]]; and 2. Nature (the [[universe]] or [[cosmos]]) consists only of natural elements, that is, of spatiotemporal [[physical property|physical]] substance—[[mass]]–[[energy]]. Non-physical or quasi-physical [[substance (philosophy)|substance]], such as [[information]], [[idea]]s, [[values]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[intellect]], and other [[emergentism|emergent phenomena]], either [[supervenience|supervene]] upon the physical or can be [[eliminative materialism|reduced]] to a physical account; and 3. Nature operates by the laws of [[physics]] and in principle, can be explained and understood by science and philosophy; and 4. the [[supernatural]] does not exist, i.e., only nature is [[reality|real]].  [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] is therefore a [[metaphysical]] philosophy opposed primarily by Biblical creationism".{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}}

[[Carl Sagan]] put it succinctly: "The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagan|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=Cosmos|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2002|isbn=9780375508325|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arthur C. Danto]], naturalism, in recent usage, is a species of philosophical monism according to which whatever exists or happens is ''natural'' in the sense of being susceptible to explanation through methods which, although paradigmatically exemplified in the natural sciences, are continuous from domain to domain of objects and events. Hence, naturalism is polemically defined as repudiating the view that there exists or could exist any entities which lie, in principle, beyond the scope of scientific explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arthur C. |last=Danto|title=The Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter=Naturalism}} Editor {{harvnb|Stone|2008|p=2}} "Personally, I place great emphasis on the phrase "in principle", since there are many things that science does not now explain. And perhaps we need some natural piety concerning the ontological limit question as to why there is anything at all. But the idea that naturalism is a polemical notion is important".&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the vagueness of the general term "naturalism", [[David Papineau]] traces the current usage to philosophers in early 20th century America such as [[John Dewey]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Sidney Hook]], and [[Roy Wood Sellars]]: "So understood, 'naturalism' is not a particularly informative term as applied to contemporary philosophers. The great majority of contemporary philosophers would happily accept naturalism as just characterized—that is, they would both reject 'supernatural' entities, and allow that science is a possible route (if not necessarily the only one) to important truths about the 'human spirit'".{{sfn|Papineau|2007}} Papineau remarks that philosophers widely regard naturalism as a "positive" term, and "few active philosophers nowadays are happy to announce themselves as 'non-naturalists'", while noting that "philosophers concerned with religion tend to be less enthusiastic about 'naturalism'" and that despite an "inevitable" divergence due to its popularity, if more narrowly construed, (to the chagrin of [[John McDowell]], [[David Chalmers]] and [[Jennifer Hornsby]], for example), those not so disqualified remain nonetheless content "to set the bar for 'naturalism' higher".{{sfn|Papineau|2007}}

Philosopher and theologian [[Alvin Plantinga]], a [[evolutionary argument against naturalism|well-known critic of naturalism]] in general, comments: "Naturalism is presumably not a religion. In one very important respect, however, it resembles religion: it can be said to perform the cognitive function of a religion. There is that range of deep human questions to which a religion typically provides an answer ... Like a typical religion, naturalism gives a set of answers to these and similar questions".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodological naturalism===

Metaphysical naturalism is an approach to [[metaphysics]] or [[ontology]], which deals with existence ''per se''. It should not be confused with [[methodological naturalism]], which sees [[empiricism]] as the basis for the scientific method.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Regarding science and evolution, [[Eugenie C. Scott]], a notable opponent of teaching [[creationism]] or [[intelligent design]] in US public schools, stresses the importance of separating metaphysical from methodological naturalism:
{{quote|If it is important for Americans to learn about science and evolution, decoupling the two forms of naturalism is essential strategy. ... I suggest that scientists can defuse some of the opposition to evolution by first recognizing that the vast majority of Americans are believers, and that most Americans want to retain their faith. It is demonstrable that individuals can retain religious beliefs and still accept evolution as science. Scientists should avoid confusing the methodological naturalism of science with metaphysical naturalism.&lt;ref name="Scott1996"/&gt;|Eugenie C. Scott|"Creationism, Ideology, and Science"}}

===Lack of necessity for worship===

The historian [[Richard Carrier]], in his book ''Sense and Goodness without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism,'' describes metaphysical naturalism thus: as a philosophy "wherein worship is replaced with curiosity, devotion with diligence, holiness with sincerity, ritual with study, and scripture with the whole world and the whole of human learning". Carrier wrote that it is the naturalist’s duty "to question all things and have a well-grounded faith in what is well-investigated and well-proved, rather than what is merely well-asserted or well-liked".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and naturalism==
{{main article|Uniformitarianism}}
Metaphysical naturalism is the philosophical basis of science as described by Kate and Vitaly (2000) "There are certain philosophical assumptions made at the base of the scientific method — namely, 1) that reality is objective and consistent, 2) that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately, and that 3) rational explanations exist for elements of the real world. These assumptions are the basis of naturalism, the philosophy on which science is grounded. Philosophy is at least implicitly at the core of every decision we make or position we take, it is obvious that correct philosophy is a necessity for scientific inquiry to take place."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|A.Sergei|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Schafersman]], agrees that methodological naturalism is "the adoption or assumption of philosophical naturalism within [[scientific method]] with or without fully accepting or believing it ... science is not metaphysical and does not depend on the ultimate truth of any metaphysics for its success, but methodological naturalism must be adopted as a strategy or working hypothesis for science to succeed. We may therefore be agnostic about the ultimate truth of naturalism, but must nevertheless adopt it and investigate nature as if nature is all that there is."{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}}

Contrary to other notable opponents of teaching [[Creationism]] or [[Intelligent Design]] in US public schools such as [[Eugenie Scott]], Schafersman asserts that "while science as a process only requires methodological naturalism, I think that the assumption of methodological naturalism by scientists and others logically and morally entails ontological naturalism".{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}} as well as the similarly controversial assertion: "I maintain that the practice or adoption of methodological naturalism entails a logical and moral belief in ontological naturalism, so they are not logically decoupled."{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}} On the other hand, Scott argues:
{{quote|that a clear distinction must be drawn between science as a way of knowing about the natural world and science as a foundation for philosophical views. One should be taught to our children in school, and the other can optionally be taught to our children at home. Once this view is explained, I have found far more support than disagreement among my university colleagues. Even someone who may disagree with my logic or understanding of philosophy of science often understands the strategic reasons for separating methodological from philosophical [[materialism]]—if we want more Americans to understand evolution.&lt;ref name="Scott1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |year=1996 |chapter="Creationism, Ideology, and Science" |title=The Flight From Science and Reason |publisher=The New York Academy of Sciences, |pages=519–520 |editors=Gross, Levitt, and Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott2008"&gt;{{cite web |last=Scott |first=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |year=2008 |url=http://ncse.com/religion/science-religion-methodology-humanism |title=Science and Religion, Methodology and Humanism |publisher=NCSE |accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Eugenie C. Scott|Science and Religion, Methodology and Humanism}} However, there are other controversies, [[Arthur Newell Strahler]] embeds peculiar [[anthropic principle|anthropic]] distinctions in the name of naturalism: "The naturalistic view is that the particular universe we observe came into existence and has operated through all time and in all its parts without the impetus or guidance of any supernatural agency. The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Strahler|1992|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Variously known as [[background independence]], the [[cosmological principle]], the principle of universality, the principle of uniformity, or [[uniformitarianism]], there ''are'' important philosophical assumptions that cannot be derived from nature. As noted by [[Stephen Jay Gould]]: "You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of unknown processes.  It works the other way around. You first assume these propositions and "then you go to the out crop of rock."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gould|1987|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1987|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The assumption of spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws is by no means unique to geology since it amounts to a warrant for inductive inference which, as Bacon showed nearly four hundred years ago, is the basic mode of reasoning in empirical science. Without assuming this spatial and temporal invariance, we have no basis for extrapolating from the known to the unknown and, therefore, no way of reaching general conclusions from a finite number of observations. (Since the assumption is itself vindicated by induction, it can in no way "prove" the validity of induction—an endeavor virtually abandoned after Hume demonstrated its futility two centuries ago)."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gould|1965|pp=223–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould also notes that natural processes such as Lyell's "uniformity of process" are an assumption: "As such, it is another ''a priori'' assumption shared by all scientists and not a statement about the empirical world."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gould|1984|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such assumptions across time and space are needed for scientists to extrapolate into the unobservable past, according to G.G. Simpson: "Uniformity is an unprovable postulate justified, or indeed required, on two grounds. First, nothing in our incomplete but extensive knowledge of history disagrees with it. Second, only with this postulate is a rational interpretation of history possible, and we are justified in seeking—as scientists we must seek—such a rational interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1963|pp=24–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to R. Hooykaas: "The principle of uniformity is not a law, not a rule established after comparison of facts, but a principle, preceding the observation of facts ... It is the logical principle of parsimony of causes and of economy of scientific notions. By explaining past changes by analogy with present phenomena, a limit is set to conjecture, for there is only one way in which two things are equal, but there are an infinity of ways in which they could be supposed different."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooykaas|1963|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Various associated beliefs==
Contemporary naturalists possess a wide diversity of beliefs within metaphysical naturalism.  Most metaphysical naturalists have adopted some form of [[materialism]] or [[physicalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html| title = Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science| first = Steven D.| last = Schafersman|authorlink=Steven Schafersman| year=1996| at= Section "The Origin of Naturalism and Its Relation to Science"| quote= Certainly most philosophical naturalists today are materialists[...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undesigned universe===
Metaphysical naturalists argue that the scientific facts and theories that we have to explain the origins of the universe provide no evidence for supernatural beings or deities.&lt;ref name=sag&gt;{{cite book |first= Richard |last= Carrier |title= Sense and Goodness without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism |date= 2010-08-09 |publisher= AuthorHouse |location= Bloomington, Indiana |section= Free Preview |accessdate= 2013-12-25 |url=http://bookstore.authorhouse.com/Products/SKU-000406158/Sense-and-Goodness-Without-God.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Richard Carrier explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...no other worldview is directly and substantially supported by any scientific evidence, whereas all scientific evidence so far does support Metaphysical Naturalism, often directly, sometimes substantially. Though naturalism has not yet been proved, it is the best bet going.&lt;ref name=sag/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One might say that either it has always existed or it had a purely natural origin, being neither created nor designed.

===Abiogenesis and evolution===
Since nature is all there is, and there was once no life, abiogenesis is implied: that life arose spontaneously from natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=166–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Carrier, [The Argument from Biogenesis: Probabilities Against a Natural Origin of Life],  ''Biology and Philosophy'' 19.5 (November 2004), pp. 739-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalists reason about ''how'', not ''if'' evolution happened.  They maintain that humanity's existence is not by [[intelligent design]] but rather a natural process of [[emergence]].

===Ethics and meta-ethics===

Some embrace [[virtue ethics]] and many see no compelling argument against [[ethical naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=168–176, 326–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=March 2012}}  Some may advocate for a [[Science of morality]].  One example of an attempt to ground a naturalist meta-ethical system is [[Richard Carrier]]'s chapter "Moral Facts Naturally Exist (and Science Could Find Them)" which was peer reviewed by four philosophers.  It sets out to prove a [[Moral realism]] centered around human satisfaction.  [[Alexander Rosenberg]] has expressed a contrary position that naturalists, in general, have to accept [[moral nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Alexander |title=The Disenchanted Naturalist’s Guide to Reality |url=http://onthehuman.org/2009/11/the-disenchanted-naturalists-guide-to-reality/ |work=On the Human Forum |publisher=National Humanities Center (United States) |authorlink=Alexander Rosenberg |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226150034/http://onthehuman.org/2009/11/the-disenchanted-naturalists-guide-to-reality/ |archivedate=26 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The mind is a natural phenomenon===

If any variety of metaphysical naturalism is true, any [[mental properties]] that exist are [[causality|caused]] by and [[ontology|ontologically]] dependent upon nature.

Metaphysical naturalists do not believe in a [[soul]] or [[spirit]], nor in [[ghost]]s, and when explaining what constitutes the [[mind]] they rarely appeal to [[substance dualism]]. If one's mind, or rather one's [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and existence as a [[person]], is entirely the product of natural processes, three conclusions follow according to W.T. Stace. First, all mental contents (such as [[idea]]s, [[theories]], [[emotions]], moral and personal [[values]], or [[aesthetic]] response) exist solely as computational constructions of one's brain and genetics, not as things that exist independently of these. Second, damage to the brain (regardless of how) should be of great concern. Third, death or destruction of one's brain cannot be survived, which is to say, all humans are mortal. Stace, however, believes that ecstatic mysticism calls into question the assumption that awareness is impossible without data processing.&lt;ref name="stace3"&gt;Stace, W.T, Mysticism and Philosophy. N.Y.: Macmillan, 1960; reprinted, Los Angeles: Jeremy P. Tarcher, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility of reason===
Metaphysical naturalists hold that [[reason]] is the refinement and improvement of naturally evolved faculties. The certitude of deductive logic remains unexplained by this essentially probabilistic view. Nevertheless, naturalists believe anyone who wishes to have more beliefs that are true than are false should seek to perfect and consistently employ their reason in testing and forming beliefs. Empirical methods (especially those of proven use in the sciences) are unsurpassed for discovering the facts of reality, while methods of [[pure reason]] alone can securely discover logical errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value of society===
Humans are [[social animals]], which is why humanity developed [[culture]] and [[civilization]]. In terms of evolution, this means that differential reproductive success somehow depended on traits that permit the development and maintenance of a healthy and productive culture and civilization.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==History&lt;!--'History of metaphysical naturalism' redirects here--&gt;==
{{also|History of materialism|History of metaphysical realism}}
===Ancient and medieval philosophy===
Naturalism was the foundation of two ([[Vaisheshika]], [[Nyaya]]) of the six orthodox schools and one ([[Carvaka]]) heterodox school of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;A Chatterjee (2012), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/naturalism-india/ Naturalism in Classical Indian Philosophy], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale Riepe (1996), ''Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass'', {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pp. 227–246&lt;/ref&gt; The Carvaka, Nyaya, Vaisheshika schools originated in the 7th, 6th, and 2nd century BCE, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman (1999), ''Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy.'' Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173629}}, page 269&lt;/ref&gt;

Western metaphysical naturalism has originated in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. The earliest [[pre-Socratic philosopher]]s, especially the [[Milesian school|Milesians]] ([[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]) and the [[atomists]] ([[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]]), were labeled by their peers and successors "the ''physikoi''" (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] φυσικός or ''physikos'', meaning "natural philosopher," borrowing on the word φύσις or ''[[physis]]'', meaning "nature") because they investigated natural causes, often excluding any role for gods in the creation or operation of the world. This eventually led to fully developed systems such as [[Epicureanism]], which sought to explain everything that exists as the product of atoms falling and swerving in a [[Void (philosophy)|void]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] surveyed the thought of his predecessors and conceived of nature in a way that charted a middle course between their excesses.&lt;ref&gt;See especially ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', books I and II.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote |Plato's world of eternal and unchanging [[Theory of Forms|Forms]], imperfectly represented in matter by a divine [[Demiurge|Artisan]], contrasts sharply with the various mechanistic ''[[Weltanschauungen]]'', of which [[atomism]] was, by the fourth century at least, the most prominent… This debate was to persist throughout the ancient world. Atomistic mechanism got a shot in the arm from [[Epicurus]]… while the [[Stoics]] adopted a [[Teleological argument|divine teleology]]…  The choice seems simple: either show how a structured, regular world could arise out of undirected processes, or inject intelligence into the system. This was how Aristotle… when still a young acolyte of Plato, saw matters. [[Cicero]]… preserves Aristotle's own [[Allegory of the cave|cave-image]]: if [[Troglodytae|troglodytes]] were brought on a sudden into the upper world, they would immediately suppose it to have been intelligently arranged. But Aristotle grew to abandon this view; although he believes in a divine being, the [[Unmoved mover|Prime Mover]] is not the [[efficient cause]] of action in the Universe, and plays no part in constructing or arranging it... But, although he rejects the divine Artificer, Aristotle does not resort to a pure mechanism of random forces. Instead he seeks to find a middle way between the two positions, one which relies heavily on the notion of Nature, or ''[[phusis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought |last=Hankinson |first=R. J. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-924656-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwfy-n5IWL8C |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the rise and dominance of [[Christianity]] in the West and the later spread of [[Islam]], metaphysical naturalism was generally abandoned by intellectuals. Thus, there is little evidence for it in [[medieval philosophy]]. The reintroduction of Aristotle's empirical epistemology as well as previously lost treatises by Greco-Roman natural philosophers which was begun by the medieval [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]] without resulting in any noticeable increase in commitment to naturalism.

===Modern philosophy===
It was not until the [[Early modern philosophy|early modern era of philosophy]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]] that naturalists like [[Benedict Spinoza]] (who put forward a theory of [[psychophysical parallelism]]), [[David Hume]],&lt;ref&gt;William Edward Morris, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ "David Hume"], [[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (May 21, 2014), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; and the proponents of [[French materialism]] (notably [[Denis Diderot]], [[Julien La Mettrie]], and [[Baron d'Holbach]]) started to emerge again in the 17th and 18th centuries. In this period, some metaphysical naturalists adhered to a distinct doctrine, [[materialism]], which became the dominant category of metaphysical naturalism widely defended until the end of the 19th century.

[[Immanuel Kant]] rejected ([[reductionist]]) materialist positions in metaphysics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Immanuel Kant|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was not hostile to naturalism. His [[transcendental philosophy]] is considered to be a form of [[liberal naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Robert, ''Kant, Science, and Human Nature''. Clarendon Press, 2006, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[late modern philosophy]], ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'', a form of [[natural philosophy]], was developed by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]]&lt;ref name=Beiser&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser]](2002), ''German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism 1781-1801'', Harvard university Press, p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]&lt;ref name=Beiser/&gt; as an attempt to comprehend nature in its totality and to outline its general theoretical structure.

A politicized version of naturalism that has arisen after Hegel was [[Ludwig Feuerbach]],&lt;ref name="NC57"&gt;Nicholas Churchich, ''Marxism and Alienation'', Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1990, p. 57: "Although Marx has rejected Feuerbach's abstract materialism," Lenin says that Feuerbach's views "are consistently materialist," implying that Feuerbach's conception of causality is entirely in line with dialectical materialism."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]'s [[dialectical materialism]], especially Engels's dialectical philosophy of nature (''[[Dialectics of Nature]]'').

Another notable school of late modern philosophy advocating naturalism was [[German materialism]]: members included [[Ludwig Büchner]], [[Jacob Moleschott]], and [[Karl Vogt]].&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owen Chadwick, ''The Secularization of the European Mind in the Nineteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 165: "During the 1850s German ... scientists conducted a controversy known ... as the materialistic controversy. It was specially associated with the names of Vogt, Moleschott and Büchner" and p. 173: "Frenchmen were surprised to see Büchner and Vogt. ... [T]he French were surprised at German materialism".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Nineteenth Century and After]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=8-VXAAAAIAAJ&amp;q= Vol. 151], 1952, p. 227: "the Continental materialism of Moleschott and Buchner&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary philosophy===
In the early 20th century, [[matter]] was found to be a form of [[energy]] and therefore not fundamental as materialists had assumed. (See [[History of physics]].) In [[contemporary philosophy]], renewed attention to the [[problem of universals]], [[philosophy of mathematics]], the development of [[mathematical logic]], and the post-[[logical positivism|positivist]] revival of [[metaphysics]] and the [[philosophy of religion]], initially by way of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] [[linguistic philosophy]], further called the naturalistic paradigm into question. Developments such as these, along with those within science and the [[philosophy of science]] brought new advancements and revisions of naturalistic doctrines by naturalistic philosophers into metaphysics, [[ethics]], the [[philosophy of language]], the [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], etc., the products of which include [[physicalism]] and [[eliminative materialism]], [[supervenience]], [[causal theory of reference|causal theories of reference]], [[anomalous monism]], [[naturalized epistemology]] (e.g. [[reliabilism]]), [[internalism and externalism]], [[ethical naturalism]], and [[property dualism]], for example.

A politicized version of naturalism that has arisen in contemporary philosophy is [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. Objectivism is an expression of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[ethical idealism]] within a naturalistic framework.

The current usage of the term naturalism "derives from debates in America in the first half of the last century. The self-proclaimed 'naturalists' from that period included [[John Dewey]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Sidney Hook]] and [[Roy Wood Sellars]]."&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, metaphysical naturalism is more widely embraced than in previous centuries, especially but not exclusively in the [[natural science]]s and the Anglo-American, [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophical]] communities. While the vast majority of the population of the world remains firmly committed to non-naturalistic worldviews, prominent contemporary defenders of naturalism and/or naturalistic theses and doctrines today include [[J. J. C. Smart]], [[David Malet Armstrong]], [[David Papineau]], [[Paul Kurtz]], [[Brian Leiter]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Michael Devitt]], [[Fred Dretske]], [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]], [[Mario Bunge]], [[Jonathan Schaffer]], [[Hilary Kornblith]], [[Quentin Smith]], [[Paul Draper (philosopher)|Paul Draper]] and [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], among many other academic philosophers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

According to [[David Papineau]], contemporary naturalism is a consequence of the build-up of scientific evidence during the twentieth century for the "[[causal closure]] of the physical", the doctrine that all physical effects can be accounted for by physical causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Papineau]], "The Rise of Physicalism" in ''Physicalism and its Discontents'', Cambridge (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|By the middle of the twentieth century, the acceptance of the causal closure of the physical realm led to even stronger naturalist views. The [[causal closure]] thesis implies that any mental and biological causes must themselves be physically constituted, if they are to produce physical effects. It thus gives rise to a particularly strong form of ontological naturalism, namely the physicalist doctrine that any state that has physical effects must itself be physical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the 1950s onwards, philosophers began to formulate arguments for ontological physicalism. Some of these arguments appealed explicitly to the causal closure of the physical realm (Feigl 1958, Oppenheim and Putnam 1958). In other cases, the reliance on causal closure lay below the surface. However, it is not hard to see that even in these latter cases the causal closure thesis played a crucial role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Papineau |first=David |authorlink=David Papineau |year=2007 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2007/entries/naturalism/#NatPhy |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor=Edward N.

According to [[Steven Schafersman]], president of [[Texas Citizens for Science]], an advocacy group opposing [[creationism]] in public schools,&lt;ref name="Williams 2"&gt;{{cite news |title=The God curriculum  |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/04/07/smcreate07.xml&amp;page=2 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=July 4, 2007 |accessdate=2008-12-26 |location=London |first=Sally |last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; the progressive adoption of methodological naturalism—and later of metaphysical naturalism—followed the advances of science and the increase of its [[explanatory power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html| title = Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science| first = Steven D.| last = Schafersman|authorlink=Steven Schafersman| year=1996| at= Section "The Origin of Naturalism and Its Relation to Science"| quote= Naturalism did not exist as a philosophy before the nineteenth century, but only as an occasionally adopted and non-rigorous method among natural philosophers. It is a unique philosophy in that it is not ancient or prior to science, and that it developed largely due to the influence of science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These advances also caused the diffusion of positions associated with metaphysical naturalism, such as [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html| title = Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science| first = Steven D.| last = Schafersman|authorlink=Steven Schafersman| year=1996| at= Section "The Origin of Naturalism and Its Relation to Science"| quote= Naturalism is almost unique in that it would not exist as a philosophy without the prior existence of science. It shares this status, in my view, with the philosophy of existentialism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for metaphysical naturalism==

In the context of creation and evolution debates, [[Internet Infidels]] co-founder Jeffery Jay Lowder argues against what he calls "the argument from bias", that ''a priori,'' the supernatural is merely ruled out due to an unexamined stipulation. Lowder believes "there are good empirical reasons for believing that metaphysical naturalism is true, and therefore a denial of the supernatural need not be based upon an ''a priori'' assumption".&lt;ref name="Lowder1999"/&gt;

Richard Carrier argues in ''Sense and Goodness Without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism'' that Metaphysical Naturalism is true. Topics covered include [[metaphilosophy]],  [[semantics]], [[epistemology]], the nature and [[origin of the universe]] (including a proposal that [[spacetime]] may be the [[ground of all being]] and [[brute fact|a rejection of the logical possibility for any ultimate answer]]),  free will [[compatibilism]], the nature of [[mind]], [[abstract objects]], [[Reductionism#Ontological reductionism|ontological reductionism]], the nature of [[emotions]], the [[meaning of life]], the nature of [[reason]], [[atheism]], [[aesthetics]], [[morality]] (including [[ethical naturalism]] and a recommendation for a [[science of morality]]), and [[politics]].

===Argument from physical minds===

Several Metaphysical Naturalists have used the trends in scientific discoveries about minds to argue that no supernatural minds exist.  For instance, Lowder says, "Since all known mental activity has a physical basis, there are probably no disembodied minds. But God is conceived of as a disembodied mind. Therefore, God probably does not exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/minds.html |title=Argument from Physical Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowder argues the correlation between mind and brain implies that supernatural souls do not exist because the theist position, according to Lowder, is that the mind depends upon this soul instead of the brain.&lt;ref name="Lowder1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infidels.org/infidels/newsletter/1999/march.html#Naturalism |date=March 1999 |work=Internet Infidels Newsletter |title=The Empirical Case for Metaphysical Naturalism |first=Jeffery Jay |last=Lowder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmological argument for naturalism===

{{quote|[Elegance] goes directly to the question of how the laws of nature are constructed. Nobody knows the answer to that. Nobody! It's a perfectly legitimate hypothesis, in my view, to say that some extremely elegant creator made those laws. But I think if you go down that road, you must have the courage to ask the next question, which is: Where did that creator come from? And where did his, her, or its elegance come from? And if you say it was always there, then why not say that the laws of nature were always there and save a step?&lt;ref name="Sagan2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=C. |last=Sagan |first2=T. |last2=Head |year=2006 |title=Conversations with Carl Sagan |series=Literary Conversations Series |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn=9781578067367 |lccn=2005048747 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJ1rDj2nR3EC&amp;pg=PR14 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Carl Sagan]]|''Conversations with Carl Sagan''}}

==Arguments against==

Arguments against metaphysical naturalism include the following examples.

===Evolutionary argument against naturalism===
{{Main article|Evolutionary argument against naturalism}}
[[Alvin Plantinga]] is the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, and the inaugural holder of the Jellema Chair in Philosophy at Calvin College. He is a [[Christian]], and a well-known critic of naturalism.  He argues, in his [[evolutionary argument against naturalism]], that the probability that evolution has produced humans with [[Reliabilism|reliable true beliefs]], is low or inscrutable, unless their evolution was guided, for example, by God.  According to David Kahan of the [[University of Glasgow]], in order to understand how beliefs are warranted, a justification must be found in the context of [[supernatural]] theism, as in Plantinga's epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPWAPF&amp;Cover=TRUE |title=Gifford Lecture Series - Warrant and Proper Function 1987-1988 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104024641/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPWAPF&amp;Cover=TRUE |archivedate=4 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alvin |last=Plantinga |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Evolution-Shibboleths-and/64990/ |title=Evolution, Shibboleths, and Philosophers — Letters to the Editor |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=11 April 2010 |quote=...I do indeed think that evolution functions as a contemporary shibboleth by which to distinguish the ignorant fundamentalist goats from the informed and scientifically literate sheep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Richard Dawkins, 'It is absolutely safe to say that, if you meet somebody who claims not to believe in evolution, that person is ignorant, stupid, or insane (or wicked, but I'd rather not consider that).' Daniel Dennett goes Dawkins one (or two) further: 'Anyone today who doubts that the variety of life on this planet was produced by a process of evolution is simply ignorant—inexcusably ignorant.' You wake up in the middle of the night; you think, can that whole Darwinian story really be true? Wham! You are inexcusably ignorant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do think that evolution has become a modern idol of the tribe. But of course it doesn't even begin to follow that I think the scientific theory of evolution is false. And I don't.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alvin |last=Plantinga |title=Warrant and Proper Function |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-507863-2 |at=Chap. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See also [[supernormal stimuli]]).''

Plantinga argues that together, naturalism and evolution provide an insurmountable "''defeater'' for the belief that our cognitive faculties are reliable", i.e., a [[skeptical argument]] along the lines of Descartes' [[evil demon]] or [[brain in a vat]].&lt;ref name="Beilby2002"&gt;{{cite book |first=J.K. |last=Beilby |year=2002 |chapter=Introduction by Alvin Plantinga |title=Naturalism Defeated?: Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism |series=Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0-8014-8763-7 |lccn=2001006111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p40tc_T7-rMC&amp;pg=PA1 |pages=1–2, 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Take ''philosophical naturalism'' to be the belief that there aren't any supernatural entities—no such person as God, for example, but also no other supernatural entities, and nothing at all like God. My claim was that naturalism and contemporary evolutionary theory are at serious odds with one another—and this despite the fact that the latter is ordinarily thought to be one of the main pillars supporting the edifice of the former. (Of course I am ''not'' attacking the theory of evolution, or anything in that neighborhood; I am instead attacking the conjunction of ''naturalism'' with the view that human beings have evolved in that way. I see no similar problems with the conjunction of ''theism'' and the idea that human beings have evolved in the way contemporary evolutionary science suggests.) More particularly, I argued that the conjunction of naturalism with the belief that we human beings have evolved in conformity with current evolutionary doctrine... is in a certain interesting way self-defeating or self-referentially incoherent.&lt;ref name="Beilby2002"/&gt;|Alvin Plantinga|"Introduction" in ''Naturalism Defeated?: Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism''}}

Branden Fitelson of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Elliott Sober]] of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] argue that Plantinga must show that the combination of evolution and naturalism also defeats the more modest claim that "at least a non-negligible minority of our beliefs are true", and that defects such as [[cognitive bias]] are nonetheless consistent with being made in the image of a rational God. Whereas evolutionary science already acknowledges that cognitive processes are unreliable, including the fallibility of the scientific enterprise itself, Plantinga's [[hyperbolic doubt]] is no more a defeater for naturalism than it is for theistic metaphysics founded upon a non-deceiving God who designed the human mind: "[neither] can construct a non-question-begging argument that refutes global skepticism."&lt;ref name = Fitelson&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fitelson | first = Branden | authorlink = Branden Fitelson |author2=[[Elliott Sober]]  |year=1998 | title = Plantinga's Probability Arguments Against Evolutionary Naturalism | journal = Pacific Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–129 | url = http://fitelson.org/plant.pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-06 | doi = 10.1111/1468-0114.00053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's argument has also been criticized by [[philosophy of mind|philosopher]] [[Daniel Dennett]] and historian [[Richard Carrier]] who argue that a cognitive apparatus for truth-finding can result from natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=181–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antinominalist argument against naturalism===
{{Main article|Theory of Forms|Hylomorphism|Scholasticism}}
[[Edward Feser]], in his 2008 book ''The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism'', lays a plenary case against naturalism by re-examining pre-Modern philosophy. Beginning in the second chapter, Feser cites the [[Plato]]nic&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism, Ch 2, pp. 31-49&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]]&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 2, pp. 53-72&lt;/ref&gt; answers to the [[problem of universals]]—that is, [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. Feser also offers arguments against [[nominalism]].&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism, Ch 2, pp. 44-46&lt;/ref&gt; And by defending realism and rejecting nominalism, he rejects [[eliminative materialism]]—and thus naturalism.

In the third chapter, Feser summarizes three of [[Thomas Aquinas|Thomas Aquinas's]] arguments for the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 90-119&lt;/ref&gt; These include arguments for an unmoved mover,&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 91-102&lt;/ref&gt; first, uncaused cause &lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 102-110&lt;/ref&gt; and (supernatural) supreme intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 110-118&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that these must exist not as a matter of probability—as in the [[intelligent design]] view, particularly of [[irreducible complexity]]&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 110-114&lt;/ref&gt;—but as a necessary consequence of "obvious, though empirical, starting points".&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''My Journey into the Wilds of Chicago''''' is a photo-literary [[coffee table book]] authored by [[Mike MacDonald (photographer)|Mike MacDonald]], with forewords by [[Bill Kurtis]] and [[Stephen Packard]].&lt;ref name=main&gt;{{cite book |last=MacDonald |first=Mike |date=2015 |title=My Journey into the Wilds of Chicago |url=http://chicagonaturenow.com/chicago-nature-book/ |location=Downers Grove, Illinois |publisher=Morning Dew Press |isbn=978-0-9963119-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is a visual and educational journey through the [[prairie]]s, [[savanna]]s, and other [[remnant natural area|natural area]]s throughout the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].&lt;ref name=SunTimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/chicago-prairie-wilderness-photography-book-mike-macdonald-interview/ |title=Sunday Sitdown: Photographer journeys to the ‘wilds of Chicago’ |last=Di Nunzio |first=Miriam |date=March 26, 2016 |website=Chicago Sun Times |publisher=Sun Times |access-date=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book contains more than 200 photographs and nearly two dozen essays and poems written by MacDonald about [[Chicago]]'s wild side, ranging in geography from the lakefront to prairie lands just north of the border in [[Wisconsin]], to [[Kankakee, Illinois|Kankakee]], [[Lockport, Illinois|Lockport]], [[Batavia, Illinois|Batavia]], and [[McHenry County, Illinois|McHenry County]].&lt;ref name=WTTW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2016/01/05/photographer-captures-wilds-chicago-new-book |title=Photographer Captures the ‘Wilds of Chicago’ in New Book |last1=Silets |first1=Alexandra |last2=Palmore |first2=Rebecca |date=January 5, 2016 |website=WTTW Website |publisher=WTTW |access-date=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''My Journey into the Wilds of Chicago'' served as the basis for the website ''ChicagoNatureNow.com!'', a website run by MacDonald.&lt;ref name=ChiNow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chicagonaturenow.com/ |website=Chicago Nature Now! |title= Homepage |access-date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website is a digital catalog of Chicago's forest preserves, and provides updates of the area's natural events.

==Reception==

The book was positively received, including a review from ''[[Publishers Weekly]],'' which said of ''My Journey into the Wilds of Chicago'', "this impressive, cloth-bound debut is a lucid perspective on the prairie and its native plants and animals; it is celebratory, soulful and poetic, evoking a strong affection for Chicago's unchecked wilderness in a city best known for its iconic lakefront and skyscrapers."&lt;ref name=PW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-9963119-0-8 |title=Review: My Journey into the Wilds of Chicago: A Celebration of Chicago- land’s Startling Natural Wonders |date=April 4, 2016 |website=Publishers Weekly |publisher=PWxyz, LLC |access-date=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''natural environment''' encompasses all [[life|living]] and non-living things occurring [[nature|naturally]], meaning in this case not [[Artificiality|artificial]]. The term is most often applied to the [[Earth]] or some parts of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living [[species]], [[climate]], weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity.

The concept of the ''natural environment'' can be distinguished as components:
* Complete [[ecological units]] that function as natural systems without massive civilized human intervention, including all vegetation, [[microorganism]]s, [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], and [[natural phenomenon|natural phenomena]] that occur within their boundaries and their nature. 
* Universal [[natural resource]]s and [[physical phenomena]] that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water, and climate, as well as [[energy]], [[radiation]], [[electric charge]], and [[magnetism]], not originating from civilized human actions

In contrast to the natural environment is the [[built environment]]. In such areas where man has fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural [[land development|land conversion]], the natural environment is greatly modified into a simplified human environment.  Even acts which seem less extreme, such as building a mud [[hut]] or a [[photovoltaic system]] in the [[desert]], the modified environment becomes an artificial one.  Though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human, hence [[beaver dam|beaver dams,]] and the works of [[Mound-building termites]], are thought of as natural.

People seldom find ''absolutely natural'' environments on Earth, and naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from  100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment, and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald |last=Symons |title=The Evolution of Human Sexuality |page=31 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1979 |location=New York |isbn=0-19-502535-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If, for instance, in an agricultural field, the [[mineralogy|mineralogic composition]] and the [[soil structure|structure]] of its soil are similar to those of an undisturbed forest soil, but the structure is quite different.

==Geological activity==
{{Main|Geology}}
The Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]], or [[lithosphere]], is the outermost solid surface of the planet and is chemically and mechanically different from underlying [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. It has been generated greatly by [[igneous]] processes in which [[magma]]  cools and solidifies to form solid rock. Beneath the lithosphere lies the mantle which is heated by the [[radioactive decay|decay]] of [[radioactive element]]s. The mantle though solid is in a state of [[rheid|rheic]] [[convection]]. This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as [[plate tectonics]]. [[Volcanoes]] result primarily from the melting of [[Subduction|subducted]] crust material or of rising mantle at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s and [[mantle plume]]s.

==Water on Earth==
[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright=0.55|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Coral reef]]s have significant marine [[biodiversity]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
Most water is found in one or another natural kind of [[body of water]].

=== Oceans ===
{{Main|Ocean}}
An [[ocean]] is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's [[surface of the Earth|surface]] (an area of some 362 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller [[sea]]s. More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800&amp;nbsp;ft) deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web |url=http://www.pagejaffna.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714233027/http://www.pagejaffna.com/ |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}".

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [[continent]]s, various [[archipelago]]s, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the [[Pacific Ocean]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Indian Ocean]], the [[Southern Ocean]] and the [[Arctic Ocean]].

=== Rivers ===
{{Main|River}}
A river is a natural [[watercourse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/river River {definition}] from Merriam-Webster. Accessed February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; usually [[freshwater]], flowing toward an [[ocean]], a [[lake]], a [[sea]] or another river.  A few rivers simply flow into the ground and dry up completely before reaching another body of water. 
[[File:Hawaii Creek.jpg|thumb|left|Rocky stream in the U.S. state of [[Hawaii]]]]

The water in a river is usually in a [[channel (geography)|channel]], made up of a [[stream bed]] between [[stream bank|banks]]. In larger rivers there is also a wider [[floodplain]] shaped by waters over-topping the channel. Flood plains may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel. Rivers are a part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater recharge]], [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], and the release of water stored in [[glacier]]s and snowpacks.

Small rivers may also be termed by several other names, including [[stream]], creek and brook.  Their [[Current (stream)|current]] is confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s.  Streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]]. The study of streams and waterways in general is known as ''surface [[hydrology]].''&lt;ref&gt;http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813113503/http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html/ |date=August 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lakes ===
[[File:LAGO LACAR.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lácar Lake]], of [[glacier|glacial]] origin, in the {{province|Neuquén|Argentina}}.]]

{{Main|Lake}}

A lake (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]], a body of water that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]].  A body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, is not part of an [[ocean]], and is larger and deeper than a [[pond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/328083/lake
|author=Britannica Online
|accessdate=2008-06-25
|title=Lake (physical feature)
|quote=[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Dictionary.com definition
|accessdate=2008-06-25
|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lake
|quote=a body of fresh or salt water of considerable size, surrounded by land.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Everglades Park swamp.JPG|thumb|left|A [[swamp]] area in [[Everglades National Park]], [[Florida]], [[US]].]]

Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in [[mountain]]ous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.
{{clear}}

==== Ponds ====
{{Main|Pond}}
A pond is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a [[lake]]. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams by their [[Flow velocity|current speed]]. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.

=== Human impact on water ===
Humans impact the water in different ways such as modifying rivers (through [[dam]]s and [[Channelization (rivers)|stream channelization]]), [[urbanization]], and [[deforestation]]. These impact lake levels, groundwater conditions, water pollution, thermal pollution, and marine pollution. Humans modify rivers by using direct channel manipulation.&lt;ref name=Goudie&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Human Impact on the Natural Environment|last=Goudie|first=Andrew|publisher=This MIT Press|year=2000|isbn=0-262-57138-2|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=203 - 239}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are building dams and reservoirs and manipulating the direction of the rivers and water path. Dams are good for humans, some communities need the reservoirs to survive. However, reservoirs and dams may negatively impact the environment and wildlife. Dams stops fish migration and the moving of organisms down stream. Urbanization effects the environment because of deforestation and changing lake levels, groundwater conditions, etc. Deforestation and urbanization go hand in hand. Deforestation may cause flooding, declining stream flow, and changes in riverside vegetation. The changing vegetation occurs because when trees cannot get adequate water they start to deteriorate, leading to a decreased food supply for the wildlife in an area.&lt;ref name=Goudie/&gt;

== Atmosphere, climate and weather ==
[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|right|Atmospheric gases [[Rayleigh scattering|scatter blue light more than other wavelengths]], creating a blue [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] when seen from space.]]
[[File:Troposphere CIMG1853.JPG|thumb|right|A view of Earth's [[troposphere]] from an [[airplane]].]]

The atmosphere of the Earth serves as a key factor in sustaining the planetary ecosystem. The thin layer of [[gas]]es that envelops the Earth is held in place by the planet's gravity. Dry [[air]] consists of 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]], 1% [[argon]] and other [[inert gases]], such as [[carbon dioxide]]. The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joe Buchdahl |url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Atmosphere/Older/Trace_Gases.html |title=Atmosphere, Climate &amp; Environment Information Programme |publisher=Ace.mmu.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009044345/http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/atmosphere/older/Trace_Gases.html |archivedate=2010-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; among which are the [[greenhouse gas]]es such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other [[chemical compound]]s. Air also contains a variable amount of [[water vapor]] and [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]] of water droplets and [[ice]] crystals seen as [[cloud]]s. Many natural substances may be present in tiny amounts in an unfiltered air sample, including [[dust]], [[pollen]] and [[spores]], [[sea spray]], [[volcanic ash]], and [[meteoroid]]s. Various industrial [[pollutant]]s also may be present, such as [[chlorine]] (elementary or in compounds), [[fluorine]] compounds, elemental [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[sulphur]] compounds such as [[sulphur dioxide]] [SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;].

The [[ozone layer]] of the Earth's atmosphere plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

===Layers of the Atmosphere===
{{Main|Earth's atmosphere}}

====Principal layers====
Earth's atmosphere can be divided into five main layers. These layers are mainly determined by whether temperature increases or decreases with altitude. From highest to lowest, these layers are:
* [[Exosphere]]: The outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere extends from the exobase upward, mainly composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].
* [[Thermosphere]]: The top of the thermosphere is the bottom of the exosphere, called the [[exobase]]. Its height varies with solar activity and ranges from about {{convert|350|-|800|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. The [[International Space Station]] orbits in this layer, between {{convert|320|and|380|km|mi|abbr=on}}.
* [[Mesosphere]]: The mesosphere extends from the stratopause to {{convert|80|-|85|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. It is the layer where most [[meteor]]s burn up upon entering the atmosphere.
* [[Stratosphere]]: The stratosphere extends from the tropopause to about {{convert|51|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. The [[stratopause]], which is the boundary between the stratosphere and mesosphere, typically is at {{convert|50|to|55|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}.
* [[Troposphere]]: The troposphere begins at the surface and extends to between {{convert|7|km|ft|abbr=on}} at the poles and {{convert|17|km|ft|abbr=on}} at the equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is mostly heated by transfer of energy from the surface, so on average the lowest part of the troposphere is warmest and temperature decreases with altitude. The [[tropopause]] is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere.

; Other layers
Within the five principal layers determined by temperature are several layers determined by other properties.
* The [[ozone layer]] is contained within the stratosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about {{convert|15|-|35|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in our atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.
* The [[ionosphere]], the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation, stretches from {{convert|50|to|1000|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} and typically overlaps both the exosphere and the thermosphere. It forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere.
* The [[homosphere]] and [[heterosphere]]: The homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.

====Effects of global warming====
[[File:Gletscherschmelze.jpg|thumb|left|The Retreat of glaciers since 1850 of [[Aletsch Glacier]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] (situation in 1979, 1991 and 2002), due to [[global warming]].]]
{{Main|Effects of global warming}}

The potential dangers of [[global warming]] are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how [[climate change]] and global warming caused by [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], or human-made releases of [[greenhouse gas]]es, most notably [[carbon dioxide]], can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly.–This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forthofer|first=Ron|title=It's Time To Act On Global Warming|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0218-08.htm|publisher=Boulder Daily Camera|accessdate=2013-10-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616203811/http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0218-08.htm|archivedate=2013-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Efforts have been increasingly focused on the [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] of greenhouse gases that are causing climatic changes, on [[Adaptation to global warming|developing adaptative strategies]] to global warming, to assist humans, other animal, and plant species, ecosystems, regions and [[nation]]s in adjusting to the [[effects of global warming]]. Some examples of recent collaboration to address climate change and global warming include:

* The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|United Nations Framework Convention Treaty]] and convention on Climate Change, to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/2860.php United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] Retrieved August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Kyoto Protocol]], which is the protocol to the international Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty, again with the objective of reducing greenhouse gases in an effort to prevent anthropogenic climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.html Kyoto Protocol] from [http://unfccc.int/2860.php United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change], Retrieved August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Western Climate Initiative]], to identify, evaluate, and implement collective and cooperative ways to reduce greenhouse gases in the region, focusing on a market-based cap-and-trade system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernclimateinitiative.org/ Western Climate Initiative], Retrieved on Feb 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significantly profound challenge is to identify the natural environmental dynamics in contrast to environmental changes not within natural variances. A common solution is to adapt a static view neglecting natural variances to exist. Methodologically, this view could be defended when looking at processes which change slowly and short time series, while the problem arrives when fast processes turns essential in the object of the study.

===Climate===

Climates can be [[Climate classification|classified]] according to the average and typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme is the one originally developed by [[Wladimir Köppen]]. The Thornthwaite system,&lt;ref&gt;[[C. W. Thornthwaite]], "An Approach Toward a Rational Classification of Climate", ''Geographical Review'', 38:55-94, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; in use since 1948, uses [[evapotranspiration]] as well as temperature and precipitation information to study animal species diversity and the potential impacts of [[climate change]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCs5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=The+Thornthwaite+system,+in+use+since+1948,+incorporates+evapotranspiration+in+addition+to+temperature+and+precipitation+information+and+is+used+in+studying+animal+species+diversity+and+potential+impacts+of+climate+changes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o21x1valsx&amp;sig=L9fJcuBCNchRY8bf7kSRcnWA7VQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi_05vijqndAhXTMn0KHf00BboQ6AEwA3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Thornthwaite%20system,%20in%20use%20since%201948,%20incorporates%20evapotranspiration%20in%20addition%20to%20temperature%20and%20precipitation%20information%20and%20is%20used%20in%20studying%20animal%20species%20diversity%20and%20potential%20impacts%20of%20climate%20changes&amp;f=false|title=English for geographers|last=García|first=Carmen Isabel Luján|date=2013-06-19|publisher=Editorial Club Universitario|isbn=9788499485676|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas [[climate]] is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Climate | encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology | publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]] | url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=climate1 | accessdate = 2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When used without qualification, "weather" is understood to be the weather of [[Earth]].

Weather occurs due to density (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the [[jet stream]]. Weather systems in the [[mid-latitudes]], such as [[extratropical cyclone]]s, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's [[Earth's rotation|axis]] is tilted relative to its orbital plane, [[sunlight]] is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On the Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40&amp;nbsp;°C (100&amp;nbsp;°F to −40&amp;nbsp;°F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in the Earth's orbit have affected the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate

Surface [[temperature]] differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] for a future time and a given location. The [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is a [[chaos theory|chaotic system]], and small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to [[weather control|control the weather]] have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that civilized human activity such as [[agriculture]] and [[industry]] has inadvertently modified weather patterns.

==Life==
[[File:Diversity of plants image version 5.png|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;There are many [[plant species]] on the planet.&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Animal diversity.png|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;An example of the many [[animal species]] on the [[Earth]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}

Evidence suggests that [[life|life on Earth]] has existed for about 3.7 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/historyoflife.php History of life through time]". University of California Museum of Paleontology.&lt;/ref&gt; All known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms, and based on these observations, theories on the origin of life attempt to find a mechanism explaining the formation of a primordial single cell organism from which all life originates. There are many different hypotheses regarding the path that might have been taken from simple [[organic molecule]]s via pre-cellular life to protocells and metabolism.

Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2006 |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |title=Definition of Life |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=2007-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208220940/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |archivedate=2007-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s. In [[biology]], the science of living organisms, "life" is the condition which distinguishes active [[organism]]s from [[Inorganic compound|inorganic matter]], including the capacity for growth, [[Physiology|functional activity]] and the continual change preceding death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary. English Edition 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/life |title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |access-date=2009-06-21 |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A diverse variety of living organisms (life forms) can be found in the [[biosphere]] on [[Earth]], and properties common to these organisms—[[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and [[bacteria]]—are a [[Carbon-based life|carbon]]- and [[Water and life|water]]-based [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] form with complex [[organization]] and heritable [[gene]]tic information. Living organisms undergo [[metabolism]], maintain [[homeostasis]], possess a capacity to [[Cell growth|grow]], respond to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], [[reproduce]] and, through [[natural selection]], adapt to their environment in successive generations. More complex living organisms can communicate through various means.

==Ecosystems==
[[File:River gambia Niokolokoba National Park.gif|thumb|left|[[Rainforest]]s often have a great deal of [[biodiversity]] with many plant and animal species. This is the [[Gambia River]] in [[Senegal]]'s [[Niokolo-Koba National Park]].]]
{{Main|Ecosystem}}

An [[ecosystem]] (also called as environment) is a natural unit consisting of all plants, animals and micro-organisms ([[biotic component|biotic]] factors) in an area functioning together with all of the non-living physical ([[abiotic]]) factors of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert W. |last=Christopherson |year=1996 |title=Geosystems: An Introduction to Physical Geography |publisher=Prentice Hall |location= |isbn=0-13-505314-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [[living organism]]s are continually engaged in a highly interrelated set of relationships with every other element constituting the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which they exist. [[Eugene Odum]], one of the founders of the science of [[ecology]], stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (i.e.: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Odum |first=E. P. |year=1971 |title=Fundamentals of Ecology |edition=Third |publisher=Saunders |location=New York |isbn=0-7216-6941-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Creek and old-growth forest-Larch Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|[[Old-growth forest]] and a [[creek (tidal)|creek]] on [[Larch Mountain (Multnomah County, Oregon)|Larch Mountain]], in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]].]] The human ecosystem concept is then grounded in the deconstruction of the human/nature [[dichotomy]], and the emergent premise that all species are ecologically integrated with each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].

A greater number or variety of species or [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]] of an ecosystem may contribute to greater resilience of an ecosystem, because there are more species present at a location to respond to change and thus "absorb" or reduce its effects. This reduces the effect before the ecosystem's structure is fundamentally changed to a different state. This is not universally the case and there is no proven relationship between the species diversity of an ecosystem and its ability to provide goods and services on a sustainable level.

The term ecosystem can also pertain to human-made environments, such as [[human ecosystem]]s and human-influenced ecosystems, and can describe any situation where there is relationship between living organisms and their environment. Fewer areas on the surface of the earth today exist free from human contact, although some genuine [[wilderness]] areas continue to exist without any forms of human intervention.

==Biomes==
[[File:Vegetation-no-legend.PNG|thumb|right|Map of Terrestrial [[biomes]] classified by vegetation.]]
{{Main|Biome}}

[[Biomes]] are terminologically similar to the concept of ecosystems, and are [[Climate|climatically]] and geographically defined areas of ecologically similar climatic conditions on the [[Earth]], such as [[Community (ecology)|communities]] of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[Soil biology|soil organisms]], often referred to ''as'' ecosystems. Biomes are defined on the basis of factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike [[ecozone]]s, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of [[ecological succession]] and [[climax vegetation]].

==Biogeochemical cycles==

{{Main|Biogeochemical cycles}}

Global [[biogeochemical cycle]]s are critical to life, most notably those of [[water]], [[oxygen]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;Smil, V. (2000). ''Cycles of Life''. New York: Scientific American Library. {{ISBN|978-0-7167-5079-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[nitrogen cycle]] is the transformation of nitrogen and nitrogen-containing compounds in nature. It is a cycle which includes gaseous components.
* The [[water cycle]], is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. Water can change states among liquid, vapour, and ice at various places in the water cycle. Although the balance of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time, individual water molecules can come and go.
* The [[carbon cycle]] is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth.
* The [[oxygen cycle]] is the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the [[lithosphere]]. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is [[photosynthesis]], which is responsible for the modern Earth's atmospheric composition and life.
* The [[phosphorus cycle]] is the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. The atmosphere does not play a significant role in the movements of phosphorus, because phosphorus and phosphorus compounds are usually solids at the typical ranges of temperature and pressure found on Earth.

==Wilderness==

[[File:Togiak Wilderness.jpg|thumb|The [[Ahklun Mountains]] and the [[Togiak Wilderness]] within the [[Togiak National Wildlife Refuge]] in the U.S. state of [[Alaska]].]]
{{Main|Wilderness}}

[[Wilderness]] is generally defined as a natural environment on [[Earth]] that has not been significantly modified by [[human]] activity. The WILD Foundation goes into more detail, defining wilderness as: "The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet - those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/ |title=The WILD Foundation |publisher=Wild.org |accessdate=2013-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121204162126/http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/ |archivedate=2012-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilderness areas and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], solitude, and [[recreation]]. Wilderness is deeply valued for cultural, spiritual, [[moral]], and [[aesthetic]] reasons. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;No Man's Garden by Daniel B. Botkin p155-157&lt;/ref&gt;

The word, "wilderness", derives from the notion of [[wildness]]; in other words that which is not controllable by humans. The word's [[etymology]] is from the [[Old English]] ''wildeornes'', which in turn derives from ''wildeor'' meaning ''wild beast'' (wild + deor = beast, deer).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/wilderness wilderness]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved November 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; From this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being "wilderness." Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered "wild." This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without very noticeable human interference.

[[Wildlife]] includes all non-[[domesticated]] plants, animals and other organisms. Domesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet, and has a major impact on the environment, both positive and negative. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, rain forests, plains, and other areas—including the most developed [[Urban area|urban]] sites—all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by civilized human factors, most scientists agree that wildlife around the world is (now) impacted by human activities.

{{See also|List of environmental issues}}
It is the common understanding of ''natural environment'' that underlies [[environmentalism]] — a broad [[politics|political]], [[sociology|social]], and [[philosophy|philosophical]] movement that advocates various actions and policies in the interest of protecting what nature remains in the natural environment, or restoring or expanding the role of nature in this environment. While true wilderness is increasingly rare, ''wild'' nature (e.g., unmanaged [[forests]], uncultivated [[grasslands]], [[wildlife]], [[wildflower]]s) can be found in many locations previously inhabited by humans.

Goals for the benefit of people and natural systems, commonly expressed by [[environmental scientist]]s and [[environmentalist]]s include:

* Elimination of [[pollution]] and [[toxicant]]s in air, water, soil, buildings, manufactured goods, and food.
* Preservation of [[biodiversity]] and protection of [[endangered species]].
* [[Conservation movement|Conservation]] and [[sustainable use]] of resources such as [[water]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Escolero, O. |author2=Kralisch, S. |author3=Martínez, S.E. |author4=Perevochtchikova, M.|year=2016|title=Diagnóstico y análisis de los factores que influyen en la vulnerabilidad de las fuentes de abastecimiento de agua potable a la Ciudad de México, México|url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/6803/%283%29Escolero.pdf|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana|language=Spanish|volume=68|issue=3|pages=409–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; land, air, energy, raw materials, and natural resources.
* Halting human-induced [[global warming]], which represents pollution, a threat to biodiversity, and a threat to human populations.
* Shifting from [[fossil fuels]] to [[renewable energy]] in electricity, heating and cooling, and transportation, which addresses pollution, global warming, and sustainability.  This may include [[public transportation]] and [[distributed generation]], which have benefits for traffic congestion and electric reliability.
* Establishment of [[nature reserve]]s for recreational purposes and ecosystem preservation.
* Sustainable and less polluting [[waste management]] including [[waste reduction]] (or even [[zero waste]]), [[reuse]], [[recycling]], [[composting]], [[waste-to-energy]], and [[anaerobic digestion]] of sewage sludge.

==Criticism==
In some cultures the term environment is meaningless because there is no separation between people and what they view as the natural world, or their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, Dale. (2007). The Heart of Environmentalism. In R. Sandler &amp; P. C. Pezzullo. Environmental Justice and Environmentalism. (pp. 85-101).

}}

'''Natural science''' is a [[Branches of science|branch of science]] concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of [[Phenomenon|natural phenomena]], based on [[empirical evidence]] from [[observation]] and [[experimentation]]. Mechanisms such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.

Natural science can be divided into two main branches: [[list of life sciences|life science]] (or biological science) and [[Outline of physical science|physical science]]. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]]. These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields).

In Western society's [[analytic tradition]], the empirical sciences and especially natural sciences use tools from [[formal science]]s, such as mathematics and logic, converting information about nature into measurements which can be explained as clear statements of the "[[laws of science|laws of nature]]". The [[social science]]s also use such methods, but rely more on [[qualitative research]], so that they are sometimes called "[[soft science]]", whereas natural sciences, insofar as they emphasize [[quantification (science)|quantifiable]] data produced, tested, and confirmed through the [[scientific method]], are sometimes called "[[hard science]]".{{sfn|Lagemaat|2006|p=283}}

Modern natural science succeeded more classical approaches to [[natural philosophy]], usually traced to [[ancient Greece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] debated the benefits of using approaches which were more [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, [[conjecture]]s, and [[presupposition]]s, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh G Gauch Jr, ''Scientific Method in Practice'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71#v=twopage pp 71–73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906160524/https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71 |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic data collection, including [[discovery science]], succeeded [[natural history]], which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.{{sfn|Oglivie|2008|pp=1–2}} Today, "natural history" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.&lt;ref name="Wordnet definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural History|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|publisher=Princeton University WordNet|accessdate=October 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303173506/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|archivedate=March 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
{{main|Philosophy of science}}
Philosophers of science have suggested a number of criteria, including [[Karl Popper]]'s controversial [[falsifiability]] criterion, to help them differentiate scientific endeavors from non-scientific ones. [[Validity (statistics)|Validity]], [[accuracy]], and [[quality control]], such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings, are amongst the most respected criteria in the present-day global scientific community.

{{Outline|Outline of natural science}}

===Biology===
{{Main|Biology|Outline of biology#Branches of biology}}
[[File:Wilson1900Fig2.jpg|thumb|Onion (''[[Allium]]'') cells in different phases of the cell cycle. Growth in an '[[organism]]' is carefully controlled by regulating the cell cycle.]]
This field encompasses a set of disciplines that examines phenomena related to living organisms. The scale of study can range from sub-component [[biophysics]] up to complex [[ecology|ecologies]]. Biology is concerned with the characteristics, [[scientific classification|classification]] and [[behaviors]] of [[organism]]s, as well as how [[species]] were formed and their interactions with each other and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

The biological fields of [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[medicine]] date back to early periods of civilization, while [[microbiology]] was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope. However, it was not until the 19th century that biology became a unified science. Once scientists discovered commonalities between all living things, it was decided they were best studied as a whole.

Some key developments in biology were the discovery of [[genetics]]; [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]]; the [[germ theory of disease]] and the application of the techniques of [[biochemistry|chemistry]] and [[biophysics|physics]] at the level of the [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[organic molecule]].

Modern biology is divided into subdisciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied. [[Molecular biology]] is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while [[cellular biology]] is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life. At a higher level, [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] looks at the internal structures, and their functions, of an organism, while [[ecology]] looks at how various organisms interrelate.

===Chemistry===
{{Main|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry#Branches of chemistry}}
[[File:Caffeine.svg|thumb|This [[structural formula]] for molecule [[caffeine]] shows a graphical representation of how the atoms are arranged.]]
Constituting the scientific study of matter at the [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] scale, chemistry deals primarily with collections of atoms, such as [[gas]]es, molecules, [[crystal]]s, and [[metal]]s. The composition, statistical properties, transformations and reactions of these materials are studied. Chemistry also involves understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms and molecules for use in larger-scale applications.

Most chemical processes can be studied directly in a laboratory, using a series of (often well-tested) techniques for manipulating materials, as well as an understanding of the underlying processes. Chemistry is often called "[[the central science]]" because of its role in connecting the other natural sciences.

Early experiments in chemistry had their roots in the system of [[Alchemy]], a set of beliefs combining mysticism with physical experiments. The science of chemistry began to develop with the work of [[Robert Boyle]], the discoverer of gas, and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], who developed the theory of the [[Conservation of mass]].

The [[Discoveries of the chemical elements|discovery of the chemical elements]] and [[atomic theory]] began to systematize this science, and researchers developed a fundamental understanding of [[State of matter|states of matter]], [[ion]]s, [[chemical bond]]s and [[chemical reaction]]s. The success of this science led to a complementary [[chemical industry]] that now plays a significant role in the world economy.

===Physics===
{{Main|Physics|Outline of physics#Branches of physics}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|The [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] are descriptions of the [[probability distribution]]s of an [[electron]] [[bound state|bound]] to a [[proton]]. Their mathematical descriptions are standard problems in [[quantum mechanics]], an important branch of physics.]]
Physics embodies the study of the fundamental constituents of the [[universe]], the [[forces]] and interactions they exert on one another, and the results produced by these interactions. In general, physics is regarded as the fundamental science, because all other natural sciences use and obey the principles and laws set down by the field. Physics relies heavily on [[mathematics]] as the logical framework for formulation and quantification of principles.

The study of the principles of the universe has a long history and largely derives from direct observation and experimentation. The formulation of theories about the governing laws of the universe has been central to the study of physics from very early on, with [[philosophy]] gradually yielding to systematic, quantitative experimental testing and observation as the source of verification. Key historical developments in physics include [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Law of universal gravitation|theory of universal gravitation]] and [[classical mechanics]], an understanding of [[electricity]] and its relation to [[magnetism]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theories of [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], the development of [[thermodynamics]], and the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] model of atomic and [[subatomic physics]].

The field of physics is extremely broad, and can include such diverse studies as [[quantum mechanics]] and [[theoretical physics]], [[applied physics]] and [[optics]]. Modern physics is becoming increasingly specialized, where researchers tend to focus on a particular area rather than being "universalists" like [[Isaac Newton]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Lev Landau]], who worked in multiple areas.

===Astronomy===
{{Main|Astronomy|Outline of astronomy#Branches of astronomy}}
[[File:Moon Dedal crater.jpg|thumb|Unmanned and manned spacecraft missions have been used to image distant locations within the [[Solar System]], such as this ''[[Apollo 11]]'' view of [[Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]].]]
This discipline is the science of [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] and [[phenomenon|phenomena]] that originate outside the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. It is concerned with the evolution, [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[meteorology]], and [[motion (physics)|motion]] of celestial objects, as well as the [[physical cosmology|formation and development of the universe]].

Astronomy includes the examination, study and modeling of [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and the [[cosmos]]. Most of the information used by astronomers is gathered by remote observation, although some laboratory reproduction of celestial phenomena has been performed (such as the molecular chemistry of the [[interstellar medium]]).

While the origins of the study of celestial features and phenomena can be traced back to antiquity, the scientific methodology of this field began to develop in the middle of the 17th century. A key factor was [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s introduction of the telescope to examine the night sky in more detail.

The mathematical treatment of astronomy began with [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s development of [[celestial mechanics]] and the laws of [[gravitation]], although it was triggered by earlier work of astronomers such as [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. By the 19th century, astronomy had developed into a formal science, with the introduction of instruments such as the [[spectroscope]] and [[photography]], along with much-improved telescopes and the creation of professional observatories.

===Earth science===
{{Main article|Earth science|Outline of Earth sciences#Branches of Earth science}}
Earth science (also known as geoscience), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet [[Earth (planet)|Earth]], including [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[physical geography]], [[oceanography]], and [[soil science]].

Although [[mining]] and [[gemology|precious stones]] have been human interests throughout the history of civilization, the development of the related sciences of [[economic geology]] and [[mineralogy]] did not occur until the 18th century. The study of the earth, particularly [[palaeontology]], blossomed in the 19th century. The growth of other disciplines, such as [[geophysics]], in the 20th century led to the development of the theory of [[plate tectonic]]s in the 1960s, which has had a similar effect on the Earth sciences as the theory of evolution had on biology. Earth sciences today are closely linked to [[petroleum]] and [[mineral resource]]s, [[climate]] research and to [[environmental assessment]] and [[environmental remediation|remediation]].

====Atmospheric sciences====
{{Main article|Atmospheric sciences}}
Though sometimes considered in conjunction with the earth sciences, due to the independent development of its concepts, techniques and practices and also the fact of it having a wide range of sub disciplines under its wing, the [[atmospheric sciences]] is also considered a separate branch of natural science. This field studies the characteristics of different layers of the atmosphere from ground level to the edge of the time. The timescale of study also varies from days to centuries. Sometimes the field also includes the study of climatic patterns on planets other than earth.

====Oceanography====
{{Main article|Oceanography}}
The serious study of oceans began in the early to mid-20th century. As a field of natural science, it is relatively young but stand-alone programs offer specializations in the subject. Though some controversies remain as to the categorization of the field under earth sciences, interdisciplinary sciences or as a separate field in its own right, most modern workers in the field agree that it has matured to a state that it has its own paradigms and practices. As such a big family of related studies spanning every aspect of the oceans is now classified under this field.

==Interdisciplinary studies==
The distinctions between the natural science disciplines are not always sharp, and they share a number of cross-discipline fields. Physics plays a significant role in the other natural sciences, as represented by [[astrophysics]], [[geophysics]], [[chemical physics]] and [[biophysics]]. Likewise chemistry is represented by such fields as [[biochemistry]], [[chemical biology]], [[geochemistry]] and [[astrochemistry]].

A particular example of a scientific discipline that draws upon multiple natural sciences is [[environmental science]]. This field studies the interactions of physical, chemical, geological, and [[biological components]] of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], with a particular regard to the effect of human activities and the impact on [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. This science also draws upon expertise from other fields such as economics, law and social sciences.

A comparable discipline is [[oceanography]], as it draws upon a similar breadth of scientific disciplines. Oceanography is sub-categorized into more specialized cross-disciplines, such as [[physical oceanography]] and [[marine biology]]. As the [[marine ecosystem]] is very large and diverse, marine biology is further divided into many subfields, including specializations in particular [[species]].

There are also a subset of cross-disciplinary fields which, by the nature of the problems that they address, have strong currents that run counter to
specialization. Put another way: In some fields of integrative application, specialists in more than one field are a key part of most dialog. Such integrative fields, for example, include [[nanoscience]], [[astrobiology]], and [[complex system]] [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]].

===Materials science===
{{Main|Materials science}}
[[File:Materials science tetrahedron;structure, processing, performance, and proprerties.svg|thumb|The materials paradigm represented as a tetrahedron]]
Materials science is a relatively new, interdisciplinary field which deals with the study of [[matter]] and its properties; as well as the discovery and design of new materials. Originally developed through the field of [[metallurgy]], the study of the properties of materials and solids has now expanded into all materials. The field covers the chemistry, physics and engineering applications of materials including metals, ceramics, artificial polymers, and many others. The core of the field deals with relating structure of material with it properties.

It is at the forefront of research in science and engineering. It is an important part of [[forensic engineering]] (the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property) and [[failure analysis]], the latter being the key to understanding, for example, the cause of various aviation accidents. Many of the most pressing scientific problems that are faced today are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and, as a result, breakthroughs in this field are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology.

The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their [[property|properties]]. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a certain application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], govern a material's [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.

==History==
{{See also|Natural philosophy|History of science}}

Some scholars trace the origins of natural science as far back as pre-literate human societies, where understanding the natural world was necessary for survival.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} People observed and built up knowledge about the behavior of animals and the usefulness of plants as food and medicine, which was passed down from generation to generation.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} These primitive understandings gave way to more formalized inquiry around 3500 to 3000 BC in the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt]]ian cultures, which produced the first known written evidence of [[natural philosophy]], the precursor of natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=2}} While the writings show an interest in astronomy, mathematics and other aspects of the physical world, the ultimate aim of inquiry about nature's workings was in all cases religious or mythological, not scientific.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=2–3}}

A tradition of scientific inquiry also emerged in [[Ancient China]], where [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] and philosophers experimented with elixirs to [[life extension|extend life]] and cure ailments.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=3}} They focused on the [[yin and yang]], or contrasting elements in nature; the yin was associated with femininity and coldness, while yang was associated with masculinity and warmth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|pp=3–4}} The five phases – fire, earth, metal, wood and water – described a cycle of transformations in nature. Water turned into wood, which turned into fire when it burned. The ashes left by fire were earth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=4}} Using these principles, Chinese philosophers and doctors explored human anatomy, characterizing organs as predominantly yin or yang and understood the relationship between the pulse, the heart and the flow of blood in the body centuries before it became accepted in the West.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

Little evidence survives of how [[Ancient India]]n cultures around the [[Indus River]] understood nature, but some of their perspectives may be reflected in the [[Vedas]], a set of sacred [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} They reveal a conception of the universe as ever-expanding and constantly being recycled and reformed.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Surgeons in the [[Ayurvedic]] tradition saw health and illness as a combination of three humors: [[wind]], [[bile]] and [[phlegm]].{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} A healthy life was the result of a balance among these humors.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} In Ayurvedic thought, the body consisted of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind and empty space.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Ayurvedic surgeons performed complex surgeries and developed a detailed understanding of human anatomy.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

[[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] philosophers in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] culture brought natural philosophy a step closer to direct inquiry about cause and effect in nature between 600 and 400 BC, although an element of magic and mythology remained.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} Natural phenomena such as earthquakes and eclipses were explained increasingly in the context of nature itself instead of being attributed to angry gods.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]], an early philosopher who lived from 625 to 546 BC, explained earthquakes by theorizing that the world floated on water and that water was the fundamental element in nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=2}} In the 5th century BC, [[Leucippus]] was an early exponent of [[atomism]], the idea that the world is made up of fundamental indivisible particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}} [[Pythagoras]] applied Greek innovations in mathematics to astronomy, and suggested that the earth was [[sphere|spherical]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}}

===Aristotelian natural philosophy (400 BC–1100 AD)===
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Aristotle's view of inheritance, as a model of the transmission of patterns of movement of the body fluids from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|Aristotelian form]] from the father.]]
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

Later [[Socrates|Socratic]] and [[Plato]]nic thought focused on ethics, morals and art and did not attempt an investigation of the physical world; Plato criticized pre-Socratic thinkers as materialists and anti-religionists.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=21–22}} [[Aristotle]], however, a student of Plato who lived from 384 to 322 BC, paid closer attention to the natural world in his philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=27–28}} In his ''[[History of Animals]]'', he described the inner workings of 110 species, including the [[stingray]], [[catfish]] and [[bee]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=33–34}} He investigated chick embryos by breaking open eggs and observing them at various stages of development.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=34}} Aristotle's works were influential through the 16th century, and he is considered to be the [[Aristotle's biology|father of biology for his pioneering work in that science]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=34–35}} He also presented philosophies about physics, nature and astronomy using [[inductive reasoning]] in his works ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=37–39, 53}}

[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato (left) and Aristotle in [[The School of Athens|a 1509 painting]] by [[Raphael]]. Plato rejected inquiry into natural philosophy as against religion, while his student, Aristotle, created a body of work on the natural world that influenced generations of scholars.]]

While Aristotle considered natural philosophy more seriously than his predecessors, he approached it as a theoretical branch of science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=52}} Still, inspired by his work, [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]]  philosophers of the early 1st century AD, including [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], wrote treatises that dealt with the rules of the natural world in varying degrees of depth.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=95}} Many [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] of the 3rd to the 6th centuries also adapted Aristotle's teachings on the physical world to a philosophy that emphasized spiritualism.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=54, 59}} Early [[medieval]] philosophers including [[Macrobius]], [[Calcidius]] and [[Martianus Capella]] also examined the physical world, largely from a cosmological and [[cosmography|cosmographical]] perspective, putting forth theories on the arrangement of celestial bodies and the heavens, which were posited as being composed of [[aether (classical element)|aether]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=103}}

Aristotle's works on natural philosophy continued to be translated and studied amid the rise of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=61–66}} 

In the Byzantine Empire [[John Philoponus]], an Alexandrian Aristotelian commentator and Christian theologian, was the first who questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics. Unlike Aristotle who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus instead relied on observation, and argued for observation rather than resorting into verbal argument.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepages.wmich.edu/~mcgrew/philfall.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the [[theory of impetus]]. John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as inspiration for Galileo Galilei during the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/philoponus/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Christian|last=Wildberg|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=8 March 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''. University of Chicago Press. Page 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

A revival in mathematics and science took place during the time of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] from the 9th century onward, when Muslim scholars expanded upon Greek and [[India]]n natural philosophy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=11}} The words ''[[alcohol]]'', ''[[algebra]]'' and ''[[zenith]]'' all have [[Arabic]] roots.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=11–12}}

===Medieval natural philosophy (1100–1600)===
{{also|Renaissance of the 12th century}}
Aristotle's works and other Greek natural philosophy did not reach the West until about the middle of the 12th century, when works were translated from [[Greek people|Greek]] and Arabic into [[Latin]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=95, 130}} The development of European civilization later in the Middle Ages brought with it further advances in natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=106}} European inventions such as the [[horseshoe]], [[horse collar]] and [[crop rotation]] allowed for rapid population growth, eventually giving way to urbanization and the foundation of schools connected to monasteries and cathedrals in modern-day [[France]] and [[England]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=106–107}} Aided by the schools, an approach to Christian [[theology]] developed that sought to answer questions about nature and other subjects using logic.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} This approach, however, was seen by some detractors as [[heresy]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} By the 12th century, Western European scholars and philosophers came into contact with a body of knowledge of which they had previously been ignorant: a large corpus of works in Greek and Arabic that were preserved by Islamic scholars.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} Through translation into Latin, Western Europe was introduced to Aristotle and his natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} These works were taught at new universities in [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]] by the early 13th century, although the practice was frowned upon by the Catholic church.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}} A 1210 decree from the [[Synod]] of Paris ordered that "no lectures are to be held in Paris either publicly or privately using Aristotle's books on natural philosophy or the commentaries, and we forbid all this under pain of excommunication."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}}

In the late Middle Ages, [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]] translated a treatise by the earlier Persian scholar [[Al-Farabi]] called ''On the Sciences'' into Latin, calling the study of the mechanics of nature ''scientia naturalis'', or natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus also proposed his own classification of the natural sciences in his 1150 work ''On the Division of Philosophy''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} This was the first detailed classification of the sciences based on Greek and Arab philosophy to reach Western Europe.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus defined natural science as "the science considering only things unabstracted and with motion," as opposed to mathematics and sciences that rely on mathematics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}} Following Al-Farabi, he then separated the sciences into eight parts, including physics, cosmology, meteorology, minerals science and plant and animal science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}}

Later philosophers made their own classifications of the natural sciences. [[Robert Kilwardby]] wrote ''On the Order of the Sciences'' in the 13th century that classed medicine as a mechanical science, along with agriculture, hunting and theater while defining natural science as the science that deals with bodies in motion.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=156–157}} [[Roger Bacon]], an English friar and philosopher, wrote that natural science dealt with "a principle of motion and rest, as in the parts of the elements of fire, air, earth and water, and in all inanimate things made from them."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} These sciences also covered plants, animals and celestial bodies.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} Later in the 13th century, Catholic priest and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined natural science as dealing with "mobile beings" and  "things which depend on matter not only for their existence, but also for their definition."{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=159–163}} There was wide agreement among scholars in medieval times that natural science was about bodies in motion, although there was division about the inclusion of fields including medicine, music and perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=234}} Philosophers pondered questions including the existence of a vacuum, whether motion could produce heat, the colors of rainbows, the motion of the earth, whether elemental chemicals exist and where in the atmosphere rain is formed.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=236–237}}

In the centuries up through the end of the Middle Ages, natural science was often mingled with philosophies about magic and the occult.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=170–178}} Natural philosophy appeared in a wide range of forms, from treatises to encyclopedias to commentaries on Aristotle.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=189–190}} The interaction between natural philosophy and [[Christianity]] was complex during this period; some early theologians, including [[Tatian]] and [[Eusebius]], considered natural philosophy an outcropping of pagan Greek science and were suspicious of it.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=239–240}} Although some later Christian philosophers, including Aquinas, came to see natural science as a means of interpreting scripture, this suspicion persisted until the 12th and 13th centuries.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=241–243}} The [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|Condemnation of 1277]], which forbade setting philosophy on a level equal with theology and the debate of religious constructs in a scientific context, showed the persistence with which Catholic leaders resisted the development of natural philosophy even from a theological perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=246–247}} Aquinas and [[Albertus Magnus]], another Catholic theologian of the era, sought to distance theology from science in their works.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=251}} "I don't see what one's interpretation of Aristotle has to do with the teaching of the faith," he wrote in 1271.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=252}}

===Newton and the scientific revolution (1600–1800)===
By the 16th and 17th centuries, natural philosophy underwent an evolution beyond commentary on Aristotle as more early Greek philosophy was uncovered and translated.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} The invention of the printing press in the 15th century, the invention of the microscope and telescope, and the [[Protestant Reformation]] fundamentally altered the social context in which scientific inquiry evolved in the West.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} [[Christopher Columbus]]'s discovery of a new world changed perceptions about the physical makeup of the world, while observations by [[Copernicus]], [[Tyco Brahe]] and [[Galileo]] brought a more accurate picture of the solar system as [[heliocentric]] and proved many of Aristotle's theories about the heavenly bodies false.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274–275}} A number of 17th-century philosophers, including [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Francis Bacon]] made a break from the past by rejecting Aristotle and his medieval followers outright, calling their approach to natural philosophy as superficial.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=276–277}}

The titles of Galileo's work ''Two New Sciences'' and [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''New Astronomy'' underscored the atmosphere of change that took hold in the 17th century as Aristotle was dismissed in favor of novel methods of inquiry into the natural world.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon was instrumental in popularizing this change; he argued that people should use the arts and sciences to gain dominion over nature.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=278–279}} To achieve this, he wrote that "human life [must] be endowed with new discoveries and powers."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} He defined natural philosophy as "the knowledge of Causes and secret motions of things; and enlarging the bounds of Human Empire, to the effecting of all things possible."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon proposed scientific inquiry supported by the state and fed by the collaborative research of scientists, a vision that was unprecedented in its scope, ambition and form at the time.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} Natural philosophers came to view nature increasingly as a mechanism that could be taken apart and understood, much like a complex clock.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–285}} Natural philosophers including [[Isaac Newton]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and [[Francesco Redi]] conducted experiments focusing on the flow of water, measuring [[atmospheric pressure]] using a [[barometer]] and disproving [[spontaneous generation]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–290}} Scientific societies and scientific journals emerged and were spread widely through the printing press, touching off the [[scientific revolution]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–295}} Newton in 1687 published his ''The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'', or ''Principia Mathematica'', which set the groundwork for physical laws that remained current until the 19th century.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=304–306}}

Some modern scholars, including Andrew Cunningham, Perry Williams and [[Floris Cohen]], argue that natural philosophy is not properly called a science, and that genuine scientific inquiry began only with the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} According to Cohen, "the emancipation of science from an overarching entity called 'natural philosophy' is one defining characteristic of the Scientific Revolution."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Other historians of science, including [[Edward Grant]], contend that the scientific revolution that blossomed in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries occurred when principles learned in the exact sciences of optics, mechanics and astronomy began to be applied to questions raised by natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Grant argues that Newton attempted to expose the mathematical basis of nature – the immutable rules it obeyed – and in doing so joined natural philosophy and mathematics for the first time, producing an early work of modern physics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=317–318}}

[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton]] is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time.]]
The scientific revolution, which began to take hold in the 17th century, represented a sharp break from Aristotelian modes of inquiry.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}} One of its principal advances was the use of the [[scientific method]] to investigate nature. Data was collected and [[repeatability|repeatable]] measurements made in [[experiment]]s.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=26–27}} Scientists then formed [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain the results of these experiments.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The hypothesis was then tested using the principle of [[falsifiability]] to prove or disprove its accuracy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The natural sciences continued to be called natural philosophy, but the adoption of the scientific method took science beyond the realm of philosophical conjecture and introduced a more structured way of examining nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}}

Newton, an English mathematician and physicist, was the seminal figure in the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=33}} Drawing on advances made in astronomy by Copernicus, Brahe and Kepler, Newton derived the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal law of gravitation]] and [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=33–35}} These laws applied both on earth and in outer space, uniting two spheres of the physical world previously thought to function independently of each other, according to separate physical rules.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=35}} Newton, for example, showed that the [[tide]]s were caused by the gravitational pull of the [[moon]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=36}} Another of Newton's advances was to make mathematics a powerful explanatory tool for natural phenomena.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}} While natural philosophers had long used mathematics as a means of measurement and analysis, its principles were not used as a means of understanding cause and effect in nature until Newton.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}}

In the 18th century and 19th century, scientists including [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], [[Alessandro Volta]], and [[Michael Faraday]] built upon Newtonian mechanics by exploring [[electromagnetism]], or the interplay of forces with positive and negative charges on [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Faraday proposed that forces in nature operated in "[[Field (physics)|fields]]" that filled space.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} The idea of fields contrasted with the Newtonian construct of gravitation as simply "action at a distance", or the attraction of objects with nothing in the space between them to intervene.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in the 19th century unified these discoveries in a coherent [[Maxwell's equations|theory of electrodynamics]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Using mathematical equations and experimentation, Maxwell discovered that space was filled with charged particles that could act upon themselves and each other, and that they were a medium for the transmission of charged waves.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}}

Significant advances in chemistry also took place during the scientific revolution. [[Antoine Lavoisier]], a French chemist, refuted the [[phlogiston theory]], which posited that things burned by releasing "phlogiston" into the air.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[Joseph Priestley]] had discovered [[oxygen]] in the 18th century, but Lavoisier discovered that [[combustion]] was the result of [[oxidation]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} He also constructed a table of 33 elements and invented modern chemical nomenclature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} Formal biological science remained in its infancy in the 18th century, when the focus lay upon the [[Scientific classification|classification and categorization]] of natural life. This growth in [[natural history]] was led by [[Carl Linnaeus]], whose 1735 [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the natural world is still in use. Linnaeus in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|pp=171–179}}

===19th-century developments (1800–1900)===
[[File:Michelson-Morley experiment (en).svg|thumb|The [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] was used to disprove that light propagated through a [[luminiferous aether]]. This 19th-century concept was then superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]].]]

By the 19th century, the study of science had come into the purview of professionals and institutions. In so doing, it gradually acquired the more modern name of ''natural science.'' The term ''scientist'' was coined by [[William Whewell]] in an 1834 review of [[Mary Somerville]]'s ''On the Connexion of the Sciences''.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite book |last1= Holmes|first1= R|title= The age of wonder: How the romantic generation discovered the beauty and terror of science|edition= |date= 2008|publisher= Harper Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0-00-714953-7|page= 449}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the word did not enter general use until nearly the end of the same century.

===Modern natural science (1900–present)===
According to a famous 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by the American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and the American physical chemist [[Merle Randall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances |first1=Gilbert N. |last1=Lewis |first2=Merle |last2=Randall |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |edition=First |others=later Printing edition |date=1923 |asin= B000GSLHZS}}&lt;/ref&gt; the natural sciences contain three great branches:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aside from the logical and mathematical sciences, there are three great branches of ''natural science'' which stand apart by reason of the variety of far reaching deductions drawn from a small number of primary postulates — they are [[mechanics]], [[electrodynamics]], and [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huggins|first=Robert A.|title=Energy storage|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-1023-3|edition=Online-Ausg. |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, natural sciences are more commonly divided into life sciences, such as botany and zoology; and physical sciences, which include physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy and materials science.

The primary candidates for non-cellular life are viruses. A minority of biologists consider viruses to be living [[organism]]s, but most do not.

Engineers sometimes use the term "[[artificial life]]" to refer to [[software]] and [[robot]]s inspired by biological processes, but these do not satisfy any biological definition of life.

== Viruses as non-cellular life ==
{{Life timeline}}{{Further|Virus|Girus|Viral evolution}}
The nature of viruses was unclear for many years following their discovery as [[pathogen]]s. They were described as [[poison]]s or [[toxin]]s at first, then as "infectious proteins", but with advances in microbiology it became clear that they also possessed [[genetic material]], a defined structure, and the ability to spontaneously assemble from their constituent parts. This spurred extensive debate as to whether they should be regarded as fundamentally organic or inorganic — as very small biological [[organism]]s or very large biochemical [[molecule]]s — and since the 1950s many scientists have thought of viruses as existing at the border between chemistry and life; a gray area between living and nonliving.&lt;ref name="Villarreal 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forterre 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lwoff|first=A.|date=1957-01-01|title=The Concept of Virus|url=http://mic.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/00221287-17-2-239;jsessionid=j7YU0LkUikNMC-na5q7Hg5R8.x-sgm-live-02|journal=Microbiology|volume=17|issue=2|pages=239–253|doi=10.1099/00221287-17-2-239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent discovery of [[giant viruses]] (aka giruses, [[nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses]], NCLDVs) has reignited this debate, since they are not only physically larger than previously known viruses, but also possess much more extensive [[genome]]s, including [[gene]]s coding for [[aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]]s, key proteins involved in [[Translation (biology)|translation]], which were previously thought to be exclusive to cellular organisms. This raises the prospect that the giant viruses may have had extinct ancestors (or even undiscovered ones) capable of engaging in life processes (such as [[evolution]] and [[Self-replication|replication]]) independent of cells, and that modern viruses lost those abilities [[Secondary loss|secondarily]]. The viral lineage including this ancestor would be ancient and may have originated alongside the earliest [[archaea]] or before the [[Last universal common ancestor|LUCA]]. If such a virus is discovered, or its past existence supported by further genetic evidence, most biologists agree that it would constitute a ''bona fide'' lifeform, and its descendants (at least the giant viruses, and possibly including all known viruses) could be [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] classified in a fourth [[Domain (biology)|domain]] of life. Discovery of the [[pandoravirus]]es, with genomes are even larger than the other giant viruses and exhibiting particularly low [[Homology (biology)|homology]] with the three existing domains, further discredited the traditional view that viruses simply "pick-pocketed" all of their genes from cellular organisms, and further supported the "complex ancestors" hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Villarreal 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/science/changing-view-on-viruses-not-so-small-after-all.html|title=Changing View on Viruses: Not So Small After All|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|date=2013-07-18|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nasir|first=Arshan|last2=Kim|first2=Kyung Mo|last3=Caetano-Anolles|first3=Gustavo|date=2012-08-24|title=Giant viruses coexisted with the cellular ancestors and represent a distinct supergroup along with superkingdoms Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=12|pages=156|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-12-156|issn=1471-2148|pmc=3570343|pmid=22920653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Viroids ==
{{Main|Viroid}}
Viroids are the smallest infectious pathogens known to biologists, consisting solely of short strands of circular, single-stranded RNA without protein coats. They are mostly plant pathogens and some are animal pathogens, from which some are of commercial importance. Viroid genomes are extremely small in size, ranging from 246 to 467 nucleobases. In comparison, the genome of the smallest known viruses capable of causing an infection by themselves are around 2,000 nucleobases in size. Viroids are the first known representatives of a new biological realm of sub-viral pathogens.&lt;ref name="pmid5095900"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diener TO | title = Potato spindle tuber "virus".

[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that planets with complex life, like [[Earth]], are exceptionally rare]]
In [[planetary astronomy]] and [[astrobiology]], the '''Rare Earth hypothesis''' argues that the [[origin of life]] and the [[evolution of biological complexity]] such as [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]], [[multicellular organism]]s on [[Earth]] (and, subsequently, [[human intelligence]]) required an improbable combination of [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] and [[geology|geological]] events and circumstances.

According to the hypothesis, complex [[extraterrestrial life]] is an improbable phenomenon and likely to be rare. The term "Rare Earth" originates from ''[[Rare Earth (book)|Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe]]'' (2000), a book by [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]], a geologist and paleontologist, and [[Donald E. Brownlee]], an astronomer and astrobiologist, both faculty members at the [[University of Washington]].

A contrary view was argued in the 1970s and 1980s by [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Frank Drake]], among others. It holds that Earth is a typical [[Terrestrial planet|rocky planet]] in a typical [[planetary system]], located in a non-exceptional region of a common [[barred-spiral galaxy]]. Given the [[principle of mediocrity]] (in the same vein as the [[Copernican principle]]), it is probable that we are typical, and the universe teems with complex life. However, Ward and Brownlee argue that planets, planetary systems, and galactic regions that are as friendly to complex life as the Earth, the [[Solar System]], and our [[Milky Way|galactic]] region are rare.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Requirements for complex life==
{{Life timeline}}
The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the [[evolution of biological complexity]] requires a host of fortuitous circumstances, such as a [[galactic habitable zone]], a central star and planetary system having the requisite character, the [[circumstellar habitable zone]], a right-sized terrestrial planet, the advantage of a gas giant guardian like Jupiter and a large [[natural satellite]], conditions needed to ensure the planet has a [[magnetosphere]] and [[plate tectonics]], the chemistry of the [[lithosphere]], [[atmosphere]], and oceans, the role of "evolutionary pumps" such as massive [[glaciation]] and rare [[Meteoroid#Bolide|bolide]] impacts, and whatever led to the appearance of the [[eukaryote]] [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[sexual reproduction]] and the [[Cambrian explosion]] of [[animal]], [[plant]], and [[fungi]] [[phylum|phyla]]. The [[evolution of human intelligence]] may have required yet further events, which are extremely unlikely to have happened were it not for the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] 66 million years ago removing [[dinosaurs]] as the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s.

In order for a small rocky planet to support complex life, Ward and Brownlee argue, the values of several variables must fall within narrow ranges. The [[universe]] is so vast that it could contain many Earth-like planets. But if such planets exist, they are likely to be separated from each other by many thousands of [[light year]]s. Such distances may preclude communication among any intelligent species evolving on such planets, which would solve the [[Fermi paradox]]: "If extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious?"&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Webb|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The right location in the right kind of galaxy===
''Rare Earth'' suggests that much of the known universe, including large parts of our galaxy, are "dead zones" unable to support complex life. Those parts of a galaxy where complex life is possible make up the [[galactic habitable zone]], primarily characterized by distance from the [[Galactic Center]]. As that distance increases:
# Star [[metallicity]] declines. Metals (which in astronomy means all elements other than hydrogen and helium) are necessary to the formation of [[terrestrial planets]].
# The [[X-ray]] and [[gamma ray]] radiation from the [[Supermassive black hole|black hole]] at the galactic center, and from nearby [[neutron star]]s, becomes less intense. Thus the early universe, and present-day galactic regions where stellar density is high and [[supernova]]e are common, will be dead zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Gravitational perturbation of planets and [[planetesimals]] by nearby stars becomes less likely as the density of stars decreases. Hence the further a planet lies from the Galactic Center or a spiral arm, the less likely it is to be struck by a large [[Meteoroid#Bolide|bolide]] which could [[extinction|extinguish]] all complex life on a planet.

Item #1 rules out the outer reaches of a galaxy; #2 and #3 rule out galactic inner regions. Hence a galaxy's habitable zone may be a ring sandwiched between its uninhabitable center and outer reaches.

Also, a habitable planetary system must maintain its favorable location long enough for complex life to evolve. A star with an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] (elliptic or hyperbolic) galactic orbit will pass through some spiral arms, unfavorable regions of high star density; thus a life-bearing star must have a galactic orbit that is nearly circular, with a close synchronization between the orbital velocity of the star and of the spiral arms. This further restricts the galactic habitable zone within a fairly narrow range of distances from the Galactic Center.

Approximately 77% of observed galaxies are spiral,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Loveday, J. |date=February 1996 |title=The APM Bright Galaxy Catalogue |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=278 |issue=4 |pages=1025–1048 |bibcode=1996MNRAS.278.1025L |arxiv=astro-ph/9603040 |doi=10.1093/mnras/278.4.1025}}&lt;/ref&gt; two-thirds of all spiral galaxies are barred, and more than half, like the Milky Way, exhibit multiple arms.&lt;ref name="mihalas1968"&gt;{{Cite book |author=D.

Our galaxy also appears unusually favorable in suffering fewer collisions with other galaxies over the last 10 billion years, which can cause more supernovae and other disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sibling Rivalry |date=31 March 2012 |work=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328586.500-milky-way-mysteries-andromeda-our-sibling-rival.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Milky Way's central [[black hole]] seems to have neither too much nor too little activity.&lt;ref&gt;Scharf, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The orbit of the Sun around the center of the Milky Way is indeed almost perfectly circular, with [[Galactic year|a period of 226 Ma]] (million years), closely matching the rotational period of the galaxy. However, the majority of stars in barred spiral galaxies populate the spiral arms rather than the halo and tend to move in [[gravitationally aligned orbits]], so there is little that is unusual about the Sun's orbit. While the Rare Earth hypothesis predicts that the Sun should rarely, if ever, have passed through a spiral arm since its formation, astronomer Karen Masters has calculated that the orbit of the Sun takes it through a major spiral arm approximately every 100 million years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/physics/55-our-solar-system/the-sun/the-sun-in-the-milky-way/207-how-often-does-the-sun-pass-through-a-spiral-arm-in-the-milky-way-intermediate How often does the Sun pass through a spiral arm in the Milky Way?], Karen Masters, ''Curious About Astronomy''&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have suggested that several mass extinctions do correspond with previous crossings of the spiral arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dartnell|2007|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbiting at the right distance from the right type of star===
[[File:Estimated extent of the Solar Systems habitable zone.png|thumb|According to the hypothesis, Earth has an improbable orbit in the very narrow habitable zone (dark green) around the Sun.]]
The terrestrial example suggests that complex life requires liquid water, requiring an orbital distance neither too close nor too far from the central star, another scale of [[habitable zone]] or [[Goldilocks Principle]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hart, M.H. |title=Habitable Zones Around Main Sequence Stars |journal=Icarus |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=351–7 |date=January 1979 |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(79)90141-6 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103579901416 |bibcode=1979Icar...37..351H}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The habitable zone varies with the star's type and age.

For advanced life, the star must also be highly stable, which is typical of middle star life, about 4.6 billion years old. Proper [[metallicity]] and size are also important to stability. The Sun has a low 0.1% [[solar luminosity|luminosity]] variation. To date no [[Solar analog#Solar twin|solar twin]] star twin, with an exact match of the sun's luminosity variation, has been found, though some come close. The star must have no stellar companions, as in [[Binary star|binary systems]], which would disrupt the orbits of planets. Estimates suggest 50% or more of all star systems are binary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/08jan_sunclimate/ NASA, Science News, Solar Variability and Terrestrial Climate, 8 January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="astro.unl.edu"&gt;[http://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/stellarprops/stellarlum.html University of Nebraska-Lincoln astronomy education group, Stellar Luminosity Calculator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nap.edu"&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/catalog/13519/the-effects-of-solar-variability-on-earths-climate-a-workshop National Center for Atmospheric Research, The Effects of Solar Variability on Earth's Climate, 2012 Report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2013/06/05/most-of-earths-twins-arent-identical-or-even-close/ Most of Earth’s twins aren’t identical, or even close!, by Ethan on 5 June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The habitable zone for a main sequence star very gradually moves out over its lifespan until it becomes a white dwarf and the habitable zone vanishes.

The liquid water and other gases available in the habitable zone bring the benefit of [[Greenhouse effect|greenhouse warming]]. Even though the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] contains a water vapor concentration from 0% (in arid regions) to 4% (in rain forest and ocean regions) and – as of February 2018 – only 408.05{{cn|date=February 2018}} parts per million of {{CO2}}, these small amounts suffice to raise the average surface temperature by about 40&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the dominant contribution being due to water vapor, which together with clouds makes up between 66% and 85% of Earth's greenhouse effect, with {{CO2}} contributing between 9% and 26% of the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gavin |last=Schmidt |title=Water vapour: feedback or forcing? |date=6 April 2005 |publisher=RealClimate |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/04/water-vapour-feedback-or-forcing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocky planets must orbit within the habitable zone for life to form. Although the habitable zone of such hot stars as [[Sirius]] or [[Vega]] is wide, hot stars also emit much more [[ultraviolet radiation]] that [[ionize]]s any planetary [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]]. They may become [[red giant]]s before advanced life [[Evolution|evolve]]s on their planets.
These considerations rule out the massive and powerful stars of type F6 to O (see [[stellar classification]]) as homes to evolved [[metazoan life]].

Small [[red dwarf]] stars conversely have small [[habitable zone]]s wherein planets are in [[tidal lock]], with one very hot side always facing the star and another very cold side; and they are also at increased risk of solar flares (see [[Aurelia and Blue Moon#Aurelia|Aurelia]]). Life therefore cannot arise in such systems. Rare Earth proponents claim that only stars from F7 to K1 types are hospitable. Such stars are rare: G type stars such as the Sun (between the hotter F and cooler K) comprise only 9%&lt;ref name="RECONS1"&gt;[http://joy.chara.gsu.edu/RECONS/TOP100.posted.htm] The One Hundred Nearest Star Systems, Research Consortium on Nearby Stars.&lt;/ref&gt; of the hydrogen-burning stars in the Milky Way.

Such aged stars as [[red giant]]s and [[white dwarf]]s are also unlikely to support life. Red giants are common in globular clusters and [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]. White dwarfs are mostly dying stars that have already completed their red giant phase. Stars that become red giants expand into or overheat the habitable zones of their youth and middle age (though theoretically planets at a much greater distance [[Red giant#Prospects for habitability|may become habitable]]).

An energy output that varies with the lifetime of the star will likely prevent life (e.g., as [[Cepheid variable]]s). A sudden decrease, even if brief, may freeze the water of orbiting planets, and a significant increase may evaporate it and cause a [[greenhouse effect]] that prevents the oceans from reforming.

All known life requires the complex chemistry of [[metallicity|metallic]] elements. The [[absorption spectrum]] of a star reveals the presence of metals within, and studies of stellar spectra reveal that many, perhaps most, stars are poor in metals. Because heavy metals originate in [[supernova]] explosions, metallicity increases in the universe over time. Low metallicity characterizes the early universe: globular clusters and other stars that formed when the universe was young, stars in most galaxies other than large [[spiral galaxy|spirals]], and stars in the outer regions of all galaxies. Metal-rich central stars capable of supporting complex life are therefore believed to be most common in the quiet suburbs{{vague|date=March 2017}} of the larger spiral galaxies—where radiation also happens to be weak.&lt;ref name="Ward 2000 15–33"&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=15–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the right arrangement of planets===
[[File:Planets2013.jpg|right|thumb|Depiction of the Sun and planets of the Solar System and the sequence of planets. Rare Earth argues that without such an arrangement, in particular the presence of the massive gas giant Jupiter (fifth planet from the Sun and the largest), complex life on Earth would not have arisen.]]
Rare Earth proponents argue that a planetary system capable of sustaining complex life must be structured more or less like the Solar System, with small and rocky inner planets and outer gas giants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/08/070827-jupiter-comets_2.html |first=Anne |last=Minard |date=27 August 2007 |title=Jupiter Both an Impact Source and Shield for Earth |accessdate=14 January 2014 |quote=without the long, peaceful periods offered by Jupiter's shield, intelligent life on Earth would never have been able to take hold.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the protection of 'celestial vacuum cleaner' planets with strong gravitational pull, a planet would be subject to more catastrophic asteroid collisions.

Observations of exo-planets have shown that arrangements of planets similar to our Solar System are rare. Most planetary systems have super Earths, several times larger than Earth, close to their star, whereas our Solar System's inner region has only a few small rocky planets and none inside Mercury's orbit. Only 10% of stars have giant planets similar to Jupiter and Saturn, and those few rarely have stable nearly circular orbits distant from their star. [[Konstantin Batygin]] and colleagues argue that these features can be explained if, early in the history of the Solar System, Jupiter and Saturn drifted towards the Sun, sending showers of planetesimals towards the super-Earths which sent them spiralling into the Sun, and ferrying icy building blocks into the terrestrial region of the Solar System which provided the building blocks for the rocky planets. The two giant planets then drifted out again to their present position. However, in the view of Batygin and his colleagues: "The concatenation of chance events required for this delicate choreography suggest that small, Earth-like rocky planets – and perhaps life itself – could be rare throughout the cosmos."&lt;ref&gt;Batygin et al., pp. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===A continuously stable orbit===
Rare Earth argues that a gas giant must not be too close to a body where life is developing. Close placement of gas giant(s) could disrupt the orbit of a potential life-bearing planet, either directly or by drifting into the habitable zone.

Newtonian dynamics can produce [[n-body problem#Three-body problem|chaotic planetary orbits]], especially in a system having [[Jovian planets|large planets]] at high [[orbital eccentricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.astro.ku.dk/~tobiash/posters/Tobias_final_new.pdf |format=PDF |title=Chaos and Planet-Particle Dynamics within the Habitable Zone of Extrasolar Planetary Systems (A qualitative numerical stability study) |accessdate=31 October 2007 |last=Hinse |first=T.C. |publisher=Niels Bohr Institute |quote=Main simulation results observed: [1] The presence of high-order mean-motion resonances for large values of giant planet eccentricity [2] Chaos dominated dynamics within the habitable zone(s) at large values of giant planet mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for stable orbits rules out [[Extrasolar planet|stars with systems of planets]] that contain large planets with orbits close to the host star (called "[[hot Jupiters]]"). It is believed that hot Jupiters have migrated inwards to their current orbits. In the process, they would have catastrophically disrupted the orbits of any planets in the habitable zone.&lt;ref&gt;"Once you realize that most of the known extrasolar planets have highly eccentric orbits (like the planets in Upsilon Andromedae), you begin to wonder if there might be something special about our solar system" (UCBerkeleyNews quoting Extra solar planetary researcher Eric Ford.) {{Cite web |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/04/13_planet.shtml |first=Robert |last=Sanders |date=13 April 2005 |title=Wayward planet knocks extrasolar planets for a loop |accessdate=31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To exacerbate matters, hot Jupiters are much more common orbiting F and G class stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm Sol Company, Stars and Habitable Planets, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628175616/http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A terrestrial planet of the right size===
[[File:Size planets comparison.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|left|Planets of the Solar System to scale. Rare Earth argues that complex life cannot exist on large gaseous planets like Jupiter and Saturn (top row) or Uranus and Neptune (top middle) or smaller planets such as Mars and Mercury]]
It is argued that life requires terrestrial planets like Earth and as gas giants lack such a surface, that complex life cannot arise there.&lt;ref&gt;Ward &amp; Brownlee pg 220&lt;/ref&gt;

A planet that is too small cannot hold much atmosphere, making surface temperature low and variable and oceans impossible. A small planet will also tend to have a rough surface, with large mountains and deep canyons. The core will cool faster, and [[plate tectonics]] may be brief or entirely absent. A planet that is too large will retain too dense an atmosphere like [[Venus]]. Although Venus is similar in size and mass to Earth, its surface atmospheric pressure is 92 times that of Earth, and surface temperature of 735 K (462&amp;nbsp;°C; 863&amp;nbsp;°F). Earth had a similar early atmosphere to Venus, but may have lost it in the [[Giant-impact hypothesis|giant impact event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lissauer|1999}}, as summarized by {{harvnb|Conway Morris|2003|p=92}}; also see {{harvnb|Comins|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With plate tectonics===
[[File:Great American Biotic Interchange examples.svg|thumb|The [[Great American Interchange]] on Earth, around ~ 3.5 to 3 Ma, an example of species competition, resulting from continental plate interaction]]
[[File:Magnetosphere Levels.svg|thumb|right|An artist's rendering of the structure of Earth's magnetic field-magnetosphere that protects Earth's life from [[solar radiation]]. 1)&amp;nbsp;Bow shock. 2)&amp;nbsp;Magnetosheath. 3)&amp;nbsp;Magnetopause. 4)&amp;nbsp;Magnetosphere. 5)&amp;nbsp;Northern tail lobe. 6)&amp;nbsp;Southern tail lobe. 7)&amp;nbsp;Plasmasphere.]]
Rare Earth proponents argue that [[plate tectonics]] and a strong [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic field]] are essential for  [[biodiversity]], [[global temperature regulation]], and the [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The lack of [[mountain chain]]s elsewhere in the Solar System is direct evidence that Earth is the only body with plate tectonics, and thus the only nearby body capable of supporting life.&lt;ref&gt; {{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate tectonics depend on the right chemical composition and a long-lasting source of heat from [[radioactive decay]]. Continents must be made of less dense [[felsic]] rocks that "float" on underlying denser [[mafic]] rock. Taylor&lt;ref name=Taylor98/&gt; emphasizes that tectonic [[subduction]] zones require the lubrication of oceans of water. Plate tectonics also provides a means of [[Biogeochemical cycle|biochemical cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/4076-plate-tectonics-essential-alien-life.html Plate Tectonics Could Be Essential for Alien Life], By Lee Pullen, Astrobiology Magazine, February 19, 2009, SPACE.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate tectonics and as a result [[continental drift]] and the creation of separate land masses would create diversified [[ecosystem]]s and [[biodiversity]], one of the strongest defences against extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Ward, R. D. &amp; Brownlee, D.}} 2000. ''[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geophys/platelif.html Plate tectonics essential for complex evolution]'' - [[Rare Earth (book)|Rare Earth]] - [[Copernicus Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of species diversification and later competition on Earth's continents is the [[Great American Interchange]]. North and Middle America drifted into [[South America]] at around 3.5 to 3 Ma. The [[fauna]] of South America evolved separately for about 30 million years, since [[Antarctica]] separated. Many species were subsequently wiped out in mainly South America by competing [[North America|Northern American]] animals.

===A large moon===
[[File:Porto Covo February 2009-2.jpg|thumb|left|Tide pools resulting from tidal interaction of the Moon are said to have promoted the evolution of complex life.]]
The Moon is unusual because the other rocky planets in the Solar System either have no satellites ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]]), or only tiny satellites which are probably captured asteroids ([[Mars]]).

The [[Giant-impact hypothesis|Giant-impact theory]] hypothesizes that the Moon resulted from the impact of a [[Mars]]-sized body, dubbed [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], with the young Earth. This giant impact also gave the Earth its [[axial tilt]]  (inclination) and velocity of rotation.&lt;ref name=Taylor98&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid rotation reduces the daily variation in temperature and makes [[photosynthesis]] viable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-rotation-summer-solstice/ scientificamerican.com, Fact or Fiction: The Days (and Nights) Are Getting Longer, By Adam Hadhazy, 14 June 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rare Earth'' hypothesis further argues that the axial tilt cannot be too large or too small (relative to the [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]). A planet with a large tilt will experience extreme seasonal variations in climate. A planet with little or no tilt will lack the stimulus to evolution that climate variation provides.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In this view, the Earth's tilt is "just right". The gravity of a large satellite also stabilizes the planet's tilt; without this effect the [[precession|variation in tilt]] would be [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], probably making complex life forms on land impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dartnell|2007|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Earth had no Moon, the ocean [[tide]]s resulting solely from the Sun's gravity would be only half that of the lunar tides. A large satellite gives rise to [[tidal pool]]s, which may be essential for the formation of [[macromolecule|complex life]], though this is far from certain.&lt;ref&gt;A formal description of the hypothesis is given in: {{Cite journal |last=Lathe |first=Richard |date=March 2004 |title=Fast tidal cycling and the origin of life |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |volume=168 |issue=1 |pages=18–22 |quote=tidal cycling, resembling the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mechanism, could only replicate and amplify DNA-like polymers. This mechanism suggests constraints on the evolution of extra-terrestrial life. |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2003.10.018 |bibcode=2004Icar..168...18L |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001910350300383X}} It is taught less formally here: {{Cite web |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/lec25.html |title=Origin of Life |accessdate=31 October 2007 |first=James |last=Schombert |publisher=University of Oregon |quote=with the vastness of the Earth's oceans it is statistically very improbable that these early proteins would ever link up. The solution is that the huge tides from the Moon produced inland tidal pools, which would fill and evaporate on a regular basis to produce high concentrations of amino acids.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large satellite also increases the likelihood of [[plate tectonics]] through the effect of [[tidal force]]s on the planet's crust.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The impact that formed the Moon may also have initiated plate tectonics, without which the [[continental crust]] would cover the entire planet, leaving no room for [[oceanic crust]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} It is possible that the large scale [[mantle convection]] needed to drive plate tectonics could not have emerged in the absence of crustal inhomogeneity. A further theory indicates that such a large moon may also contribute to maintaining a planet's magnetic shield by continually acting upon a metallic planetary core as dynamo, thus protecting the surface of the planet from charged particles and cosmic rays, and helping to ensure the atmosphere is not stripped over time by solar winds.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[File:Earth's atmosphere.svg|thumb|right|Earth's atmosphere]]

===Atmosphere===
A terrestrial planet of the right size is needed to retain an atmosphere, like Earth and Venus. On Earth, once the giant impact of [[Theia (planet)|Theia]] thinned [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], other events were needed to make the atmosphere capable of sustaining life. The [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] reseeded Earth with water lost after the impact of Theia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/27969-earth-water-from-asteroids-not-comets.html Space.com, Most of Earth's Water Came from Asteroids, Not Comets, By Charles Q.

===One or more evolutionary triggers for complex life===
[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|This diagram illustrates the ''twofold cost of sex''. If each individual were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the sexual population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation]]
Regardless of whether planets with similar physical attributes to the Earth are rare or not, some argue that life usually remains simple bacteria. Biochemist [[Nick Lane]] argues that simple cells ([[prokaryote]]s) emerged soon after Earth's formation, but since almost half the planet's life had passed before they evolved into complex ones ([[eukaryote]]s) all of whom share a [[common ancestor]], this event can only have happened once. In some views, [[prokaryote]]s lack the cellular architecture to evolve into eukaryotes because a bacterium expanded up to eukaryotic proportions would have tens of thousands of times less energy available; two billion years ago, one simple cell incorporated itself into another, multiplied, and evolved into [[mitochondria]] that supplied the vast increase in available energy that enabled the evolution of complex life. If this incorporation occurred only once in four billion years or is otherwise unlikely, then life on most planets remains simple.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view is that mitochondria evolution was environmentally triggered, and that mitochondria-containing organisms appeared soon after the first traces of atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, W. &amp; Mentel, M. (2010)[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-origin-of-mitochondria-14232356# The Origin of Mitochondria. Nature Education] 3(9):58&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution and persistence of [[evolution of sexual reproduction|sexual reproduction]] is another mystery in biology. The purpose of [[sexual reproduction]] is unclear, as in many organisms it has a 50% cost (fitness disadvantage) in relation to [[asexual reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mating type]]s (types of [[gamete]]s, according to their compatibility) may have arisen as a result of [[anisogamy]] (gamete dimorphism), or the male and female genders may have evolved before anisogamy.&lt;ref&gt;T. Togashi, P. Cox (Eds.) ''The Evolution of Anisogamy''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; 2011, p. 22-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. &amp; Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Oxford University Press, p. 25 [https://books.google.com/books?id=d4cLBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Online resources, [http://www.oup.co.uk/companion/beukeboom].&lt;/ref&gt; It is also unknown why most sexual organisms use a binary [[mating system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Czárán |first1=T.L. |last2=Hoekstra |first2=R.F. |year=2006 |title=Evolution of sexual asymmetry |url=|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=4 |issue=|pages=34–46 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-4-34|pmid=15383154 |pmc=524165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and why some organisms have gamete dimorphism. [[Charles Darwin]] was the first to suggest that [[sexual selection]] drives [[speciation]]; without it, complex life would probably not have evolved.

===The right time in evolution===
[[File:Timeline evolution of life.svg|left|thumb|Timeline of evolution; [[History of writing|human writings]] exists for only 0.000218% of Earth's history.]] 
While life on Earth is regarded to have spawned relatively early in the planet's history, the evolution from multicellular to intelligent organisms took around 800 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~ulm/papers/ECh7.pdf 800 million years for complex organ evolution] - [[Heidelberg University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Civilizations on Earth have existed for about 12,000 years and radio communication reaching space has existed for less than 100 years. Relative to the age of the Solar System (~4.57 Ga) this is a short time, in which extreme climatic variations, super volcanoes, and large meteorite impacts were absent. These events would severely harm intelligent life, as well as life in general. For example, the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic mass extinction]], caused by widespread and continuous volcanic eruptions in an area the size of Western Europe, led to the extinction of 95% of known species around 251.2 [[Mega-annum|Ma]] ago. About 65 million years ago, the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub]] impact at the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (~65.5 Ma) on the [[Yucatán peninsula]] in [[Mexico]] led to a mass extinction of the most advanced species at that time.

If there were intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations able to make contact with distant Earth, they would have to live in the same 12Ka period of the 800Ma evolution of life.

==Rare Earth equation==
The following discussion is adapted from Cramer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cramer|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rare Earth equation is Ward and Brownlee's [[riposte]] to the [[Drake equation]]. It calculates &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the number of Earth-like planets in the Milky Way having complex life forms, as:
[[File:Pikaia gracilens B.jpg|thumb|upright|According to Rare Earth, the Cambrian explosion that saw extreme diversification of [[chordata]] from simple forms like Pikaia (pictured) was an improbable event]]
:&lt;math&gt;N=N^* \cdot n_e \cdot f_g \cdot f_p \cdot f_{pm} \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot f_l \cdot f_m \cdot f_j \cdot f_{me}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=271–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where:
* ''N*'' is the number of stars in the [[Milky Way]]. This number is not well-estimated, because the Milky Way's mass is not well estimated, with little information about the number of small stars. ''N*'' is at least 100 billion, and may be as high as 500 billion, if there are many low visibility stars.
* &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; is the average number of planets in a star's habitable zone. This zone is fairly narrow, because constrained by the requirement that the average planetary temperature be consistent with water remaining liquid throughout the time required for complex life to evolve. Thus &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt;=1 is a likely upper bound.
We assume &lt;math&gt;N^* \cdot n_e=5\cdot10^{11}&lt;/math&gt;. The Rare Earth hypothesis can then be viewed as asserting that the product of the other nine Rare Earth equation factors listed below, which are all fractions, is no greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; and could plausibly be as small as 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;. In the latter case, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; could be as small as 0 or 1. Ward and Brownlee do not actually calculate the value of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, because the numerical values of quite a few of the factors below can only be conjectured. They cannot be estimated simply because [[Anthropic principle|we have but one data point]]: the Earth, a rocky planet orbiting a [[Stellar classification#Class G|G2]] star in a quiet suburb of a large [[barred spiral galaxy]], and the home of the only intelligent species we know, namely ourselves.
* &lt;math&gt;f_g&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of stars in the galactic habitable zone (Ward, Brownlee, and Gonzalez estimate this factor as 0.1&lt;ref name=Gonzalez/&gt;).
* &lt;math&gt;f_p&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of stars in the [[Milky Way]] with planets.
* &lt;math&gt;f_{pm}&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planets that are rocky ("metallic") rather than gaseous.
* &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of habitable planets where microbial life arises. Ward and Brownlee believe this fraction is unlikely to be small.
* &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planets where complex life evolves. For 80% of the time since microbial life first appeared on the Earth, there was only bacterial life. Hence Ward and Brownlee argue that this fraction may be small.
* &lt;math&gt;f_l&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of the total lifespan of a planet during which complex life is present. Complex life cannot endure indefinitely, because the energy put out by the sort of star that allows complex life to emerge gradually rises, and the central star eventually becomes a [[red giant]], engulfing all planets in the planetary habitable zone. Also, given enough time, a catastrophic extinction of all complex life becomes ever more likely.
* &lt;math&gt;f_m&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of habitable planets with a large moon. If the [[giant impact theory]] of the Moon's origin is correct, this fraction is small.
* &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planetary systems with large Jovian planets. This fraction could be large.
* &lt;math&gt;f_{me}&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planets with a sufficiently low number of extinction events. Ward and Brownlee argue that the low number of such events the Earth has experienced since the [[Cambrian explosion]] may be unusual, in which case this fraction would be small.

The Rare Earth equation, unlike the [[Drake equation]], does not factor the probability that complex life evolves into [[intelligence|intelligent life]] that discovers technology (Ward and Brownlee are not [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]]). Barrow and Tipler&lt;ref&gt;{{BarrowTipler1986}} Section 3.2&lt;/ref&gt; review the consensus among such biologists that the evolutionary path from primitive Cambrian [[chordate]]s, e.g., ''[[Pikaia]]'' to ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', was a highly improbable event. For example, the large [[brain]]s of humans have marked adaptive disadvantages, requiring as they do an expensive [[metabolism]], a long [[gestation period]], and a childhood lasting more than 25% of the average total life span. Other improbable features of humans include:
*Being one of a handful of extant [[bipedal]] land (non-avian) [[vertebrate]]. Combined with an unusual [[eye–hand coordination]], this permits dextrous manipulations of the physical environment with the [[hand]]s;
*A [[vocal folds|vocal apparatus]] far more expressive{{citation needed|reason=What about dolphins? Their ability to communicate complex ideas is indisputable. Also, dolphins clearly have culture.|date=August 2016}} than that of any other mammal, enabling [[speech]]. Speech makes it possible for humans to interact cooperatively, to share knowledge, and to acquire a culture;
*The capability of formulating [[abstraction]]s to a degree permitting the invention of [[mathematics]], and the discovery of [[science]] and [[technology]]. Only recently did humans acquire anything like their current scientific and technological sophistication.

==Advocates==
Writers who support the Rare Earth hypothesis:
* [[Stuart Ross Taylor]],&lt;ref name=Taylor98/&gt; a specialist on the Solar System, firmly believes in the hypothesis. Taylor concludes that the Solar System is probably unusual, because it resulted from so many chance factors and events.
* Stephen Webb,&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"/&gt; a physicist, mainly presents and rejects candidate solutions for the [[Fermi paradox]]. The Rare Earth hypothesis emerges as one of the few solutions left standing by the end of the book.
* [[Simon Conway Morris]], a [[paleontologist]], endorses the Rare Earth hypothesis in chapter 5 of his ''Life's Solution: Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conway Morris|2003|loc=Ch. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cites Ward and Brownlee's book with approval.&lt;ref&gt;Conway Morris, 2003, p. 344, n. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank J. Tipler]] (1986. 3.2, 8.7, 9), [[cosmologist]]s, vigorously defend the hypothesis that humans are likely to be the only intelligent life in the [[Milky Way]], and perhaps the entire universe. But this hypothesis is not central to their book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'', a thorough study of the [[anthropic principle]] and of how the laws of physics are peculiarly suited to enable the emergence of complexity in nature.
* [[Ray Kurzweil]], a computer pioneer and self-proclaimed [[Singularitarian]], argues in ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that the coming [[Technological singularity|Singularity]] requires that Earth be the first planet on which sentient, technology-using life evolved. Although other Earth-like planets could exist, Earth must be the most evolutionarily advanced, because otherwise we would have seen evidence that another culture had experienced the [[Technological singularity|Singularity]] and expanded to harness the full computational capacity of the physical universe.

=={{anchor|Criticism}}Criticism==
Cases against the Rare Earth Hypothesis take various forms.

===Anthropic reasoning===
The hypothesis concludes, more or less, that complex life is rare because it can evolve only on the surface of an Earth-like planet or on a suitable satellite of a planet. Some biologists, such as [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]], believe this assumption too restrictive and unimaginative; they see it as a form of [[begging the question|circular reasoning]].

According to [[David Darling (astronomer)|David Darling]], the Rare Earth hypothesis is neither [[hypothesis]] nor [[prediction]], but merely a description of how life arose on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darling|2001|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his view Ward and Brownlee have done nothing more than select the factors that best suit their case.

&lt;blockquote&gt;What matters is not whether there's anything unusual about the Earth; there's going to be something [[idiosyncratic]] about every planet in space. What matters is whether any of Earth's circumstances are not only unusual but also essential for complex life. So far we've seen nothing to suggest there is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darling|2001|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics also argue that there is a link between the Rare Earth Hypothesis and the [[creationist]] ideas of [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, Kendrick. 'Was the 'Rare Earth' Hypothesis Influenced by a Creationist?' The Skeptical Inquirer. 1 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exoplanets around main sequence stars are being discovered in large numbers===
{{see also|Estimated frequency of Earth-like planets}}
An increasing number of [[extrasolar planet]] discoveries are being made with {{Extrasolar planet counts|planet_count}} planets in {{Extrasolar planet counts|system_count}} planetary systems known as of {{Extrasolar planet counts|asof}}.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |work=[[The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php |last=Schneider |first=Jean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rare Earth proponents argue life cannot arise outside Sun-like systems. However, [[Planetary habitability#Red dwarf systems|some exobiologists have suggested]] that stars outside this range may give [[Abiogenesis|rise to life]] under the right circumstances; this possibility is a central point of contention to the theory because these late-K and M category stars make up about 82% of all hydrogen-burning stars.&lt;ref name="RECONS1"/&gt;

Current technology limits the testing of important Rare Earth criteria: surface water, tectonic plates, a large moon and [[biosignature]]s are currently undetectable. Though planets the size of Earth are difficult to detect and classify, scientists now think that rocky planets are common around Sun-like stars.&lt;ref name="HowardSanchis-Ojeda2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Howard |first1=Andrew W. |display-authors=etal |title=A rocky composition for an Earth-sized exoplanet |journal=Nature |volume=503 |issue=7476 |year=2013 |pages=381–384 |doi=10.1038/nature12767 |pmid=24172898 |arxiv=1310.7988 |bibcode=2013Natur.503..381H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Earth Similarity Index]] (ESI) of mass, radius and temperature provides a means of measurement, but falls short of the full Rare Earth criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-11/21/exoplanet-indices |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925005119/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-11/21/exoplanet-indices |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Gary [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-22/new-recipe-in-search-for-alien-life/3686408/ New approach in search for alien life] ABC Online. 22 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that Rare Earth's estimates of rocky planets in habitable zones (&lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; in the Rare Earth equation) are too restrictive.

Ward and Brownlee argue that for complex life to evolve (Rare Earth equation factor &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt;), [[tectonics]] must be present to generate [[biogeochemical cycles]], and predicted that such geological features would not be found outside of Earth, pointing to a lack of observable mountain ranges and [[orogenic|subduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=191–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, no scientific consensus on the evolution of plate tectonics on Earth.

NASA scientists Hartman and McKay argue that plate tectonics may in fact slow the rise of oxygenation (and thus stymie complex life rather than promote it).&lt;ref&gt;Hartman H, McKay CP "Oxygenic photosynthesis and the oxidation state of Mars." Planet Space Sci. 1995 Jan-Feb;43(1-2):123-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer modelling by Tilman Spohn in 2014 found that plate tectonics on Earth may have arisen from the effects of complex life's emergence, rather than the other way around as the Rare Earth might suggest. The action of lichens on rock may have contributed to the formation of subduction zones in the presence of water.&lt;ref name=Choi2014&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Does a Planet Need Life to Create Continents?

====A magnetic field may not be a requirement====
The importance of Earth's magnetic field to the development of complex life has been disputed. Kasting argues that the atmosphere provides sufficient protection against cosmic rays even during times of magnetic pole reversal and atmosphere loss by sputtering.&lt;ref name="Kasting 2001"/&gt; Kasting also dismisses the role of the magnetic field in the evolution of eukaryotes, citing the age of the oldest known [[magnetofossils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasting|2001|pp=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A large moon may neither be rare nor necessary===
The requirement of a large moon (Rare Earth equation factor &lt;math&gt;f_m&lt;/math&gt;) has also been challenged. Even if it were required, such an occurrence may not be as unique as predicted by the Rare Earth Hypothesis. Recent work by [[Edward Belbruno]] and [[J. Richard Gott]] of Princeton University suggests that giant impactors such as those that may have formed the [[Moon]] can indeed form in planetary [[trojan points]] ({{L4}} or {{L5}} [[Lagrangian point]]) which means that similar circumstances may occur in other planetary systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=E. |last=Belbruno |author2=J.

[[File:Artist's concept of collision at HD 172555.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Collision between two planetary bodies (artist concept).]]

Rare Earth's assertion that the Moon's stabilization of Earth's obliquity and spin is a requirement for complex life has been questioned. Kasting argues that a moonless Earth would still possess habitats with climates suitable for complex life and questions whether the spin rate of a moonless Earth can be predicted.&lt;ref name="Kasting 2001"/&gt; Although the [[giant impact theory]] posits that the impact forming the Moon increased Earth's rotational speed to make a day about 5 hours long, the Moon has slowly "[[Tidal deceleration#Tidal deceleration|stolen]]" much of this speed to reduce Earth's solar day since then to about 24 hours and continues to do so: in 100 million years Earth's solar day will be roughly 24 hours 38 minutes (the same as Mars's solar day); in 1 billion years, 30 hours 23 minutes. Larger secondary bodies would exert proportionally larger tidal forces that would in turn decelerate their primaries faster and potentially increase the solar day of a planet in all other respects like Earth to over 120 hours within a few billion years. This long solar day would make effective heat dissipation for organisms in the tropics and subtropics extremely difficult in a similar manner to tidal locking to a red dwarf star. Short days (high rotation speed) causes high wind speeds at ground level. Long days (slow rotation speed) cause the day and night temperatures to be too extreme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/earth/what-would-happen-if-our-planet-became-tidally-locked-130202.htm discovery.com What If Earth Became Tidally Locked? 2 February 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Rare Earth proponents argue that the Earth's plate tectonics would probably not exist if not for the tidal forces of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;Ward &amp; Brownlee 2000, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nick |first=Hoffman |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/life-01x1.html |title=The Moon And Plate Tectonics: Why We Are Alone |work=Space Daily |date=11 June 2001 |accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis that the Moon's tidal influence initiated or sustained Earth's plate tectonics remains unproven, though at least one study implies a temporal correlation to the formation of the Moon.&lt;ref name="TurnerRushmer2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turner |first1=S. |last2=Rushmer |first2=T. |last3=Reagan |first3=M. |last4=Moyen |first4=J.-F. |title=Heading down early on?

===Complex life may arise in alternative habitats===
[[File:Blacksmoker in Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Complex life may exist in environments similar to [[black smoker]]s on Earth.]]
{{see also|Hypothetical types of biochemistry}}
Rare Earth proponents argue that simple life may be common, though complex life requires specific environmental conditions to arise. Critics consider life could arise on a [[natural satellite|moon]] of a gas giant, though this is less likely if life requires volcanicity. The moon must have stresses to induce tidal heating, but not so dramatic as seen on Jupiter's Io. However, the moon is within the gas giant's intense radiation belts, sterilizing any biodiversity before it can get established. [[Dirk Schulze-Makuch]] disputes this, hypothesizing alternative biochemistries for alien life.&lt;ref name="Schulze-MakuchIrwin2008"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dirk Schulze-Makuch |author2=Louis Neal Irwin |title=Life in the Universe: Expectations and Constraints |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdjoTGAvrkkC&amp;pg=PA1 |date=2 October 2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3-540-76816-6 |pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Rare Earth proponents argue that only microbial extremophiles could exist in subsurface habitats beyond Earth, some argue that complex life can also arise in these environments.

'''Software evolution''' is the term used in [[software engineering]] (specifically [[software maintenance]]) to refer to the process of developing [[software]] initially, then repeatedly updating it for various reasons. 

==General introduction==
[[Fred Brooks]], in his key book ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Brooks]], ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]''. [[Addison-Wesley]], 1975 &amp; 1995. ISBN
0-201-00650-2 &amp; {{ISBN|0-201-83595-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; states that over 90% of the costs of a typical system arise in the maintenance phase, and that any successful piece of software will inevitably be maintained.

In fact, [[Agile methods]] stem from maintenance-like activities in and around web based technologies, where the bulk of the capability comes from frameworks and standards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Software maintenance address bug fixes and minor enhancements and software evolution focus on [[Adaptation (computer science)|adaptation]] and [[System migration|migration]].

&lt;!-- evolution of evolution models --&gt;
Software technologies will continue to develop. These changes will require new laws and theories to be created and justified. Some models as well would require additional aspects in developing future programs. Innovations and improvements do increase unexpected form of software development. The maintenance issues also would probably change as to adapt to the evolution of the future software. Software processes are themselves evolving, after going through learning and refinements, it is always improve their efficiency and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;aeddy; ref: Understanding Open Source Software Evolution Walt Scacchi Institute for Software Research&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concepts==
The need for software evolution comes from the fact that no one is able to predict how user requirements will evolve ''a priori'' .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first1=K. H. | last1=Bennett | first2=V. T. | last2=Rajlich | first3=R. Mohamad | last3=Mazrul, | title = Legacy System: Coping with success | journal=[[IEEE Software]] | date=1995 | pages=19–23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In other words, the existing systems are never complete and continue to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation | author = Trung Hung Vo | title = Software Maintenance| date=  2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they evolve, the complexity of the systems will grow unless there is a better solution available to solve these issues. The main objectives of software evolution are ensuring functional relevance, reliability and flexibility of the system. Software evolution can be fully manual (based on changes by software engineers), partially automated (e.g. using refactoring tools) or fully automated (with autonomous configuration or evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Baudry|first=Benoit|last2=Monperrus|first2=Martin|last3=Mony|first3=Cendrine|last4=Chauvel|first4=Franck|last5=Fleurey|first5=Franck|last6=Clarke|first6=Siobhan|date=February 2014|title=DIVERSIFY: Ecology-inspired software evolution for diversity emergence|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6747203/?reload=true|journal=2014 Software Evolution Week - IEEE Conference on Software Maintenance, Reengineering, and Reverse Engineering (CSMR-WCRE)|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/csmr-wcre.2014.6747203|isbn=9781479937523|citeseerx=10.1.1.646.2786}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Software evolution has been greatly impacted by the Internet:

* the rapid growth of World Wide Web and Internet Resources make it easier for users and engineers to find related information. 

* open source development where anybody could download the source codes and hence modify it has enabled fast and parallel evolution (through forks). 

==Types of software maintenance==

E.B. Swanson initially identified the 
three categories of maintenance: corrective, adaptive, and perfective. Four categories of software were then catalogued by Lientz and Swanson (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Lientz, B.P. and Swanson, E.B., ''Software Maintenance Management, A Study Of The Maintenance Of Computer Application Software In 487 Data Processing Organizations''. Addison-Wesley, Reading MA, 1980. {{ISBN|0-201-04205-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These have since been updated and normalized internationally in the [[ISO/IEC]] 14764:2006:&lt;ref&gt;[[ISO/IEC]] 14764:2006, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Corrective maintenance'': Reactive modification of a software product performed after delivery to correct discovered problems;
* ''Adaptive maintenance'': Modification of a software product performed after delivery to keep a software product usable in a changed or changing environment;
* ''Perfective maintenance'': Modification of a software product after delivery to improve performance or maintainability;
* ''Preventive maintenance'': Modification of a software product after delivery to detect and correct latent faults in the software product before they become effective faults.

All of the preceding take place when there is a known requirement for change.

Although these categories were supplemented by many authors like Warren et al. (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which enrich the description of the many evolution activities.

==Stage model==
Current trends  and practices are projected forward using a new model of software evolution called the staged model [1]. Staged model was introduced to replace conventional analysis which is less suitable for modern software development is rapid changing due to its difficulties of hard to contribute in software evolution. There are five distinct stages contribute in simple staged model (Initial development, Evolution, Servicing, Phase-out, and Close-down). 
* According to K.H.Bennett and V.T Rajlich [1], the key contribution is to separate the 'maintenance' phase into an evolution stage followed by a servicing and phase out stages. The first version of software system which is lacking some features will be developed during initial development or also known as alpha stage [2]. However, the architecture has already been possessed during this stage will bring for any future changes or amendments. Most references in this stage will base on scenarios or case study. Knowledge has defined as another important outcome of initial development. Such knowledge including the knowledge of application domain, user requirements, business rules, policies, solutions, algorithm, etc. Knowledge also seems as the important factor for the subsequent phase of evolution.
* Once the previous stage completed successfully (and must be completed successfully before entering next stage), the next stage would be evolution. Users tend to change their requirements as well as they prefer to see some improvements or changes. Due to this factor, the software industry is facing the challenges of rapid changes environment. Hence the goal of evolution is to adapt the application to the ever-changing user requirements and operating environment [1]. During the previous stage, the first version application created might contain a lot of faults, and those faults will be fixed during evolution stage based on more specified and accurate requirements due to the case study or scenarios.
* The software will continuously evolve until it is no longer evolvable and then enter stage of servicing (also known as software maturity). During this stage, only minor changes will be done.
* Next stage which is phase-out, there is no more servicing available for that particular software. However, the software still in production.
* Lastly, close-down. The software use is disconnected or discontinue [2] and the users are directed towards a replacement.[1].

==Lehman's Laws of Software Evolution==
{{Main|Lehman's laws of software evolution}}
Prof. [[Meir M. Lehman]], who worked at [[Imperial College London]] from 1972 to 2002, and his colleagues have identified a set of behaviours in the evolution of proprietary software. These behaviours (or observations) are known as Lehman's Laws, and there are eight of them:

# (1974) "Continuing Change" — an E-type system must be continually adapted or it becomes progressively less satisfactory&lt;ref name="laws1-5"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0164-1212(79)90022-0|last=Lehman|first=M. M.|title=On Understanding Laws, Evolution, and Conservation in the Large-Program Life Cycle|year=1980|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|volume=1|pages=213–221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# (1974) "Increasing Complexity" — as an E-type system evolves, its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1980) "Self Regulation" — E-type system evolution processes are self-regulating with the distribution of product and process measures close to normal&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1978) "Conservation of Organisational Stability ([[invariant work rate]])" - the average effective global activity rate in an evolving E-type system is invariant over the product's lifetime&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1978) "Conservation of Familiarity" — as an E-type system evolves, all associated with it, developers, sales personnel and users, for example, must maintain mastery of its content and behaviour to achieve satisfactory evolution. Excessive growth diminishes that mastery. Hence the average [[incremental growth]] remains invariant as the system evolves.&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1991) "Continuing Growth" — the functional content of an E-type system must be continually increased to maintain user satisfaction over its lifetime
# (1996) "Declining Quality" — the quality of an E-type system will appear to be declining unless it is rigorously maintained and adapted to operational environment changes
# (1996) "Feedback System" (first stated 1974, formalised as law 1996) — E-type evolution processes constitute multi-level, multi-loop, multi-agent feedback systems and must be treated as such to achieve significant improvement over any reasonable base&lt;ref&gt;[[Lehman's laws of software evolution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth mentioning that the applicability of all of these laws for all types of software systems has been studied by several researchers. For example, see a presentation by Nanjangud C Narendra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Software-Evolution-in-Agile-Development | title=Software Evolution in Agile Development | first=Nanjangud | last=Narendra | website=InfoQ | date=29 April 2011 | accessdate=19 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he describes a case study of an enterprise Agile project in the light of Lehman’s laws of software evolution. Some empirical observations coming from the study of [[open source software development]] appear to challenge some of the laws {{Vague|date=June 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

The laws predict that the need for functional change in a software system is inevitable, and not a consequence of incomplete or incorrect analysis of requirements or bad programming. They state that there are limits to what a software development team can achieve in terms of safely implementing changes and new functionality.

Maturity Models specific to software evolution have been developed to improve processes, and help to ensure continuous rejuvenation of the software as it evolves iteratively{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

The "global process" that is made by the many stakeholders (e.g. developers, users, their managers) has many feedback loops. The evolution speed is a function of the feedback loop structure and other characteristics of the global system. Process simulation techniques, such as [[system dynamics]] can be useful in understanding and managing such global process.

Software evolution is not likely to be [[Darwinian evolution|Darwinian]], [[Lamarckian evolution|Lamarckian]] or [[Baldwinian evolution|Baldwinian]], but an important phenomenon on its own. Given the increasing dependence on software at all levels of society and economy, the successful evolution of software is becoming increasingly critical. This is an important topic of research that hasn't received much attention.

The evolution of software, because of its rapid path in comparison to other man-made entities, was seen by Lehman as the "fruit fly" of the study of the evolution of artificial systems.

The concept of a spherical Earth displaced earlier beliefs in a [[flat Earth]]: In early [[Mesopotamian mythology]], the world was portrayed as a flat disk floating in the ocean with a hemispherical sky-dome above,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy|author=Otto E.

Other speculations on the shape of Earth include a seven-layered [[ziggurat]] or [[cosmic mountain]], alluded to in the [[Avesta]] and ancient [[Persian Empire|Persian]] writings (see [[seven climes]]).

The realization that the [[figure of the Earth]] is more accurately described as an [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] dates to the 17th century, as described by [[Isaac Newton]] in ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''. In the early 19th century, the flattening of the earth ellipsoid was determined to be of the order of 1/300 ([[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]], [[George Everest|Everest]]). The modern value as determined by the [[United States Department of Defense|US DoD]] [[World Geodetic System]] since the 1960s is close to 1/298.25.&lt;ref&gt;See [[figure of the Earth]] and [[Earth radius#Mean radii|Earth radius]] for details. Recent measurements from [[satellite]]s suggest that the Earth is, in fact, slightly [[pear]]-shaped.

==Cause==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}

The Earth is massive enough that [[gravity]] maintains it as a roughly spherical shape. Its formation into a sphere was made easy by its primordial hot, liquid phase.

===Formation===

The [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|Solar System formed]] from a dust cloud that was at least partially the remnant of one or more [[supernova]]s that created heavy elements by [[nucleosynthesis]]. Grains of matter accreted through electrostatic interaction. As they grew in mass, gravity took over in gathering yet more mass, releasing the [[potential energy]] of their collisions and in-falling as [[heat]]. The [[protoplanetary disk]] also had a greater proportion of radioactive elements than the Earth today because, over time, those elements decayed. Their decay heated the early Earth even further, and continue to contribute to [[Earth's internal heat budget]]. The early Earth was thus mostly liquid.

A sphere is the only stable shape for a non-rotating, gravitationally self-attracting liquid. The outward acceleration caused by the Earth's rotation is greater at the equator than at the poles (where is it zero), so the sphere gets deformed into an [[ellipsoid]], which represents the shape having the lowest potential energy for a rotating, fluid body. This ellipsoid is slightly fatter around the equator than a perfect sphere would be. Earth's shape is also slightly lumpy because it is composed of different materials of different densities that exert slightly different amounts of gravitational force per volume.

The liquidity of a hot, newly formed planet allows heavier elements to sink down to the middle and forces lighter elements closer to the surface, a process known as [[planetary differentiation]]. This event is known as the [[iron catastrophe]]; the most abundant heavier elements were [[iron]] and [[nickel]], which now form the [[Earth's core]].

{{further|History of Earth}}

===Later shape changes and effects===

Though the surface rocks of the Earth have cooled enough to solidify, the [[outer core]] of the planet is still hot enough to remain liquid. Energy is still being released; [[volcano|volcanic]] and [[tectonic]] activity has pushed rocks into hills and mountains and blown them out of [[caldera]]s. [[Meteor]]s also create [[impact crater]]s and surrounding ridges. However, if the energy release ceases from these processes, then they tend to [[Erosion|erode]] away over time and return toward the lowest potential-energy curve of the ellipsoid. [[Weather]] powered by [[solar energy]] can also move water, rock, and soil to make the Earth slightly out of round.

Earth undulates as the shape of its lowest potential energy changes daily due to the gravity of the Sun and Moon as they move around with respect to the Earth. This is what causes [[tides]] in the [[ocean]]s' water, which can flow freely along the changing potential.

===Shapes of other bodies===
[[File:Eros, Vesta and Ceres size comparison.jpg|thumb|Composite image showing the round dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]; the slightly smaller, mostly round [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]; and the much smaller, much lumpier [[433 Eros|Eros]]]]
[[File:Comet 67P on 19 September 2014 NavCam mosaic.jpg|thumb|The amorphous nucleus of the comet [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]]]]

The [[IAU definition of planet|IAU definitions of planet]] and [[dwarf planet]] require that a Sun-orbiting body has undergone the rounding process to reach a roughly spherical shape, an achievement known as [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. The same spheroidal shape can be seen from smaller rocky planets like [[Mars]] to [[gas giant]]s like [[Jupiter]].

Any natural Sun-orbiting body that has not reached hydrostatic equilibrium is classified by the IAU as a [[small Solar System body]] (SSB). These come in many non-spherical shapes which are lumpy masses accreted haphazardly by in-falling dust and rock; not enough mass falls in to generate the heat needed to complete the rounding. Some SSSBs are just collections of relatively small rocks that are weakly held next to each other by gravity but are not actually fused into a single big [[bedrock]]. Some larger SSSBs are nearly round but have not reached hydrostatic equilibrium. The small Solar System body [[4 Vesta]] is large enough to have undergone at least partial planetary differentiation.

Stars like the Sun are also spheroidal due to gravity's effects on their [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], which is a free-flowing [[fluid]]. Ongoing [[stellar fusion]] is a much greater source of heat for stars compared to the initial heat released during formation.

==Effects and empirical confirmation==

The roughly spherical shape of the Earth can be confirmed by many different types of observation from ground level, aircraft, and spacecraft.  The shape causes a number of phenomena that a flat Earth would not.  Some of these phenomena and observations would be possible on other shapes, such as a curved [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] or [[torus]], but no other shape would explain all of them.

===Spacecraft===

Many pictures have been taken of the entire Earth by satellites launched by a variety of governments and private organizations. From high orbits, where half the planet can be seen at once, it is plainly spherical.  The only way to piece together all the pictures taken of the ground from lower orbits so that all the surface features line up seamlessly and without distortion is to put them on an approximately spherical surface.

Astronauts in [[low Earth orbit]] can personally see the curvature of the planet, and travel all the way around several times a day.

The astronauts who travelled to the Moon have seen the entire Moon-facing half at once, and can watch the sphere rotate once a day (approximately; the Moon is also moving with respect to the Earth).

===Aircraft===

People in high-flying aircraft or skydiving from high-altitude balloons can plainly see the curvature of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OnJCqtTxsA James May Witnesses Curvature of Earth] (at {{convert|70000|ft}})&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial aircraft do not necessarily fly high enough to make this obvious.  Trying to measure the curvature of the horizon by taking a picture is complicated by the fact that camera lenses can produce distorted images depending on the angle used.  An extreme version of this effect can be seen in the [[fisheye lens]].  Scientific measurements would require a carefully calibrated lens.

The fastest way for an airplane to travel between two distant cities is a [[great circle]] route, which deviates significantly from what would be the fastest straight-line travel path on a flat Earth.

Photos of the ground taken from airplanes over a large enough area also do not fit seamlessly together on a flat surface, but do fit on a roughly spherical surface. Aerial photographs of large areas must be corrected to account for curvature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asprs.org/wp-content/uploads/pers/1958journal/dec/1958_dec_751-756.pdf The Effects of Earth's Curvature and Refraction on the Mensuration of Vertical Photographs]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visibility of distant objects===

{{main|Horizon#Distance to the horizon}}

On a completely flat Earth with no visual interference (such as trees, hills, or atmospheric haze) the ground itself would never obscure distant objects; one would be able to see all the way to the edge of the surface.  A spherical surface has a [[horizon]] which is closer when viewed from a lower altitude.&lt;ref name="smarter"&gt;[https://www.popsci.com/10-ways-you-can-prove-earth-is-round 10 easy ways you can tell for yourself that the Earth is not flat]&lt;/ref&gt;  In theory, a person standing on the surface with eyes {{convert|1.8|m}} above the ground can see the ground up to about {{convert|4.79|km}} away, but a person at the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]] at {{convert|273|m}} can see the ground up to about {{convert|58.98|km}} away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/june32012/index.html Consequences of a living on a sphere]&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon would seem to present a method to verify that the Earth's surface is locally [[wikt:convex|convex]].  If the degree of curvature was determined to be the same everywhere on the Earth's surface, and that surface was determined to be large enough, it would show that the Earth is spherical.

In practice, this turns out to be an unreliable method of measurement, due to variations in atmospheric [[refraction]].  This additional effect can give the impression that the earth's surface is flat, curved more convexly than it is, or even that it is [[wikt:concave|concave]], by bending light travelling near the surface of the earth (as happened in various trials of the famous [[Bedford Level experiment]]).

The phenomenon of variable atmospheric bending can be empirically confirmed by noting that sometimes the refractive layers of air can cause the image of a distant object to be broken into pieces or even turned upside down.  This is commonly seen at sunset, when the sun's shape is distorted, but has also been photographed happening for ships, and has caused the city of Chicago to appear normally, upside down, and broken into pieces from across Lake Michigan (from where it is normally below the horizon).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/earth/the-perfectly-scientific-explanation-for-why-chicago-appeared-upside-down-in-michigan/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc57.com/story/28925566/mirage-of-chicago-skyline-seen-from-michigan-shoreline&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their longer wavelengths, radio waves are even more susceptible to atmospheric refraction and reflection, which can cause radio and television signals to be received from towers thousands of miles away which cannot be seen with visible light.

When the atmosphere is relatively well-mixed, the visual effects generally expected of a spherical Earth can be observed.  For example, ships travelling on large bodies of water (such as the ocean) disappear over the horizon progressively, such that the highest part of the ship can still be seen even when lower parts cannot, proportional to distance from the observer.  The same is true of the coastline or mountain when viewed from a ship or from across a large lake or flat terrain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bco_p4V7-QU A video showing the curvature of the Earth] (using island coastline)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="headsup" /&gt;

===Lunar eclipses ===

The shadow of the Earth on the Moon during a [[lunar eclipse]] is always a dark circle that moves from one side of the moon to the other (partially grazing it during a partial eclipse).  This could be produced by a flat disc that always faces the Moon head-on during the eclipse, but this is inconsistent with the fact that the Moon is only rarely directly overhead during an eclipse. For each eclipse, the local surface of the Earth is pointed in a somewhat different direction.  The shadow of a circular disc held at an angle is an oval, not a circle as is seen during the eclipse.  The idea of the Earth being a flat disc is also inconsistent with the fact that a given lunar eclipse is only visible from half of the Earth at a time.

The only shape that casts a round shadow no matter which direction it is pointed is a sphere, and the ancient Greeks deduced that this must mean the Earth is spherical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollack|first1=Rebecca|title=Ancient Myths Revised with Lunar Eclipse|url=https://www.astro.umd.edu/openhouse/3about-the-obs/news/2003-11-10.html|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observation of the stars at altitude===

On a perfectly spherical Earth, flat terrain or ocean, when viewed from the surface, blocks exactly half the sky - a hemisphere of 180°. Moving away from the surface of the Earth means that the ground blocks less and less of the sky.  For example, when viewed from the Moon, the Earth blocks only a small portion of the sky, because it is so distant.  This phenomenon of geometry means that when viewed from a high mountain, flat ground or ocean blocks less than 180° of the sky. The rate of change in the angle blocked by the sky as altitude increases is different for a disc than a sphere, and values observed show that the Earth is locally convex.  (The angles blocked would also be different for a mountain close to the edge of a flat Earth compared to a mountain in the middle of a flat Earth, and this is not observed.)  In theory, measurements of this type from all around the Earth would confirm that it is a complete sphere (as opposed to some other shape with convex areas) though actually taking all those measurements would be very expensive.

Using other evidence to hypothesize a spherical shape, the medieval Iranian scholar [[Al-Biruni]] used this phenomenon to calculate the Earth's circumference to within {{convert|16.8|km}} of the correct value.&lt;ref name="headsup" /&gt;

===Observation of the fixed stars from different locations===

The [[fixed stars]] can be demonstrated to be very far away, by [[diurnal parallax]] measurements (a technique known at least as early as Ancient Greece).  Unlike the Sun, Moon, and planets, they do not change position with respect to one another (at least not perceptibly over the span of a human lifetime); the shapes of the [[constellation]]s are always the same.  This makes them a convenient reference background for determining the shape of the Earth.  Adding distance measurements on the ground allows calculation of the Earth's size.

The fact that different stars are visible from different locations on the Earth was noticed in ancient times. [[Aristotle]] wrote that some stars are visible from Egypt which are not visible from Europe.&lt;ref name="headsup"&gt;[http://headsup.boyslife.org/ten-reasons-we-know-earth-is-round/ How We Know the Earth Is Actually Round]&lt;/ref&gt; This would not be possible if the Earth was flat.&lt;ref name="smarter" /&gt;

At the [[North Pole]] it is continuously nighttime for six months of the year and the same hemisphere of stars (a 180° view) are always visible making one counterclockwise rotation every 24 hours. The star [[Polaris]] (the "North Star") is almost at the center of this rotation (which is directly overhead). Some of the [[88 modern constellations]] visible are [[Ursa Major]] (including the [[Big Dipper]]), [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], and [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]. The other six months of the year, it is continuously daytime and the light from the Sun mostly blots out the stars.  (The location of the poles can be defined by these phenomena, which only occur there; more than 24 hours of continuous daylight can occur north of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]].)

At the [[South Pole]], a completely non-overlapping set of constellations are visible during the six months of continuous nighttime, including [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Crux]], and [[Centaurus]].  This 180° hemisphere of stars rotate clockwise once every 24 hours, around a point directly overhead (where there do not happen to be any particularly bright stars).

The fact that the stars visible from the north and south poles do not overlap must mean that the two observation spots are on opposite sides of the Earth, which is not possible if the Earth is a single-sided disc, but is possible for other shapes (like a sphere, but also any other convex shape like a donut or dumbbell).

From any point on the [[equator]], 360° of stars are visible over the course of the night, as the sky rotates around a line drawn from due north to due south (which could be defined as "the directions to walk to get to the poles in the shortest amount of time").  When facing east, the stars visible from the north pole are on the left, and the stars visible from the south pole are on the right.  This means the equator must be facing at a 90° angle from the poles.

The direction any intermediate spot on the Earth is facing can also be calculated by measuring the angles of the fixed stars and determining how much of the sky is visible.  For example, [[New York City]] is about 40° north of the equator.  The apparent motion of the Sun blots out slightly different parts of the sky from day to day, but over the course of the entire year it sees a dome of 280° (360° - 80°).  So for example, both [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] and the [[Big Dipper]] are visible during at least part of the year.

Making stellar observations from a representative set of points across the Earth, combined with knowing the shortest on-the-ground distance between any two given points makes an approximate sphere the only possible shape for the Earth.

Knowing the difference in angle between two points on the Earth's surface and the surface distance between them allows a calculation of the Earth's size.  Using observations at [[Rhodes]] (in Greece) and [[Alexandria]] (in Egypt) and the distance between them, the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Posidonius#Geography, ethnology, and geology|Posidonius]] actually did use this technique to calculate the circumference of the planet to within perhaps 4% of the correct value (though modern equivalents of his units of measure are not precisely known).

===Surface circumnavigation===

Since the 1500s, many people have sailed or flown completely around the world in all directions, and none have discovered an edge or impenetrable barrier.  (See [[Circumnavigation]], [[Arctic exploration]], and [[History of Antarctica]].)

Some flat Earth theories that propose the world is a north-pole-centered disc, conceive of Antarctica as an impenetrable ice wall that encircles the planet and hides any edges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.testingtheglobe.com/quest2.html&lt;/ref&gt; This disc model explains east-west circumnavigation as simply moving around the disc in a circle.  (East-west paths form a circle in both disc and spherical geometry.)  It is possible in this model to traverse the North Pole, but it is not possible to perform a circumnavigation that includes the South Pole (which it posits does not exist).

Explorers, government researchers, commercial pilots, and tourists have been to [[Antarctica]] and found that it is not a large ring that encircles the entire world, but actually a roughly disc-shaped continent smaller than South America but larger than Australia, with an interior that can in fact be traversed in order to take a shorter path from e.g. the tip of South America to Australia than would be possible on a disc.

The first land crossing of the entirety of Antarctica was the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] in 1955-58, and many exploratory airplanes have since passed over the continent in various directions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/2300322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/2372669/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observing the Sun===

On a flat Earth, an omnidirectional Sun (emitting light in all directions, as it does) would illuminate the entire surface at the same time, and all places would experience sunrise and sunset at the horizon at the same time (with some small variations due to mountains and valleys). With a spherical Earth, half the planet is in daylight at any given time (the hemisphere facing the Sun) and the other half is experiencing nighttime. When a given location on the spherical Earth is in sunlight, its [[antipodes|antipode]] - the location exactly on the opposite side of the Earth - is always experiencing nighttime. The spherical shape of the Earth causes the Sun to rise and set at different times in different places, and different locations get different amounts of sunlight each day. 

In order to explain day and night, time zones, and the seasons, some flat Earth theorists propose that the Sun does not emit light in all directions, but acts more like a spotlight, only illuminating part of the flat Earth at a time.&lt;ref&gt;claimed by http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=58309.0#.VuJqbULlyPZ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="takes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2017/10/28/what-does-take-believe-world-flat/0gdgl2JMPhBpgJK5mGXPkI/story.html |title=What does it take to believe the world is flat? |date=28 October 2017 |author=Courtney Humphries}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is not consistent with observation; at sunrise and sunset, a spotlight Sun would be up in the sky at least a little bit, rather than at the horizon where it is always actually observed. A spotlight Sun would also appear at different angles in the sky with respect to a flat ground than it does with respect to a curved ground. Assuming light travels in straight lines, actual measurements of the Sun's angle in the sky from locations very distant from each other are only consistent with a geometry where the Sun is very far away and is being seen from a hemispherical surface (the daylight half of the Earth).  These two phenomena are related: a low-altitude spotlight Sun would spent most of the day near the horizon for most locations on Earth (which is not observed), but rise and set fairly close to the horizon.  A high-altitude Sun would spend more of the day away from the horizon, but rise and set fairly far from the horizon (which is not observed).

====Local solar time and time zones====

{{main|Time zone}}

Ancient timekeeping reckoned "noon" as the time of day when the sun is highest in the sky, with the rest of the hours in the day measured against that.  During the day, the [[apparent solar time]] can be measured directly with a [[sundial]].  In ancient Egypt, the first known sundials divided the day into 12 hours, though because the length of the day changed with the season, the length of the hours also changed.  Sundials that defined hours as always being the same duration appeared in the [[Renaissance]].  In Western Europe, [[clock tower]]s and [[striking clock]]s were used in the Middle Ages to keep people nearby appraised of the local time, though compared to modern times this was less important in a largely agrarian society.

Because the Sun reaches its highest point at different times for different [[longitude]]s (about four minutes of time for every degree of longitude difference east or west), the local solar noon in each city is different except for those directly north or south of each other.  This means that the clocks in different cities could be offset from each other by minutes or hours.  As clocks became more precise and industrialization made timekeeping more important, cities switched to [[mean solar time]], which ignores minor variations in the timing of local solar noon over the year, due to the elliptical nature of the Earth's orbit, and its tilt.

The differences in clock time between cities was not generally a problem until the advent of [[railroad]] travel in the 1800s, which both made travel between distant cities much faster than by walking or horse, and also required passengers to show up at specific times to meet their desired trains.  In the [[United Kingdom]], railroads gradually switched to [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (set from local time at the Greenwich observatory in London), followed by public clocks across the country generally, forming a single time zone.  In the United States, railroads published schedules based on local time, then later based on standard time for that railroad (typically the local time at the railroad's headquarters), and then finally based on four standard time zones shared across all railroads, where neighboring zones differed by exactly one hour.  At first railroad time was synchronized by portable [[Railroad chronometer|chronometer]]s, and then later by [[telegraph]] and [[radio]] signals.

[[San Francisco]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gaisma.com/en/location/richmond-virginia.html&lt;/ref&gt; is at 122.41°W longitude and [[Richmond, Virginia]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gaisma.com/en/location/san-francisco-california.html&lt;/ref&gt; is at 77.46°W longitude.  They are both at about 37.6°N latitude (±.2°).  The approximately 45° of longitude difference translates into about 180 minutes, or 3 hours, of time between sunsets in the two cities, for example.  San Francisco is in the [[Pacific Time]] zone, and Richmond is in the [[Eastern Time]] zone, which are three hours apart, so the local clocks in each city show that the sun sets at about the same time when using the local time zone.  But a phone call from Richmond to San Francisco at sunset will reveal that there are still three hours of daylight left in California.

====Length of the day====

On a flat Earth with an omnidirectional Sun, all places would experience the same amount of daylight every day, and all places would get daylight at the same time.  Actual day length varies considerably, with places closer to the poles getting very long days in the summer and very short days in the winter, with northerly summer happening at the same time as southerly winter.  Places north of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]] get no sunlight for at least one day a year, and get 24-hour sunlight for at least one day a year.  Both the poles experience sunlight for 6 months and darkness for 6 months, at opposite times.

The movement of daylight between the northern and southern hemispheres happens because of the [[axial tilt]] of the Earth.  The imaginary line around which the Earth spins, which goes between the North Pole and South Pole, is tilted about 23° from the oval that describes its orbit around the Sun.  The Earth always points in the same direction as it moves around the Sun, so for half the year ([[summer]] in the Northern Hemisphere), the North Pole is pointed slightly toward the Sun, keeping it in daylight all the time because the Sun lights up the half of the Earth that is facing it (and the North Pole is always in that half due to the tilt).  For the other half of the orbit, the South Pole is tilted slightly toward the Sun, and it is [[winter]] in the Northern Hemisphere.  This means that at the equator, the Sun is not directly overhead at noon, except around the [[autumnal equinox]] and [[vernal equinox]], when one spot on the equator is pointed directly at the Sun.

The length of the day varies because as the Earth rotates some places (near the poles) pass through only a short curve near the top or bottom of the sunlight half; other places (near the equator) travel along much longer curves through the middle.

The length of [[twilight]] would be very different on a flat Earth. On a round Earth, the atmosphere above the ground is lit for a while before sunrise and after sunset are observed at ground level, because the Sun is still visible from higher altitudes.  Longer twilights are observed at higher latitudes (near the poles) due to a shallower angle of the Sun's apparent movement compared to the horizon.  On a flat Earth, the Sun's shadow would reach the upper atmosphere very quickly, except near the closest edge of the Earth, and would always set at the same angle to the ground (which is not what is observed).  The "spotlight Sun" theory is also not consistent with this observation, since the air cannot be lit without the ground below it also being lit (except for shadows of mountains and other surface obstacles).

====Determining the shape of the Earth====

On a given day, if many different cities measure the angle of the Sun at local noon, the resulting data, when combined with the known distances between cities, shows that the Earth has 180 degrees of north-south curvature.  (A full range of angles will be observed if the north and south poles are included, and the day chosen is either the autumnal or spring equinox.)  This is consistent with many rounded shapes, including a sphere, and is inconsistent with a flat shape.

Some claim that this experiment assumes a very distant Sun, such that the incoming rays are essentially parallel, and if a flat Earth is assumed, that the measured angles can allow one to calculate the distance to the Sun, which must be small enough that its incoming rays are not very parallel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=58309.0#.VuJqbULlyPZ&lt;/ref&gt; However, if more than two relatively well-separated cities are included in the experiment, the calculation will make clear whether the Sun is distant or nearby.  For example, on the equinox, the 0 degree angle from the North Pole and the 90 degree angle from the equator predict a Sun which would have to be located essentially next to the surface of a flat Earth, but the difference in angle between the equator and New York City would predict a Sun much further away if the Earth is flat.  Because these results are contradictory, the surface of the Earth cannot be flat; the data ''is'' consistent with a nearly spherical Earth and a Sun which is very far away compared with the diameter of the Earth.

====Determining the size of the Earth====

Using the knowledge that the Sun is very far away, the ancient Greek geographer Eratosthenes [[Eratosthenes#Measurement_of_the_Earth.27s_circumference|performed an experiment]] using the differences in the observed angle of the Sun from two different locations to calculate the circumference of the Earth. Though modern telecommunications and timekeeping were not available, he was able to make sure the measurements happened at the same time by having them taken when the Sun was highest in the sky (local noon) at both locations. Using slightly inaccurate assumptions about the locations of two cities, he came to a result within 15% of the correct value.

====Watching the sun set twice====

On level ground, the difference in the distance to the horizon between lying down and standing up is large enough to watch the Sun set twice by quickly standing up immediately after seeing it set for the first time while lying down.  This also can be done with a [[cherry picker]]&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.xkcd.com/2009/04/06/a-date-idea-analyzed/&lt;/ref&gt; or a tall building with a fast elevator.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/5917230/did-you-know-that-the-burj-khalifa-is-so-tall-that-you-can-watch-two-sunsets-on-the-same-day Did You Know That the Burj Khalifa Is So Tall That you Can Watch Two Sunsets On the Same Day?]&lt;/ref&gt; On a flat Earth, one would not be able to see the Sun again (unless standing near the edge closest to the Sun) due to a much faster-moving Sun shadow.&lt;ref name="headsup" /&gt; 

When the supersonic [[Concorde]] took off not long after sunset from London and flew westward to New York faster than the sunset was advancing westward on the ground, passengers observed a sunrise in the west. After landing in New York, passengers saw a second sunset in the west.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/concorde-and-supersonic-travel-the-days-when-the-sun-rose-in-the-west-8888836.html Concorde and supersonic travel: The days when the sun rose in the west]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the speed of the Sun's shadow is slower in polar regions (due to the steeper angle), even a subsonic aircraft can overtake the sunset when flying at high latitudes. One photographer used a roughly circular route around the North Pole to take pictures of 24 sunsets in the same 24-hour period, pausing westward progress in each time zone to let the shadow of the Sun catch up.&lt;ref name="twenty_four"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2788267/here-comes-suns-photographer-travels-time-zone-capture-24-sunsets-one-day.html Here comes the suns! Photographer travels through every time zone to capture 24 sunsets in ONE DAY]&lt;/ref&gt; The surface of the Earth rotates at {{convert|180.17|mph}} at 80° north or south, and {{convert|1040.4|mph}} at the equator.&lt;ref name="twenty_four" /&gt;

===Spherical vs. flat triangles===
[[Image:Triangles (spherical geometry).jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram showing how the interior angles of triangles add up to about 180° when plotted on a small, nearly flat area of the Earth, but add up to more than 180° (in this case 230°) when plotted on a large area with significant curvature]]
Because the Earth is spherical, long-distance travel sometimes requires heading in different directions than one would head on a flat Earth.

For example, consider an airplane that travels {{convert|10000|km}} in a straight line, takes a 90-degree right turn, travels another {{convert|10000|km}}, takes another 90-degree right turn, and travels {{convert|10000|km}} a third time.  On a flat Earth, the aircraft would have travelled along three sides of a square, and arrive at a spot about {{convert|10000|km}} from where it started. But because the Earth is spherical, in reality it will have travelled along three sides of a triangle, and arrive back very close to its starting point.  If the starting point is the North Pole, it would have travelled due south from the North Pole to the equator, then west for a quarter of the way around the Earth, and then due north back to the North Pole.

In [[spherical geometry]], the sum of angles inside a triangle is greater than 180° (in this example 270°, having arrived back at the north pole a 90° angle to the departure path) unlike on a flat surface, where it is always exactly 180°.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/tripleright.jpg Triple-right triangle on a sphere (image)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grids are distorted by spherical ground===

A [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of [[longitude]] is a line where local solar noon occurs at the same time each day.  These lines define "north" and "south".  These are perpendicular to lines of [[latitude]] that define "east" and "west", where the Sun is at the same angle at local noon on the same day.  If the Sun were travelling from east to west over a flat Earth, meridian lines would always be the same distance apart - they would form a square grid when combined with lines of latitude. In reality, meridian lines get farther apart as one travels toward the equator, which is only possible on a round Earth.  In places where land is plotted on a grid system, this causes discontinuities in the grid.  For example, in areas of the [[Midwestern United States]] that use the [[Public Land Survey System]], the northernmost and westernmost sections of a [[township]] deviate from what would otherwise be an exact square mile.  The resulting discontinuities are sometimes reflected directly in local roads, which have kinks where the grid cannot follow completely straight lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/gerco-de-ruijter-grid-corrections-highways-driving-wichita Mysterious Detour While Driving? It Could Be Due to the Curvature of the Earth]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weather systems===

Low-pressure weather systems with inward winds (such as a [[hurricane]]) spin counterclockwise north of the equator, but clockwise south of the equator.  This is due to the [[Coriolis force]], and requires that (assuming they are attached to each other and rotating in the same direction) the north and southern halves of the Earth are angled in opposite directions (e.g. the north is facing toward Polaris and the south is facing away from it).

===Gravity===

The laws of [[gravity]], [[chemistry]], and [[physics]] that explain the formation and rounding of the Earth are well-tested through experiment, and applied successfully to many engineering tasks.

From these laws, we know the amount of mass the Earth contains, and that a non-spherical planet the size of the Earth would not be able to support itself against its own gravity.  A flat disc the size of the Earth, for example, would likely crack, heat up, liquefy, and re-form into a roughly spherical shape.  On a disc strong enough to maintain its shape, gravity would not pull downward with respect to the surface, but would pull toward the center of the disc,&lt;ref name="smarter" /&gt; contrary to what is observed on level terrain (and which would create major problems with oceans flowing toward the center of the disk).

Ignoring the other concerns, some flat Earth theorists explain the observed surface "gravity" by proposing that the flat Earth is constantly accelerating upwards.&lt;ref name="takes" /&gt; Such a theory would also leave open for explanation the [[tide]]s seen in Earth's oceans, which are conventionally explained by the gravity exerted by the Sun and Moon.

===Technology===

Observation of [[Foucault pendulum]]s, popular in science museums around the world, demonstrate both that the world is spherical and that it rotates (not that the stars are rotating around it).

The mathematics of navigation by [[GPS]] assume that satellites are moving in known orbits around an approximately spherical surface.  The accuracy of GPS navigation in determining latitude and longitude and the way these numbers map onto locations on the ground show that these assumptions are correct.  The same is true for the operational [[GLONASS]] system run by Russia, and the in-development European [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], Chinese [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|BeiDou]], and Indian [[Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System|IRNSS]].

Satellites, including communications satellites used for television, telephone, and Internet connections, would not stay in orbit unless the modern theory of gravitation were correct.  The details of which satellites are visible from which places on the ground at which times prove an approximately spherical shape of the Earth.  (Undersea cables are also used for intercontinental communications.)

Radio transmitters are mounted on tall towers because they generally rely on [[line-of-sight propagation]]. The distance to the [[horizon]] is further at higher altitude, so mounting them higher significantly increases the area they can serve.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popsci.com/bob-released-neil-degrasse-tyson-diss-track&lt;/ref&gt; Some signals can be transmitted at much longer distances, but only if they are at frequencies where they can use [[groundwave propagation]], [[tropospheric propagation]], [[tropospheric scatter]], or [[ionospheric propagation]] to reflect or refract signals around the curve of the Earth.

===Architecture===

The design of some large structures needs to take the shape of the Earth into account.  For example, the towers of the [[Humber Bridge]], although both vertical with respect to gravity, are {{convert|36|mm|in|1|abbr=in}} farther apart at the top than the bottom due to the local curvature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitgrimsby.co.uk/humber.htm|publisher=Visit Grimsby|title=The Humber Bridge|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hellenistic world====

Though the earliest written mention of a spherical Earth comes from ancient Greek sources, there is no account of how the sphericity of the Earth was discovered.&lt;ref name="evans47"&gt;James Evans, (1998), ''The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy'', page 47, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; A plausible explanation is that it was "the experience of travellers that suggested such an explanation for the variation in the observable [[altitude]] of the pole and the change in the area of circumpolar stars, a change that was quite drastic between [[Greek colonies|Greek settlements]]"&lt;ref name="Neugebauer.575–6"/&gt; around the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]], particularly those between the [[Nile Delta]] and [[Crimea]].&lt;ref name="Neugebauer.575–6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy|author=Otto E.

In ''The Histories'', written 431–425&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Herodotus]] cast doubt on a report of the Sun observed shining from the north. He stated that the phenomenon was observed during a [[circumnavigation]] of [[Africa]] undertaken by [[Phoenicia]]n explorers employed by [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[pharaoh]] [[Necho II]] c.&amp;nbsp;610–595&amp;nbsp;BC ([[s:History of Herodotus/Book 4|''The Histories'']], 4.42) who claimed to have had the Sun on their right when circumnavigating in a clockwise direction. To modern historians, these details confirm the truth of the Phoenicians' report and even open the possibility that the Phoenicians knew about the spherical model. However, nothing certain about their knowledge of geography and navigation has survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friis|first=Herman Ralph|title=The Pacific Basin: A History of Its Geographical Exploration|date=1967|publisher=[[American Geographical Society]]|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veuwAAAAIAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pythagoras=====
Early Greek philosophers alluded to a spherical Earth, though with some ambiguity.&lt;ref name="dicks1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dicks |first=D.R. |title=Early Greek Astronomy to Aristotle |pages=68 |date=1970 |isbn=978-0-8014-0561-7 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pythagoras]] (6th century&amp;nbsp;BC) was among those said to have originated the idea, but this might reflect the ancient Greek practice of ascribing every discovery to one or another of their ancient wise men.&lt;ref name="evans47"/&gt; Some idea of the sphericity of the Earth seems to have been known to both [[Parmenides]] and [[Empedocles]] in the 5th century&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name="kahn53"&gt;Charles H.

&lt;/ref&gt; After the 5th century&amp;nbsp;BC, no Greek writer of repute thought the world was anything but round.&lt;ref name="dicks1" /&gt;

=====Plato=====
[[Plato]] (427–347&amp;nbsp;BC) travelled to southern [[Italy]] to study [[Pythagorean mathematics]]. When he returned to [[Athens]] and established his school, Plato also taught his students that Earth was a sphere, though he offered no justifications. "My conviction is that the Earth is a round body in the centre of the heavens, and therefore has no need of air or of any similar force to be a support".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Phaedo]]|author=Plato|page=108|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; If man could soar high above the clouds, Earth would resemble "one of those balls which have leather coverings in twelve pieces, and is decked with various colours, of which the colours used by painters on Earth are in a manner samples."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=Phaedo|author=Plato|page=110b|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], his one work that was available throughout the Middle Ages in Latin, we read that the Creator "made the world in the form of a globe, round as from a lathe, having its extremes in every direction equidistant from the centre, the most perfect and the most like itself of all figures",&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=Timaeus|author=Plato|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the word "world" here refers to the heavens.

=====Aristotle=====
[[File:20080816eclipsed2.jpg|thumb|150px|Round Earth umbra during the [[August 2008 lunar eclipse]]]]
[[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC) was Plato's prize student and "the mind of the school".&lt;ref&gt;David Johnson and Thomas Mowry, ''Mathematics: A Practical Odyssey'', [[Cengage Learning]], 2011, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle observed "there are [[star]]s seen in [[Egypt]] and [...] [[Cyprus]] which are not seen in the northerly regions." Since this could only happen on a curved surface, he too believed Earth was a sphere "of no great size, for otherwise the effect of so slight a change of place would not be quickly apparent." (''De caelo'', 298a2–10)

Aristotle provided physical and observational arguments supporting the idea of a spherical Earth:

* Every portion of the Earth tends toward the centre until by compression and convergence they form a sphere. (''De caelo'', 297a9–21)
* Travelers going south see southern constellations rise higher above the horizon; and
* The shadow of Earth on the Moon during a [[lunar eclipse]] is round. (''De caelo'', 297b31–298a10).

The concepts of symmetry, equilibrium and cyclic repetition permeated Aristotle's work. In his [[Meteorology (Aristotle)|''Meteorology'']] he divided the world into five climatic zones: two temperate areas separated by a torrid zone near the [[equator]], and two cold inhospitable regions, "one near our upper or northern pole and the other near the [[...]] southern pole," both impenetrable and girdled with ice (''Meteorologica'', 362a31–35). Although no humans could survive in the frigid zones, inhabitants in the southern temperate regions could exist.

[[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|Aristotle's theory of natural place]] relied on a spherical Earth to explain why [[Earth (classical element)|heavy things]] go down (toward what Aristotle believed was the center of the Universe), and things like [[Air (classical element)|air]] and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] go up. In this [[geocentric model]], the structure of the universe was believed to be a series of perfect spheres. The Sun, Moon, planets and fixed stars were believed to move on [[celestial spheres]] around a stationary Earth.

Though Aristotle's theory of physics survived in the Christian world for many centuries, the [[heliocentric model]] was eventually shown to be a more correct explanation of the [[Solar System]] than the geocentric model, and [[atomic theory]] was shown to be a more correct explanation of the nature of matter than [[classical element]]s like earth, water, air, fire, and aether.

=====Archimedes=====
In proposition 2 of the First Book of his treatise "On floating bodies," [[Archimedes]] demonstrates that "The surface of any fluid at rest is the surface of a sphere whose centre is the same as that of the earth,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | translator-last = Heath | translator-first = T.

=====Eratosthenes=====
[[Eratosthenes]], a Greek [[Hellenistic astronomy|astronomer]] from [[Hellenistic]] [[Cyrenaica]] (276–194&amp;nbsp;BC), estimated [[Earth]]'s circumference around 240&amp;nbsp;BC. He had heard that in [[Syene]] the [[Sun]] was directly overhead at the summer [[solstice]] whereas in [[Alexandria]] it still cast a shadow. Using the differing angles the shadows made as the basis of his trigonometric calculations he estimated a circumference of around 250,000 ''[[Ancient Greek units of measurement|stades]]''. The length of a 'stade' is not precisely known, but Eratosthenes's figure only has an error of around five to fifteen percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Albert | last = Van Helden | title = Measuring the Universe: Cosmic Dimensions from Aristarchus to Halley | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 1985 | pages = 4–5 | isbn = 0-226-84882-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/F_JSC_NES_School_Measures_Up.html|title=JSC NES School Measures Up|publisher=NASA|date=11 April 2006|accessdate=7 Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Scolumb.htm|title=The Round Earth|publisher=NASA|date=12 December 2004|accessdate=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eratosthenes used rough estimates and round numbers, but depending on the length of the [[stadia (length)|stadion]], his result is within a margin of between 2% and 20% of the actual [[meridional]] [[circumference]], {{convert|40008|km}}. Note that [[Eratosthenes]] could only measure the circumference of the Earth by assuming that the [[distance to the Sun]] is so great that the rays of [[sunlight]] are practically [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Lloyd | first = G.

Seventeen hundred years after Eratosthenes, Christopher Columbus studied Eratosthenes's findings before sailing west for the Indies. However, ultimately he rejected Eratosthenes in favour of other maps and arguments that interpreted Earth's circumference to be a third smaller than reality. If, instead, Columbus had accepted Eratosthenes findings, then he may have never gone west, since he didn't have the supplies or funding needed for the much longer voyage.&lt;ref&gt;

=====Seleucus of Seleucia=====
[[Seleucus of Seleucia]] (c.&amp;nbsp;190&amp;nbsp;BC), who lived in the city of [[Seleucia]] in [[Mesopotamia]], wrote that the Earth is spherical (and actually orbits the [[Sun]], influenced by the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]] of [[Aristarchus of Samos]]).

=====Posidonius=====
[[Posidonius]] (c. 135 – 51 BC) put faith in Eratosthenes's method, though by observing the star [[Canopus]], rather than the sun in establishing the Earth's circumference. In Ptolemy's ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'', his result was favoured over that of Eratosthenes. Posidonius furthermore expressed the distance of the sun in earth radii.

====Roman Empire====
From its Greek origins, the idea of a spherical earth, along with much of [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomical thought]], slowly spread across the globe and ultimately became the adopted view in all major astronomical traditions.&lt;ref name="Krüger: Roman and medieval continuation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ragep: Islamic adoption"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pingree: Indian adoption"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martzloff, Cullen: Chinese adoption"/&gt;

In the West, the idea came to the Romans through the lengthy process of cross-fertilization with [[Hellenistic civilization]]. Many Roman authors such as [[Cicero]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] refer in their works to the rotundity of the earth as a matter of course.&lt;ref name="Reinhard Krüger"&gt;Krüger, Reinhard: [https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/bitstream/11682/5268/1/ReinhardKrueger.pdf "Ein Versuch über die Archäologie der Globalisierung.

=====Strabo=====
[[File:Shiphorp.jpg|thumb|When a ship is at the horizon, its [[Hull-down|lower part is obscured]] by the Earth's curvature. This was one of the first arguments favouring a round-Earth model.]]
It has been suggested that seafarers probably provided the first observational evidence that the Earth was not flat, based on observations of the [[horizon]]. This argument was put forward by the geographer [[Strabo]] (c.&amp;nbsp;64&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– 24&amp;nbsp;AD), who suggested that the spherical shape of the Earth was probably known to seafarers around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] since at least the time of [[Homer]],&lt;ref name=strabo&gt;Hugh Thurston, ''Early Astronomy'', (New York: Springer-Verlag), p. 118. {{ISBN|0-387-94107-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; citing a line from the ''[[Odyssey]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'', Bk. 5 393: "As he rose on the swell he looked eagerly ahead, and could see land quite near." [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler's]] translation is [http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/odyssey.5.v.html#284 available online].&lt;/ref&gt; as indicating that the poet [[Homer]] knew of this as early as the 7th or 8th century BC. [[Strabo]] cited various phenomena observed at sea as suggesting that the Earth was spherical. He observed that elevated lights or areas of land were visible to sailors at greater distances than those less elevated, and stated that the curvature of the sea was obviously responsible for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title= The Geography of Strabo, in Eight Volumes | author= Strabo | others= Loeb Classical Library edition, translated by Horace Leonard Jones, A.M., Ph.D. | date= 1960 | origyear= 1917 | location= London | publisher= William Heinemann }}, Vol.I Bk.

=====Claudius Ptolemy=====
[[Claudius Ptolemy]] (90–168&amp;nbsp;AD) lived in [[Alexandria]], the centre of scholarship in the 2nd century. In the ''[[Almagest]],'' which remained the standard work of astronomy for 1,400 years, he advanced many arguments for the spherical nature of the Earth. Among them was the observation that when a ship is sailing towards [[mountain]]s, observers note these seem to rise from the sea, indicating that they were hidden by the curved surface of the sea. He also gives separate arguments that the Earth is curved north-south and that it is curved east-west.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ptolemy | title = Almagest | pages = I.4}} as quoted in {{Cite book| first = Edward | last = Grant | title = A Source Book in Medieval Science | publisher = Harvard University Press | date = 1974 | pages = 63–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He compiled an eight-volume ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' covering what was known about the earth. The first part of the ''Geographia'' is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. As with the model of the Solar System in the ''Almagest'', Ptolemy put all this information into a grand scheme. He assigned [[coordinate]]s to all the places and geographic features he knew, in a [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] that spanned the globe (although most of this has been lost). [[Latitude]] was measured from the [[equator]], as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred to express it as the length of the longest day rather than [[degree (angle)|degrees of arc]] (the length of the [[midsummer]] day increases from 12h to 24h as you go from the equator to the [[polar circle]]). He put the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of 0 [[longitude]] at the most western land he knew, the [[Canary Islands]].

''Geographia'' indicated the countries of "[[Seres|Serica]]" and "Sinae" ([[China]]) at the extreme right, beyond the island of "Taprobane" ([[Sri Lanka]], oversized) and the "Aurea Chersonesus" ([[Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian peninsula]]).

Ptolemy also devised and provided instructions on how to create maps both of the whole inhabited world (''oikoumenè'') and of the Roman provinces. In the second part of the ''Geographia,'' he provided the necessary [[topographic]] lists, and captions for the maps. His ''oikoumenè'' spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Canary Islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to [[China]], and about 81 degrees of latitude from the Arctic to the [[East Indies]] and deep into [[Africa]]. Ptolemy was well aware that he knew about only a quarter of the globe.

=====Late Antiquity=====
Knowledge of the spherical shape of the Earth was received in scholarship of [[Late Antiquity]] as a matter of course, in both [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Early Christianity]]. [[Calcidius]]'s fourth-century [[Latin language|Latin]] commentary on and translation of Plato's ''Timaeus'', which was one of the few examples of Greek scientific thought that was known in the Early Middle Ages in Western Europe, discussed [[Hipparchus]]'s use of the geometrical circumstances of eclipses to compute the [[On Sizes and Distances|relative diameters]] of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McCluskey | first = Stephen C. | title = Astronomies and Cultures in Early Medieval Europe | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 1998 | pages = 119–120 | isbn = 978-0-521-77852-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Calcidius | author-link = Calcidius | editor-last = Klibansky| editor-first = Raymond| editor-link = Raymond Klibansky| date = 1962 | title = Timaeus a Calcidio translatus commentarioque instructus | series = Corpus Platonicum Medii Aevi, Plato Latinus | volume = 4 | publisher = Brill / Warburg Institute| publication-place = Leiden / London | pages = 141–144 | isbn = 9780854810529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theological doubt informed by the [[flat Earth]] model implied in the [[Hebrew Bible]] inspired some early Christian scholars such as [[Lactantius]], [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], but this remained an eccentric current. Learned Christian authors such as [[Basil of Caesarea]], [[Ambrose]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] were clearly aware of the sphericity of the Earth. "Flat Earthism" lingered longest in [[Syriac Christianity]], which tradition laid greater importance on a literalist interpretation of the Old Testament. Authors from that tradition, such as [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]], presented the Earth as flat as late as in the 6th century. This last remnant of the ancient model of the cosmos disappeared during the 7th century. From the 8th century and the beginning [[Early Middle Ages|medieval period]], "no cosmographer worthy of note has called into question the sphericity of the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Anselm Vogel, "Sphaera terrae – das mittelalterliche Bild der Erde und die kosmographische Revolution," PhD dissertation Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, 1995, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
Greek ethnographer [[Megasthenes]], c.&amp;nbsp;300&amp;nbsp;BC, has been interpreted as stating that the contemporary Brahmans believed in a spherical earth as the center of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

The works of the classical [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomer]] and [[Indian mathematics|mathematician]], [[Aryabhatta]] (476–550 AD), deal with the sphericity of the Earth and the motion of the planets. The final two parts of his [[Sanskrit]] magnum opus, the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'', which were named the ''Kalakriya'' ("reckoning of time") and the ''Gol'' ("sphere"), state that the Earth is spherical and that its circumference is 4,967 [[yojana]]s.

===Middle Ages===
Knowledge of the sphericity of the Earth survived into the medieval corpus of knowledge by direct transmission of the texts of Greek antiquity ([[Aristotle]]), and via authors such as [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Beda Venerabilis]].
It became increasingly traceable with the rise of [[scholasticism]] and [[Medieval university|medieval learning]].&lt;ref name="Reinhard Krüger"/&gt;
Spread of this knowledge beyond the immediate sphere of Greco-Roman scholarship was necessarily gradual, associated with the pace of [[Christianisation]] of Europe. For example, the first evidence of knowledge of the spherical shape of the Earth in [[Scandinavia]] is a 12th-century [[Old Icelandic]] translation of ''[[Elucidarius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Simek, ''Altnordische Kosmographie'', Berlin, 1990, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-exhaustive list of more than a hundred [[Latin]] and vernacular writers from [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]] who were aware that the earth was spherical has been compiled by Reinhard Krüger, professor for Romance literature at the [[University of Stuttgart]].&lt;ref name="Reinhard Krüger"/&gt;{{seemore|message=Krüger's list of the 79 authors known by name can be studied by clicking on}}

;Isidore of Seville
Bishop [[Isidore of Seville]] (560–636) taught in his widely read encyclopedia, ''The [[Etymologiae|Etymologies]],'' that the Earth was "round".&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''Etymologiae,'' XIV.ii.1 [3].&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop's confusing exposition and choice of imprecise Latin terms have divided scholarly opinion on whether he meant a sphere or a disk or even whether he meant anything specific.&lt;ref&gt;Referring to Isidore's five circles in ''De Natura Rerum'' X 5, ERnest Brehaut wrote: "The explanation of the passage and of the figure which illustrates it seems to be that Isidore accepted the terminology of the spherical earth from Hyginus without taking the time to understand it—if indeed he had the ability to do so—and applied it without compunction to the flat earth." {{cite book|title=Encyclopedist of the Flat Earth|author=Ernest Brehaut|page=30|date=1912}} Similarly, J. Fontaine refers to this passage as a "scientific absurdity".{{cite book|title=Traité de la Nature|author=Isidore of Seville|editor=J. Fontaine|date=1960|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable recent scholars claim that he taught a spherical earth.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley M. Stevens, "The Figure of the Earth in Isidore's 'De natura rerum," ''Isis'', 71(1980): 268–277.&lt;/ref&gt; Isidore did not admit the possibility of people dwelling at the antipodes, considering them as legendary&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''Etymologiae,'' XIV.v.17 [4].&lt;/ref&gt; and noting that there was no evidence for their existence.&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''Etymologiae,'' IX.ii.133 [5].&lt;/ref&gt;

;Bede the Venerable

The monk [[Bede]] (c.&amp;nbsp;672–735) wrote in his influential treatise on computus, ''The Reckoning of Time'', that the Earth was round. He explained the unequal length of daylight from "the roundness of the Earth, for not without reason is it called 'the orb of the world' on the pages of Holy Scripture and of ordinary literature. It is, in fact, set like a sphere in the middle of the whole universe." (De temporum ratione, 32). The large number of surviving manuscripts of ''The Reckoning of Time,'' copied to meet the Carolingian requirement that all priests should study the computus, indicates that many, if not most, priests were exposed to the idea of the sphericity of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Faith Wallis, trans., ''Bede: The Reckoning of Time,'' (Liverpool: Liverpool Univ. Pr., 2004), pp. lxxxv–lxxxix.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ælfric of Eynsham]] paraphrased Bede into Old English, saying, "Now the Earth's roundness and the Sun's orbit constitute the obstacle to the day's being equally long in every land."&lt;ref&gt;Ælfric of Eynsham, ''On the Seasons of the Year,'' Peter Baker, trans&lt;/ref&gt;

Bede was lucid about earth's sphericity, writing "We call the earth a globe, not as if the shape of a sphere were expressed in the diversity of plains and mountains, but because, if all things are included in the outline, the earth's circumference will represent the figure of a perfect globe... For truly it is an orb placed in the centre of the universe; in its width it is like a circle, and not circular like a shield but rather like a ball, and it extends from its centre with perfect roundness on all sides."&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;Russell, Jeffrey B. 1991. ''Inventing the Flat Earth''. New York: Praeger Publishers. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Anania Shirakatsi
The 7th-century [[Armenia]]n scholar [[Anania Shirakatsi]] described the world as "being like an egg with a spherical yolk (the globe) surrounded by a layer of white (the atmosphere) and covered with a hard shell (the sky)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hewsen |first1=Robert H. |authorlink1=Robert H.

====Islamic astronomy====
[[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Islamic astronomy]] was developed on the basis of a spherical earth inherited from [[Hellenistic astronomy]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia of Islam: Astronomy"&gt;Ragep, F. Jamil: "Astronomy", in: Krämer, Gudrun (ed.) et al.: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', THREE, Brill 2010, without page numbers&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic theoretical framework largely relied on the fundamental contributions of [[Aristotle]] (''[[De caelo]]'') and [[Ptolemy]] (''[[Almagest]]''), both of whom worked from the premise that the earth was spherical and at the centre of the universe ([[geocentric model]]).&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia of Islam: Astronomy"/&gt;

Early Islamic scholars recognized Earth's sphericity,&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad Hamidullah]]. ''L'Islam et son impulsion scientifique originelle'', Tiers-Monde, 1982, vol. 23, n° 92, p. 789.&lt;/ref&gt; leading [[Islamic mathematics|Muslim mathematicians]] to develop [[spherical trigonometry]]&lt;ref&gt;David A. King, ''Astronomy in the Service of Islam'', (Aldershot (U.K.): Variorum), 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to further mensuration and to calculate the distance and direction from any given point on the Earth to [[Mecca]]. This determined the ''[[Qibla]],'' or Muslim direction of prayer.

;Al-Ma'mun
Around 830&amp;nbsp;AD, Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] commissioned a group of [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]] and [[Islamic geography|geographers]] to measure the distance from Tadmur ([[Palmyra]]) to [[Raqqa]] in modern Syria. They found the cities to be separated by one degree of [[latitude]] and the [[meridian arc]] distance between them to be 66{{frac|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;miles and thus calculated the Earth's circumference to be 24,000&amp;nbsp;miles.&lt;ref&gt;''Gharā'ib al-funūn wa-mulah al-`uyūn'' (The Book of Curiosities of the Sciences and Marvels for the Eyes), 2.1 "On the mensuration of the Earth and its division into seven climes, as related by Ptolemy and others," (ff. 22b–23a)[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/bookofcuriosities]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another estimate given by his astronomers was 56{{frac|2|3}} Arabic miles (111.8&amp;nbsp;km) per degree, which corresponds to a circumference of 40,248&amp;nbsp;km, very close to the currently modern values of 111.3&amp;nbsp;km per degree and 40,068&amp;nbsp;km circumference, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Kennedy, ''Mathematical Geography'', pp=187–8, in {{Harv|Rashed|Morelon|1996|pp=185–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Ibn Hazm
[[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[polymath]] [[Ibn Hazm]] stated that the proof of the Earth's sphericity "is that the Sun is always vertical to a particular spot on Earth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/how-islamic-inventors-changed-the-world-6106905.html "How Islamic inventors changed the world"]. ''[[The Independent]]''. March 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Al-Farghānī
[[Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathīr al-Farghānī|Al-Farghānī]] (Latinized as Alfraganus) was a Persian astronomer of the 9th century involved in measuring the diameter of the Earth, and commissioned by Al-Ma'mun. His estimate given above for a degree (56{{frac|2|3}} Arabic miles) was much more accurate than the 60{{frac|2|3}} Roman miles (89.7&amp;nbsp;km) given by Ptolemy. [[Christopher Columbus]] uncritically used Alfraganus's figure as if it were in Roman miles instead of in Arabic miles, in order to prove a smaller size of the Earth than that propounded by Ptolemy.&lt;ref&gt;Felipe Fernández-Armesto, ''Columbus and the Conquest of the Impossible'', pp. 20–1, Phoenix Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Biruni
[[File:Abu Reyhan Biruni-Earth Circumference.svg|thumb|Biruni's method for calculation of Earth's radius]]
[[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] (973–1048) used a new method to accurately compute the Earth's [[circumference]], by which he arrived at a value that was close to modern values for the Earth's circumference.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Aber (2003). Alberuni calculated the Earth's circumference at a small town of Pind Dadan Khan, District Jhelum, Punjab, Pakistan.[http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/histgeol/biruni/biruni.htm Abu Rayhan al-Biruni], [[Emporia State University]].&lt;/ref&gt; His estimate of 6,339.6&amp;nbsp;km for the [[Earth radius]] was only 31.4&amp;nbsp;km less than the modern mean value of 6,371.0&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="Moritz2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moritz |first=H. |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=March 2000 |title=Geodetic Reference System 1980 |journal=Journal of Geodesy |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=128–133 |doi=10.1007/s001900050278 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/0bgccvjj5bedgdfu/about/ |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 2000JGeod..74..128. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to his predecessors, who measured the Earth's circumference by sighting the Sun simultaneously from two different locations, Biruni developed a new method of using [[Trigonometry|trigonometric]] calculations based on the angle between a [[plain]] and [[mountain]] top. This yielded more accurate measurements of the Earth's circumference and made it possible for a single person to measure it from a single location.&lt;ref&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (1992), ''Avicenna'', p. 31, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-01929-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Savizi&gt;

Biruni's method was intended to avoid "walking across hot, dusty deserts," and the idea came to him when he was on top of a tall mountain in India. From the top of the mountain, he sighted the angle to the horizon which, along with the mountain's height (which he calculated beforehand), allowed him to calculate the curvature of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Chicago Press| isbn = 978-0-226-31635-2| pages = 182–184| editor = J.

According to John J. O'Connor and Edmund F. Robertson,
{{quote|Important contributions to [[geodesy]] and [[Islamic geography|geography]] were also made by Biruni. He introduced techniques to measure the earth and distances on it using [[triangulation]]. He found the [[Earth radius|radius of the earth]] to be 6339.6 km, a value not obtained in the West until the 16th century.

;Applications
Muslim scholars who held to the round Earth theory used it for a quintessentially Islamic purpose: to calculate the distance and direction from any given point on the Earth to [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;In the 11th century, [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|al-Biruni]] used spherical trigonometry to find the direction of Mecca from many cities and published it in ''The Determination of the Co-ordinates of Cities''. See Lyons, 2009, p85&lt;/ref&gt; This determined the [[Qibla]], or Muslim direction of prayer.

A terrestrial globe (Kura-i-ard) was among the presents sent by the Persian Muslim astronomer [[Jamal ad-Din (astronomer)|Jamal-al-Din]] to [[Kublai Khan]]'s [[China|Chinese]] court in 1267. It was made of wood on which "seven parts of water are represented in green, three parts of land in white, with rivers, lakes etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1959|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho Peng Yoke remarks that "it did not seem to have any general appeal to the Chinese in those days".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Ho Peng Yoke|title=Li, Qi and Shu, An introduction to Science and Civilisation in China|date=1985|publisher=New York, Dover Publications|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====High and late medieval Europe====

[[File:John Gower world Vox Clamantis.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Gower]] prepares to shoot the world, a sphere with compartments representing earth, air, and water (''[[Vox Clamantis]]'', around 1400)]]
During the [[High Middle Ages]], the astronomical knowledge in Christian Europe was extended beyond what was transmitted directly from ancient authors by transmission of learning from [[Medieval Islamic astronomy]]. An early student of such learning was Gerbert d'Aurillac, the later [[Pope Sylvester II]].

Saint Hildegard ([[Hildegard von Bingen]], 1098–1179), depicted the spherical earth several times in her work ''Liber Divinorum Operum''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/galileopalazzostrozzi/object/HildegardOfBingenLiberDivinorumOperum.html Hildegard of Bingen, Liber divinorum operum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes de Sacrobosco]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1195 – c.&amp;nbsp;1256&amp;nbsp;AD) wrote a famous work on Astronomy called ''[[Tractatus de Sphaera]],'' based on Ptolemy, which primarily considers the sphere of the sky. However, it contains clear proofs of the earth's sphericity in the first chapter.&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Pedersen, "In Quest of Sacrobosco", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy,'' 16(1985): 175–221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=The Sphere of Sacrobosco|others=trans. Lynn Thorndike|date=1949|url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] commentators on Aristotle's ''[[On the Heavens]]'' and Sacrobosco's ''Treatise on the Sphere'' unanimously agreed that the earth is spherical or round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Grant | first = Edward | author-link = Edward Grant | title = Planets, Stars, &amp; Orbs: The Medieval Cosmos, 1200–1687 | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 1996 | pages = 620–622, 737–738 | isbn = 0-521-56509-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant observes that no author who had studied at a [[medieval university]] thought that the earth was flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Grant | first = Edward | author-link = Edward Grant | title = God and Reason in the Middle Ages | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 2001 | page = 339 | isbn = 0-521-00337-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Elucidarium'' of [[Honorius Augustodunensis]] (c. 1120), an important manual for the instruction of lesser clergy, which was translated into [[Middle English]], [[Old French]], [[Middle High German]], [[Old Russian]], [[Middle Dutch]], [[Old Norse]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and several Italian dialects, explicitly refers to a spherical Earth. Likewise, the fact that [[Bertold von Regensburg]] (mid-13th century) used the spherical Earth as an illustration in a [[sermon]] shows that he could assume this knowledge among his congregation. The sermon was preached in the vernacular German, and thus was not intended for a learned audience.

Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]],'' written in Italian in the early 14th century, portrays Earth as a sphere, discussing implications such as the different stars visible in the [[southern hemisphere]], the altered position of the [[sun]], and the various [[timezone]]s of the Earth.

The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] exploration of [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s voyage to the [[Americas]] (1492) and, finally, [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s circumnavigation of the earth (1519–21) provided practical evidence of the global shape of the earth.

===Early Modern period===

====Circumnavigation of the globe====
{{further|Age of Discovery}}
[[File:Behaims Erdapfel.jpg|thumb|150px|The ''[[Erdapfel]]'', the oldest surviving terrestrial globe (1492/93)]]

The first direct demonstration of Earth's sphericity came in the form of the first circumnavigation in history, an expedition captained by Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]].&lt;ref&gt;Nowell, Charles E. ed. (1962). Magellan's Voyage around the World: Three Contemporary Accounts. Evanston: NU Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was financed by the Spanish Crown. On August 10, 1519, the five ships under Magellan's command departed from [[Seville]]. They crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean]], passed through what is now called the [[Strait of Magellan]], crossed the Pacific, and arrived in [[Cebu]], where Magellan was killed by Philippine natives in a battle. His second in command, the Spaniard [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], continued the expedition and, on September 6, 1522, arrived at Seville, completing the circumnavigation. [[Charles I of Spain]], in recognition of his feat, gave Elcano a [[coat of arms]] with the motto ''Primus circumdedisti me'' (in Latin, "You went around me first").&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs(2006), "The story of geographical discovery" p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

A circumnavigation alone does not prove that the earth is spherical. It could be cylindric or irregularly globular or one of many other shapes. Still, combined with trigonometric evidence of the form used by Eratosthenes 1,700 years prior, the Magellan expedition removed any reasonable doubt in educated circles in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = ICSE Geography IX|author = RK Jain|publisher = Ratna Sagar|page = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Transglobe Expedition]] (1979–1982) was the first expedition to make a circumpolar circumnavigation, traveling the world "vertically" traversing both of the poles of rotation using only surface transport.

====Ming China====
In the 17th century, the idea of a spherical Earth, now considerably advanced by [[Scientific revolution|Western astronomy]], ultimately spread to [[Ming China]], when [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]], who held high positions as astronomers at the imperial court, successfully challenged the Chinese belief that the Earth was flat and square.&lt;ref name="Jean-Claude Martzloff 69"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/ans/eastm/back/cs11/cs11-4-martzloff.pdf|title=Jean-Claude Martzloff, "Space and Time in Chinese Texts of Astronomy and of Mathematical Astronomy in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries", ''Chinese Science'' 11 (1993–94): 66–92 (69)|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305205943/http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/ans/eastm/back/cs11/cs11-4-martzloff.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Cullen (1980)"&gt;Christopher Cullen, “Joseph Needham on Chinese Astronomy”, ''Past and Present'', No. 87. (May, 1980), pp. 39–53 (42 &amp; 49)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Cullen (1976)"&gt;Christopher Cullen, "A Chinese Eratosthenes of the Flat Earth: A Study of a Fragment of Cosmology in Huai Nan Tzu 淮 南 子", ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', Vol. 39, No. 1 (1976), pp. 106–127 (107–109)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ge zhi cao'' (格致草) treatise of Xiong Mingyu (熊明遇) published in 1648 showed a printed picture of the Earth as a spherical globe, with the text stating that "the round Earth certainly has no square corners".&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 499"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. pp. 499.&lt;/ref&gt; The text also pointed out that sailing ships could return to their port of origin after circumnavigating the waters of the Earth.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 499"/&gt;

The influence of the map is distinctly Western, as traditional maps of Chinese cartography held the graduation of the sphere at 365.25 degrees, while the Western graduation was of 360 degrees. Also of interest to note is on one side of the world, there is seen towering [[Chinese pagoda]]s, while on the opposite side (upside-down) there were European [[cathedral]]s.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 499"/&gt; The adoption of European astronomy, facilitated by the failure of indigenous astronomy to make progress, was accompanied by a [[sinocentric]] reinterpretation that declared the imported ideas Chinese in origin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;European astronomy was so much judged worth consideration that numerous Chinese authors developed the idea that the Chinese of antiquity had anticipated most of the novelties presented by the missionaries as European discoveries, for example, the rotundity of the Earth and the "heavenly spherical star carrier model." Making skillful use of philology, these authors cleverly reinterpreted the greatest technical and literary works of Chinese antiquity. From this sprang a new science wholly dedicated to the demonstration of the Chinese origin of astronomy and more generally of all European science and technology.&lt;ref name="Jean-Claude Martzloff 69"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although mainstream Chinese science until the 17th century held the view that the earth was flat, square, and enveloped by the [[celestial sphere]], this idea was criticized by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin-dynasty]] scholar [[Yu Xi]] (fl. 307–345), who suggested that the Earth could be either square or round, in accordance with the shape of the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling. (1995) [1959]. ''Science and Civilization in China: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth'', vol. 3, reprint edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-05801-5}}, pp. 220, 498–499.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan-dynasty]] mathematician [[Li Ye (mathematician)|Li Ye]] (c. 1192–1279) firmly argued that the Earth was spherical, just like the shape of the heavens only smaller, since a square Earth would hinder the movement of the heavens and celestial bodies in his estimation.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling. (1995) [1959]. ''Science and Civilization in China: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth'', vol. 3, reprint edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-05801-5}}, pp. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th-century ''Ge zhi cao'' treatise also used the same terminology to describe the shape of the Earth that the [[Eastern Han dynasty|Eastern-Han]] scholar [[Zhang Heng]] (78–139 AD) had used to describe the shape of the sun and moon (i.e. that the former was as round as a [[crossbow]] bullet, and the latter was the shape of a ball).&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling. (1995) [1959]. ''Science and Civilization in China: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth'', vol. 3, reprint edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-05801-5}}, pp. 227, 499.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement and representation==
{{Main|Geodesy}}
[[Geodesy]], also called geodetics, is the scientific discipline that deals with the measurement and representation of the Earth, its [[gravitation]]al field and geodynamic phenomena ([[polar motion]], Earth [[tide]]s, and crustal motion) in three-dimensional time-varying space.

Geodesy is primarily concerned with positioning and the gravity field and geometrical aspects of their temporal variations, although it can also include the study of Earth's [[magnetic field]]. Especially in the [[German language|German]] speaking world, geodesy is divided into [[geomensuration]] ("Erdmessung" or "höhere Geodäsie"), which is concerned with measuring the Earth on a global scale, and [[Geophysical survey|surveying]] ("Ingenieurgeodäsie"), which is concerned with measuring parts of the surface.

The Earth's shape can be thought of in at least two ways;
* as the shape of the [[geoid]], the mean sea level of the world ocean; or
* as the shape of Earth's land surface as it rises above and falls below the sea.

As the science of [[geodesy]] measured Earth more accurately, the shape of the geoid was first found not to be a perfect sphere but to approximate an [[spheroid|oblate spheroid]], a specific type of [[ellipsoid]]. More recent measurements have measured the geoid to unprecedented accuracy, revealing [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentration]]s beneath Earth's surface.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5375">'''Technological evolution''' is a theory of radical transformation of society through technological development. This theory originated with [[Czechs|Czech]] philosopher [[Radovan Richta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Böhme|first1=Gernot|last2=Stehr|first2=Nico|title=The Knowledge Society: The Growing Impact of Scientific Knowledge on Social Relations|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789400947245|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3mdDBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=radovan%20richta%20describes%20the%20radical%20transformation%20of%20society%20through%20technological%20development&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=27 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of technological evolution==
''[[Mankind in Transition|Mankind In Transition]]; A View of the Distant Past, the Present and the Far Future'', Masefield Books, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloomfield|first1=Masse|title=The Automated Society; A View of the Distant Past, the Present and the Far Future|date=1993|publisher=Masefield Books|isbn=1879981025|url=http://massebloomfield.com/books/the-automated-society/|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Technology]] (which Richta defines as "a material entity created by the application of mental and physical effort to nature in order to achieve some value") evolves in three stages: tools, machine, automation. This evolution, he says, follows two trends:

===Development===
The pretechnological period, in which all other animal species remain today aside from some avian and primate species was a non-rational period of the early [[Prehistory|prehistoric man]].

The emergence of technology, made possible by the development of the rational faculty, paved the way for the first stage: the tool. A tool provides a mechanical advantage in accomplishing a physical task, such as an arrow, plow, or hammer that augments physical labor to more efficiently achieve his objective. Later animal-powered tools such as the plow and the horse, increased the productivity of food production about tenfold over the technology of the hunter-gatherers. Tools allow one to do things impossible to accomplish with one's body alone, such as seeing minute visual detail with a [[microscope]], manipulating heavy objects with a [[pulley]] and cart, or carrying volumes of water in a bucket.

The second technological stage was the creation of the [[machine]]. A machine (a powered machine to be more precise) is a tool that substitutes the element of human physical effort, and requires  only to control its function. Machines became widespread with the industrial revolution, though [[windmills]], a type of machine, are much older.

Examples of this include cars, trains, [[computers]], and lights. Machines allow humans to
Tremendously exceed the limitations of their bodies. Putting a machine on the farm, a tractor, increased food productivity at least tenfold over the technology of the plow and the horse.

The third, and final stage of technological evolution is the [[automation]]. The automation is a machine that removes the element of human control with an automatic algorithm. Examples of machines that exhibit this characteristic are [[digital watches]], automatic telephone switches, [[pacemakers]], and computer programs.

It's crucial to understand that the three stages outline the introduction of the fundamental types of technology, and so all three continue to be widely used today. A spear, a plow, a pen, a knife, a glove, a chicken and an optical microscope are all examples of tools.

===Theoretical implications===
The process of technological evolution culminates with the ability to achieve all the material values technologically possible and desirable by mental effort.

An [[Economics|economic]] implication of the above idea is that intellectual labour will become increasingly more important relative to physical labour. Contracts and agreements around information will become increasingly more common at the marketplace. Expansion and creation of new kinds of institutes that works with information such as    universities, book stores, patent-trading companies, etc. is considered an indication that a civilization is in technological evolution.

This highlights the importance underlining the debate over intellectual property in conjunction with decentralized distribution systems such as today's internet. Where the price of information distribution is going towards zero with ever more efficient tools to distribute information is being invented. Growing amounts of information being distributed to an increasingly larger customer base as times goes by. With growing [[disintermediation]] in said markets and growing concerns over the protection of intellectual property rights it is not clear what form markets for information will take with the evolution of the information age.

'''''Unequal crossing over''''' is a type of gene duplication or deletion event that deletes a sequence in one strand and replaces it with a duplication from its sister [[chromatid]] in [[mitosis]] or from its homologous chromosome during [[meiosis]].  It is a type of [[chromosomal crossover]] between homologous sequences that are not paired precisely. Normally genes are responsible for occurrence of crossing over. It exchanges sequences of different links between chromosomes.  Along with [[gene conversion]], it is believed to be the main  driver for the generation of [[gene duplication]]s and is a source of mutation in the genome.&lt;ref name="Dan"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Molecular Evolution |edition=Second |last1=Graur |first1=Dan |last2=Li |first2=Wen-Hsiung |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |isbn=0878932666 |url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Fundamentals_of_Molecular_Evolution.html?id=Bf5-QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
During [[meiosis]], the duplicated chromosomes ([[chromatids]]) in eukaryotic organisms are attached to each other in the [[centromere]] region and are thus paired. The maternal and paternal chromosomes then align alongside each other.  During this time, recombination can take place via crossing over of sections of the paternal and maternal chromatids and leads to reciprocal recombination or non-reciprocal recombination.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  Unequal crossing over requires a measure of similarity between the sequences for misalignment to occur.  The more similarity within the sequences, the more likely unequal crossing over will occur.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  One of the sequences is thus lost and replaced with the duplication of another sequence.

When two sequences are misaligned, unequal crossing over may create a tandem repeat on one chromosome and a deletion on the other.  The rate of unequal crossing over will increase with the number of repeated sequences around the duplication.  This is because these repeated sequences will pair together, allowing for the mismatch in the cross over point to occur.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite book |title=iGenetics |last=Russel |first=Peter J. |date=2002 |publisher=[[Benjamin Cummings]] |location=San Francisco |isbn=0-8053-4553-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences for the organism==
Unequal crossing over is the process most responsible for creating regional gene duplications in the genome.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  Repeated rounds of unequal crossing over cause the homogenization of the two sequences.  With the increase in the duplicates, unequal crossing over can lead to dosage imbalance in the genome and can be highly deleterious.&lt;ref name=Dan /&gt;&lt;ref name=russell /&gt;

==Evolutionary implications==
In unequal crossing over, there can be large sequence exchanges between the chromosomes.  Compared with gene conversion, which can only transfer a maximum of 1,500 base pairs, unequal crossing over in yeast rDNA genes has been found to transfer about 20,000 base pairs in a single crossover event&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="szostak1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szostak |first1=J. W. |last2=Wu |first2=R. |title=Unequal crossing over in the ribosomal DNA of ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''| doi = 10.1038/284426a0 |journal=Nature |volume=284 |pages=426–430 |date=1980 |issue=5755|bibcode=1980Natur.284..426S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unequal crossover can be followed by the [[concerted evolution]] of  duplicated sequences.

It has been suggested that longer intron found between two beta-globin genes are a response to deleterious selection from unequal crossing over in the beta-globin genes.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zimmer1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zimmer |first1=E. A. |last2=Martin |first2=S. M. |last3=Beverley |first3=S. M. |last4=Kan |first4=Y. W. |last5=Wilson |first5=A. C. |title=Rapid duplication and loss of genes coding for the alpha chains of hemoglobin |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA |volume=77 |pages=2158–2162 |date=1980 | pmc=348671 | doi =10.1073/pnas.77.4.2158 |pmid=6929543|bibcode=1980PNAS...77.2158Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparisons between alpha-globin, which does not have long introns, and beta-globin genes show that alpha-globin have 50 times higher concerted evolution.

When unequal crossing over creates a [[gene duplication]], the duplicate has 4 [[evolution]]ary fates. This is due to the fact that [[purifying selection]] acting on a duplicated copy is not very strong.  Now that there is a redundant copy, [[neutral mutation]]s can act on the duplicate.  Most commonly the neutral mutations will continue until the duplicate becomes a [[pseudogene]].  If the duplicate copy increases the dosage effect of the gene product, then the duplicate may be retained as a redundant copy.  [[Neofunctionalization]] is also a possibility: the duplicated copy acquires a mutation that gives it a different function than its ancestor.  If both copies acquire mutations, it is possible that a [[subfunctionalization|subfunctional event]] occurs.  This happens when both of the duplicated sequences have a more specialized function than the ancestral copy&lt;ref name=force1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Force |first1=Allan |last2=Lynch |first2=Michael |last3=Pickettb |first3=F. Bryan |last4=Amoresa |first4=Angel |last5=Yana |first5=Yi-lin  |last6=Postlethwaita |first6=John |date=1999 |title=Preservation of Duplicate Genes by Complementary, Degenerative Mutations |journal=Genetics |volume=151 |pages=1531–1545|pmid=10101175 |pmc=1460548 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genome size===
Gene duplications are the main reason for the increase of genome size, and as unequal crossing over is the main mechanism for gene duplication, unequal crossing over contributes to genome size evolution is the most common regional duplication event that increases the size of the genome.

====Junk DNA====
When viewing the genome of a eukaryote, a striking observation is the large amount of tandem, repetitive DNA sequences that make up a large portion of the genome.  For example, over 50% of the ''Dipodmys ordii'' genome is made up of three specific repeats. ''Drosophila virilis'' has three sequences that make up 40% of the genome, and 35% of the ''Absidia glauca'' is repetitive DNA sequences.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  These short sequences have no selection pressure acting on them and the frequency of the repeats can be changed by unequal crossing over.&lt;ref name="zhang2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=J. |title=Evolution of the human ASPM gene, a major determinant of brain size |journal=Genetics |volume=165 |pages=2063–2070 |date=2003 | pmid = 14704186 |issue=4 |pmc=1462882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P. | journal = Journal of Applied Physics | volume = 17 | issue = 11 | pages = 857–863|bibcode = 1946JAP....17..857W }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''discomposition effect''' or '''Wigner's Disease''',&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard; (1995); "Dark Sun: The Making Of The Hydrogen Bomb"; Simon &amp; Schuster; pg 277.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[dislocation]] of [[atom]]s in a solid caused by [[neutron radiation]]. 

Any solid can display the Wigner effect. The effect is of most concern in [[neutron moderator]]s, such as [[graphite]], intended to reduce the speed of [[Neutron temperature#Fast|fast neutrons]], thereby turning them into [[Neutron temperature|thermal neutrons]] capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction involving [[uranium-235]].

== Explanation ==
To create the Wigner effect, [[neutron]]s that collide with the atoms in a [[crystal structure]] must have enough [[energy]] to displace them from the lattice. This amount ([[threshold displacement energy]]) is approximately 25 [[Electronvolt|eV]]. A neutron's energy can vary widely, but it is not uncommon to have energies up to and exceeding 10 MeV (10,000,000 eV) in the centre of a [[nuclear reactor]]. A neutron with a significant amount of energy will create a [[Collision cascade|displacement cascade]] in a matrix via [[elastic collision]]s. For example, a 1 MeV neutron striking [[graphite]] will create 900 displacements; not all displacements will create defects, because some of the struck atoms will find and fill the vacancies that were either small pre-existing voids or vacancies newly formed by the other struck atoms.

The atoms that do not find a [[vacancy defect|vacancy]] come to rest in non-ideal locations; that is, not along the symmetrical lines of the lattice. These atoms are referred to as [[interstitial defect|interstitial atoms]], or simply interstitials. An interstitial atom and its associated vacancy are known as a [[Frenkel defect]]. Because these atoms are not in the ideal location, they have an energy associated with them, much as a ball at the top of a hill has [[Potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|gravitational potential energy]]. This energy is referred to as [[Wigner energy]]. When a large number of [[interstitial defect|interstitials]] have accumulated, they pose a risk of releasing all of their energy suddenly, creating a rapid, very great increase in temperature. Sudden, unplanned increases in temperature can present a large risk for certain types of nuclear reactors with low operating temperatures; one such was the indirect cause of the [[Windscale fire]]. Accumulation of energy in irradiated graphite has been recorded as high as 2.7 kJ/g, but is typically much lower than this.&lt;ref&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency. [http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/te_1521_web.pdf Characterization, Treatment and Conditioning of Radioactive Graphite from Decommissioning of Nuclear Reactors] (September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Graphite, having a heat capacity of 0.720 J/g°C, could see a sudden increase in temperature of about 3750&amp;nbsp;°C (6780&amp;nbsp;°F).

Despite some reports,&lt;ref&gt;Workshop on Short-Term Health Effects of Reactor Accidents: Chernobyl, August 8–9, 1986
V.P. Bond and E.P. Cronkite, Editors　[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/6905797-IIYHeP/6905797.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Wigner energy buildup had nothing to do with the cause of the [[Chernobyl disaster]]: this reactor, like all contemporary power reactors, operated at a high enough temperature to allow the displaced graphite structure to realign itself before any potential energy could be stored.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/chernobyl-meltdown-no-graphite-us-nuclear-reactors-2016-4&lt;/ref&gt; Wigner energy may have played some part following the [[prompt criticality|prompt critical]] neutron spike, when the accident entered the graphite fire phase of events.

== Dissipation of Wigner energy ==
A buildup of Wigner energy can be relieved by heating the material. This process is known as [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]. In graphite this occurs at 250&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/w/wigner-energy.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intimate Frenkel pairs ==
In 2003, it was postulated that Wigner energy can be stored by the formation of metastable defect structures in graphite. Notably, the large energy release observed at 200–250&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] has been described in terms of a metastable interstitial-vacancy pair.&lt;ref&gt;Metastable Frenkel Pair Defect in Graphite: Source of Wigner Energy? C. P. Ewels, R. H. Telling, A. A. El-Barbary, M. I. Heggie, and P. R. Briddon Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 025505 – Published 10 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The interstitial atom becomes trapped on the lip of the vacancy, and there is a barrier for it to recombine to give perfect graphite.

'''Wood''' is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the [[Plant stem|stems]] and roots of [[tree]]s and other [[woody plant]]s. It is an [[organic material]], a natural [[composite material|composite]] of [[cellulose]] fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a [[:wikt:matrix|matrix]] of [[lignin]] that resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary [[xylem]] in the stems of trees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hickey, M.|author2=King, C.|date=2001|title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and [[nutrient]]s between the [[leaf|leaves]], other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber.

Wood has been used for thousands of years for [[fuel]], as a [[construction material]], for making [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s, [[furniture]] and [[paper]]. More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives, such as [[cellophane]] and [[cellulose acetate#production|cellulose acetate]].

As of 2005, the growing stock of [[forest]]s worldwide was about 434 billion cubic meters, 47% of which was commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/008/A0400E/A0400E06.pdf|title=Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an abundant, [[carbon-neutral]] renewable resource, woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy. In 1991 approximately 3.5 billion cubic meters of wood were harvested. Dominant uses were for furniture and building construction.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Horst H.

==History==

A 2011 discovery in the [[Canadian province]] of [[New Brunswick]] yielded the earliest known plants to have grown wood, approximately 395 to 400 [[million years ago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2011/08/12/nb-origins-of-wood-found.html|title=N.B. fossils show origins of wood|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=August 12, 2011|date=August 12, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813012432/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2011/08/12/nb-origins-of-wood-found.html|archivedate=August 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Philippe Gerrienne et al.|title=A Simple Type of Wood in Two Early Devonian Plants|journal=Science|volume=333|issue=6044|pages=837|date=Aug 12, 2011|doi=10.1126/science.1208882|pmid=21836008|bibcode=2011Sci...333..837G|url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/jspui/handle/2268/97121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood can be dated by [[carbon dating]] and in some species by [[dendrochronology]] to determine when a wooden object was created.

People have used wood for thousands of years for many purposes, including as a [[fuel]] or as a [[construction]] material for making [[house]]s, [[tool]]s, [[weapon]]s, [[furniture]], [[packaging]], [[artwork]]s, and [[paper]]. Known [[construction]]s using wood date back ten thousand years. Buildings like the European Neolithic long house were made primarily of wood.

Recent use of wood has been enhanced by the addition of steel and bronze into construction.&lt;ref name="A History of Wood from the Stone Age to the 21st Century"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woods|first1=Sarah|title=A History of Wood from the Stone Age to the 21st Century|url=http://www.ecobuildingpulse.com/products/a-history-of-wood_o|website=EcoBUILDING|publisher=A Publication of The American Institute of Architects|accessdate=March 28, 2017|ref=3|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329051421/http://www.ecobuildingpulse.com/products/a-history-of-wood_o|archivedate=March 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==
[[File:Tree secondary growth diagram.jpg|thumb|Diagram of [[secondary growth]] in a [[tree]] showing idealized vertical and horizontal sections. A new layer of wood is added in each growing season, thickening the stem, existing branches and [[root]]s, to form a [[growth ring]].]]

===Growth rings===
{{main article|Growth rings}}

Wood, in the strict sense, is yielded by [[tree]]s, which increase in [[diameter]] by the formation, between the existing wood and the inner [[Bark (botany)|bark]], of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem, living branches, and roots. This process is known as [[secondary growth]]; it is the result of cell division in the [[vascular cambium]], a lateral meristem, and subsequent expansion of the new cells. These cells then go on to form thickened secondary cell walls, composed mainly of [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]] and [[lignin]].

Where the differences between the four seasons are distinct, e.g. [[New Zealand]], growth can occur in a discrete annual or seasonal pattern, leading to [[growth ring]]s; these can usually be most clearly seen on the end of a log, but are also visible on the other surfaces. If the distinctiveness between seasons is annual (as is the case in equatorial regions, e.g. [[Singapore]]), these growth rings are referred to as annual rings. Where there is little seasonal difference growth rings are likely to be indistinct or absent.  If the bark of the tree has been removed in a particular area, the rings will likely be deformed as the plant overgrows the scar.

If there are differences within a growth ring, then the part of a growth ring nearest the center of the tree, and formed early in the growing season when growth is rapid, is usually composed of wider elements. It is usually lighter in color than that near the outer portion of the ring, and is known as earlywood or springwood. The outer portion formed later in the season is then known as the latewood or summerwood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmforestline.com.au/pages/2.1.2.1_wood.html Wood growth and structure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212121121/http://farmforestline.com.au/pages/2.1.2.1_wood.html |date=December 12, 2009 }} www.farmforestline.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are major differences, depending on the kind of wood (see below).

===Knots===
&lt;!--[[Wood knot]] and [[Knot (wood)]] redirect directly here.--&gt;
[[File:TreeKnot.jpg|thumb|left|A knot on a tree trunk]]

As a tree grows, lower branches often die, and their bases may become overgrown and enclosed by subsequent layers of trunk wood, forming a type of imperfection known as a knot. The dead branch may not be attached to the trunk wood except at its base, and can drop out after the tree has been sawn into boards. Knots affect the technical properties of the wood, usually reducing the local strength and increasing the tendency for splitting along the wood grain,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} but may be exploited for visual effect. In a longitudinally sawn plank, a knot will appear as a roughly circular "solid" (usually darker) piece of wood around which the [[wood grain|grain]] of the rest of the wood "flows" (parts and rejoins). Within a knot, the direction of the wood (grain direction) is up to 90 degrees different from the grain direction of the regular wood.

In the tree a knot is either the base of a side [[branch]] or a dormant bud. A knot (when the base of a side branch) is conical in shape (hence the roughly circular cross-section) with the inner tip at the point in stem diameter at which the plant's vascular cambium was located when the branch formed as a bud.

In grading [[lumber]] and structural timber, knots are classified according to their form, size, soundness, and the firmness with which they are held in place. This firmness is affected by, among other factors, the length of time for which the branch was dead while the attaching stem continued to grow.

[[File:Wood Knot.JPG|thumb|upright|Wood knot in vertical section]]
{{quote|''Knots materially affect cracking and warping, ease in working, and cleavability of timber. They are defects which weaken timber and lower its value for structural purposes where strength is an important consideration. The weakening effect is much more serious when timber is subjected to forces perpendicular to the grain and/or [[tension (physics)|tension]] than when under load along the grain and/or [[physical compression|compression]]. The extent to which knots affect the strength of a [[beam (structure)|beam]] depends upon their position, size, number, and condition. A knot on the upper side is compressed, while one on the lower side is subjected to tension. If there is a season check in the knot, as is often the case, it will offer little resistance to this tensile stress.  Small knots, however, may be located along the neutral plane of a beam and increase the strength by preventing longitudinal [[shear stress|shearing]]. Knots in a board or plank are least injurious when they extend through it at right angles to its broadest surface. Knots which occur near the ends of a beam do not weaken it. Sound knots which occur in the central portion one-fourth the height of the beam from either edge are not serious defects.''|Samuel J.

Knots do not necessarily influence the stiffness of structural timber, this will depend on the size and location. Stiffness and elastic strength are more dependent upon the sound wood than upon localized defects. The breaking strength is very susceptible to defects. Sound knots do not weaken wood when subject to compression parallel to the grain.

In some decorative applications, wood with knots may be desirable to add visual interest. In applications where wood is [[painted]], such as skirting boards, fascia boards, door frames and furniture, resins present in the timber may continue to 'bleed' through to the surface of a knot for months or even years after manufacture and show as a yellow or brownish stain. A knot [[primer (paint)|primer]] paint or solution ([[knotting (wood treatment)|knotting]]), correctly applied during preparation, may do much to reduce this problem but it is difficult to control completely, especially when using mass-produced kiln-dried timber stocks.

===Heartwood and sapwood===&lt;!-- [[Sapwood (wood)]] redirects here --&gt;
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
[[File:Taxus wood.jpg|thumb|right|A section of a [[Taxus|Yew]] branch showing 27 annual growth rings, pale sapwood, dark heartwood, and [[pith]] (center dark spot). The dark radial lines are small knots.]]
'''Heartwood''' (or duramen&lt;ref name=eb-duramen&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Duramen|volume=8|page=692|short=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is wood that as a result of a naturally occurring chemical transformation has become more resistant to decay. Heartwood formation is a genetically programmed process that occurs spontaneously. Some uncertainty exists as to whether the wood dies during heartwood formation, as it can still chemically react to decay organisms, but only once.&lt;ref&gt;Shigo, Alex. (1986) ''A New Tree Biology Dictionary''. Shigo and Trees, Associates. {{ISBN|0943563127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heartwood is often visually distinct from the living sapwood, and can be distinguished in a cross-section where the boundary will tend to follow the growth rings. For example, it is sometimes much darker. However, other processes such as decay or insect invasion can also discolor wood, even in woody plants that do not form heartwood, which may lead to confusion.

Sapwood (or alburnum&lt;ref name="eb-alburnum"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alburnum|volume=1|page=516|short=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the younger, outermost wood; in the growing tree it is living wood,&lt;ref&gt;Capon, Brian (2005), Botany for Gardeners (2nd ed.), Portland, OR: Timber Publishing, p. 65 {{ISBN|0881926558}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its principal functions are to conduct water from the [[root]]s to the [[leaf|leaves]] and to store up and give back according to the season the reserves prepared in the leaves. However, by the time they become competent to conduct water, all xylem tracheids and vessels have lost their cytoplasm and the cells are therefore functionally dead. All wood in a tree is first formed as sapwood. The more leaves a tree bears and the more vigorous its growth, the larger the volume of sapwood required. Hence trees making rapid growth in the open have thicker sapwood for their size than trees of the same species growing in dense forests. Sometimes trees (of species that do form heartwood) grown in the open may become of considerable size, {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} or more in diameter, before any heartwood begins to form, for example, in second-growth [[hickory]], or open-grown [[pine]]s.

The term ''heartwood'' derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree. This is evidenced by the fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as [[chestnut]], [[black locust]], [[mulberry]], [[osage-orange]], and [[sassafras]], while in [[maple]], [[ash tree|ash]], [[hickory]], [[Celtis|hackberry]], [[beech]], and pine, thick sapwood is the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IbjPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=The+term+heartwood+derives+solely+from+its+position+and+not+from+any+vital+importance+to+the+tree+as+a+tree+can+thrive+with+heart+completely+decayed#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20term%20heartwood%20derives%20solely%20from%20its%20position%20and%20not%20from%20any%20vital%20importance%20to%20the%20tree%20as%20a%20tree%20can%20thrive%20with%20heart%20completely%20decayed&amp;f=false|title=The Mechanical Properties of Wood: Including a Discussion of the Factors Affecting the Mechanical Properties, and Methods of Timber Testing|last=Record|first=Samuel James|date=1914|publisher=J.

No definite relation exists between the annual rings of growth and the amount of sapwood. Within the same species the cross-sectional area of the sapwood is very roughly proportional to the size of the crown of the tree. If the rings are narrow, more of them are required than where they are wide. As the tree gets larger, the sapwood must necessarily become thinner or increase materially in volume. Sapwood is relatively thicker in the upper portion of the trunk of a tree than near the base, because the age and the diameter of the upper sections are less.

When a tree is very young it is covered with limbs almost, if not entirely, to the ground, but as it grows older some or all of them will eventually die and are either broken off or fall off. Subsequent growth of wood may completely conceal the stubs which will however remain as knots. No matter how smooth and clear a log is on the outside, it is more or less knotty near the middle. Consequently, the sapwood of an old tree, and particularly of a forest-grown tree, will be freer from knots than the inner heartwood. Since in most uses of wood, knots are defects that weaken the timber and interfere with its ease of working and other properties, it follows that a given piece of sapwood, because of its position in the tree, may well be stronger than a piece of heartwood from the same tree.

It is remarkable that the inner heartwood of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since in many cases it is hundreds, and in a few instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.

If a tree grows all its life in the open and the conditions of [[soil]] and site remain unchanged, it will make its most rapid growth in youth, and gradually decline. The annual rings of growth are for many years quite wide, but later they become narrower and narrower. Since each succeeding ring is laid down on the outside of the wood previously formed, it follows that unless a tree materially increases its production of wood from year to year, the rings must necessarily become thinner as the trunk gets wider. As a tree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual wood production is lessened, thereby reducing still more the width of the growth rings. In the case of forest-grown trees so much depends upon the competition of the trees in their struggle for light and nourishment that periods of rapid and slow growth may alternate. Some trees, such as southern [[oak]]s, maintain the same width of ring for hundreds of years. Upon the whole, however, as a tree gets larger in diameter the width of the growth rings decreases.

Different pieces of wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly, particularly if the tree is big and mature. In some trees, the wood laid on late in the life of a tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than that produced earlier, but in other trees, the reverse applies. This may or may not correspond to heartwood and sapwood. In a large log the sapwood, because of the time in the life of the tree when it was grown, may be inferior in [[hardness]], [[strength of materials|strength]], and toughness to equally sound heartwood from the same log. In a smaller tree, the reverse may be true.

===Color===
[[File:Sequoia wood.jpg|thumb|The wood of [[Sequoia sempervirens|coast redwood]] is distinctively red.]]
In species which show a distinct difference between heartwood and sapwood the natural color of heartwood is usually darker than that of the sapwood, and very frequently the contrast is conspicuous (see section of yew log above). This is produced by deposits in the heartwood of chemical substances, so that a dramatic color variation does not imply a significant difference in the mechanical properties of heartwood and sapwood, although there may be a marked biochemical difference between the two.

Some experiments on very resinous [[longleaf pine]] specimens indicate an increase in strength, due to the [[resin]] which increases the strength when dry. Such resin-saturated heartwood is called "fat lighter". Structures built of fat lighter are almost impervious to rot and [[termite]]s; however they are very flammable. [[Tree stump|Stumps]] of old longleaf pines are often dug, split into small pieces and sold as kindling for fires. Stumps thus dug may actually remain a century or more since being cut. [[Spruce]] impregnated with crude resin and dried is also greatly increased in strength thereby.

Since the latewood of a growth ring is usually darker in color than the earlywood, this fact may be used in visually judging the density, and therefore the hardness and strength of the material. This is particularly the case with coniferous woods. In ring-porous woods the vessels of the early wood often appear on a finished surface as darker than the denser latewood, though on cross sections of heartwood the reverse is commonly true. Otherwise the color of wood is no indication of strength.

Abnormal discoloration of wood often denotes a diseased condition, indicating unsoundness. The black check in western [[Tsuga|hemlock]] is the result of insect attacks. The reddish-brown streaks so common in hickory and certain other woods are mostly the result of injury by birds. The discoloration is merely an indication of an injury, and in all probability does not of itself affect the properties of the wood. Certain [[wood-decay fungus|rot-producing fungi]] impart to wood characteristic colors which thus become symptomatic of weakness; however an attractive effect known as [[spalting]] produced by this process is often considered a desirable characteristic. Ordinary sap-staining is due to fungal growth, but does not necessarily produce a weakening effect.

===Water content===
Water occurs in living wood in three locations, namely:
* in the [[cell wall]]s,
* in the [[protoplasm]]ic contents of the [[cell (biology)|cells]]
* as free water in the cell cavities and spaces, especially of the xylem

In heartwood it occurs only in the first and last forms. Wood that is thoroughly air-dried retains 8–16% of the water in the cell walls, and none, or practically none, in the other forms. Even oven-dried wood retains a small percentage of moisture, but for all except chemical purposes, may be considered absolutely dry.

The general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render it softer and more pliable. A similar effect occurs in the softening action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect.

Drying produces a decided increase in the strength of wood, particularly in small specimens. An extreme example is the case of a completely dry [[spruce]] block 5&amp;nbsp;cm in section, which will sustain a permanent load four times as great as a green (undried) block of the same size will.

The greatest strength increase due to drying is in the ultimate crushing strength, and strength at [[yield (engineering)|elastic limit]] in endwise compression; these are followed by the modulus of rupture, and stress at elastic limit in cross-bending, while the [[elastic modulus|modulus of elasticity]] is least affected.&lt;ref name=Record&gt;{{cite book

Wood is a [[heterogeneous]], [[hygroscopic]], [[cell (biology)|cellular]] and [[anisotropy|anisotropic]] material. It consists of cells, and the cell walls are composed of micro-fibrils of [[cellulose]] (40–50%) and [[hemicellulose]] (15–25%) impregnated with [[lignin]] (15–30%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treetesting.com/wood_properties_growth_and_structure.htm|title=Wood Properties Growth and Structure 2015|work=treetesting.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313044617/http://treetesting.com/wood_properties_growth_and_structure.htm|archivedate=March 13, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In coniferous or [[softwood]] species the wood cells are mostly of one kind, [[tracheid]]s, and as a result the material is much more uniform in structure than that of most [[hardwood]]s. There are no vessels ("pores") in coniferous wood such as one sees so prominently in oak and ash, for example.

In ring-porous species, such as ash, black locust, [[catalpa]], chestnut, [[elm]], hickory, [[mulberry]], and oak,&lt;ref name=sperry1994/&gt; the larger vessels or pores (as cross sections of vessels are called) are localized in the part of the growth ring formed in spring, thus forming a region of more or less open and porous tissue. The rest of the ring, produced in summer, is made up of smaller vessels and a much greater proportion of wood fibers. These fibers are the elements which give strength and toughness to wood, while the vessels are a source of weakness.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In diffuse-porous woods the pores are evenly sized so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the growth ring instead of being collected in a band or row.

===Earlywood and latewood===

====In softwood====
[[File:Wood Pseudotsuga taxifolia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Earlywood and latewood in a softwood; radial view, growth rings closely spaced in [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir]]]]
In temperate softwoods, there often is a marked difference between latewood and earlywood. The latewood will be denser than that formed early in the season. When examined under a microscope, the cells of dense latewood are seen to be very thick-walled and with very small cell cavities, while those formed first in the season have thin walls and large cell cavities. The strength is in the walls, not the cavities. Hence the greater the proportion of latewood, the greater the density and strength. In choosing a piece of pine where strength or stiffness is the important consideration, the principal thing to observe is the comparative amounts of earlywood and latewood. The width of ring is not nearly so important as the proportion and nature of the latewood in the ring.

If a heavy piece of pine is compared with a lightweight piece it will be seen at once that the heavier one contains a larger proportion of latewood than the other, and is therefore showing more clearly demarcated growth rings. In [[Pinus classification|white pines]] there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work. In [[Pinus classification|hard pines]], on the other hand, the latewood is very dense and is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft, straw-colored earlywood.

It is not only the proportion of latewood, but also its quality, that counts. In specimens that show a very large proportion of latewood it may be noticeably more porous and weigh considerably less than the latewood in pieces that contain less latewood. One can judge comparative density, and therefore to some extent strength, by visual inspection.

No satisfactory explanation can as yet be given for the exact mechanisms determining the formation of earlywood and latewood. Several factors may be involved. In conifers, at least, rate of growth alone does not determine the proportion of the two portions of the ring, for in some cases the wood of slow growth is very hard and heavy, while in others the opposite is true. The quality of the site where the tree grows undoubtedly affects the character of the wood formed, though it is not possible to formulate a rule governing it. In general, however, it may be said that where strength or ease of working is essential, woods of moderate to slow growth should be chosen.

====In ring-porous woods====
[[File:Wood Fraxinus excelsior.jpg|thumb|upright|Earlywood and latewood in a ring-porous wood (ash) in a ''[[Fraxinus excelsior]]''; tangential view, wide growth rings]]
In ring-porous woods, each season's growth is always well defined, because the large pores formed early in the season abut on the denser tissue of the year before.

In the case of the ring-porous hardwoods, there seems to exist a pretty definite relation between the rate of growth of timber and its properties. This may be briefly summed up in the general statement that the more rapid the growth or the wider the rings of growth, the heavier, harder, stronger, and stiffer the wood. This, it must be remembered, applies only to ring-porous woods such as oak, ash, hickory, and others of the same group, and is, of course, subject to some exceptions and limitations.

In ring-porous woods of good growth, it is usually the latewood in which the thick-walled, strength-giving fibers are most abundant. As the breadth of ring diminishes, this latewood is reduced so that very slow growth produces comparatively light, porous wood composed of thin-walled vessels and wood parenchyma. In good oak, these large vessels of the earlywood occupy from 6 to 10 percent of the volume of the log, while in inferior material they may make up 25% or more. The latewood of good oak is dark colored and firm, and consists mostly of thick-walled fibers which form one-half or more of the wood. In inferior oak, this latewood is much reduced both in quantity and quality. Such variation is very largely the result of rate of growth.

Wide-ringed wood is often called "second-growth", because the growth of the young timber in open stands after the old trees have been removed is more rapid than in trees in a closed forest, and in the manufacture of articles where strength is an important consideration such "second-growth" hardwood material is preferred. This is particularly the case in the choice of hickory for handles and [[spoke]]s. Here not only strength, but toughness and resilience are important.&lt;ref name=Record/&gt;

The results of a series of tests on hickory by the U.S. Forest Service show that:
:"The work or shock-resisting ability is greatest in wide-ringed wood that has from 5 to 14 rings per inch (rings 1.8-5 mm thick), is fairly constant from 14 to 38 rings per inch (rings 0.7–1.8 mm thick), and decreases rapidly from 38 to 47 rings per inch (rings 0.5–0.7 mm thick). The strength at maximum load is not so great with the most rapid-growing wood; it is maximum with from 14 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3–1.8 mm thick), and again becomes less as the wood becomes more closely ringed. The natural deduction is that wood of first-class mechanical value shows from 5 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3–5 mm thick) and that slower growth yields poorer stock. Thus the inspector or buyer of hickory should discriminate against timber that has more than 20 rings per inch (rings less than 1.3 mm thick). Exceptions exist, however, in the case of normal growth upon dry situations, in which the slow-growing material may be strong and tough."&lt;ref name=USforest&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Products Laboratory. ''[http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fplgtr113/fplgtr113.htm The Wood Handbook: Wood as an engineering material] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315214043/http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fplgtr113/fplgtr113.htm |date=March 15, 2007 }}''. General Technical Report 113. Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of rate of growth on the qualities of chestnut wood is summarized by the same authority as follows:

:"When the rings are wide, the transition from spring wood to summer wood is gradual, while in the narrow rings the spring wood passes into summer wood abruptly. The width of the spring wood changes but little with the width of the annual ring, so that the narrowing or broadening of the annual ring is always at the expense of the summer wood. The narrow vessels of the summer wood make it richer in wood substance than the spring wood composed of wide vessels. Therefore, rapid-growing specimens with wide rings have more wood substance than slow-growing trees with narrow rings. Since the more the wood substance the greater the weight, and the greater the weight the stronger the wood, chestnuts with wide rings must have stronger wood than chestnuts with narrow rings. This agrees with the accepted view that sprouts (which always have wide rings) yield better and stronger wood than seedling chestnuts, which grow more slowly in diameter."&lt;ref name=USforest/&gt;

====In diffuse-porous woods====
In the diffuse-porous woods, the demarcation between rings is not always so clear and in some cases is almost (if not entirely) invisible to the unaided eye. Conversely, when there is a clear demarcation there may not be a noticeable difference in structure within the growth ring.

In diffuse-porous woods, as has been stated, the vessels or pores are even-sized, so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in the earlywood. The effect of rate of growth is, therefore, not the same as in the ring-porous woods, approaching more nearly the conditions in the conifers. In general it may be stated that such woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when very rapidly or very slowly grown. In many uses of wood, total strength is not the main consideration. If ease of working is prized, wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of texture and straightness of grain, which will in most cases occur when there is little contrast between the latewood of one season's growth and the earlywood of the next.

===Monocot wood===
[[File:Gelugu (coconut wood) in Klaten, Java.jpg|thumb|Trunks of the [[coconut]] palm, a monocot, in Java. From this perspective these look not much different from trunks of a [[dicot]] or [[conifer]]]]
Structural material that resembles ordinary, "dicot" or conifer timber in its gross handling characteristics is produced by a number of [[monocotyledon|monocot]] plants, and these also are colloquially called wood. Of these, [[bamboo]], botanically a member of the grass family, has considerable economic importance, larger culms being widely used as a building and construction material and in the manufacture of engineered flooring, panels and [[Wood veneer|veneer]]. Another major plant group that produces material that often is called wood are the [[Arecaceae|palms]]. Of much less importance are plants such as ''[[Pandanus]],'' ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'' and ''[[Cordyline]].'' With all this material, the structure and composition of the processed raw material is quite different from ordinary wood.

===Specific gravity===
The single most revealing property of wood as an indicator of wood quality is specific gravity (Timell 1986),&lt;ref name="tim"&gt;Timell, T.E. 1986. Compression wood in gymnosperms. Springer-Verlag, Berlin. 2150 p.&lt;/ref&gt; as both pulp yield and lumber strength are determined by it. Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of an equal volume of water; density is the ratio of a mass of a quantity of a substance to the volume of that quantity and is expressed in mass per unit substance, e.g., grams per milliliter (g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or g/ml). The terms are essentially equivalent as long as the metric system is used. Upon drying, wood shrinks and its density increases. Minimum values are associated with green (water-saturated) wood and are referred to as ''basic specific gravity'' (Timell 1986).&lt;ref name="tim" /&gt;

===Wood density===

{{See also|Janka hardness test}}

Wood density is determined by multiple growth and physiological factors compounded into “one fairly easily measured wood characteristic” (Elliott 1970).&lt;ref name="ell"&gt;Elliott, G.K. 1970. Wood density in conifers. Commonwealth For. Bureau, Oxford, U.K., Tech. Commun. 8. 44 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Age, diameter, height, radial (trunk) growth, geographical location, site and growing conditions, [[silviculture|silvicultural]] treatment, and seed source all to some degree influence wood density. Variation is to be expected. Within an individual tree, the variation in wood density is often as great as or even greater than that between different trees (Timell 1986).&lt;ref name="tim" /&gt; Variation of specific gravity within the [[trunk (botany)|bole]] of a tree can occur in either the horizontal or vertical direction.

==Hard and soft woods==

It is common to classify wood as either [[softwood]] or [[hardwood]]. The wood from [[Pinophyta|conifers]] (e.g. pine) is called softwood, and the wood from [[dicotyledons]] (usually broad-leaved trees, (e.g. oak) is called hardwood. These names are a bit misleading, as hardwoods are not necessarily hard, and softwoods are not necessarily soft. The well-known balsa (a hardwood) is actually softer than any commercial softwood. Conversely, some softwoods (e.g. [[Taxus baccata|yew]]) are harder than many hardwoods.

There is a strong relationship between the properties of wood and the properties of the particular tree that yielded it. The density of wood varies with species. The density of a wood correlates with its strength (mechanical properties). For example, [[mahogany]] is a medium-dense hardwood that is excellent for fine furniture crafting, whereas [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]] is light, making it useful for [[Physical model|model]] building. One of the densest woods is [[Olea laurifolia|black ironwood]].

==Chemistry of wood==
[[File:Lignin.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Chemical structure of [[lignin]], which comprises about 25% of wood dry matter and is responsible for many of its properties.]]
The chemical composition of wood varies from species to species, but is approximately 50% carbon, 42% oxygen, 6% hydrogen, 1% nitrogen, and 1% other elements (mainly [[calcium]], [[potassium]], [[sodium]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], and [[manganese]]) by weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mémotech Bois et Matériaux Associés|date=1996|publisher=Éditions Casteilla|location=Paris|isbn=978-2713516450|page=22|author= Jean-Pierre Barette|author2= Claude Hazard et Jérôme Mayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood also contains [[sulfur]], [[chlorine]], [[silicon]], [[phosphorus]], and other elements in small quantity.

Aside from water, wood has three main components. [[Cellulose]], a crystalline polymer derived from glucose, constitutes about 41–43%. Next in abundance is [[hemicellulose]], which is around 20% in deciduous trees but near 30% in conifers. It is mainly [[pentose|five-carbon sugars]] that are linked in an irregular manner, in contrast to the cellulose. [[Lignin]] is the third component at around 27% in coniferous wood vs. 23% in deciduous trees. Lignin confers the hydrophobic properties reflecting the fact that it is based on [[aromatic ring]]s. These three components are interwoven, and direct covalent linkages exist between the lignin and the hemicellulose. A major focus of the paper industry is the separation of the lignin from the cellulose, from which paper is made.

In chemical terms, the difference between hardwood and softwood is reflected in the composition of the constituent [[lignin]]. Hardwood lignin is primarily derived from [[sinapyl alcohol]] and [[coniferyl alcohol]]. Softwood lignin is mainly derived from coniferyl alcohol.&lt;ref name=boerjan&gt;{{cite journal| author = W. Boerjan| author2 =  J. Ralph| author3 = M. Baucher|date=June 2003| title = Lignin biosynthesis| journal = Annu. Rev.

===Extractives===
Aside from the [[Lignocellulosic biomass|lignocellulose]], wood consists of a variety of low [[molecular weight]] [[organic compound]]s, called ''extractives''. The wood [[extract]]ives are [[fatty acid]]s, [[resin acid]]s, [[wax]]es and [[terpene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Mimms |first = Agneta |author2=Michael J. Kuckurek |author3=Jef A.

==Uses==

===Fuel===
{{Main article|Wood fuel}}
Wood has a long history of being used as fuel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jFvrF4DaZcgC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=%C2%A0Wood+has+a+long+history+of+being+used+as+fuel#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Wood%20has%20a%20long%20history%20of%20being%20used%20as%20fuel&amp;f=false|title=Alternative Fuels and the Environment|last=Sterrett|first=Frances S.|date=1994-10-12|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0873719780|language=en|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which continues to this day, mostly in rural areas of the world. Hardwood is preferred over softwood because it creates less smoke and burns longer. Adding a woodstove or fireplace to a home is often felt to add ambiance and warmth.

===Construction===

[[File:Saitta House Dyker Heights.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The [[Saitta House]], [[Dyker Heights]], [[Brooklyn]], New York built in 1899 is made of and decorated in wood.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dykerheightscivicassociation.com/saittareport.pdf Saitta House&amp;nbsp;– Report Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216233832/http://www.dykerheightscivicassociation.com/saittareport.pdf |date=December 16, 2008 }}",''DykerHeightsCivicAssociation.com''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Wood has been an important construction material since humans began building shelters, houses and boats. Nearly all boats were made out of wood until the late 19th century, and wood remains in common use today in boat construction. [[Elm]] in particular was used for this purpose as it resisted decay as long as it was kept wet (it also served for water pipe before the advent of more modern plumbing).

Wood to be used for construction work is commonly known as ''[[lumber]]'' in North America. Elsewhere, ''lumber'' usually refers to felled trees, and the word for sawn planks ready for use is ''timber''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jSiRAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA7-PA15&amp;dq=%C2%A0Wood+to+be+used+for+construction+work+is+commonly+known+as+lumber+in+North+America#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Wood%20to%20be%20used%20for%20construction%20work%20is%20commonly%20known%20as%20lumber%20in%20North%20America&amp;f=false|title=Materials for Interior Environments|last=Binggeli|first=Corky|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1118421604|language=en|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Medieval Europe [[oak]] was the wood of choice for all wood construction, including beams, walls, doors, and floors. Today a wider variety of woods is used: solid wood doors are often made from [[Populus|poplar]], small-knotted [[pine]], and [[Douglas fir]].

[[File:Преображенская церковь (деревянная) (1714 г.) 01.JPG|thumb|right|The churches of [[Kizhi]], Russia are among a handful of [[World Heritage Site]]s built entirely of wood, without metal joints. See [[Kizhi Pogost]] for more details.]]
New domestic housing in many parts of the world today is commonly made from timber-framed construction. [[Engineered wood]] products are becoming a bigger part of the construction industry. They may be used in both residential and commercial buildings as structural and aesthetic materials.

In buildings made of other materials, wood will still be found as a supporting material, especially in roof construction, in interior doors and their frames, and as exterior cladding.

Wood is also commonly used as shuttering material to form the mold into which concrete is poured during [[reinforced concrete]] construction.

====Wood flooring====
[[File:LightningVolt Wood Floor.jpg|thumb|right|Wood can be cut into straight planks and made into a [[wood flooring]].]]
{{Main article |Wood flooring}}A solid wood floor is a floor laid with planks or battens created from a single piece of timber, usually a hardwood. Since wood is hydroscopic (it acquires and loses moisture from the ambient conditions around it) this potential instability effectively limits the length and width of the boards.

Solid hardwood flooring is usually cheaper than engineered timbers and damaged areas can be sanded down and refinished repeatedly, the number of times being limited only by the thickness of wood above the tongue.

Solid hardwood floors were originally used for structural purposes, being installed perpendicular to the wooden support beams of a building (the joists or bearers) and solid construction timber is still often used for sports floors as well as most traditional wood blocks, [[mosaic]]s and [[parquetry]].

====Engineered wood====
{{main article |Engineered wood}}

Engineered wood products, glued building products "engineered" for application-specific performance requirements, are often used in construction and industrial applications. Glued engineered wood products are manufactured by bonding together wood strands, veneers, lumber or other forms of wood fiber with glue to form a larger, more efficient composite structural unit.&lt;ref name="apawood"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/E30.pdf|title=APA – The Engineered Wood Association|work=apawood.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627045932/http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed%2FE30.pdf|archivedate=June 27, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These products include [[glued laminated timber]] (glulam), wood structural panels (including [[plywood]], [[oriented strand board]] and composite panels), [[laminated veneer lumber]] (LVL) and other structural composite lumber (SCL) products, [[parallel strand lumber]], and I-joists.&lt;ref name="apawood" /&gt; Approximately 100 million cubic meters of wood was consumed for this purpose in 1991.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; The trends suggest that particle board and fiber board will overtake plywood.

Wood unsuitable for construction in its native form may be broken down mechanically (into fibers or chips) or chemically (into cellulose) and used as a raw material for other building materials, such as engineered wood, as well as [[particle board|chipboard]], [[hardboard]], and [[medium-density fiberboard]] (MDF). Such wood derivatives are widely used: wood fibers are an important component of most paper, and cellulose is used as a component of some [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic materials]]. Wood derivatives can be used for kinds of flooring, for example [[laminate flooring]].

===Furniture and utensils===
Wood has always been used extensively for [[furniture]], such as [[chairs]] and beds. It is also used for tool handles and cutlery, such as [[chopsticks]], [[toothpick]]s, and other utensils, like the [[wooden spoon]] and [[pencil]].

===Next generation wood products===
Further developments include new [[lignin]] glue applications, recyclable food packaging, rubber tire replacement applications, anti-bacterial medical agents, and high strength fabrics or composites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/annual%20report/AR_2007_2008/AR_ENG_2007.pdf|title=FPInnovations|work=forintek.ca|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319100903/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/annual%20report/AR_2007_2008/AR_ENG_2007.pdf|archivedate=March 19, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As scientists and engineers further learn and develop new techniques to extract various components from wood, or alternatively to modify wood, for example by adding components to wood, new more advanced products will appear on the marketplace. Moisture content electronic monitoring can also enhance next generation wood protection.&lt;ref&gt;"System for remotely monitoring moisture content on wooden elements" I Arakistain, O Munne EP Patent EPO1382108.0&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the arts===
[[File:Prayer Bead with the Adoration of the Magi and the Crucifixion MET DP371962.jpg|thumb|''[[Prayer Bead with the Adoration of the Magi and the Crucifixion]]'', [[Gothic boxwood miniature]]]]
Wood has long been used as an [[media (arts)|artistic medium]]. It has been used to make sculptures and [[wood carving|carvings]] for millennia. Examples include the [[totem pole]]s carved by North American indigenous people from conifer trunks, often Western Red Cedar (''[[Thuja plicata]]'').

Other uses of wood in the arts include:
* [[Woodcut]] [[printmaking]] and [[wood engraving|engraving]]
* Wood can be a surface to paint on, such as in [[panel painting]]
* Many [[musical instrument]]s are made mostly or entirely of wood

===Sports and recreational equipment===
Many types of [[sports equipment]] are made of wood, or were constructed of wood in the past. For example, [[cricket bat]]s are typically made of [[Salix alba|white willow]]. The [[baseball bat]]s which are legal for use in [[Major League Baseball]] are frequently made of [[Fraxinus|ash wood]] or [[hickory]], and in recent years have been constructed from [[maple]] even though that wood is somewhat more fragile. NBA courts have been traditionally made out of [[Parquetry#Use in the NBA|parquetry]].

Many other types of sports and recreation equipment, such as [[ski]]s, [[ice hockey stick]]s, [[lacrosse stick]]s and [[bow (weapon)|archery bows]], were commonly made of wood in the past, but have since been replaced with more modern materials such as aluminium, [[titanium]] or [[composite material]]s such as [[fiberglass]] and [[carbon fiber]]. One noteworthy example of this trend is the family of [[Golf club (equipment)|golf clubs]] commonly known as the ''[[wood (golf)|woods]]'', the heads of which were traditionally made of [[Diospyros|persimmon]] wood in the early days of the game of golf, but are now generally made of metal or (especially in the case of [[Wood (golf)#Drivers|drivers]]) carbon-fiber composites.

==Bacterial degradation==
Little is known about the bacteria that degrade cellulose. [[Symbiotic bacteria]] in ''[[Xylophaga]]'' may play a role in the degradation of sunken wood; while bacteria such as ''[[Alphaproteobacteria]]'', ''[[Flavobacteria]]'', ''[[Actinobacteria]]'', ''[[Clostridia]]'', and ''[[Bacteroidetes]]'' have been detected in wood submerged over a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=How Deep-Sea Wood Falls Sustain Chemosynthetic Life|author1=Christina Bienhold|author2=Petra Pop Ristova|author3=Frank Wenzhöfer|author4=Thorsten Dittmar|author5=Antje Boetius|journal=PLOS ONE|volume = 8|issue=1|pages=e53590|date=January 2, 2013|df=mdy-all|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053590|pmid=23301092|pmc=3534711|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...853590B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yakov Isidorovich Perelman''' ({{lang-ru|Яков Исидорович Перельман}}; December 4, 1882 – March 16, 1942) was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] science writer and author of many [[popular science]] books, including ''Physics Can Be Fun'' and ''Mathematics Can Be Fun'' (both translated from [[Russian language|Russian]] into English).

Perelman was born in 1882 in the town of [[Białystok]], [[Congress Poland]]. He obtained the Diploma in Forestry from the [[Imperial Forestry Institute (Russia)|Imperial Forestry Institute]] (Now Saint Petersburg State Forest Technical University) in [[Saint Petersburg]], in 1909. He was influenced by [[Ernst Mach]] and probably the Russian Machist [[Alexander Bogdanov]] in his pedagogical approach to popularising science.&lt;ref&gt;Siemsen, H. (2010) 'Mach’s Science Education, the PISA Study and Czech Science Education' in: Ernst Mach – Fyzika – Filosofie – Vzdělávání. Vol. 1 Brno: Masarykova Univerzita, 2010, pp. 255–265, DOI: 10.5817/CZ.MUNI.M210-4808-2011-255.&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of "Physics for Entertainment", Perelman set out to produce other books, in which he showed himself to be an imaginative populariser of science. Especially popular were ''"Arithmetic for entertainment", "Mechanics for entertainment", "Geometry for Entertainment", "Astronomy for entertainment", "Lively Mathematics", " Physics Everywhere", and "Tricks and Amusements".

His famous books on [[physics]] and [[astronomy]] were translated into various languages by the erstwhile [[Soviet Union]].

The scientist [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] thought highly of Perelman's talents and creative genius, writing of him in the preface of ''Interplanetary Journeys'': "The author has long been known by his popular, witty and quite scientific works on physics, astronomy and mathematics, which are, moreover written in a marvelous language and are very readable."

Perelman has also authored a number of textbooks and articles in Soviet popular science magazines.

In addition to his educational and scientific writings, he also worked as an editor of science magazines, including ''Nature and People'' and ''In the Workshop of Nature''.

Perelman died from starvation in 1942, during the German [[Siege of Leningrad]]. The siege started at 9 September 1941 and lasted 872 days, until 
27 January 1944. The Siege of Leningrad was one of the longest, most destructive sieges of a major city in modern history and one of the costliest in terms of casualties (1,117,000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n-t.ru/ri/ms/dz10.htm Доктор занимательных наук.

His older brother Yosif was a writer who published under the pseudonym [[Osip Dymov (writer)|Osip Dymov]]. He is not related to the Russian mathematician [[Grigori Perelman]], who was born in 1966 to a different Yakov Perelman. However, Grigori Perelman told The New Yorker that his father gave him ''Physics for Entertainment'', and it inspired his interest in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite news | last = Nasar  | first = Sylvia  |author2=Gruber, David   | title = Manifold Destiny: A legendary problem and the battle over who solved it.  | work = [[The New Yorker]]  | date = 21 August 2006  | url = http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060828fa_fact2  | accessdate = 2006-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Physics for Entertainment''==
In 1913, Russian bookshops began carrying ''Physics for Entertainment''.  The educationalist's new book attracted young readers seeking answers to scientific questions.

''Physics for Entertainment'' had a unique layout as well as an instructive style.  In the preface (11th ed.) Perelman wrote: "The main objective of ''Physics for entertainment'' is to arouse the activity of scientific imagination, to teach the reader to think in the spirit of the science of physics and to create in his mind a wide variety of associations of physical knowledge with the widely differing facts of life, with all that he normally comes into contact with."

In the foreword, Perelman describes the contents as “conundrums, brain-teasers, entertaining anecdotes, and unexpected comparisons,” adding, “I have quoted extensively from [[Jules Verne]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Mark Twain]] and other writers, because, besides providing entertainment, the fantastic experiments these writers describe may well serve as instructive illustrations at physics classes.”  The 13th edition (1936) would be the last published during the author's lifetime.  Among the book's notable topics was the idea of a perpetual machine: a hypothetical machine which could run incessantly performing useful work.  The author discusses perpetual motion, highlighting many attempts to build such a machine, and explains why they failed.  Other topics included how to jump from a moving car, and why, “according to the law of buoyancy, we would never drown in the [[Dead Sea]].”

[[Randall Munroe]], the creator of the web comic [[xkcd]] and author of his own popular science books, wrote: 
	
&lt;blockquote&gt;The book is a series of a few hundred examples, no more than one or two pages each, asking a question that illustrates some idea in basic physics.

It’s neat to see what has and hasn’t changed in the last century or so.  Many of the examples he uses seem to be straight out of a modern high school physics textbook, while others were totally new to me.  And some of the answers to the questions he poses seem obvious, but others made me stop and think. [This] diagram ... shows a design for a fountain with no pump — it took me a while to get why it works.... Later in the book, he explains the physics of that drinking bird toy.
	
It’s written in a fun, engaging, conversational style, as if he’s in the room chatting with you about these neat ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[blog.xkcd.com/2009/10/02/physics-for-entertainment/ Physics for Entertainment] Posted on 2009-10-02 by randallpmunro, xkcd: The blag of the webcomic&lt;/ref&gt;
