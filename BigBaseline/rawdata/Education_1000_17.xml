{{redirect|Semester|the astronomical sense of the term semester|Eclipse cycle}}
An '''academic term''' (or simply '''term''') is a portion of an academic year, the time during which an educational institution holds classes. The [[school timetable|schedule]]s adopted vary widely.

In most countries, the academic year begins in late summer or early autumn and ends during the following spring or summer. In [[Northern Hemisphere]] countries, this means that the academic year lasts from August, September, or October to May, June, or July. In [[Southern Hemisphere]] countries, the academic year aligns with the calendar year, lasting from February or March to November or December. The summer may or may not be part of the term system.

==Synonyms==
''Semester'', ''trimester'' and ''quarter'' are all synonyms for an academic term (the last two being mainly confined to American English),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english-thesaurus/term|title=Synonyms of 'term'|at=session|work=Collins English Thesaurus|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refer to terms of specific periods as described below:
*'''Semester''' ({{lang-la|sēmestris|lit=six monthly}}) originally German, where it referred to a university session of six months, adopted into American usage in the early 19th century as a half-year term of typically 15 to 18 weeks. Used in the US and other countries to refer to the two main periods into which the academic year is divided in some universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/semester|title=Semester|work=Oxford Living Dictionary|accessdate=28 July 2018|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/semester|title=Definition of 'semester'|work=Collins English Dictionary|accessdate=28 July 2018|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Trimester''' ({{lang-la|trimestris|lit=of three months}}) used in the US and Canada to refer to one of the three terms into which the academic year is divided in some universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/trimester|title=Trimester|work=Oxford Living Dictionary|accessdate=28 July 2018|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/trimester|title=Definition of 'trimester'|work=Collins English Dictionary|accessdate=28 July 2018|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Quarter''' ({{lang-la|quartarius|lit=fourth part of a measure}}) used in American English to refer to one of four terms into which the academic year is divided in some universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/quarter|title=Quarter|work=Oxford Living Dictionary|accessdate=28 July 2018|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
{{See also|Education in Australia}}
In most of Australia, the primary and secondary school year lasts approximately 200 days, from late January or early February to early or mid-December, and is split into four terms:

* '''Term 1''' starts in late January or early February and ends in late March or early April (often in close proximity to [[Easter]]).
* '''Term 2''' starts in late April or early May and ends in late June.
* '''Term 3''' starts in mid-to-late July and ends mid-to-late September.
* '''Term 4''' starts in mid-October and ends early to mid-December.

Terms 4&amp;1 (rolled over) and 2&amp;3 are respectively usually deemed 'summer' and 'winter' respectively for purposes of sports participation and uniform standards. Australian states and territories vary their approach to Easter when determining the dates for the holiday at the end of Term 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.gov.au/topics/australian-facts-and-figures/school-term-dates/] from australia.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact dates vary from year to year, as well as between states, and for [[Public school (government funded)|public]] and [[private school]]. In [[Tasmania]] until and including 2012, the school year was split into three terms, the first one being the longest and including an extended Easter holiday (which was also the practice of mainland Australia until the mid-1980s). However, in 2013 Tasmania introduced a four-term year, to conform to the rest of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.tas.gov.au/school/termdates/future |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414143811/http://www.education.tas.gov.au/school/termdates/future |archivedate=2011-04-14 |df= }} from education.tas.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt; There is typically a break of two weeks mid-semester (i.e. after Term 1 and after Term 3) and a break of three weeks in the middle of the year, although this can vary between jurisdictions. In the year 2000, due to the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney, the state of New South Wales extended the break after Term 3 to three weeks, compensating by reducing the break in the middle of the year to two weeks.

Most Australian universities have two semesters a year, but [[Bond University]], [[Deakin University]], [[CQUniversity]], [[Griffith University]] and the [[University of Canberra]] have three trimesters. Unusually, Macquarie University officially uses the word "session" and CQUniversity uses the word "term" in place of "semester". Many universities offer an optional short summer semester. One recent innovation in Australian higher education has been the establishment of the fully distance–online [[Open Universities Australia]] (formerly Open Learning Australia) that offers continuous study opportunities of individual units of study (what are called courses in North America) that can lead to full degree qualifications.

Open Universities Australia operates four 13-week study periods each year. Since students study only part-time and off campus these study periods mesh reasonably easily with existing university offerings based on semesters. In some cases, a "semester" is referred to as a "Study Period", for example by [[Centrelink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/payments/ya_study.htm |title=Youth Allowance |publisher=Centrelink.gov.au |date=2012-01-30 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Austria==
{{See also|Education in Austria}}
The Austrian school year for primary and secondary schools is split into two terms, the first one starts on the first Monday in September in the states of [[Vienna]], [[Lower Austria]] and [[Burgenland]] and on the second Monday of September in [[Upper Austria]], [[Salzburg]], [[Styria]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[State of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and [[Vorarlberg]]. Most schools have holidays between the national holiday on October 26 and All Souls Day on November 2, but those are unofficial holidays not observed by all schools in Austria. Christmas holidays start on December 24 and end on the first weekday after January 6. The first term ends in Vienna and Lower Austria on the first Friday of February, in Burgenland, Carinthia, Salzburg, Tyrol and Vorarlberg on the second Friday of February and in Upper Austria and Styria on the third Friday of February.

There is a one-week break between the two terms. In the second term there are the Easter holidays, the Mayday Holiday on May 1 and the [[long weekend]]s of [[Pentecost]], [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]] and [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]. The school year ends in Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland on the last Friday of June, in Upper Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Salzburg, Tyrol and Vorarlberg on the first Friday in July.

==Barbados==
{{See also|Education in Barbados}}
The Barbadian school year is fashioned after the British system, and as such, it follows a scheduling with three terms per school year.

*'''First term''' begins in the second week of September and continues for 15 weeks, ending in mid-December, excluding one week for mid-term break in mid-October.
*'''Second term''' begins in the first week of January and continues for 12 weeks, ending at the end of March.
*'''Third term''' begins mid-April and continues for 11 weeks until the end of June. 
The long school holiday period is 9 to 10 weeks from the end of June until the first week of September.

==Brazil==
{{See also|Education in Brazil}}
In Brazil, due to the Law of Directives and Bases of Brazilian Education, the academic year must have 200 days, both at schools and at universities. The school year usually begins during the first week of February. There is a 2-week/4-week long winter break in July. The Brazilian school year ends the first week of December, summer in Brazil.

Most schools use the 4 term system, called "Unidades" ''(unities)''.

In Brazilian universities academic terms are defined as periods or semesters (''período'', ''semestre''). The majority of [[academic degrees]] courses are 8 semesters (four years) long or 10 semesters (five years) long.

==Bangladesh==
{{See also|Education in Bangladesh}}
In [[Bangladesh]], the kindergarten, elementary and schools follow the semester system. Most of the universities follow the semester system although for some particular subjects such as Law they follow a yearly system. Business schools of all public and private universities follow a semester or trimester system.

Some of the universities using a two-semester system (using "Term 1" and "Term 2" designations) include: [[Jessore University of Science and Technology]], [[Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology]], [[Bangladesh Agricultural University]], [[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology]], [[Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology]], [[International Islamic University Chittagong]], [[Khulna University]], [[Khulna University of Engineering and Technology]], [[Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology]], [[Shahjalal University of Science and Technology]].[[Jagannath University]], and [[Sylhet Agricultural University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAU::Sylhet Agricultural University|url=http://www.sau.ac.bd|website=www.sau.ac.bd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the universities following a trimester system (using "Spring", "Summer" and "Fall" designations) include: [[American International University - Bangladesh]], [[BRAC University]], [[East West University]], [[Daffodil International University]], [[North South University]], [[Presidency University, Bangladesh|Presidency University]], [[Prime University]], [[Stamford University (Bangladesh)|Stamford University]], [[Military Institute of Science and Technology]], [[University of Information Technology and Sciences]], [[University of Development Alternative|University of Development Alternative (UODA)]] and [[United International University]].

== Belgium ==
{{See also|Education in Belgium}}
In Belgium, kindergarten, elementary and secondary schools begin on September 1 and end on June 30.

Schools also take breaks/holidays:

*'''Autumn break:''' One week at the start of November
*'''Christmas break:''' Two weeks around [[Christmas]] and [[New Year]]
*'''Carnival break:''' One week in February.
*'''Easter break:''' Two weeks around Easter.
*'''Summer break:''' is always the break from the 1st of July until the 31st of August
*'''Ascension break:''' Thursday and Friday in early May to mid June
*'''Labor Day:''' May 1
*'''Whitsun:''' Monday in mid May to late June
*'''Armistice Day:''' November 11

Universities and colleges in Belgium use the semester system, dividing the academic year in two equal parts of fourteen weeks of courses. Universities start the first semester in the third week of September, and no 'autumn break'. Colleges start one week earlier, in the second week of September, giving them right to the 'autumn break' of one week. After 13 weeks of courses the 'Christmas break' starts (around December 20), which is used to study for the 3–4 weeks of examinations in January.

After these examinations the universities have one week of vacation, the so-called 'semestrial vacation', while the colleges start the classes of the second semester at the end of January, immediately after the examinations, which week they reclaim with the 'spring break' at the end of February, which the universities do not have. The universities start the second semester in the beginning of February.

Both universities and colleges have the 'Easter break', which again is used to study for the examinations in June. After Easter, the classes start again until the end of May, followed by four weeks of examinations in June, after which three months of vacation is given. The students who failed in passing some of the courses in their curriculum in January and June, the so-called 'first session', have to do the examinations again in the second session at the end of August.

==Cambodia==
In Cambodia the school year kindergarten sectors in public schools consists of 10 months with a two-month vacation, while in primary, and secondary sectors, it is divided into two semesters and each semester is divided into 2 quarters. The first of November is the start of the academic term. After the 1st semester, a small vacation when the school is halted and at the end of the Second Semester, a 2-month vacation until the start of the new year. In universities, it is divided into 4 years.

==Canada==
{{See also|Education in Canada}}
Education being a provincial responsibility, there is no Canadian national standard. In Canada the school year for elementary and high school consists of 178 to 200 days, depending on jurisdiction, but several days may be deducted from this total for professional development and administrative duties, resulting in approximately 187 teaching days per year for most jurisdictions. Elementary students receive approximately 950 hours of instruction and secondary students receive approximately 1000 hours per year.

Generally in English Canada, [[high school]]s run on a two-semester arrangement, also known as fall and spring semester, the first semester starting from the day after [[Labour Day#Canada|Labour Day]] in September to mid-January and the second running from early February until the Thursday before the last Friday in June. The semesters are often divided into two terms each. Some schools in Canada run on a trimester system, the first running from September to January, the second from January to March or April, and the third from March or April until June. The trimester is more common in elementary and middle schools (Kindergarten - Grade 8) than in high schools (Grade 9 - Grade 12). Most of those characteristics differ in [[Education in Quebec|Québec]], where education is, with the exception of a few school boards, given in French. By tradition, Quebec and [[Franco-Ontarian]] elementary and secondary schools will arrange timetables to ensure the school year ends before June 24, date of the [[National Holiday (Quebec)|St-Jean-Baptiste day celebration]], a traditional holiday.

Most [[Universities in Canada|universities]] and [[Canadian colleges|colleges]] usually run from early September until the end of April or early May. Often, this winter session is split into two terms running September to December and January to April. Various forms of summer studies may be offered May to August. Some, such as [[University of Waterloo]] and [[Simon Fraser University]], run a full tri-semester system, providing full courses during summer. There are a few school boards in Canada experimenting with year-round schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/list/calendar/holidaye.html |title=School Year Calendar |publisher=Edu.gov.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucc.ca/index_e.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909180740/http://www.aucc.ca/index_e.html |archivedate=2006-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chile==
{{See also|Education in Chile}}
In elementary school, high school, as well as in universities, Chilean education is divided into two semesters. The first one starts late February or early March and lasts until late June and the second starts in early August and finishes in mid-December; also, some universities offer a summer period from early January to mid-February but just for exceptional courses.
These semesters have breaks for public festivities, such as Easter, independence commemoration (from two days to two weeks in September depending on year and place) and some public holidays like labour day, among others.

==China==
{{expand section|date=March 2012}}
{{See also|Education in the People's Republic of China}}

In the [[People's Republic of China]], elementary, middle and high schools have two semesters, the first from September to January, and the second from February or March, depending on the date of [[Chinese New Year]], to July.

Most universities and colleges in China also uses the two-semesters system, while a small portion of Chinese universities, such as [[Shanghai University]], are experimenting with the quarter system.

From January to February or March is the Winter break or Lunar New Year break. Summer break is normally from July to the end of August.

In Northern China, the winter break is longer and the summer break is shorter; the opposite applies in Southern China.

There are some casual holiday breaks:

* New year holiday: from 1 Jan. to 3 Jan.
* Lunar New year holiday: In Jan. or Feb. It lasts for around four weeks.
* [[Qingming Festival]]: Set according to the [[solar term]]. Usually on April 4 or 5.
* Labor's Day: 1 May to 3 May.
* [[Dragon Boat Festival]]: Set according to Lunar Calendar. Usually about May and June.
* [[Mid-autumn Festival]]: Set according to Lunar Calendar. Usually about middle of September.
* National Day: From 1st Oct. to 7 Oct for Chinese students.

==Costa Rica==
In Costa Rica the school year runs for ten months. It starts in the first week of February and ends in the last week of November. There is a mid-term vacation of approximately 2 weeks in July, and most schools also observe "Easter Week" in March or April.

==Czech Republic==
{{See also|Education in the Czech Republic}}
In the elementary and high schools in the [[Czech Republic]], the school year usually runs from September 1 to June 30 of the following year.

It is divided into two semesters with breaks on public holidays such as St. Vaclav (September 28), Independence day (October 28, two days break), Velvet Revolution (November 17), Christmas (7–10 days break), Spring break (1 week break), Easter (three days break on Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter Monday) and finally Labour day (May 1) and Liberation day (May 8). After the end of school year on June 30, the Summer holidays follow until September 1 when a new school year starts. Sole exception to this is the final year at high schools, which ends with Graduation of students at the end of May.

Universities have two mid-terms. The academic year starts usually in the second half of September or in the beginning of October. (It depends on university.)
Bachelor's degree is normally obtained by students after 3 years and masters after another 2 years of study. Still, there are some exceptions (e.g. medicine takes 6 years, no bachelor's degree).

==Denmark==
{{See also|Education in Denmark}}
In schools in [[Denmark]], the school year runs from August to June. In universities, the academic year runs from around September 1 to June 30, and is often divided into an autumn semester (with January set aside for exams) and a spring semester (with June set aside for exams). Since 2004, some Danish universities and faculties divide the academic year into four quarters, each of which may consist of eight weeks and an exam week, and being separated from the next quarter by a one-week break.

==Estonia==
{{See also|Education in Estonia}}
In [[Estonia]], elementary and high schools begin on 1 September and end in the beginning of June. The school year is divided into quarters that last about two to three months. Summer is usually counted as a term break, although the beginning of June is still part of the fourth quarter. Universities start on the first Monday of September and usually end in the middle of May or in the beginning of June; though in reality, exam periods may continue until the end of June (e.g. University of Tartu).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vana.hm.ee/uus/hm/client/index.php?1|title=Avaleht - Haridus- ja Teadusministeerium|work=hm.ee|access-date=2006-09-16|archive-url=https://archive.is/20060613060237/http://vana.hm.ee/uus/hm/client/index.php?1|archive-date=2006-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethiopia==
{{See also|Education in Ethiopia}}
In [[Ethiopia]], almost all elementary, secondary, and college classes are conducted on a two-semester timetable. The first semester of the year is from September to late January or mid February. The second semester usually begins some two weeks after the end of the first and ends in late May or mid June.

==Finland==
{{See also|Education in Finland}}
In the elementary and secondary schools and college, the academic year is divided in semesters. The autumn semester begins in mid-August and is suspended a few days before Christmas. The classes continue after the Epiphany with the spring semester which finishes at the beginning of June.

==France==
{{See also|Education in France}}
In primary and secondary schools, the school year begins the first Monday of September, unless September 1 is on Sunday. The school year is divided into three trimesters. The first from September to January, the second from January to April, and the third is from April to June.

'''School Breaks'''
Breaks are scattered throughout the school year every 6, 7 or 8 weeks and last 2 weeks each.

'''All Saint Break'''
The first break is around [[All Saints' Day]] on November 1.

'''Christmas Break'''
Christmas Break starts the Saturday before Christmas.

'''Winter Break'''
Winter Break dates differ of the Academia's location, which could be in Zone A, B, or C, to avoid high traffic on the road. It usually starts in February, ends late February or early March.

'''Easter Break'''
Easter Break depends on the location of Academia. It starts in April, and ends late April or early May.

'''End of Academic term - Summer Break'''
In primary school, end of Acamedic term is early July. In secondary school (middle school or high school) end of Academic term is before Middle School Exam in late June, or Baccalaureat, in mid-June.

On Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, pupils have a full day of teaching from around 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. until around 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. On Wednesday mornings, some pupils may have supplementary classes. French pupils used to attend school on Saturdays, but the so-called "four-days week" has been implemented since September 2008, reducing the teaching year from 936 to 864 hours (above the European average of 800 hours, but below the UK minimum of 950 hours for state schools).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Samuel |first=Henry |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1564587/French-school-revolution-creates-four-day-week.html |title=French school revolution creates four-day week |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=2007-09-29 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional holidays include Veterans Day on November 11, May 8, Ascension Day, May Day on May 1, and Easter Monday.

==Germany==
{{See also|Education in Germany}}

===Schools===
The school year in Germany begins between late July and early September, and ends from mid-June to July, with a summer break of similar length to that in the UK (only 6 weeks) but much shorter than in some other countries (with up to 3 months). The summer vacation starts in a different week by state (there are 16 federal states including [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]). The school year includes four or five shorter breaks or holidays:

*'''Christmas Break''': Two weeks around Christmas and New Year
*'''Winter Break''': One week or two weeks (only in a few states, a few days in some other) of February or the beginning of March. Called Carnival Break if they start at Carnival Monday.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Schulferien#Winter-/Sport-/Zeugnis-/Semesterferien]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Easter Break''': Two weeks of March / April
*'''Whitsun Break''': One or two weeks around [[Whitsun]]
*'''Summer Break''': Six weeks, may start as early as mid June (then school starts again in late July in this state) or as late as in the end of July (then school starts again only in early September in that state). On the [[Halligen]] ([[tidal islands]] in the [[North Sea]]) the summer vacations are five weeks.
*'''Autumn Break''': One week or two weeks in October/November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schulferien-feiertage.de/ferien/aktuelle-Schulferien-aller-Bundeslaender.htm|title=Ferientermine 2015 - alle Bundesländer|work=schulferien-feiertage.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Germany's federal structure, all breaks may differ depending on the [[State (country subdivision)|state]]. The exact dates for the beginning and the end of school breaks are kept different state by state and changed every year. This is meant to keep holiday traffic as low as possible.

The school year is divided into two parts (September to February &amp; February to July). There is not necessarily any break between those two parts, but pupils get a semi-year school report (it only displays their current level and is not relevant for promotion).

===Universities===
German universities run two semesters with the start and end dates depending on the university. The ''Wintersemester'' (WiSe), during which most students start university, often goes from 1 October until 31 March, with lectures starting around 15 October and lasting 14 weeks. There is usually a two-week break around Christmas and New Year (which is not counted in the 14 weeks). The ''Sommersemester'' (SoSe) consequently usually goes from 1 April until 30 September with lectures starting some time after Easter and lasting 12 weeks. The two lecture-free periods of 12 to 14 weeks between the semesters are for taking exams, doing internships, lab courses, and employment.

The [[University of Mannheim]] changed its schedule to conform with US standards in Fall of 2006. The semesters there are now from August 1 to January 31 (''Herbst-/Wintersemester'') and from February 1 to July 31 (''[[:de:Semester|Frühjahrs-/Sommersemester]]'').

===Universities of Applied Sciences===
"Fachhochschulen" start both semesters one month earlier than other universities.

===Vocational-cooperative universities===
"Berufsakademien" have four quarters, January to March and so on. In alternating quarters the students attend the university and intern at the employer (the latter being the "Praxisphase"). The number of lessons per week is significantly higher than at normal universities (equivalent to a full-time job) and the exams cannot be during the "free time" of the year, as that time is spent in the company. Vacation is given according to labor laws, i.e. half of 20–30 days (because only half of the year is worked).

==Hong Kong==
{{See also|Education in Hong Kong}}
In Hong Kong, the academic year usually runs from September 1 to mid-July for most primary and secondary schools. For senior secondary student, they usually start their academic year from mid of August or late August. Some secondary schools have two terms, but most have three terms. For universities and other tertiary institutions the academic year usually runs from September or October to April or May, sometimes with an extra summer term roughly from May to July.

Kindergartens often operate a semester (two-term) system, divided by the lengthy (e.g. two-week) break for Chinese New Year, typically in early February.

==Hungary==
{{See also|Education in Hungary}}
In the elementary and high schools in Hungary, the school year usually runs from September 1 to June 15 of the next year, with variation if these dates fall on Saturday or Sunday. The school year ''(tanév)'' is usually split into two semesters ''(félév)''. These semesters are also divided, with some schools holding examinations each half-semester. The first semester runs from September 1 until the middle of January and is divided by the fall vacation, which is around All Saints' Day and lasts for a week. The second semester is closed at the end of the school year. It is divided by the Easter holiday, which usually consist of the weekend before Easter and the holiday itself. Apart from these vacations and national celebrations, a few schools have 'skiing holidays' ''(síszünet)'', the date of which varies from the middle of January until February, though some schools hold it in December. Its length also varies from one school to another. It is made so that the students of the school who partake in the skiing camp of the school need no verification of absence. In the last school year of secondary education, the [[Matura]] examinations (school-leaving exam and entrance exam for university admissions; similar to [[A-level]] exams in the UK) are administered from May through July.

Hungarian universities run two semesters. They are typically from the first or second week of September to the middle of December (fall semester (őszi félév)) and from February to the middle of May (spring semester (tavaszi félév)). Both semesters are followed by an examination period. During the winter exam period, a break of 1–2 weeks is administered between Christmas and the beginning of the new year. In addition to the break between the semesters in summer, there is typically a break including Christmas and New Year. Some universities also have a fall and an Easter vacation.

==India==
{{See also|Education in India}}
In elementary and secondary schools, the school year in some part is April to March and others June to May, while in universities it is from July to May. There is a mid-year break during summer, usually from the end of May to the start of July in universities and in elementary and high schools, the vacations range from the beginning of April and last up to the beginning or middle of June. There is also a winter vacation of two weeks at the beginning of the year. However, in the Eastern and southern states like [[West Bengal]] and [[Karnataka]] there will be two breaks, one for [[Navratri|Dasara]] in September/October for 15 days and another for Christmas in December which ranges from 7 to 15 days. A semester system is being implemented in most of the universities in India as directed by the University Grants Commission.

[[University of Calicut]], [[Kerala University]], [[Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala|MG University]] and [[Sri Sankara University (SCSVMV University)]] have reached a consensus, and the other universities are also likely to introduce credit-based semester system in Kerala.{{clarify|date=March 2012}} [[Delhi University]] also introduced this system.

For Jammu and Kashmir, the school year usually begins in mid-October or the start of November. There are two vacations in a year, Winter holidays last from the start of December until the first of March. A summer vacation usually lasts two weeks from mid-July to the end of July, the dates do vary. For schools, students move from old to the new academic year immediately after the exams for the previous year is over with a small break of a week for compilation of results.

Most schools also have an autumn break or Diwali break in August or around October/November. This is generally right before the second semester exam in September or in the middle of the second semester.

==Indonesia==
{{See also|Education in Indonesia}}
An academic year in Indonesia is divided to two terms, running from mid-July to December and January to mid-June. For universities, however, the terms are much shorter, running from September to December and February to May. Some universities provide a summer semester (called ''the short semester'') from June to August. During president [[Abdurrahman Wahid]]'s term, schools are closed for [[Ramadan]] and a week after [[Eid-ul-Fitr]] (Idul Fitri). Some schools implement Saturday-off. Previously, academic year starts from January to December, but this rule changed in 1985.

==Iran==
{{See also|Education in Iran}}
In Iran, the academic year runs from September to June (10 months). Some universities, however, offer a limited number of courses in summer. Students have a three-month summer vacation. All schools are closed during [[Nowruz]] from march 20 until the beginning of April to celebrate the Iranian new year. The first (fall) semester begins on the first day of the [[Persian Calendar]] month of Mehr equivalent to the first day of [[autumn]] in the Northern Hemisphere and ends in January. The second (spring) semester begins in the winter and ends in June. No mid-term break exists in the academic calendar.

==Republic of Ireland==
{{See also|Education in the Republic of Ireland}}
The primary school year runs from the beginning of September until the end of June. There are breaks for Christmas and Easter and two mid-term breaks at the end of October and mid-February. Secondary schools run from September to the end of May, but due to the [[Junior Certificate]] and [[Leaving Certificate (Ireland)|Leaving Certificate]] exams, 3rd and 6th years respectively break at the end of June for summer holidays upon completion of the exams which end in the 3rd week of June.
The academic year for schools in receipt of public funding lasts for a minimum of 167 teaching days in secondary schools and 183 days in primary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0034_2011.pdf |work=education.ie |title=Department of Education and Skills circular 0034/2011 |format=PDF |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-level institutions generally from early September to December for their first term. The second term usually runs from January to Easter and the third term from Easter to mid- or late May. There are two common approaches to organising semesters: One, e.g. at [[Trinity College Dublin]] (TCD) and [[NUI Galway]], is to align the first semester with the first term ([[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas]] at TCD) and then split the second semester over the second term ([[Hilary term|Hilary]] at TCD) and third term ([[Trinity term|Trinity]] at TCD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tcd.ie/calendar/academic-year-structure/academic-year-structure.pdf|title=Academic Year Structure 2018 – 19|publisher=TCD|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/student_life/registration/documents/academic_calendar_20182019__revised.pdf|title=Academic Year 2018-2019|publisher=NUI Galway|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other approach, e.g. at [[University College Dublin]], is for the first semester to start at the start of the first term and continue after Christmas for a few weeks of the second term and for the second semester to start immediately after this in the middle of the second term, without a break, run through the rest of the second term, and continue after Easter through to the end of the third term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/students/documents/termdates_2018_19.pdf|title=Academic Year 2018/19 Term Dates|publisher=University College Dublin|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israel==
{{See also|Education in Israel}}

===Public education===
The school year in [[Israel]] starts in elementary, middle, and high schools on September 1, and lasts until the end of June for elementary schools, and until June 20 for middle and high schools. There are no fixed holidays of equal length, with breaks occurring on national holidays, usually lasting two or three days. For Jews, there is a nine-day break for Sukkot (autumn); a seven-day break for Hannukah (in December); and for Passover (spring) the break is 2–3 weeks long. For the Muslim population, breaks are taken for [[Eid al-Adha]], [[Eid ul-Fitr]] and end of semester breaks.

The university academic year typically divides into two semesters which start after [[Sukkot]] (typically mid to late October) and end in June or July. Some academic institutions also enable a third semester in the summer.

The short breaks:{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

*Eid ul-Fitr: the end of Ramadan, three- to five-day break, according to the lunar calendar (only in Islamic schools).
*Eid al-Adha: the end of Hajj, four-day break, according to the lunar calendar (only in Islamic schools).
*Rosh Hashanah: three-day break; the break is sometime between September 4 and October 6. 
*Yom Kippur: two-day break; the break is sometime between September 13 and October 15. (see note below from 2012).
*Sukkot: nine-day break in late September or in October.
*Purim: three-day break, the break in late February or early March.
*Yom Ha'atzmaut: one-day break, the break in late April or early May. The previous day, [[Yom Hazikaron]], is a half day.
*Lag BaOmer: one-day break, the break in early May or mid-May.
*Shavuot: three-day break, the break in late May or early June.

The school year in Israel is divided into two semesters:{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

*'''Semester 1''': From 1 September to late January or early February.
*'''Semester 2''': From late January or early February to late June.

Until 2011, the summer break ended on August 31, but in 2011 [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Israeli ministry of education]] decided to shorten the summer break by one week and the break now ends on August 26 {{as of|2012|lc=y}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} In 2014, the old schedule was reinstated so that the summer break is back to August 31. The period between Yom Kippur and Sukkot was added as holiday to compensate for this but {{as of|2014|lc=y}}, has consequently been removed.

===Yeshivas===
In most [[Yeshiva]]s, the year is divided into three periods (terms) called ''zmanim''. [[Elul]] zman starts from the beginning of the Hebrew month of Elul and extends until the end of [[Yom Kippur]]. This is the shortest (approx. six weeks), but most intense semester as it comes before the High Holidays of [[Rosh Hashanah]] and Yom Kippur. Winter zman starts after Sukkot and lasts until just before [[Passover]], a duration of five months (six in a [[Jewish calendar|Jewish leap year]]). Summer semester starts after Passover and lasts until either the middle of the month of [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]] or [[Tisha B'Av]], a duration of about three months. During the interim periods, which are called ''bein hazmanim'' (between the terms), students are on vacation.

==Italy==
{{See also|Education in Italy}}
In [[Italy]], all schools start in the first half of September, even though the exact beginning date changes every year. For schools from primary schools to high schools, the academic year is split into two semesters:

*'''First semester''': from September to February;
*'''Second semester''': from February to the beginning of June.
Kindergartens usually follow a similar schedule.

A university academic year is slightly different because of exams. University academic year divides into:

*'''First semester''': from the beginning of October to the end of February. Some courses begin as early as September. Throughout January and February, there are usually no lessons, only exams. 
*'''Second semester''': from the beginning of March to the end of July. Throughout the second half of May and the months of June and July, there are also no lessons in most universities, only exams.

Even though September is a free month, it is officially an exam month in all Italian universities. It means that it is possible to take exams.
During every exam session (January–February, May–June–July or September), students are usually allowed to take any exam of their previous carrier that they couldn't pass and even a certain number of exams of the new academic year (credit limit for this last option).

===Public holidays===
In the following holidays, no lessons take place:

*Carnival (particularly Mardi Gras) – usually on February; 
*Easter - date changing every year, usually in March or April and lasting 5–7 days;
*Liberation Anniversary – on the 25th April;
*Labour Day - on the 1st May;
*Anniversario della Repubblica (Anniversary of the Republic) - on the 2nd June;
*Tutti i Santi (All Saints) - on the 1st November;
*Immacolata concezione (Immaculate Conception) - on the 8th December;
*Christmas, New Year's Eve and Epiphany - from 23 December to 6 January (included)

==Japan==
{{See also|Education in Japan}}
In Japan, {{citation needed span|text=most of the schools run a three-term school year|date=June 2015}} (trimester system), and most universities and colleges have a semester system. The exact date of the beginning of the summer break and its duration vary across regions, but commonly the break lasts for about six weeks. The break originated to avoid the heat in summer, so elementary, middle, and high schools in [[Hokkaidō]] and [[Nagano Prefecture]] tend to have a shorter summer break than the rest of schools in Japan.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

'''School Term 1:''' April 1 to late July

'''School Term 2:''' early September to late December (with a two-week-long break for [[New Year's]] at the end of the year.)

'''School Term 3:''' early January to late March (and a brief week-long [[spring break]].)

The [[graduation ceremony]] occurs in March, and the enrollment ceremony in early April. The Japanese public school year consists of approximately 200 days.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Some universities and colleges accept students in September or October in order to let those students from other semester systems enroll. In recent years{{When|date=January 2015}} a few colleges{{Which|date=January 2015}} have begun experimenting with having two semesters instead of the traditional three with the break between two semesters in summer.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Kenya==
In Kenya, for K-12 education, the calendar year starts in January and ends in November. The academic year is divided into 3 terms as follows:

* '''Term 1:''' Early January – Late March
* '''Term 2:''' Early May – Late July
* '''Term 3:''' Early September – Early/Mid November
April, August and December are usually school holidays.

There is no standard academic calendar for universities as each university is free to set its own calendar.

International schools tend to follow the Northern Hemisphere academic calendar.

==Lithuania==

==Malaysia==
{{See also|Education in Malaysia}}

In [[Malaysia]]n primary and secondary schools, the school year is divided into two semesters. The first semester begins in early January and ends in late May, with a one-week mid-term break in March. After the mid-year holidays, which lasts for two weeks, the second semester begins in mid-June and ends in mid-November, with a one-week mid-term break in September. The school year ends with a six-week year-end holidays from mid-November to early January.

The school week varies by state, depending on the [[workweek and weekend|weekend]] of the state. For states with a Saturday-Sunday weekend, the school week is Monday to Friday. For states with a Friday-Saturday weekend ([[Johor]], [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], and [[Terengganu]]), the school week is Sunday to Thursday; as a result, school terms begin and end a day earlier in these four states than in the rest of the country. Some schools have co-curricular activities on Saturdays.

Schools are closed on national and state [[public holidays in Malaysia|public holidays]]. Schools are allowed to have a few special holidays without replacement for events such as school anniversary and [[sports day]]. For festivities such as [[Eid al-Fitr|Hari Raya Aidilfitri/Hari Raya Puasa]], [[Gawai Dayak|Hari Gawai]], Chinese New Year and [[Diwali|Deepavali]], schools usually apply for additional holidays to allow longer breaks for students to visit relatives in their hometowns. However, every day missed exceeding the special holiday allowance would be replaced by having classes on weekends.

The calendar is designed by the [[Secretary of Public Education]] ({{Lang-es|Secretaría de Educación Pública}}, SEP), the government department overseeing public education aln in Mexico with arrangements of the leaders of the [[Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación|National Educational Workers Union]] (Spanish: ''Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación'', SNTE). All public and private elementary schools under the guidance of the dependence observe this year. In the case of universities, normally the school year starts in the last week of July and is divided in trimesters or semesters. Christmas Break is usually 3 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sep.gob.mx Official website] of Mexico's [[Secretariat of Public Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nepal==
{{See also|Education in Nepal}}
Education in Nepal is structured as school education and higher education. School education includes primary level of grades 1&amp;ndash;5, lower secondary and secondary levels of grades 6&amp;ndash;8 and 9&amp;ndash;10 respectively. Pre-primary level of education is available in some areas. Six years old is the prescribed age for admission into grade one. A national level [[School Leaving Certificate (Nepal)|School Leaving Certificate]] (SLC) examination is conducted at the end of grade 10.These class starts in late April and finishes early March.
Summer break is usually of 1 week to 1 month and 1 month vacation is provided as festival holiday in November usually.

Grades 11 and 12 are considered as higher secondary level. Higher Secondary Education Board (HSEB) supervises higher secondary schools which are mostly under private management. Previously these
grades were under the university system and were run as proficiency certificate level. Although some universities still offer these programs, the policy now is to integrate these grades into the school system.These class starts from late July
and ends in April.

Higher education consists of bachelor, masters, and PhD levels. Depending upon the stream and subject, bachelors level may be of three to five years' duration. The duration of masters level is generally two years. Some universities offer programs like M Phil and post-graduate diplomas.

[[Vocational education]] in Nepal starts after lower secondary education. Students can choose to follow a two-year curriculum leading to the "Technical School leaving Certificate".&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=World+TVET+Database&amp;ct=NPL | title=Vocational Education in Nepal | publisher=UNESCO-UNEVOC | accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universities also offers professional and technical degrees. Out of the formal track, short-term programs(1 year) focusing on skills development are also available.

==New Zealand==
{{See also|Education in New Zealand}}
The New Zealand school year runs from the beginning of February to mid-December, and since 1996, has been divided into four terms. By law, all state and state-integrated schools are required to be open for instruction for 380 half-days in a year (390 half-days for schools with only Year 8 students or below), meaning that the start and end of the school year is not nationally fixed to a particular date, as schools take different teacher-only days and provincial anniversary days off during the year. Schools can be exempted from opening the required number of half-days in some cases, such as in [[Christchurch]] in 2011 when many schools closed for up to a month after the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]]. The breaks between terms have fixed start and end dates, and the break length is fixed at two weeks.

In general, terms run as follows if Easter falls in early-to-mid-April:

*'''Term 1:''' Begins no earlier than [[Auckland Anniversary Day]] (Monday closest to 29 January) and no later than 7 February; ends [[Maundy Thursday]] (day before Good Friday)
*'''Term 2:''' Begins second Monday following Easter Monday; ends beginning of July
*'''Term 3:''' Begins mid-July; ends mid-to-late September
*'''Term 4:''' Begins early-to-mid October; ends no later than 20 December

If Easter falls in March or late in April, Term 1 usually ends in mid-April and Term 2 begins at the beginning of May. If Easter is in March, a 5-day half-term break then exists, with school ending on Maundy Thursday and resuming on the Wednesday. The start of term two may be delayed if [[Anzac Day]] (25 April) falls on the Monday or Tuesday directly following the Easter break.

Private schools are not required to adhere to the Ministry's term structure, but by law they may not be open for instruction on Saturday or Sunday, the ten national public holidays, the school location's relevant anniversary day, and the Tuesday immediately following Easter Monday.

Senior secondary students (Years 11, 12, and 13) in many state schools have examination leave from mid-November, on the Thursday or Friday before the first [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement|NCEA]] external examinations begin. Officially, however, the term still does not end until mid-December.

==Oman==
{{See also|Education in Oman}}
The school year in [[Oman]] is divided into two semesters:

*'''First semester''' starts in early September and runs to mid-January depending on the level.
*'''Second semester''' runs from early February to late May.
Usually there are exams at the end of each semester. Students get a number of breaks throughout the year: National Day on 18 November, New Higri year break, Prophet Mohammed birthday break, Eid Al-Fitr break and Eid Al-Adha break. As most of these breaks depend on the Higri year which is 10 days shorter than the Solar year, there is a gradual change on the date of these events in relation to the school year.

==Pakistan==
{{See also|Education in Pakistan}}
In Pakistan, the school year runs from April to March. Students have a two-month summer vacation and a two-week winter vacation. In [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], [[Azad Kashmir]] and some areas of [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], where heavy snow paralyzes life in the winter, the schools close for two months and there are two weeks of summer vacation.

Schools and universities are off on national holidays: Pakistan Day (March 23), Independence Day (August 14), Defence of Pakistan Day (September 6), the anniversaries of the birth (December 25) and death (September 11) of [[Quaid-e-Azam]], [[Allama Iqbal]] (November 9) and the birth (July 30) and death (July 8) of [[Madar-e-Millat]].

[[Labour Day]] (also known as [[May Day]]) is also observed in Pakistan on May 1. Both [[Muslim holidays|Eid]] festivals are also public holidays.

In the University of Engineering and Technology Lahore, the holidays are for two and half months during summer.

For the government universities, the students of bachelors are given 1-1.5 month of summer vacation and 1-1.5 weeks of winter vacations.

==Philippines==
{{See also|Education in the Philippines}}

===Basic Education===
The Philippine school year lasts usually between nine and ten months long, and a school year must be at least 200 days as prescribed by law including examination periods. The school year begins in the first week of June and ends in the third or fourth week of March. Private schools may have a slightly shorter academic calendar either starting in the second (or third week) of June or ending earlier in March.

In most primary and secondary (junior high) schools, an academic year is usually divided into quarters for purposes of examination and reporting of marks though a few private schools adopt a trimestral system. Each quarter normally lasts for approximately seven (usually the 3rd quarter) to ten weeks (usually the 1st, 2nd and 4th quarters) but the actual length of each quarter and the months they cover varies among private schools. The fourth quarter for pupils in grade 6 is usually two to three weeks shorter than undergraduates to allow for preparation of final grades to determine who are eligible for graduation as well as to prepare for the graduation ceremonies themselves. Each quarter culminates in most schools with a quarterly examination period of three to five days.

The academic term for senior high school (grades 11 and 12) operates on a semestral basis. Semestral, Christmas, and summer breaks are scheduled at about the same time as primary and junior high school. Grade 12 pupils have a shorter second semester than grade 11 in order for the school to prepare for graduation.

In most schools, summer break usually lasts for two months, starting from the first week of April up to the last week of May. Most schools end the school year before [[Holy Week in the Philippines|Holy Week]]. Semestral break is normally set to coincide with All Saints and All Souls Day. The [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas]] Break usually begins in the third week of December, and classes resume the Monday or week after [[New Year's Day]] (unless that Monday is January 2). Commencement ceremonies are often held in late March or early April.

Exceptions to this general schedule are international schools operating in the country, which normally follow their home country's respective school system.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Higher Education===
For most universities and colleges, an academic year is divided into two semesters, each up to 18 weeks long except for senior students in their final semester where they end the semester two weeks earlier. Enrollment/registration in an institution is usually good for only one semester: a student who successfully registers for the first semester is not automatically enrolled to study in the second semester. The student will need to successfully complete clearance requirements and in a few cases, maintain a certain overall mark in order to progress in her university studies in the next semester. The first semester is followed by a break consisting of two to four weeks before the second semester, called the Semestral Break, which usually occurs between the second week of October to the second week of November for all universities and colleges. The Semestral Break can be two to three weeks long, and normally includes the All Saints' and [[All Souls' Day|All Souls']] holidays.

Other schools such as [[Technological University of the Philippines – Taguig Campus]], [[De La Salle University]] and [[Far Eastern University – East Asia College]], and [[AMA Computer University]] operate under a trimestral system. Classes start in the fourth week of May and ends in the third week of April. Under this system, students are typically able to finish their academic studies a year earlier than those from other universities with a semestral programme. [[Mapúa University]] began using the quarterly system with eleven weeks to a term after its acquisition by the Yuchengco Group. This allows their engineering programmes to be completed a year ahead of schools running on a semestral schedule.

Moreover, starting academic year 2014-2015, constituent campuses in the University of the Philippines System started their school year in August to end in May and the University of Santo Tomas started the Academic Year in August and it will end in May 2015. In AY 2015-2016, several Philippine colleges and universities will follow the shift.

In AY 2015-2016, San Beda College Manila and St. Scholastica's College Manila will start their calendar in early July 2015 and it will end in mid- to late April 2016 and it was aimed to be a transition to a full August to May Calendar in the succeeding academic years.

Also in AY 2015-2016, the University of Santo Tomas, will complete its shift to an August to May calendar. Ateneo de Manila University will also shift to an August to May Calendar this AY 2015-2016 with having a summer term in June to July before AY 2015-2016 starts. De La Salle University and De La Salle – College of St. Benilde will have an August to August Calendar for the incoming AY 2015-2016.

==Poland==
{{See also|Education in Poland}}
In Poland, the school year begins on September 1 and ends on the first Friday after June 18. There is a Christmas break in December which lasts until after New Year's Day. There is also a winter holiday break lasting two weeks in January or February but the exact date is different for each [[voivodeship]] and the dates usually change each year. Winter break is also the dividing line between the two semesters of the school year.

Most universities start their courses on October 1 (at some institutions late September), and the first semester (commonly referred to as the "''winter term''") ends in January. The second term starts in February or March, (the "''summer term''") and ends in June. Each semester is usually 15 or 16 weeks long. After each of them there is an "''examination session''", when no courses are taught, which lasts up to one month. The summer break starts after the exams and lasts until the start of the next academic year. In September there is an extra examination session during which students can retake failed exams.

==Portugal==
{{See also|Education in Portugal}}
The school year in Portugal runs from September to June and is divided in three Terms (''Períodos'', in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]):

*'''1st Term:''' From mid-September until mid-December.
*'''2nd Term:''' From the beginning of January until Easter (March–April).
*'''3rd Term:''' From the week after Easter (April) until the end of June (except for 9th, 11th and 12th grades, which finish early due to exams).

During the school year there are several breaks or holidays (''interrupções'' or ''férias'', in Portuguese):

*'''Christmas Break:''' Usually beginning in the 3rd week of December and lasts for two weeks including Christmas and New Year holidays. The 2nd term then begins, often in the first Monday of January.
*'''Carnival Break:''' Three days (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) during [[Carnival]]. This break used to be one week long but in recent years it has been reduced.
*'''Easter Break:''' Two weeks including Easter. It varies from year to year, but it is usually around late March or middle April.
*'''Summer Break:''' Usually known as "''Férias Grandes''" (Big Holidays) it lasts during the summer from late June to middle September and it separates one school year from another.

Universities and colleges follow a different academic year, which consists of two semesters.

==Romania==

{{See also|Education in Romania}}
The school year in Romania is divided into two semesters. From kindergarten to high school the first semester opens in early-mid September and continues until mid-late January. The second semester lasts from early February until early-mid June.
Note that Some teachers might change the calendar a bit, like starting semesters and summer break one week earlier.

==Russia==
{{See also|Education in Russia}}
The school year in Russia traditionally starts on September 1 (''The [[Knowledge Day]]''). The school year is divided into four terms (quarters), separated by one- or two-week holidays (the first week in November, the first two weeks in January, and the last week of March). The summer holiday lasts three months: June, July, and August. Generally the school year lasts until 25 May, which is also known as [[Last bell|''The Last School-Bell'' day]] celebrated by the graduates, their families and teachers. The school graduation ceremony - ''Graduation Evening'' ({{lang-ru|выпускной вечер}}) - is organized on June 20–25.

The academic year at universities also starts on September 1 and usually consists of 42 educational weeks and 10 weeks of holidays. It is divided into two terms (semesters). The first one (autumn semester) runs from September 1 to January 24/25 (21 weeks, including a 3- to 5-week winter exams session at the end) followed by a two-week holiday. Coincidentally January 25 is also ''[[Tatiana Day]]'', traditionally celebrated as Russian Students Day. The second one (spring semester) runs from February 9 to June 30 or July 4/5 (21 weeks, including a 3- to 5-week summer exams session) followed by an eight-week summer holiday. Some Russian universities do not use a traditional scheme: they exclude exams sessions, and the academic year is divided in a 2:3 ratio of 17 educational weeks (followed by a two-week holiday) and 25 educational weeks (followed by an eight-week summer holiday).

==Singapore==
{{See also|Education in Singapore}}

===Schools===
The school year coincides with the calendar year, and the first term begins on January 2 (unless it is a weekend or a Monday). The school year comprises four terms of 10 weeks each.

* '''Term 1:''' January to March (Term 1 holidays: one week)
* '''Term 2:''' March to May (Term 2 holidays: four weeks)
* '''Term 3:''' July to September (Term 3 holidays: one week)
* '''Term 4:''' September to November (Term 4 holidays: seven weeks)

Terms 1 and 2 are known as Semester 1, and terms 3 and 4 as Semester 2. {{citation needed span|text=The first year of Junior College begins in February|date=June 2015}} to accommodate the release of the O level results.

International schools in Singapore operate on a different system, often similar to the system in their home countries.

===Institute of Technical Education (ITE)===
The training year in ITE is made up of two terms, commencing January and April respectively, depending on the month of intake.

====For January intake====

* '''Term 1''': January to June (with a 2-week break period in March)
* '''Term 2''': July to December (with a 2-week break period in September)
At the end of each term, there will be a 4-week break period before a new term begins.

====For April intake====

* '''Term 1''': April to September (with a 4-week break period in June)
* '''Term 2''': October to March (with a 4-week break period in December)
At the end of each term, there will be a 2-week break period before a new term begins.

===Polytechnics===
Polytechnics and universities operate on a different calendar from schools. There are two semesters in a year in polytechnics.
* '''Semester 1:''' April to August (with a 2-week break period in June)
* '''Semester 2:''' October to February (with a break period around Christmas)
At the end of each semester, there will be a 7-week break period before a new semester begins.

It is to match the northern hemisphere calendar more closely.
* '''Semester 1:''' August to December
* '''Semester 2:''' January to May

==Slovakia==
{{See also|Education in Slovakia}}
The school year for elementary, grammar and high schools begins on September 2 (September 1 is [[Constitution Day]]) and ends June 29 of the following year. The school day starts at 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. and ends at 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (time varies due to day and type of school). in most schools. It is split into two halves, with the first half ending on the last day of January.

Universities starts in second half of September or 1 October. Academic year consist of 2 semesters (winter /until December/ and summer /until May/).

==Slovenia==
{{See also|Education in Slovenia}}
The school year in [[Slovenia]] for elementary and grammar schools begins on 1 September and formally ends on 31 August, although classes and exams are finished by 25 June. July and August thus constitute summer holidays. There are also four one-week breaks during the school year, occurring around [[All Saints Day]], between Christmas and New Year, at the end of February, and around the [[May Day]].

Universities and colleges follow a different academic year. It consists of two semesters—the winter semester starting on 1 October, which ends around 15 January. It is followed by a one-month break, during which students take the exams for subjects they have read in the semester. The summer semester begins on 15 February and lasts until 31 May, followed by the exam period, which ends on 30 June. Students who have not passed the necessary exams have a chance to do so during the autumn exam period in September. Students and faculty are free during in July and August. New classes are held again in October.

==South Africa==
{{See also|Education in South Africa}}
All South African public schools have a four-term school year as determined by the national Department of Education. Each term is between 10 and 11 weeks long. The terms are roughly structured as follows:

'''First Term'''
*Begins mid-January and ends before [[Good Friday]] (Usually in March or April).
*Followed by the Easter Holidays, which usually last 10 days.

'''Second Term'''
*Begins mid-April and ends June
*Followed by the [[Winter]] Holidays, which usually last 21 days.

'''Third Term'''
*Begins mid-July and ends September
*Followed by the September Holidays, also sometimes called the Spring Holidays, which usually last 10 days.

'''Fourth Term'''
*Begins early October and ends early December
*Followed by the Christmas Holidays, also sometimes called the December or Summer Holidays, which usually last approximately 40 days.
*Matriculants (12th graders) usually don't attend school much during this term due to them focusing on the year-end exams.

The academic year is approximately 200 school days in duration and runs from January to December.

Private schools follow a similar calendar, but slightly alter it according to their academic and religious needs. Some independent (private) schools have a three-term year instead [https://archive.is/20130505182119/http://www.southafrica.co.za/about-south-africa/at-a-glance/school-holiday-terms-dates/].

The dates of the school year for coastal schools are slightly different from those for inland schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kzneducation.gov.za/calendars/calendar2008.pdf Kwazulu Natal Education Department] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924211401/http://www.kzneducation.gov.za/calendars/calendar2008.pdf |date=September 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Education Department proposed a five-week-long school break in June–July 2010 for the 2010 Soccer World Cup-hosted in South Africa-to avoid pupil and teacher absenteeism and a chaotic transport system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=188835 |title=Daily Dispatch East London |publisher=Dispatch.co.za |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310073519/http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=188835 |archivedate=2012-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of universities in South Africa|South African universities]] have a year consisting of two semesters, with the first semester running from early February to early June, and the second semester from late July to late November. Each semester consists of twelve or thirteen teaching weeks, interrupted by a one-week short vacation, and followed by three or four weeks of examinations. In the first semester the short vacation often falls around the Easter weekend, while in the second semester it occurs in early September.

==South Korea==
{{See also| Education in South Korea}}
In [[South Korea]], the school year is divided into two terms. The first term usually runs from March 2, unless it is a Friday or the weekend, to mid-July with the summer vacation from mid-July to late-August (elementary and secondary schools) and from mid-June to late August (higher education institutions). The second term usually resumes in late August and runs until mid-February. The winter break is from late December to late January. There are two weeks of school (elementary and secondary schools) in February. Then there is a two-week-break before the new academic year starts in March.&lt;ref&gt;No Reference*&lt;/ref&gt;

The school hours are approximately from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm for high school, each class lasting 50 minutes. For middle school, it is about from 8:00am–3:30pm, each class lasting 45 minutes. In Primary School, the lower grades (Grades 1-3) have classes around 8:30 to 2:00 and the upper grades (Grades 4-6) have classes from about 9:00 to 3:00. Each class lasts about 40 minutes. In high school, the older students are sometimes required to stay until 9:00 pm or later studying on their own. For the most part, teachers rotate and the students stay in their classroom except for certain classes such as Physical Education, Music and Science labs.

There is a popular saying in [[Korean language|Korean]], 노는 토요일 (no-neun to-yo-il); it means, resting on Saturdays. From 2006 to 2011, Korean students (from elementary to secondary schools) were required to go to school on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Saturdays of each month. Prior to 2006, students had to go to school six days a week, except for 2005, when students had one Saturday off every month. The schools normally ended at noon on Saturday, and the curriculum is mostly focused on extracurricular activities. However, Korean Ministry of Education abolished school days on the Saturdays in 2012.

==Taiwan==

===Historical context===
The English law courts terms and legal training [[pupillage]] divided the year into four terms, partly to create a predictable work schedule, but also to make allowances for harsh travel conditions and delays caused by adverse weather at a time when all English law students and many [[litigant]]s had to travel to London for training or legal advice at one of the [[Inns of Court]]. The English [[legal year]] still runs to this calendar:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-justice-system/term-dates-and-sittings/term-dates/|title=Term dates|website=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, academic and judicial institutions traditionally organised their year around the [[Scottish term days]], the traditional divisions of the Scottish legal year:&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=What were the Scottish 'Term Days'?|url=http://www.scottishrecordsassociation.org/newsrkv004.htm|publisher=Scottish Records Association|accessdate=21 August 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119193827/http://www.scottishrecordsassociation.org/newsrkv004.htm|archivedate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Candlemas: 2 February, Candlemas, which fell forty days after Christmas, marked the presentation of the infant Jesus in the temple and the purification of the Virgin Mary.
*Whitsunday: originally a moveable term day, coming the seventh Sunday after Easter, was fixed in Scotland at 15 May in 1693. Whitsunday was originally the feast of Pentecost, around which a great many christenings would occur, so it became associated with the color white.
*Lammas Day: 1 August, feast of St. Peter ad Vincula was a corruption of loaf-mass, the Sunday on which the first fruits of harvest were offered, first corn ground, and first loaf made. In Scotland it was associated with hand-fasting and some fairs on this day were called handfasting fairs. (Originally synonymous with betrothal, handfasting became a contract binding a man and woman to live together for a year and a day before they decided on permanent marriage.)
*Martinmas: 11 November, was known as St. Martin in Winter or St. Martin of Tours to distinguish this from another feast of St. Martin in July.

===Primary/Secondary education===
The school year in the United Kingdom is generally divided into three terms running from autumn to summer. For state schools, the school year consists of 195 days of which there are 190 teaching days and five [[Inset day|INSET teacher training days]]. For independent schools, the school year can be as short as 175 days. The structure of the school year varies between the constituent countries of the United Kingdom with school holiday dates varying between local education authorities.

Before the mechanisation of agriculture and when more of the population lived in the rural countryside, the long summer school holiday in Britain arose in the 19th century as a result of the education authorities abandoning the battle to keep children at school through [[haymaking]] (around the start of August) and wheat [[harvest]] (around the end of August), when every available pair of hands was needed on the land.

===England and Wales===
In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the school year generally runs from early September until late July of the following year. Most schools operate a three-term school year, each term divided in half by a week-long break known as "half term" (although some counties, like Oxfordshire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/cms/content/school-term-dates-and-holidays |title= School term dates and holidays}}&lt;/ref&gt; consider these to be six separate terms instead), and are structured as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Term !! Months covered !! Half term break
|-
| Autumn || early September to mid-December || late October/early November
|-
| Spring || early January to shortly before Easter || mid February
|-
| Summer || shortly after Easter to late July || late May/early June
|}
There is no winter term.

The terms are separated by two holidays, each of approximately two weeks' duration: the Christmas holidays separating the autumn term and spring term, and the Easter holidays separating the spring term and the summer term. The period between the end of one school year and the start of the next is the summer holidays, which are six to eight weeks long.

====Alternative arrangements for English and Welsh schools====
The academic year originated in the pre-industrial era when all able-bodied young people were expected to work through the period of July and August. For the purposes of education, the remainder of the year was arranged into three terms accommodating the Christian holidays of Christmas and Easter. Half-term breaks divide the 16- to 17-week terms.

However the long summer break has been criticised by educationalists in the post-industrialist age because it creates a break in the academic progress.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Conor. [http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/conor_clarke/2007/07/the_case_against_summer.html "The case against summer"]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' (London), 19 July 2007. Accessed 22 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Even a House of Commons Education Select Committee recommended in 1999 that schools switch to a five-term academic year, abolishing the long summer holidays. Each term would be eight weeks long with a two-week break in between terms, and a minimum four-week summer holiday, with no half terms—the idea being that children can keep up momentum for eight weeks without a break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/589194.stm|title=Inquiry to consider five-term year|date=3 January 2000|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposals were introduced at a small number of schools nationally.

In 1999, the [[Local Government Association]] set up a commission to look at alternative proposals for a more balanced school year. In partnership with [[Local government#United Kingdom|Local Authorities]] and teachers unions, they were unable to agree to a suitable alternative arrangement for terms, but by 2004 came to an agreement with the [[National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers]] for a standardised arrangement of school terms. Since 2004, around one third of English local authorities have signed up to the proposals which see a standard academic year agreed between the authorities, including slight variations on the traditional schemes, based on the following principles:

* start the school year on a September date as near as possible to 1 September;
* equalise teaching and learning blocks (roughly 2×7 and 4×6 weeks);
* establish a two-week spring break in early April irrespective of the incidence of the Easter bank holiday. (Where the break does not coincide with the bank holiday the date should be, as far as practicable, nationally agreed and as consistent as possible across all local authorities);
* allow for the possibility of a summer holiday of at least six weeks for those schools which want this length of break.
* identify and agree annually designated periods of holiday, including the summer holiday, where head teachers are recommended not to arrange teacher days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lga.gov.uk/lga/core/page.do?pageId=119164|title=Standard school year|date=4 September 2008|work=UK [[Local Government Association]]|accessdate=2009-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220052909/http://www.lga.gov.uk/lga/core/page.do?pageId=119164|archive-date=2010-02-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition the independent schools have set their own term dates with varying degrees of local and national co-ordination.

===Northern Ireland===
The school year in [[Northern Ireland]] generally runs from early September to late June or early July of the following year. Most schools operate a three-term school year similar to England and Wales; however, there is no half term during summer term due to the province's longer summer holidays. The terms are structured as follows:

* Autumn Term: September to December (half term: late October)
* Spring Term: January to the Friday before [[Lazarus Saturday]] (half term: mid-February)
* [[Summer Term]]: Second Monday after Easter to June or early July

The terms are separated by two holidays each consisting of approximately two weeks: the Christmas holidays separating the autumn and spring terms, and the Easter holidays separating the spring and summer terms. The summer holidays in Northern Ireland last nine weeks, from the start of July until the end of August, due to the [[Twelfth of July]] bank holiday.

===Scotland===
The school year in [[Scotland]] generally runs from middle or late August to late June or early July of the following year (usually in eastern [[council areas]] from the third Monday in August to the first Friday in July and in western council areas from the second Monday in August to the last Friday in June). Most schools operate a three-term school year, each term divided in half by a break known as ‘mid-term’, lasting a week or two in October, a few days to a week in February, and a few days in May. The terms are structured as follows:

* Autumn Term: August to December (mid-term: middle to late October)
* Spring Term: January to the Friday before Lazarus Saturday (mid-term: mid-February)
* Summer Term: Second Monday after Easter to June or July (mid-term: late May)

The terms are separated by two holidays each consisting of approximately two weeks: the Christmas Holidays separating the autumn and spring terms, and the Easter holidays separating the spring and summer terms. The period between the end of one school year and the start of the next is known as the summer holidays and consists of six or seven weeks.

===Universities===
The academic year at most UK universities runs from September or October to June or July with three or four week breaks around Christmas and Easter that divide the year into three terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://study-uk.britishcouncil.org/options/find-course/subjects-modules-study-modes|title=About subjects, modules, and study modes|at=The academic year|publisher=[[British Council]]|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prepareforsuccess.org.uk/blog/when-do-uk-universities-and-colleges-have-holidays/|website=Prepare for Success|publisher=[[University of Southampton]]/UK Council for International Student Affairs|title=When do UK universities and colleges have holidays?|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most universities overlay a semester structure for academic courses on top of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.internationalstudent.com/study-abroad/guide/uk-usa-education-system/|title=UK vs. USA Education System|at=Academic Term|website=InternationalStudent.com|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities, particularly older ones, do still use terms, often with the last term given over to exams. Some older universities have special names for the three terms, e.g. [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas]], [[Hilary term|Hilary]], [[Trinity term|Trinity]] ([[University of Oxford|Oxford]]) or Michaelmas, [[Epiphany term|Epiphany]], [[Easter term|Easter]] ([[Durham University|Durham]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.postgrad.com/study-in-uk/uk-postgraduate-study/university-holidays/|website=postgrad.com|publisher=Postgrad Solutions|title=University Term Times and Vacations|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptions to the ordinary structure of the academic year include the [[University of Buckingham]], where undergraduate courses do not coincide with the academic year used by universities in Britain and elsewhere. Instead, they largely coincide with the calendar year—they typically start in January or February, with examinations in autumn.

==United States==
{{See also|Education in the United States}}
There are a number of different systems used in the US:
* A [[Academic quarter (year division)|'''quarter''']] system divides the academic year into four terms, one per season, with attendance required in three quarters per year to total 32 to 36 weeks of instruction.
* A '''semester''' system divides the academic year into two terms of equal length, with attendance required in both semesters to total 32 to 36 weeks of instruction. There is often an optional summer session half as long as a full semester.
* A '''trimester''' system divides the academic year into three terms of 14 to 16 weeks each, with attendance required in two trimesters per year, to total 28 to 32 weeks of instruction. The trimester evolved from the semester system in the 1960s and, thus, is compatible with it (i.e. it is simply a semester shortened from 16–18 weeks to 14–16 weeks). The spring-summer trimester may be a full trimester or may be divided into distinct spring and summer half-trimester or shorter sessions, in which classes meet double-time (or greater) to provide the same instruction that would be received in a full trimester.
The word '''quadmester''' or '''quadrimester''' is occasionally used to mean either four months or (more commonly in modern American usage) a quarter of a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Primary and secondary===
In the United States, the [[K–12 education|K–12]] school calendar is determined by the individual states, and in some cases by the local school district, so there is considerable variation. The academic year typically consists of two 18-week semesters, each divided into two nine-week marking periods (or quarters) or three six-week marking periods, and constituting 170 to 186 instructional days (with an average of 180).{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} An instructional week is five instructional days, measured Monday–Friday at all public and most private schools; Saturday–Wednesday or Sunday–Thursday at Muslim private schools; and so on. Grades are usually reported per marking period, but major examinations are given per semester or per year.

The traditional start date for the school year has been the Tuesday or Wednesday right after [[Labor Day]]. Although some schools still keep this tradition, many schools now start in the last two weeks of August and some schools (especially private ones) may start as late as the end of September or the first week in October. There are also some schools, especially in the southern tier of the United States, that begin at the end of July and early August. The school year ends 40 to 42 instructional weeks after it begins (usually around late-May or June).

[[School holiday#United States|School holidays in the United States]] vary by jurisdiction. They include [[Public holidays in the United States|federal, state, and local holidays]], all or only some of which may be observed by an individual school district. In addition to these legal holidays, there are vacation periods of varying length. Almost all schools observe the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] holiday, and extend it to include the day after Thanksgiving ([[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]) since it is a Friday. There is usually a recess of about one to two weeks during the winter holiday period at Christmas and New Year, with a spring break in March or April that is usually correlated to the holidays of Easter and usually Passover.

Many schools have additional "in-service" days in which school is in session for only faculty and staff. These days are often used for parent–teacher conferences on student progress, especially in primary school. In secondary school, they are usually used as staff development days. Sometimes schools do half-day in-service days in which students are dismissed early, rather than full-day holidays.

Unplanned vacations can extend the school year if they could have been prevented by school administrators, in theory if not in fact. Natural disasters and other incidents do not normally extend the school year because they could ''not'' have been prevented. Thus, if the school is closed for two weeks (10 instructional days) because the boiler has broken down, that will extend the school year by two weeks because proper maintenance could have prevented the problem, but snow storms and other forms of severe weather normally do not extend the school year because they cannot be prevented. Some regions allow for up to three to five [[snow days]], and any additional missed days can extend the school year.

===Community colleges===
Many, but not all, community colleges originated as extensions of the primary and secondary school system.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Some of these colleges often continue to follow the K-12 schedule. However, most operate under a semester based schedule.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole section|date=September 2011}} Washington state schools are standardized by the State Board of Community and Technical colleges and follow a quarter system.

===Collegiate calendars===
Three calendar systems are used by most American colleges and universities: quarter system, semester system, and trimester system. These are ways the calendar year is organized into a formal academic year, measured September–August or August–August. Some schools, particularly some business schools and community colleges, use the {{Not a typo|mini-mester}} or mini-semester system.

The quarter system divides the calendar year into four quarters, three of which constitute a complete academic year. Quarters are typically 10–12 weeks long so that three quarters amount to 30–36 weeks of instruction. Approximately 20 percent of universities are on the quarter system. Most colleges that use the quarter system have a fall quarter from late September to mid-December, a winter quarter from early January to mid-March, a spring quarter from late March or early April to mid-June, and an optional summer session. Notable users of the quarter system include the [[University of California]] system (excluding [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[University of California, Merced|Merced]], the [[David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA|UCLA medical school]], and all of the system's law schools), [[Stanford University|Stanford]], the [[University of Chicago]], [[Dartmouth College]], [[Northwestern University]], [[University of Washington]], the [[University of Oregon]], and [[DePaul University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uchicago.edu/academics/calendar/ |title=Academic Calendar &amp;#124; The University of Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago |date=October 12, 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/aboutuc/calendars.html |title=About UC - Campus Calendars - Overview of the University of California system |publisher=University of California |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504163506/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/aboutuc/calendars.html |archivedate=2012-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Union College]] uses a modified quarter system: fall, winter, and spring terms are each eleven weeks long; there are some summer classes, but there is no official summer quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.union.edu/offices/registrar/calendar/ |title=Academic Calendars |publisher= Union College  |accessdate=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Union's calendar makes use of just three of four quarters, the three academic terms are generally (and somewhat misleadingly to outsiders) dubbed "trimesters," which they literally are since they each span three months, December, July and August being off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.union.edu/admissions/trimesters/ |title=The Trimester System |publisher= Union College  |accessdate=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable and somewhat unique user of the quarter system is [[Baylor Law School]]: it operates on the quarter system while the remaining colleges of [[Baylor University]] operate on the semester system.

The semester system divides the calendar year into two semesters of 16 to 18 weeks each, plus summer sessions of varying lengths. The two semesters together constitute 32 to 36 weeks of instruction, so that three academic quarters equal two academic semesters. Thus, academic credit earned in quarter hours converts to semester hours at ⅔ of its value, while credit earned in semester hours converts to quarter hours at 3/2 of its value. Put another way, 3 quarter hours is 2 semester hours. Most{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} universities on the semester system have a fall semester from the day after Labor Day in September to mid-December, a spring/winter semester from late January to early May, and an optional summer session.

In practice, the average quarter-long course is four or five units and the average semester course is three units, so a full-time student graduating in four years would take five courses per semester and three or four courses per quarter.

Some colleges and universities have a 4-1-4 system, which divides the year into two four-month terms (September to December and February to May) as well as a single one-month term in January in which students can do independent study, study abroad, internships, activities, or focus on one or two classes. The one-month term is sometimes called a ''{{Not a typo|mini-mester}}'', ''winter session'', ''inter-term/interim/intersession'' or ''J-term''. Examples of schools using this system include:{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}
[[Austin College]], [[University of Rhode Island]], [[Whittier College]], [[Williams College]], [[Bethany College (West Virginia)|Bethany College]] in West Virginia, [[Berea College]], the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[New College of Florida]], [[Calvin College]], [[Elmhurst College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elmhurst.edu/magazine/indepth/9970301.html |title=Midwinter Feast |publisher=Elmhurst College |access-date=2015-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106234234/http://www.elmhurst.edu/magazine/indepth/9970301.html |archive-date=2016-01-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustavus Adolphus College]], [[Linfield College]], [[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luther.edu/admissions/fastfacts/luther/ |title=Luther at a Glance |publisher=Luther College |accessdate=2010-08-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810210317/http://www.luther.edu/admissions/fastfacts/luther/ |archivedate=2010-08-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oberlin College]], [[Middlebury College]], [[Erskine College]], [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]], [[Eckerd College]], [[Wofford College]], [[Saint Olaf College]], [[Samford University]], [[Miami University]], [[Hofstra University]], [[University of Delaware]], [[Saint Mary's College of California]], [[Colby College]], [[Chapman University]], [[McDaniel College]], [[Elon University]], [[Pacific University]], and [[Pacific Lutheran University]].

Some schools have a similar format but ordered as 4-4-1, with the short term in May after the conclusion of the spring semester. The term is sometimes called either "Maymester", a [[portmanteau]] of "May" and "semester", or "May Term". Examples of schools using this system include [[Wartburg College]], [[Bates College]], Chatham University, [[Clemson University]], [[The College of New Jersey]], [[Elmira College]], [[The Ohio State University]], [[Purdue University]], [[Transylvania University]], the [[University of Redlands]], [[Emory University]] and [[Washington and Lee University]]'s 12-12-4 undergraduate calendar.

The trimester system evolved out of the semester system. It divides the academic year into three equal portions of 15 – 16 weeks each. Institutions that use the trimester system include [[Carleton College]], [[Knox College (Illinois)]], [[Lawrence University]], and the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]]. The fall and winter trimesters constitute an academic year of 30–32 weeks. The spring/summer trimester is usually divided into a 7.5 week Spring Session followed by a 6-week or 7.5 week Summer Session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugadm.northwestern.edu/freshman/academics/calendar.htm |title=Academic calendar, Office of Undergraduate Admission - Northwestern University |publisher=Northwestern.edu |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731022612/http://www.ugadm.northwestern.edu/freshman/academics/calendar.htm |archivedate=2010-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduced maximum course load that accompanies the shortening from the traditional semester makes the trimester system compatible with the semester system. Academic credit is thus measured on the trimester system in semester hours; there is no such thing as a "trimester hour" of credit.

At the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Brigham Young University]], for example, the Fall trimester (informally still called 'semester') operates from September through December; the Winter trimester runs from January through April; and the spring-summer trimester operates from May through August, as two half-trimesters. Most spring-summer classes either meet double-time for 7–8 weeks in May and June or double-time/double-plus-time for 6–8 weeks in July and August (with summer half-term classes sometimes starting in the last week of June).

The quinmester academic calendar at [[Park University]] operates with five terms per year, each lasting eight weeks (January–March, March–May, June–July, August–October, and October–December).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.park.edu/calendars/images/Four-Year-Academic-Calendar.pdf |title=Park University Four Year Academic Calendar |publisher=Park.edu |date=2012-08-20 |accessdate=2015-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of colleges have adopted the "one course at a time" or "block schedule" calendar. Academic years consist of a number of terms lasting roughly four weeks each, during which a full semester's amount of work is completed in one and only one class. [[Colorado College]] first began their "Block Plan" in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradocollege.edu/welcome/blockplan/ The Colorado College Block Plan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222014112/http://www.coloradocollege.edu/welcome/blockplan/ |date=December 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Maharishi University of Management|Maharishi International University]] in 1971, and [[Cornell College]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellcollege.edu/academics/ocaat/index.shtml |title=Cornell College One Course At A Time |publisher=CornellCollege.edu |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quest University]] in Squamish, British Columbia; [[Tusculum College]] in [[Tusculum, Tennessee]]; and [[University of Montana - Western|The University of Montana - Western]] are the only other colleges operating under this academic calendar.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

'''Action Bioscience''' is a non-commercial, educational [[web site]] sponsored by the [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] (AIBS) . It was created to promote [[Biology|bioscience]] [[scientific literacy|literacy]] and bring attention to seven bioscience issues of critical current importance: 1) [[Biodiversity]], 2) [[Natural environment|Environment]], 3) [[Genomics]], 4) [[Biotechnology]], 5) [[Evolution]], 6) New Frontiers, and 7) Science [[Education]]

The organization seeks to:

* motivate the public to play an active role in bioscience education
* show how developments in bioscience research can affect everyone
* promote an understanding of biogeography and the biodiversity of life
* engage the public to reflect on the relationship between human activity and the natural course of evolution
* promote global ecological awareness
* advance formal and informal bioscience education
* encourage students to pursue studies in the biosciences

To meet these goals, the web site provides articles by scientists, science educators, and science students on issues related to seven bioscience challenges: environment, biodiversity, genomics, biotechnology, evolution, new frontiers in science, and bioscience education. In addition, the web site provides educators with original lessons and resources to enhance bioscience teaching. Up-to-date external links are provided at the bottom of each article to help the reader "learn more" about or "get involved" in the issue. Selected articles are translated into Spanish.

'''Alternative education''' encompasses many [[educational philosophy|pedagogical approaches]] differing from mainstream pedagogy. Such alternative [[learning environment]]s may be found within [[state schools|state]], [[charter school|charter]], and [[independent school]]s as well as [[homeschooling|home-based learning]] environments. Many educational alternatives emphasize small [[class size]]s, close relationships between students and teachers and a [[sense of community]].

The [[public law|legal]] framework for such education varies by locality, and determines any obligation to conform with mainstream standard tests and grades

Alternative pedagogical approaches may include different structures, as in the [[open classroom]], different teacher-student relationships, as in the [[Quaker]] and [[Democratic education|free schools]], and/or differing curricula and teaching methods, as in the [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] and [[Montessori schools]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/alternative-education "alternative education"]. Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 21 Sep. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Synonyms for "alternative" in this context include "non-traditional," "non-conventional" and "non-standardized". Alternative educators use terms such as "authentic", "[[Holistic education|holistic]]" and "progressive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Robin Ann|title=An Introduction to Educational Alternatives|url=http://www.educationrevolution.org/store/resources/alternatives/introtoalternatives/|website=Alternative Education Resource Organization|publisher=Paths of Learning|accessdate=16 October 2014|date=November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History, 18th to 21st century ==
Alternative education grew up in response to the establishment of standardized and [[compulsory education]] over the last two to three centuries. Educators including [[Emile, or On Education|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]],&lt;ref&gt;Jean Jacques Rousseau
Bertram, Christopher, "Jean Jacques Rousseau", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/rousseau/&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]]; the [[transcendentalism|American transcendentalist]]s [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]; founders of [[educational progressivism|progressive education]] [[John Dewey]] and [[Francis Wayland Parker|Francis Parker]], and educational pioneers such as [[Friedrich Fröbel]], [[Maria Montessori]] and [[Rudolf Steiner]] believed that education should cultivate the developing child on many levels: not only [[intellect]]ually, but also [[moral]]ly and [[spirituality|spiritual]]ly, [[emotion]]ally and [[psychology|psychological]]ly, and [[human anatomy|physical]]ly. After World War II an alternative [[Reggio Emilia approach]] to early-childhood education was developed in [[Reggio Emilia|Italy]], introduced by [[Loris Malaguzzi]].

[[Cultural critic]]s such as [[John Caldwell Holt]], [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], [[Frederick Mayer]] and [[George Dennison]] have examined education from [[individualism|individualist]], [[anarchism|anarchist]], and [[libertarianism|libertarian]] perspectives.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Other writers, from [[Paulo Freire]] to American educators [[Herbert Kohl (education)|Herbert Kohl]] and [[Jonathan Kozol]], have criticized mainstream Western education from the viewpoint of [[liberalism|liberal]] and radical politics. The argument for an approach catering to the interests and learning style of an individual is supported by research suggesting that a learner-responsible model is more effective than a teacher-responsible one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 | title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ron Miller has identified five elements common to educational alternatives:&lt;ref&gt;Ron Miller, ''Self-Organizing Revolution'', Holistic Education Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
# Respect for the person
# Balance
# Decentralization of authority
# Noninterference among the political, economic, and cultural spheres of society
# A holistic worldview.

In modern times, at least in some localities, the legal right to provide educational alternatives has become established alongside [[Compulsory education|a duty to provide]] education for school age children.

==Localities==

===Canada===
[[Education in Canada]] falls under the jurisdiction of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial government]]. Alternative education is provided in some public schools, such as [[Mountainview Montessori School]], as well as in independent schools, such as [[Toronto Montessori Schools]] and [[Vancouver Waldorf School]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourkids.net/school/vancouver-waldorf-school-north-vancouver/207]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Origins====
Alternative education in Canada stems from two philosophical educational points of view, Progressive and Libertarian.&lt;ref name="Alternative Education"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levin|first1=Malcolm|title=Alternative Education|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alternative-education/|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|accessdate=24 October 2014|date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Levin, 2006 the term "alternative" was adopted partly to distinguish these schools from the independent, parent-student-teacher-run "free" schools that preceded them (and from which some of the schools actually evolved) and to emphasize the boards' commitment to options within the public school system. Progressive educational tradition places emphasis on both the need to incorporate curriculum and teaching to match the stages of child development and the gradual integration of the child into adult society through planned experiential learning. The sources of stimulus would be from the philosopher John Dewey in the United States, from post WW1 New Schools in Great Britain and the Steiner/Waldorf schools in Europe. The Libertarian tradition focuses on the rights of the parents and children to make their own educational and life choices. As noted by Levin “It is rooted in the belief to uphold the individual freedom and the innate goodness of the child against institutional and social conformity and the corrupting influences of modern society.”&lt;ref name="Alternative Education"/&gt;

====School Types====
The 1980s saw a shift to special schools and/or programs for those students that excelled in academia, were artistically talented, or through programs linking schooling with the workplace in a co-operative venture. It might be considered as a natural evolution of education to offer options and not a regimented one size fits all approach. Most alternative high schools falling under public jurisdiction offered independent study programs, basic-skills programs, and were mini-high schools with a mixture of conventional and nonconventional courses, and schools with an arts focus. They also offered smaller classes, closer and more informal relations with teachers, and greater flexibility in course selection and timetabling. The most recent development within alternative education in Canada may be to follow the United States in their “Charter School” movement. In the US specific states have passed legislation permitting their departments of education or local school boards to issue "charters" directly to individual schools wishing to operate autonomously. Alberta is the first province that has already embraced this model.&lt;ref name="Alternative Education"/&gt;

=== India ===
{{Further|Homeschooling and Alternative Education in India}}
Since the early 20th century, educators have discussed and implemented alternative forms of education, such as [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s [[Visva-Bharati University]], [[Sri Aurobindo]]'s [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram|Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti Schools]]. Traditional learning in India involved students living in [[gurukula]]s, where they received free food, shelter and education from a [[guru]] ("teacher" in [[Sanskrit]]). Progress was based on tests given by the gurus, and the system aimed to nurture students' creativity and personality development. Although mainstream education in India is based on the system introduced by [[Lord Macaulay]], a few projects aim to rejuvenate the earlier method. Some students in these (and similar) projects conduct research in [[Sanskrit studies]], Vedic studies, [[Veda|Vedic science]], [[yoga]] and [[ayurveda]]. Others, after completing their education in a gurukula, enter mainstream higher education.

===Japan===
Japanese education is a nationwide, standardized system under the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Ministry of Education]]. The only alternative options have been accredited, private schools with more freedom of curricula (including textbook choice; public schools are limited to government-approved textbooks), teaching methods and hiring guidelines. Nearly all private schools require a competitive entrance examination and charge [[tuition]], with few scholarships available. Interest in alternative education was sparked during the 1980s by student violence and [[bullying]], [[school refusal]], [[social anxiety disorder]] and, in the worst cases, [[suicide]]; the desire to enable young people to keep up with a globalized economy is an additional impetus.

"Free school" is a term used to describe a non-profit group (or independent school) which specializes in the care and education of children who refuse to attend standard schools. The first [[democratic school]] was founded in 1985 as a shelter for children avoiding the school environment, and a number of other such schools have been established. In 1987 the first of seven Waldorf schools in Japan was founded, and other alternatives include a growing homeschooling movement.

In 2003 Japan introduced Special Zones for Structural Reform ([[w:ja:構造改革特別区域|構造改革特別区域]]), based on [[China]]’s [[Special Economic Zone]] policy, which enable the opening of government-accredited schools providing alternative education. Two years later, the first such school was founded.

Despite the schools' high tuition, some parents send their children to [[international school]]s to acquire fluency in a foreign language (usually English). Although international schools are not certified by the Japanese government, many are approved by their native country (the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Korea and China) and some offer an [[International Baccalaureate Organization|International Baccalaureate]] program.

===Philippines===
{{main article|Alternative Learning System (Philippines)}}

===United Kingdom===
In 2003, there were about 70 schools in the [[United Kingdom]] offering education based on philosophies differing from that of the mainstream pedagogy, about half of which are [[Steiner-Waldorf schools]]. [[Summerhill School]], established by [[A.S. Neill]] in 1921, was the first [[Democratic school]]; most have since closed, except for Summerhill, [[Sands School]], Hebden Bridge School and [[List_of_democratic_schools#United_Kingdom|democratic schools]] for children and young people. Though most alternative schools were until recently all fee-paying, state-funded [[Free school (England)|Free Schools]]  were introduced in 2011, only two of which alternative education: the Steiner Academy Frome, Somerset, and the [[Steiner Academy Hereford]].

===United States===
A variety of educational alternatives exist at the [[Elementary education|elementary]], [[Secondary education|secondary]] and [[Tertiary education|tertiary]] level in four categories: [[#School choice|school choice]], [[#Independent school|independent schools]] and [[#Home-based education|home-based education]]. The [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education's]] document ''State Regulation of Private Schools'' reports on the legal requirements that apply to [[K-12]] private schools in each of the states, including any curriculum requirements. The report states that it is intended as a reference for public and nonpublic school officials and state policy-makers.&lt;ref&gt;''State Regulation of Private Schools'', U.S. Department of Education, 2009 [http://www2.ed.gov/admins/comm/choice/regprivschl/index.html?exp=5]&lt;/ref&gt; The report confirms that similar areas of education are approached in a variety of ways.

==== School choice ====
{{Main article|School choice}}
Public-school alternatives in the U.S. include separate schools, classes, programs and semi-autonomous "schools within schools". Public school-choice options are open to all students, although some have waiting lists. Among these are [[charter school]]s, combining private initiatives and state funding, and [[magnet school]]s, which attract students to a particular program (such as the [[performing arts]]).

{{See also|List of Sudbury schools}}
Independent, or private, schools have flexibility in staff selection and educational approach. Many are [[Montessori method|Montessori]] and [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]] (the latter also known as Steiner schools, after their founder [[Rudolf Steiner]]). Other independent schools include [[democratic school|democratic]] or free schools, such as [[Clonlara School]], which is the oldest, continually operating K-12 alternative school in the country, the [[Sudbury school]]s, [[open classroom]] schools, those based on [[experiential education]] and schools using an international curriculum such as the [[International Baccalaureate]] and [[Round Square (educational organisation)|Round Square]] schools.

==== Homeschooling ====
{{Main article|Homeschooling}}
Families seeking alternatives for educational, philosophical or religious reasons, or if there is no nearby educational alternative may opt for home-based education. A minor branch is [[unschooling]], an approach based on interest rather than a curriculum. Others enroll in [[umbrella school]]s which provide a curriculum. Homeschool courses give students in-depth, personal attention in any subject with which they struggle or excel. Some homeschool families form a cooperative, where parents with expertise in a subject may teach children from a number of families while their children are taught by other parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolmoney.org/homeschooling-advantages-and-disadvantages|title=Advantages of homeschooling |accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Autodidacticism}}
Self-directed inquiry is recognized at all levels of education, from the "unschooling" of children to the autodidacticism of adults, and may occur separately from (or with) traditional forms of education.&lt;ref name="self-university"&gt;{{citation |author=Hayes, C. |year=1989 |title=Self-University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asociación de Inspectores de Educación''' (ADIDE) is a Spanish professional association of [[education]] supervisors. By the number of its members it is the most important association of these professionals in [[Spain]]: nowadays, 950 out of 1600 Spanish Inspectors of Education are members of ADIDE, while the rest of them are either unassociated or splitting their membership into several different [[professional association|associations]] and [[Trade union|unions]].

== Background ==

Educational professionals usually group themselves either in unions, professional associations or professional organizations. Unions have as their main aim the defence of the [[Employment|labour]] conditions of their members. Professional associations deal with the performance of the Code of Professional [[Ethics]] established by the association. Professional associations, like ADIDE, can have as well as the previous interests, some different aims and concerns, such as ensuring the professional development of members through suitable formation and [[training]], the organization of scientific meetings and congresses, and the [[publishing]] of professional magazines and books.

The [[Inspectorate]] of Education is a body (or two, actually) of [[civil servants]] of about 1600 people in Spain. This body of inspectors supervise all the [[Education in Spain|Spanish education system]] except the [[Spanish universities|university studies]]. Every inspector is usually in charge of several [[schools]] and other [[educational institutions]], and performs his/her duties according to an annual Inspection Plan. Quite often, however inspectors have to tackle with all kind of incidents and unscheduled situations which requires much attention from them.

== Founding ==

After the establishment of [[democracy]], the Spanish education system undertook very important changes in the 1980s, a time when a significant group of teachers and school administrators started to carry out the supervision function of schools. The already existing associations of inspectors of education at that time did not ensure the professional development of the new inspectors, so it was necessary for them to found a new association. ADIDE was created in 1990 and soon started to replace the absence of unions to achieve the promotion of professional interests and helping to put into practice the new educational policies as settled in the [[Education reform]] provided by the Organic Act of General Organization of the Educational System 1990.

Initially, ADIDE was a unique national organization for the whole of Spain, but due to the Association Act 2005, it had to adopt a [[Federation|federated]] [[structure]], which provoked some problems of interaction on the very first moments. The new technologies and members’ cooperation worked well to maintain a good level of coordination among all the federal associations, one for every one of the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Spanish Autonomous Regions]], which hold a high level of independence in educational matters. The federated association is since then known as ADIDE-Federación, while every autonomous region association is known by the name of ADIDE followed by the name of the region it operates on.

An '''assignment cover sheet''' is a paper used by [[student]]s when completing [[assignment (education)|assignment]]s at [[university]] for their courses. These coversheets generally contain [[metadata]] about the assignment (such as the name of the student and the course number). This aids the efficient handling of assignments. Other types of data may be included, depending on the needs of the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mendota.english.wisc.edu/~WAC/page.jsp?id=44&amp;c_type=category&amp;c_id=27 |title=Integrating Writing Into Your Course |author= |date= |work=University of Wisconsin (Madison) |accessdate=October 7, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities require and/or provide cover sheets in standardized formats. These are often in the form of computer files which a student can download, print, and personalize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assessment.illinoisstate.edu/generaleducation/coversheet.shtml |title=Student Assignment CoverSheet |author= |date= |work=Illinois State University |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127035002/http://assessment.illinoisstate.edu/generaleducation/coversheet.shtml |archivedate=November 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unisa.edu.au/ltu/students/study/assessment/use_coversheet.asp |title=Using the assignment cover sheet |author= |date=June 10, 2010 |work=University of South Australia |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.monash.edu.au/students/current/resources/assigncoversheet.html |title=Assignment cover sheet |author= |date= |work=Monash University |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219020616/http://www.education.monash.edu.au/students/current/resources/assigncoversheet.html |archivedate=February 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cover sheets are also required by some educational entities that are not universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pclab.cccoe.k12.ca.us/assignme.htm |title=Assignment Sheets |author= |date= |work=Contra Costa County Office of Education Regional Occupation Program |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426133217/http://pclab.cccoe.k12.ca.us/assignme.htm |archivedate=April 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1630">'''Bachelor of Arts and Science (B.A.S.''' or '''B.A.&amp;Sc.''' or '''B.A.Sc.)''' is an [[undergraduate]] [[bachelor's degree]] conferred by a small number of [[United States|American]] universities and a fair number of universities in other English-speaking countries (including [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]). Generally, to receive a B.A.S. degree, a student would need to complete the general requirements for a bachelor's degree and also the requirements for two different [[academic major]]s (or [[academic minor]]s) — one that usually leads to a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree and one that usually leads to a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree. In the United States, the degree is meant to be a four-year degree, but many students will take five years to complete the program.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Technically speaking, it is not an example of a [[double degree]], as universities only confer a single degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/ucdwebcatalog/academicinfo/major.html UC Davis Registrar] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716235722/http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/ucdwebcatalog/academicinfo/major.html |date=2012-07-16 }} ''"A single degree is granted to students who graduate with multiple majors."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://registrar.stanford.edu/bulletin/4871.htm |title=Stanford University Registrar |access-date=2011-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507022714/http://registrar.stanford.edu/bulletin/4871.htm |archive-date=2011-05-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caleb Gattegno''' (1911–1988) was one of the most influential and prolific mathematics educators of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alsina|first1=Claudi|last2=Nelson|first2=Roger|title=Icons of mathematics : an exploration of twenty key images|date=2011|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|location=[Washington, D.C.]|isbn=978-0883853528|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his innovative approaches to teaching and learning mathematics (Visible &amp; Tangible Math), foreign languages ([[The Silent Way]]) and reading ([[Words in Color]]). He is also the inventor of pedagogical materials for each of these approaches, and the author of more than 120 books and hundreds of articles{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} largely on the topics of education and human development.

==Pedagogical approach==
Gattegno’s pedagogical approach is characterised by propositions based on the observation of human learning in many and varied situations. This is a description of three of these propositions.

===Learning and effort===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}
Gattegno noticed that there is an “energy budget” for learning. Human beings have a highly developed sense of the economics of their own energy and are very sensitive to the cost involved in using it. It is therefore essential to teach in ways that are efficient in terms of the amount of energy spent by learners. To be able to mathematically determine whether one method was more efficient than another, he created a unit of measurement for the effort used to learn. He called that unit an ''ogden'', and one can only say an ''ogden'' has been spent if the learning was done outside of ordinary functionings, and was retained. For example, learning one word in a foreign language costs one ''ogden'', but if the word cannot be recalled, the ''ogden'' has not truly been spent. Gattegno's teaching materials and techniques were designed to be economical with ''ogdens'', so that the most information can be recalled with the least sense of effort.

Certain kinds of learning are very expensive in terms of energy, i.e., ''ogdens'', while others are practically free. Memorization is a very expensive way to learn. The energy cost can be especially high when the content is of no particular interest to the learner. Memorizing dates in history or major exports of foreign countries is like that, for most people. School is not the only place where that kind of learning is found. Learning somebody's name or telephone number is equally arbitrary. We have to use our own energy to make such arbitrary items stick in our memories. The “mental glue” necessary is expensive, since that type of learning uses up a lot of energy.

Not only is that type of learning expensive, it tends also to be fragile. It is typically difficult to remember those kinds of items. Even when we make a great effort, we do not always succeed. We often recognise a face without being able to remember the name of the person ... not to mention all that almost all of us have forgotten much of what we "learned" at school.  It is not unusual for us to forget much of what we memorize.

However, there is another way of functioning, which Gattegno called retention. An example of retention is the reception of sensory images. When we look at something – a street, a film, a person, a fine view – photons move from what we are contemplating and enter our eyes to strike the retina. When we listen to something, we create auditory images in a similar way, that is, through energy that enters our system, rather than energy we allocate from inside, to memorize an arbitrary item. To retain an auditory or visual image, we have to use perhaps only an insignificant amount of our own to retain it; the amount is so small we are not aware of any effort. Such images are easily acquired and generally remain for long periods. We all have experiences similar to the following examples Gattegno offered:

'''''First experience:''' "I recently visited a village in the south of France where I had not been for over 10 years and I was able to say, 'Oh, yes, I know. The pharmacy is over there beyond the baker’s.' I went to see and there it was. I had made no effort to memorise this village square. It had entered my mind during my previous visits and it had remained there."''

'''''Second experience:''' "I visit a supermarket and go down the aisles. I see an unexceptional woman with a trolley. Three aisles further on, I see her again. I have not tried to remember her, but I have seen her and I can recognise her again a little later."''

Our system of retention is extremely efficient. We keep in our minds a huge quantity of information simply because we have seen, heard, tasted, smelled or felt it. That ability is part of human nature. It enables us to walk about our town without getting lost, to ski or to read a book.

Gattegno proposed that we base education, not on memorization, which has a high energetic cost and is often unreliable, but on retention. The learning tools and techniques Gattegno proposed rely systematically on retention.

===The subordination of teaching to learning===
Gattegno argued that for pedagogical actions to be effective, teaching should be subordinated to learning, which requires that as an absolute prerequisite teachers must understand how people learn. Rather than present facts for memorization, teachers construct challenges for students to conquer. If the student cannot conquer the challenge easily, the teacher does not tell the answer, but observes and asks questions to determine where the confusion lies, and what awareness needs to be triggered in the student.

The role of teachers is not to try to transmit knowledge, but to engender acts of awareness in their students, for only awareness is educable. Gattegno created pedagogical materials designed to provoke awarenesses. The materials are intended to be used along with techniques aimed at leading students through a succession of awarenesses. As the students progress, teachers who observe their students can see when and how they can induce a new act of awareness.

For example, he created [[Words in Colour]] for learning to read. Briefly, it consists of a series of word charts using a colour code in which each colour represents a phoneme of the language. The charts are used to provoke the phonological awareness in students of the sounds they are making and the order in which they are making them thus engendering all the awarenesses of how the graphemes relate to the phonemes and of how the spatial order of writing reflects the chronological order of speech. Other charts, called Fidels, list the graphemes for each phoneme.

He also used this colour code in [[The Silent Way]]  materials for learning foreign languages to enable students to identify and produce the sounds of the new language. [[Cuisenaire rods]] are used, particularly with beginners, to create visible and tangible situations from which the students can induce the structures of the language. The silence of the teacher both gives the students room to explore the language and frees the teacher to observe the students. The teacher is thus able to propose a sequence of pedagogical challenges adapted precisely to the evolution of the students’ learning. "If I would be remembered for anything", he said in one of his last seminars, "it would be that I painted the sounds with colours."

In his approach to teaching mathematics, manipulatives, such as Geoboards which he invented and Cuisenaire Rods which he popularised, are part of a way of systematically developing students’ mathematical thinking through the exploration of clear and tangible problems.

All the materials created by Gattegno were designed to allow teachers using them to place the accent systematically on the students’ learning rather than on what they, the teachers, do. Teachers watch their students deal with the challenges they are given, and provide them with feedback on their trials and errors. Teachers thus actively base their work on the awareness and awarenesses of the students, in the here and now. It is therefore very difficult for a teacher to closely follow a detailed lesson-plan, since the students are actively exploring the domain and have the freedom to take the lesson wherever they need it to go. The class becomes a kind of guided improvisation in which the teacher launches a challenge at a suitable level for the students, and if necessary nudges them into the awarenesses they need to have in order to learn. This is the case whatever the subject being dealt with, and is what is meant by Gattegno’s expression, “the subordination of teaching to learning”.

===Only awareness is educable===
Gattegno found that only awareness is educable in human beings. On the path to learning, several awarenesses must be reached. The first is the awareness that there is something to be learned, some unknown to become known. The next awarenesses are triggered by experience with the subject matter. For example, rather than ask a student to write "2+2=4," Gattegno might ask them to create the number 4 in as many ways as possible with colored rods. The student can then clearly see, feel, and describe the characteristics of the number 4. Instead of memorizing "2+2=4," the student has had a mathematical experience, and become aware that "4" can be broken into parts, and that the process of breaking apart and putting together can be described in several ways.

We are constantly becoming aware of new things. When it is something significant, the awareness is often audible in the form of the “Ah!” so typical of an important realisation. However, most realisations are made much more discretely. Indeed, as we live our everyday lives, we become aware of all sorts of things at great speed throughout the day: the price of bananas, that these bananas are not ripe enough, that the price of the yoghurts has been reduced because they are close to their sell-by date …. All our life is a succession of tiny awarenesses. Until we become aware of something, that thing remains totally unknown to us. As soon as we become aware of it and integrate it into our lives, we often no longer pay attention to it. But the moment of realisation, the act of learning, is an act of awareness.

The role of the teacher in acts of learning is not to inform students of this or that piece of information, but to help them to discover it, to perform a conscious act to become aware of it.

Gattegno suggests that '''learning takes place in four stages''' which can be described in terms of awareness.

'''The first stage''' consists in a single act of awareness: the realisation that there is something new to be explored. As long as I am unaware that there is something to be known, I cannot start to learn.

'''The second stage''': As soon as I start to learn, I have to explore the situation in order to understand it. As I am not yet an expert in the field, I make many mistakes. These mistakes enable me to progress because by observing what happens and becoming aware of it I can adapt my attempts in relation to the feedback given by the environment. This stage ends when I know what I have to do, but I only succeed when I am wholly present in what I am doing.

'''The third stage''' is a transitional stage. At the beginning, I am able to do what I want if I pay attention at each instant. At the end of this stage I no longer need to pay attention: the new skill has become completely automatic and because it is automatic, I am free to give my attention to learning other things.

'''The fourth stage''' is that of transfer. For the rest of my life, what I have learnt can be used for all the new skills I may wish to acquire. When I learnt to run, I used the know-how I had acquired from learning to walk. Both of these, walking and running, were useful to me when I decided to learn cross-country skiing. Each skill remains available, except in the rare cases of accident or injury, for a lifetime.

The '''Calmecac''' ("the house of the lineage", {{IPA-nah|kalˈmekak||}}) was a school for the sons of [[Aztec]] nobility (''[[Pipiltin|pīpiltin]]'' {{IPA-nah|piːˈpiɬtin||}}) in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Postclassic period]] of [[Mesoamerica]]n history, where they would receive rigorous religious and military training. The two main primary sources for information on the ''calmecac'' and ''telpochcalli'' are in [[Bernardino de Sahagún]]'s [[Florentine Codex]] of the ''General History of the Things of New Spain'' (Books III, VI, and VIII) and part 3 of the [[Codex Mendoza]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Calneck, "The Calmecac and Telpochcalli in Pre-Conquest Tenochtitlan," in ''The Work of Bernardino de Sahagún: Pioneer Ethnographer of Sixteenth-Century Aztec Mexico'', J. Jorge Klor de Alva et al., eds.  Albany: SUNY Albany Institute for Mesoamerican Studies 1988, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the calmecac has been characterized as for elites only, Sahagun's account says that at times commoners, [[macehualtin]] were assigned to the calmecac as well and trained for the priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Calneck, "The Calmecac and Telpochcalli" p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hassig (1988), p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tēlpochcalli]] ({{IPA-nah|teːɬpot͡ʃˈkalːi||}} "house of youth") was where mostly commoners and some noble youths received military training, but would have been precluded from the higher ranks of power.&lt;ref&gt;Calnek, "Calmecac and Telpochcalli", p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Codex Mendoza's account of the calmecac emphasizes the possibilities of upward mobility for young commoner men, (''macehualtin''), educated in the telpochcalli. The placement of a noble youth in the telpochcalli might have been by lesser wives' or concubines' sons or younger sons, perhaps of commoner status, so that the boys did not have to compete with noble youths in the calmecac.&lt;ref&gt;Calnek, "Calmecac and Telpochcalli", p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;  Codex Mendoza's account largely ignores class distinctions between the two institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Calnek, "Calmecac and Telpochcalli", p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The calmecac of the Aztec capital, [[Tenochtitlan]], was located in the ceremonial center of the city and it was dedicated to [[Quetzalcoatl]].&lt;ref&gt;Hassig (1988), p.34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''calmecac'' was the students' home for the duration of their training, and they would enter the school as young as five to seven years of age. The students received instruction in songs, rituals, reading and writing, the [[Aztec calendar|calendar]] (''[[tonalpohualli|tōnalpōhualli]]'' {{IPA-nah|toːnaɬpoːˈwalːi||}}) and all the basic training which was also taught in the telpochcalli.

Students commenced formal military training around age fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig (1988), p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Promising sons of nobles would be trained especially by the military orders of the [[Jaguar warriors]] (''ōcēlōmeh'' {{IPA-nah|oːseːˈloːmeʔ||}}) or [[Eagle warrior]]s (''cuāuhtin'' {{IPA-nah|ˈkʷaːʍtin||}}) in their quarters, the ''cuāuhcalli'' ({{IPA-nah|kʷaːʍˈkalːi||}}).&lt;ref&gt;Hassig (1988), p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Communication apprehension'''  is the level of anxiety triggered by the real or anticipated communication act, as defined by McCroskey.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCroskey|first1=James|last2=Beatty|first2=M.|title=Shyness: Perspectives on research and treatment|date=1986|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York, NY|pages=219–293|url=http://www.jamescmccroskey.com/publications/bookchapters/007_1986_C21.pdf|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is connected to the idea of judgment from the audience, and [[self-image]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://open.lib.umn.edu/publicspeaking/front-matter/publisher-information/|title=Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and Ethics of Public Speaking|last1=Creative Commons license|first=|date=2011|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication apprehension, CA, can cause a variety of involuntary responses such as "stomach butterflies", shaking, nausea, sweating, forgetting the information, among many others. The term communication apprehension is usually connected with 'stage fright';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Communication Yearbook 6|last=Burgoon|first=Michael|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9781135148799|location=|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this response is not necessarily connected with a delivery on a stage or in front of a large audience.&lt;ref name="ED284315"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holbrook|first1=Hilary Taylor|title=Communication Apprehension: The Quiet Student in Your Classroom.|journal=ERIC Digest|date=1987|volume=ERIC Clearinghouse on Reading and Communication Skills Urbana IL.|url=https://www.ericdigests.org/pre-926/quiet.htm|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This anxiety can be caused by any of the five forms of communication: [[Intrapersonal communication|intrapersonal]], [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]], group, public, and [[mass communication]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Types==
There are different types of communication apprehension, each of these types represent a specific or general situation that presents a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] for this anxiety response. McCroskey argues that there are four types of communication apprehension:

===Trait anxiety===
Trait anxiety is considered a personality type, which represents that the individual has an orientation to feel anxiety during the communication act regardless of the situation, audience or context.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Witt, P. L., Brown, K. C., Roberts, J. B., Weisel, J., Sawyer, C., &amp; Behnke, R. (2006, March). Somatic anxiety patterns before, during and after giving a public speech. Southern Communication Journal, 71, 87–100.&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of people will avoid exposing themselves to a communication situation, since their communication apprehension is part of their daily behavior.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/304210263|title=Communication apprehension and individual learning style preference: Correlations and dimensions|last=Dwyer|first=Karen|date=1995|website=The University of Nebraska - Lincoln|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCroskey and Beatty argue that some people have a higher vulnerability factor for communication apprehension due to genetics, also known as [[communibiology]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;McCroskey, J. C.; Beatty, M. J. (2000). "The communibiological perspective: Implications for communication in instruction". ''Communication Education''. '''49''': 1. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1080%2F03634520009379187 10.1080/03634520009379187].&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers oppose this idea and argue that it can not be solely inherited but rather a personality trait acquired; therefore, it can be changed. However, they can compromise that around 80% of communication apprehension is obtained within our neurological structures, which are determined genetically. Furthermore, only 20% is influenced by an environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Boren, Justin P.; Veksler, Alice E. (2011).

''Communication Research Trends''. '''30''' (4): 1–31. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] [https://www.worldcat.org/issn/0144-4646 0144-4646].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Meaning that this type of communication apprehension can be improved with practice and other techniques; however, it will not be completely eliminated since it is inherited.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Context anxiety===
Context anxiety triggers communication apprehension due to a specific context. This is considered a psychological response caused by a specific context but not necessarily on others; a person can have no problem talking to her best friend but can get anxiety while talking in front of a class. The most known example for context anxiety is public speaking; almost 70% of students suffer from a certain level of communication apprehension trigger by public speaking.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There are other contexts that can create a similar response such as speaking in front of class, small group discussions, or meetings.&lt;ref name="ED284315" /&gt;

===Audience anxiety===
Audience anxiety is when a specific individual or group of people creates a problem on communication, or a reverse reaction. For some people, anxiety can be caused by familiar peers, while for others it can be caused by unfamiliar faces.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At the beginning of a speech class, the students tend to be fearful since they see new faces which increases the levels of communication apprehension. However, once the students get to know each other they feel comfortable; decreasing or eliminating their levels of apprehension.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Dwyer, Karen Kangas; Carlson, Robert E.; and Dalbey, Jennifer (2003) "Impact of High School Preparation on College Oral Communication Apprehension," Basic Communication Course Annual: Vol. 15 , Article 9. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ecommons.udayton.edu/bcca/vol15/iss1/9&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation anxiety===
Situational anxiety is a psychological reaction of a person due to a specific situation that may not have any relation with the person or context.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This anxiety is triggered by a special combination of audience and context that involves different dimensions and creates a unique scenario.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As an example we can see a first date. Although a person may not suffer from communication apprehension; the situation of being with a person that they have feelings for, on a new environment, and being the first time they experience this situation, can increase the stress levels and create communication apprehension.

==PRCA==
The PRCA 10 is a test created to determine the communication shyness of a speaker. This test shows that communication apprehension is not limited to public speaking since it allows you to identify different situations that can trigger anxiety, these situations belong to an apprehension triggered by context, context anxiety.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The four situations that are presented on the test are: group discussion, meetings, interpersonal, and public speaking.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

This test provides an easy equation to obtain a score for each category, these scoress are compared to the ranges provided at the end of the test; these ranges were obtained by a study of over 40,000 college students and over 3,000 non-students adults provided on a national sample.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By this comparison, the test taker can determine their level of communication apprehension for each scenario, ranking them with a low, moderate or high level of apprehension. The test is able to provide a diagnostic of context anxiety and overall communication apprehension by simply adding the sub scores and comparing the total score.

In [[higher education in Canada]], [[Nigeria]] and the [[Higher education in the United States of America|United States]], a '''course''' is a unit of teaching that typically lasts one [[academic term]], is led by one or more instructors ([[teacher]]s or [[professor]]s), and has a fixed roster of [[student]]s. A course is usually an individual subject.  Students may receive a [[grade (education)|grade]] and academic [[Credit (education)|credit]] after completion of the course.&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/course "course"] in ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary''. Retrieved 15 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and [[Singapore]], as well as parts of [[Canada]], a '''course''' is the entire programme of studies required to complete a [[university]] degree, and the word "unit" or "module" would be used to refer to an academic course as it is referred to in other parts of the world, for example [[North America]] and the rest of [[Europe]].

In between the two, in South Africa, a course officially is the collection of all courses (in the American sense, these are often called "modules") over a year or semester, though the American usage is common.  In the Philippines, a course can be an individual subject (usually referred to by faculty and school officials) or the entire programme (usually referred to by students and outsiders).

Courses are time-limited in most universities worldwide, lasting anywhere between several weeks to several semesters. They can either be compulsory material or "elective". An elective is usually not a required course, but there are a certain number of non-specific electives that are required for certain majors.

==Types of courses==
Courses are made up of individual sessions, typically on a fixed weekly schedule.

There are different formats of course in universities:

*the [[lecture]] course, where the instructor gives lectures with minimal interaction;
*the [[seminar]], where students prepare and present their original written work for discussion and critique;
*the [[:wikt:colloquium|colloquium]] or reading course, where the instructor assigns readings for each session which are then discussed by the members;
*the [[tutorial]] course, where one or a small number of students work on a topic and meet with the instructor weekly for discussion and guidance.
*the [[Directed Individual Study]] course, where a student requests to create and title an area of study for themselves which is more concentrated and in-depth than a standard course. It is directed under a [[tenure]]d faculty member and approved by a [[professor|department chair]] or possibly the [[dean (education)|dean]] within that specific college;
*the [[laboratory]] course, where most work takes place in a laboratory.

Many courses combine these formats.  Lecture courses often include weekly [[discussion section]]s with smaller groups of students led by the principal instructor, another instructor, or [[teaching assistant]].  Laboratory courses often combine lectures, discussion sections, and laboratory sessions.

Students are expected to do various kinds of work for a course:

*Attending course sessions.
*Reading and studying course readings assigned in the course [[syllabus]].
*Discussing material they have read.
*Writing short and long [[essay|paper]]s based on assigned reading and their own [[library]] [[research]].
*Completing homework or problem sets.
*Completing laboratory exercises.
*Taking quizzes and [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s.

The exact work required depends on the discipline, the course, and the particular instructor.  Unlike most European university courses, grades are generally determined by all of these kinds of work, not only the final examination.

==Elective and required courses==
An elective course is one chosen by a student from a number of optional subjects or courses in a curriculum, as opposed to a required course which the student must take. While required courses (sometimes called "core courses" or "general education courses") are deemed essential for an academic degree, elective courses tend to be more specialized. Elective courses usually have fewer students than the required courses.

The term [[Elective (medical)|elective]] is also used for a period of [[medicine|medical]] study conducted away from the student's home [[medical school]], often abroad. Motivations for choosing such a program include a wish to experience other cultures, and to learn how to work in the clinical situations in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.bmj.com/issues/05/02/editorials/47.php A guide for electives]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, North American universities require students to achieve both breadth of knowledge across disciplines and depth of knowledge in a particular chosen subject area, known as a major. Thus, students of the Arts or Humanities are required to take some science courses, and vice versa. Normally, students are free to choose their particular electives from among a wide range of courses offered by their university, as long as the students possess the prerequisite knowledge to understand the subject matter being taught. An English major, for example, might also study one or two years of chemistry, biology or physics as well as mathematics and a foreign language.

Elective courses are also offered in the third and fourth years of university, though the choice is more restrictive and will depend upon the particular major the student has chosen. For example, at the [[University of British Columbia]], students intending to specialize in [[Sanskrit]] as part of a major in Asian language and culture will usually have to complete several Sanskrit and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] or [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] courses during the first two years of university, as well as additional courses in other languages of India in the third and fourth years of study. In addition to these required courses, however, students would choose among several third- and fourth-year elective courses on topics not directly related to India, such as the history and culture of [[China]], [[Japan]] or [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="ubcasia"&gt;[http://www.students.ubc.ca/calendar/index.cfm?tree=12,197,282,62#1382 Major in Asian Language and Culture], ''UBC Calendar 2009/10''. Retrieved 2009-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course numbering system==

In the United States, most universities implement a course numbering system where each course is identified by the name of the [[Major (academic)|major]] (or an abbreviation thereof) followed by a 3- or 4-digit number − for example, [[Computer science|CS]] 123. This common numbering system was designed to make transfer between colleges easier. In theory, any numbered course in one academic institution should bring a student to the same standard as a similarly numbered course at other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Higher education in the United States: an encyclopedia |author = Forest, J.J.F. |year = 2002 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sFFX9OIkF2IC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=course%20numbering%20systems&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page = 73 |publisher = ABC-CLIO |isbn = 1-57607-248-7 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first digit of the course number is related to its level, or relative difficulty, of the course,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://bulletins.psu.edu/undergrad/courses/ |title = University Course Descriptions |work = University Bulletin |publisher = [[Pennsylvania State University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://handbook.psu.edu/content/course-numbering-system |title = Course Numbering System |work = University Undergraduate Advising Handbook |publisher = [[Pennsylvania State University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can roughly correspond the year of study in which the course is likely to be taken. It's common for the second digit to represent the subfield in the department within which the course is offered − for example, in a Physics department, all courses numbered PHYS 47xx may be about magnetism, while all PHYS 48xx courses may be about optics. The attribution of the third and fourth digits is less standardized, but in general, sequences of related courses tend to have consecutive course numbers, with gaps between such sequences to signal different sets of courses.

The [[101 (topic)|course number 101]] is often used for an introductory course at a beginner's level in a department's subject area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11958">{{Critical pedagogy}}
'''Critical consciousness''', '''conscientization''', or '''{{lang|pt|[[w:pt:conscientização|conscientização]]}}''' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], is a popular education and social concept developed by Brazilian [[pedagogue]] and [[educational theory|educational theorist]] [[Paulo Freire]], grounded in [[post-Marxist]] [[critical theory]]. Critical consciousness focuses on achieving an in-depth understanding of the world, allowing for the perception and exposure of social and political contradictions. Critical consciousness also includes taking action against the oppressive elements in one's life that are illuminated by that understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Mustakova-Possardt, M (2003) [http://onecountry.org/e152/e15216as_Review_Consciousness_story.htm "Is there a roadmap to critical consciousness? Critical Consciousness: A Study of Morality in Global, Historical Context."] ''One Country. 15''(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coinage==
The [[English language|English]] term "conscientization" is a translation of the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] term {{lang|pt|conscientização}}, which is also translated as "[[consciousness raising]]" and "critical consciousness". The term was popularized by [[Brazil]]ian educator, activist, and theorist [[Paulo Freire]] in his 1970 work ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]''. Freire was teaching the poor and illiterate members of Brazilian society to read at a time when literacy was a requirement for [[suffrage]] and dictators ruled many [[South America]]n countries. The term originally derives from [[Frantz Fanon]]'s coinage of a French term, {{lang|fr|conscienciser}}, in his 1952 book, ''Black Skins, White Masks''.

==Overview==
Paulo Freire defines critical consciousness as the ability to "intervene in reality in order to change it."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critical consciousness proceeds through the identification of "generative themes", which Freire identifies as "iconic representations that have a powerful emotional impact in the daily lives of learners." In this way, individual consciousness helps end the "[[Conspiracy of silence (expression)|culture of silence]]" in which the socially dispossessed internalize the negative images of themselves created and propagated by the oppressor in situations of extreme poverty. Liberating learners from this [[mimicry]] of the powerful, and the fratricidal violence that results therefrom is a major goal of critical consciousness. Critical consciousness is a fundamental aspect of Freire's concept of [[popular education]].

[[Arlene Goldbard]], an author on the subject of community cultural development finds the concept of conscientization to be a foundation of community cultural development.  From the glossary of Goldbard's 2006 book [[New Village Press|''New Creative Community.'']]: "Conscientization is an ongoing process by which a learner moves toward critical consciousness. This process is the heart of liberatory education. It differs from "consciousness raising" in that the latter may involve transmission of preselected knowledge. Conscientization means engaging in [[Praxis (process)|praxis]], in which one both reflects and takes action on their social reality to break through prevailing mythologies and reach new levels of awareness—in particular, awareness of [[oppression]], being an "object" of others’ will rather than a self-determining "subject." The process of conscientization involves identifying contradictions in experience through dialogue and becoming part of the process of changing the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newvillagepress.net/pub_newCreativeComm.html Creative Communication] ''New Village Press''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History of application==
The ancient [[Greeks]] first identified the essence of critical consciousness when philosophers encouraged their students to develop an "impulse and willingness to stand back from humanity and nature... [and] to make them objects of thought and criticism, and to search for their meaning and significance.&lt;ref&gt;Thorton, B. "Critical Consciousness and Liberal Education" in Watson, B. (2006) ''Civic Education And Culture.''&lt;/ref&gt; In his books ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed''&lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (1970) ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed.'' New York: Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Education for Critical Consciousness'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Freire, P. (2005) ''Education for Critical Consciousness.'' New York: Continuum International Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; Freire explains critical consciousness as a sociopolitical educative tool that engages learners in questioning the nature of their historical and social situation, which Freire addressed as "reading the world". The goal of critical consciousness, according to Freire, should be acting as subjects in the creation of democratic society. In [[education]], Freire implies [[intergenerational equity]] between students and teachers in which both learn, both question, both reflect and both participate in [[meaning-making]]. Using this idea, and describing current instructional methods as [[wikt:homogenization|homogenization]] and [[lockstep]] standardization, alternative approaches are proposed, such as the Sudbury model of democratic education schools, an alternative approach in which children, by [[Sudbury model#Individual_freedom.2C_freedom_of_choice.2C_learning_and_learning_through_experience|enjoying personal freedom]] thus [[Sudbury model#Discipline|encouraged to exercise personal responsibility for their actions]], [[Literacy#Criticism_of_the_concept_of_teaching_literacy|learn at their own pace]] rather than following a previously imposed chronologically-based curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1992). ''"Special Education" -- A noble Cause Sacrificed to Standardization, ''Education in America -- A View from Sudbury Valley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1992).

Chapter 1, ''And 'Rithmetic,'' Free at Last -- The Sudbury Valley School,.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar form students learn all the subjects, techniques and skills in these schools. The staff are minor actors, the "teacher" is an adviser and helps just when asked.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987), Chapter 19, ''Learning,'' Free at Last -- The Sudbury Valley School.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, H. (1987). [http://www.sudval.com/05_underlyingideas.html#03 ''The Art of Doing Nothing,''] The Sudbury Valley School Experience. Accessed November 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sudbury model|Sudbury model of democratic education]] schools maintain that [[values]], [[social justice]], critical consciousness, intergenerational equity, and political consciousness included, must be [[Experiential learning|learned through experience]],&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D.

(eds) (2005). ''Oxford Dictionary of Scientific Quotations.'' Oxford University Press. 21:9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Picking up on Freire's definition of critical consciousness, [[Joe L. Kincheloe]] has expanded the definition of the concept in his work on postformalism. In Kincheloe's formulation postformalism connects cognition to critical theoretical questions of power and social justice. In this context Kincheloe constructs a critical theory of cognition that explores questions of meaning, emancipation vis-a-vis ideological inscription, and a particular focus on the socio-political construction of the self. With these concerns in mind Kincheloe's postformal critical consciousness engages questions of purpose, issues of human dignity, freedom, authority, reconceptualized notions of reason, intellectual quality, and social responsibility. Postformal critical consciousness stimulates a conversation between critical pedagogy and a wide range of social, cultural, political economic, psychological, and philosophical concerns. Kincheloe employs this "multilogical conversation" to shape new modes of self-awareness, more effective forms of social, political, and pedagogical action, and an elastic model of an evolving critical consciousness (Kincheloe and Steinberg, 1993; Kincheloe, 1999; Thomas and Kincheloe, 2006).

Freire's development of critical consciousness has been expanded upon in several academic disciplines and common applications.&lt;ref&gt;Adelson, L (1987) "Contemporary Critical Consciousness: Peter Sloterdijk, Oskar Negt/Alexander Kluge, and the 'New Subjectivity'." ''German Studies Review. 10''(1); pp. 57-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Public health community collaborations focused on HIV prevention for women,&lt;ref&gt;Champeau, D. &amp; Shaw, S. (2002) "Power, empowerment, and critical consciousness in community collaboration: Lessons from an advisory panel for an HIV awareness media campaign for women." ''Women Health. 36''(3):31-50.&lt;/ref&gt; the role of critical consciousness in adult education,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, E., Tisdell, E. &amp; Stone Hanley, M. (2000) ''The Role of Positionality in Teaching for Critical Consciousness: Implications for Adult Education.'' Paper presented at the 2000 Adult Education Research Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt; and the effect of peer pressure on cigarette smokers&lt;ref&gt;Zucker, A., Stewart, A., Pomerleau, C. &amp; Boyd, C. (2005) "Resisting Gendered Smoking Pressures: Critical Consciousness as a Correlate of Women's Smoking Status," ''Behavioral Science. 53''(3-4); 261-272.&lt;/ref&gt;  Freire's notion of critical consciousness is, in part, a type of [[political consciousness]].

{{tone|date=May 2015}}
A '''culminating project''' (also known as a '''senior project''', '''grad project''' or '''exit project'''), is a project that challenges high school seniors to demonstrate their academic knowledge in an experiential way (in most cases). According to the US Dept of Education&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; State Education Boards typically allow individual [[school district]]s to customize the project, based on basic state guidelines. 

== Confusion about the culminating project ==

People reporting on the culminating project sometimes confuse the terminology with the state [[high school exit exam]]. The state exit exam is a written exam that usually tests student’s math, reading, writing, and science skills, whereas the culminating project is a required project that is usually a learning experience based on a topic chosen by the student. The project is mandatory in order to graduate.

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the project is to increase both teaching and learning. High school graduation standards have declined for several decades. [[Education reform|School reform]] or the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/parents/academic/involve/nclbguide/parentsguide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a way to bring value back to the high school diploma as well as support students  as they go out into the world prepared for college, a job, the military, entrepreneurship, internship, or whatever path students decide to follow once they graduate.

== Why a project is required ==
The requirement is an effort to increase the education standards. As [[college admissions]] and the workplace require more from their recruits, nationwide high schools must also.

In an effort to be clear, it is restated that the culminating project is not required by all schools. Again, parents and guardians would have to check with the student’s school official website for graduation requirements.

However, for students that are required to complete a culminating project, this is a chance for the student to explore a topic of personal interest. The project provides an opportunity that student may not have otherwise. By completing the project, students have a [[real life experience]] that can help them in their next adventure in life (college, job, entrepreneurship, military, internship, etc.).

Students gain a number of important skills by participating in the process such as,
* Leadership
* Communication
* Project management
* [[Time management]]
* Group skills
* Negotiation skills
* Meeting deadlines
* Conflict management
* [[Public speaking]]
* Presentation skills
* [[Self motivation]]

== Kinds of projects ==
The high school graduation culminating project format varies from state to state and even school to school within the same state. Parents and guardians will have to check with their students specific school for their requirements. Typically the project consists of choosing a topic of interest, writing a [[Academic publishing|research paper]] on that topic, having an experience directly related to the topic, keeping a journal of artifacts demonstrating your work, followed by the final step which is a presentation (US Dept of Education).

The student usually presents the project to a panel consisting of 2-5 people typically made up of teachers, community members, faculty, and staff. However, some schools have student present to a panel of their peers. Schools and school districts have total discretion to format the process in a way that works best for their students and their school culture.

In some cases, students complete a project on their own with the support of a mentor from their community. Some schools allow group projects and [[Presentation of a group|group presentation]]. For example, it would not be uncommon for the leadership class of a school to raise funds to build a school in Africa. Other requirements include a mandatory social/community aspect related to the project which means the high school graduation project has to benefit someone other than the student.

The '''"Method of Currere"''' is an approach to education based on [[post-modern philosophy]] and [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical technique]], first described in a 1975 paper by [[William Pinar]].&lt;ref name="Pinar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pinar|first=William Frederick|year=1975|title=The method of currere|journal=American Educational Research Association|url=http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED104766.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The method ==

Currere encourages educators and learners to undertake an autobiographical examination of themselves.

Pinar suggests that the term ''currere'', the infinitive form of [[curriculum]], implies the framework for the autobiographical reflection on educational experiences that ultimately shape an individual's self-understanding in our democratic society. In relation to curriculum Pinar states, "The method of currere reconceptualized curriculum from course objectives to complicated conversation with oneself (as a 'private' intellectual), an ongoing project of self-understanding in which one becomes mobilized for engaged pedagogical action — as a private-and-public intellectual – with others in the social reconstruction of the public sphere".&lt;ref name="pinar2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinar|first=William|title=What is curriculum theory?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOjsgKnT2asC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-8058-4827-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The framework ==

Pinar proposes a framework for the method of currere requiring those involved in education to reflect upon their life experiences thus far. The framework includes four steps or benchmarks to be followed.&lt;ref name="Pinar"/&gt; The steps are: the regressive, the progressive, the analytical, and the synthetic. Pinar uses the four steps as a framework to reflect on curriculum theory and public education. The framework's purpose is as follows, "This four step process includes retelling the story of one's educational experiences, imagining future possibilities for self-understanding and educational practice; analysis of the relationships between past, present and future life history and practice; and new ways of thinking about education".

Step one: The regressive step encourages learner/educators to remember particular educational experiences and how the past experiences have guided them in the development of their own personal attitude or beliefs about education. This allows them to understand how the past has not only affected them, but the people surrounding them. Pinar says one's past is "shared, each in his or her own way, by us all."&lt;ref name="pinar2004"/&gt; They may remember past experiences and how they overcame struggles as a young person in society. [[John Dewey]] describes experience through trial and error. He states, "We simply do something, and when it fails, we do something else, and keep on trying till we hit upon something which works, and then we adopt that method as a rule of thumb measure in subsequent procedure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRFWAJJVE_EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=1916 repub. 2011|isbn=978-1-60444-120-8|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Step two: The progressive step offers an opportunity to think about the future.

Step three: The analytical step involves analyzing the here and now and creates a subjective space of freedom from the present. Students and teachers may see the moments of right here and now as a "historical moment in which we lived, in which others have lived, and in which our descendants will someday live".&lt;ref name="pinar2004"/&gt;

Step four: The final step is the synthetic step which involves analyzing the present in light of the knowledge and understanding gained from steps 1, 2, and 3. Many educators may use the first three steps to visualize and analyze their journey of becoming an educator. When they ultimately begin affecting others' lives and working with curriculum, educators find themselves in the synthetic stage of becoming. "One utilizes insights from past, present and future to create transformed educational environments".&lt;ref name="Kissel-Ito"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kissel-Ito|first=Cindy|date=May 2008|title=The name assigned to the document by the author. This field may also contain sub-titles, series names, and report numbers. "Currere" as Transformative Story Telling in Religious Education|journal=Religious Education|publisher=Routledge|volume=103|issue=3|pages=339–350|url=http://www.religiouseducation.net/member/06_rea_papers/Kissel-Ito_Cindy.pdf|doi=10.1080/00344080802053519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==

James G. Henderson and Rosie Gornik use currere in Transformative Curriculum Leadership as they present educators a particular type of curriculum judgment. They use a paradigm called curriculum wisdom problem solving while envisioning curriculum as a journey. Just as Pinar presents our process of becoming a journey, Henderson and Gornik use currere throughout their writing with the purpose of allowing the reader insights into firsthand accounts of educators' experiences. They work closely with teaching for [[3S Understanding]]—"referring to the integration of Subject matter understanding with democratic Self and Social understanding and undertaking a personal journey of understanding".&lt;ref name="henderson2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderson|first1=James George|last2=Gornik|first2=Rosemary|title=Transformative curriculum leadership|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Merrill/Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-113896-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Transformative Curriculum Leadership we find Gornik's deep self-understanding in regard to [[3S Understanding]] through her currere. She presents the reader with various autobiographical narratives and vignettes written to inspire the reader to delve into their own currere and examine their own self-understanding.

Henderson and Gornik (2007) say they incorporate the currere method in their book because they "acknowledge that educators who choose to facilitate their students' personalized journeys of understanding cannot do so without undertaking a similar journey of understanding".&lt;ref name="henderson2007"/&gt; Educators have many responsibilities including presenting their students with opportunities or ideas of how to become active members in today's democratic society. The purpose of the book is to encourage the reader to become a "connoisseur" of democratic education with an understanding of educational growth in societies with democratic values.&lt;ref name="henderson2007"/&gt;

The [[graduation]] completion rate is the measure reflecting the number of [[student]]s who complete their graduation and receive a [[Academic degree|degree]] from an [[educational institution]]. The [[Dropping out|drop-out]] rate is the measure reflecting the number of students who disengage with the educational institutions they are enrolled in. Those measures are calculated by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] (NCES), the primary federal [[United States|U.S.]] entity for collecting and analyzing data related to education.

Graduation rate has been reported to be decreasing over the past decades in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dailycollegian.com/2011/01/30/graduation-rates-decrease-nationwide/ |title=Graduation rates decrease nationwide |last1=Kiss |first1=Claire Reid|last2=Fuller  |first2=Andrea  |date=January 30, 2011 |website= |publisher=The Massachusetts Daily Collegian |access-date=September 29, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the percentage of dropouts among 16-24-year-olds has shown some decreases over the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2011/2011015.pdf |title=Digest of Education Statistics, 2010, Introduction p.1 |last1=Snyder |first1=Thomas D. |last2=Dillow |first2=Sally A. |date=April 2011 |website= |publisher=NCES |access-date=September 29, 2018 |quote=}}   &lt;/ref&gt; The substantial growth in college enrollment among high school graduates has not been matched with a comparable expansion in [[college degree]] attainment.&lt;ref name="BLT"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1257/app.2.3.129| title = Why Have College Completion Rates Declined? An Analysis of Changing Student Preparation and Collegiate Resources| journal = American Economic Journal: Applied Economics| volume = 2| issue = 3| pages = 129–157| year = 2010| last1 = Bound | first1 = J.| last2 = Lovenheim | first2 = M. F.| last3 = Turner | first3 = S.| pmc = 3140225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Historical background ===

Degree completion has been decreasing since 1970. Bound, Lovenheim and Turner (2010) studied why the college completion rate declined.&lt;ref name="BLT"/&gt; Their main explanations of the decreasing rate are the changes in student preparation and the collegiate resources. The authors explain that between 1970 and 1999, [[Post-secondary education|post-secondary institution]]s saw a significant increase in enrollments and, at the same time, a decrease in college completion. "Partly as a consequence of the substantial increase in the college wage premium since 1980, a much higher fraction of high school graduates enter college today than they did a quarter century ago. However, the rise in the fraction of high school graduates attending college has not been met by a proportional increase in the fraction who finish."&lt;ref name="BLT"/&gt;

A study by the [[Higher Education Research Institute]] of the [[University of California]] underlines that in 1994. fewer college students were completing their college in four years than in 1984. The completion rate within four years was 36.4% in 1994, whereas it was 46.7% in the late 1960s. The degree completion when the students were allowed to graduate in six years was 58.8% in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander W. Astin, Leticia Osegura (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; "The fact that these public-private differences decline somewhat when six-year rates are used suggests that students in the public colleges and universities are taking longer to complete their degrees," says Professor [[Alexander Astin|Alexander W. Astin]], co-author of the study and Director of the [[Higher Education Research Institute]]. The current trend is of longer time spent to graduate than it was 50 years ago.

=== Main causes ===

The main causes of the decreasing [[college]] completion rate are the lower preparation level of the [[student]]s and the small allocation of resources dedicated to instruction and institutional choices, according to Bound, Lovenheim and Turner and their study on "Understanding Decrease in Completion Rates and Increase in Time to Degree".&lt;ref name="BLT"/&gt; The resources allocated to institutions haven't been enough to offset the increase of new students enrollment in [[higher education]] institutions.

{{quotation | The abstract of the study "Understanding Decrease in Completion Rates and Increase in Time to Degree" by John Bound, Michael Lovenheim, Sarah Turner (2009) says:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"Persistent increases in the wage premium five college graduates in recent decades have not
 been matched by gains in collegiate attainment. Indeed, the proportion of students entering college
 who receive degrees has slowed while time to completion of the baccalaureate degree has increased
 markedly among college graduates in the United States over the last three decades. Using data from
 the NLS72 and NELS:88 longitudinal surveys, we find that while enrollment rates have increased
 disproportionately among those students less well prepared for college, these students are unlikely to
 complete BA degrees resulting in an overall decline in the completion rate. In contrast, we find that
 changes in the composition of the college going population can account for essentially none of the
 observed increase in time to degree. The increase in time to degree is localized among those who
 begin postsecondary education at public colleges outside the most selective universities. We produce
 evidence that increased stratification in U.S. higher education and reductions in collegiate resources
 outside the top-tier of institutions are a primary component of the explanation for the observed
 increases in time to degree, with increases in time to degree relatively concentrated in states that have
 experienced rapid growth in the size of the college-age population and dilution in resources per student
 at many public colleges. Further, evidence of increased hours of employment among students is
 consistent with students working more to meet rising college costs thereby negatively affecting the
 length of time it takes them to complete college".&lt;ref name="BLT"/&gt; }}

== Current situation ==

The [[US Census Bureau]] in 2009 reported that, nationally, 9% of 18–24 year-olds and only 27.5% of those 25 years and older had a [[bachelor's degree]] or more. [[Massachusetts]] is the state where the completion rate is the highest with 37.8% of citizens 25 years and older having a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's degree]].  In [[West Virginia]], the completion rate is the lowest with only 17.1%&lt;ref&gt;US Census Bureau 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  of the population having [[bachelor's degree]]s.

In his [[2010 State of the Union Address]], [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] said that he wants the United States to have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. To reach this "big goal", American college graduates should increase by 50%, adding at least 8 million additional graduates. Obama said that increasing college completion rate is important to increase economic opportunities and lower social costs for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;The Progress of Education Reform 2007 : Dropout prevention (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early colleges ===
Early colleges have lower drop-outs rate than community colleges and universities.The [[early college high school]] programs provide students the opportunity to receive a high school diploma and an [[associate's degree]], or up to two years of credit toward a bachelor's degree, in four years. Students take a mixture of high school and college classes in order to obtain their high school diploma and [[associate's degree]]. Each early college high school is a public school and open to any residents in the school district. Early colleges have the advantage of allowing student an alternative to the traditional access to diplomas.

=== Community colleges ===
Community colleges have the mission to provide better access to higher education and graduation for under-served populations. Greater access and success in post-secondary education is a primary element for decreasing [[Income inequality|income inequalities]] and increasing the [[productivity]] of America's workers.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Ben Benarke&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, 46% of all undergraduate students in the US attended [[community college]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Report from College Board's National Commission on Community College (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Long and Kurlaender studied the graduation differences between [[community college]]s and [[University|universities]] and found that community college students were 14.5% less likely to complete their degree within 9 years as opposed to students in universities.&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Terry Long, Michal Kurlaender (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research studied the effect of incentive payments at community colleges and found that they increased the likelihood of low-income students enrolling in the second semester after random assignment and total number of credits earned, with program group students completing nearly 40 percent more credits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2009/wp2009_13.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''Paying for Performance: The Education Impacts of a Community College Scholarship Program for Low-income Adults'', February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other recent research shows other methods of increasing graduation and persistence rates.  Century College in Minnesota implemented GPS Lifeplan to help develop goals in areas such as education, leadership, and finance.  The concepts in GPS Lifeplan are integrated in many areas of the college such as New Student Seminars and other areas of curriculum. New full-time student using GPS Lifeplan retention rates were 81% compared  to overall retention of 72%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promising practices for community college student success|url=http://www.ccsse.org/docs/Matter_of_Degrees.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2013|author=Center for Community College Student Engagement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universities ===
In universities, efforts are made on targeting the "at-risk" students to avoid drop outs, and creating aligned programs for better coordination between [[high school]]s and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Davis Jenkins (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Successful transfer to 4-year institutions is an issue that concerns every higher educational institution. Academic preparation in high school and solid coordination with those institutions are highly suitable for improving graduation rates.&lt;ref&gt;Josipa Roksa,Juan Carlos Calciagno (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public policies ==

Organizations and associations such as [[Lumina Foundation for Education]] and Delta Cost Project study how to reallocate the limited resources in ways that can increase college completion rates. Studies suggest that in order to respond to this issue of low graduation rates, states should focus on long term policy rather than short-term fixes. The re-examination of how resources are allocated would help to improve the higher education system and avoid drop outs. Several studies have been conducted in order to guide policies toward better ways to manage resources and drive [[expenditure]]s.

Webber and Ehrenberg studied the overall impact and the institutional-level impact based on institutional average [[SAT scores]] and the average federal [[Pell Grant]] given to students at the institution. They found that an increase in expenditures on instruction and student services resulted in higher education rates. The reallocation of resources from instruction to student services would result in a consequent increase in graduation rates. The researchers underline that the institutions with students academically unprepared or economically disadvantaged invest in focusing more on getting student services to potentially raise their students graduation rates.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas A Webber, Ronald G Ehrenberg (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 2011, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice-President]] [[Joe Biden]] declared&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/vice-president-biden-issues-call-action-boost-college-graduation-rates-nationwid|title=Vice President Biden Issues Call to Action to Boost College Graduation Rates Nationwide - U.S. Department of Education|website=www.ed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Right now we've got an education system that works like a funnel when we need it to work like a pipeline... We have to make the same commitment to getting folks across the graduation stage that we did to getting them into the register's office. The dreams and skills of our college graduates will pave the way to a bright economic future for our nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.democrats.org/news/blog/boosting_college_graduation_rates_across_the_country|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323034130/https://www.democrats.org/news/blog/boosting_college_graduation_rates_across_the_country|title=Boosting College Graduation Rates Across the Country|publisher=Democrats.org|archivedate=March 23, 2011|date=March 22, 2011|author=Mary Hough}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A New College Completion Tool Kit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/college_completion_tool_kit.pdf | title=College Completion Tool Kit | publisher=United States Department of Education | date=March 2011 | author=Arne Duncan | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325054514/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/college_completion_tool_kit.pdf | archivedate=March 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been developed by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] to help the governors and state governments develop better strategies for [[Higher education|higher-education]] promotion.
The solutions proposed by the College Completion Tool Kit urge government to set up financial [[incentive]]s to increase completion rate. The federal government advises to base funding formulas on enrollment rate but also on performance measures and outcome indicators. In order to improve institutions of higher education, states and public policies should:

* strengthen high school academic rigor
* make "college prep" the default track in high school
* create opportunities for high school students to earn [[college credit]]s
* develop and implement aggressive outreach strategies to reengage adult students who have received some college training short of certificate on degree attainment but dropped out
* restructure remedial education to meet individual student needs successfully
* restructure post-secondary education delivery to ensure that students complete their degrees in a timely manner

=== The case of Louisiana ===
The [[Lumina Foundation for Education]] proposes solutions to increase college completion rates and to meet President Obama's graduation goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/State_of_the_Union/state-of-the-union-2011-full-transcript/story?id=12759395|title=TRANSCRIPT: State of the Union 2011|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=January 27, 2011|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategies highlighted by The Lumina Foundation for Education are to increase the rate at which students complete college and to provide ways for adults in the workforce to return to college to complete degrees.&lt;ref name="A Stronger Nation"&gt;A Stronger Nation Through Higher Education - How and why Americans much achieve a "big goal" for college attainment, The Lumina Foundation for Education, September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

In Louisiana, the college attainment rate is 27%.&lt;ref name="A Stronger Nation"/&gt;{{rp|49}} In order to reach the "big goal", Louisiana would need to increase its annual degree production by 8.2%. The Lumina Foundation for Education advises some strategies:
* to target Louisiana residents who have completed some college without earning a degree
* to target parishes and regions in greater needs and to focus the state's effort there
Louisiana's challenge is to increase college students' success for working adults, low income students, first generation students and minority students.&lt;ref name="A Stronger Nation"/&gt;{{rp|50}}

== Controversy ==
[[File:Educational Attainment in the United States 2009.png|thumb|280px|This graph shows the educational attainment since 1940.&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/p20-578.pdf | title=Educational Attainment in the United States: 2015 | last1=Ryan | first1=Camille | last2=Siebens | first2=Julie | date=March 2016 | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau | accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The graduation completion rate is contested. January 2010 was when [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] stated in their issue that this rate fails to count students who take a long time to complete their degrees.&lt;ref&gt;The Chronicle of Higher Education, January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They qualified the rate as "an incomplete measure of institutional quality. The data describes a minority of all enrolled students, counting only full-time, first-time students who enroll in the fall and complete degrees within "150 percent of normal time"—six years for students seeking bachelor's degrees. The graduation rate excludes students who transfer to other colleges and earn degrees there. It also excludes transfer students who come in to finish college and graduate. By one estimate, the rate ignores up to 50 percent of all enrolled students".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Graduation-Rates-Fall-at/125614/|title=Graduation Rates Fall at One-Third of 4-Year Colleges|date=December 5, 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2506">A '''discount card''' is a card or document, often a plastic [[credit card]] or paper card, that entitles the holder to [[Discounts and allowances|discount]]s on the prices of some products or services. Cards may be issued as part of a [[loyalty program]], offering discounts to existing customers to ensure their continuing custom; they may be offered free of charge, offering a modest discount with the intention of persuading purchasers to patronise participating shops; or they may be sold to members, offering larger discounts—for example, the [[tastecard]] offers 50% discounts at many [[restaurant]]s—at a substantial annual cost. Cards may be offered by merchants or groups of merchants, by clubs or associations who negotiate on behalf of all members to obtain benefits, or by official organisations offering concessionary prices to qualifying groups, such as the disabled.

==Types==
* [[Loyalty program|Loyalty cards]]
* Cards giving entitlement to [[educational discount]]. In many cases, a discount may be offered on proof of student status, without a special card.
* Cards giving entitlement to [[military discount]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veteransadvantage.com/cms/about-us Card for former members of US military services] "to honor and thank all who serve our country", available on annual payment&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://discountcard.forcesreunited.org.uk/ UK card offering "Concessions and Recognition for ex-forces"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501032843/http://discountcard.forcesreunited.org.uk/ |date=May 1, 2012 }}, available on payment&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, a discount may be offered on proof of current or former membership of a military service, without a special card.
* Cards giving entitlement to [[disability discount]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/737/files/dpr818a.pdf Card offering discount in for parking in state parks to disabled people in California, USA], for small administrative charge&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, a discount may be offered on proof of disability, without a special card.
* [[Proof of Age Standards Scheme|Proof of age card]], a card which certifies the age of the holder. This type of card may, for example, be used by older children for free or discounted travel on [[public transport]]. Cards of this type are also used to certify that people of youthful appearance are old enough to legally buy, for example, [[tobacco]] and [[alcoholic beverage]]s.

'''Dr. univ.''' is an abbreviation for ''doctor universitatis'' (Doctor of University in English). It was a doctoral rank in [[Hungary]] classified between Master of Arts and CSc (Candidatus Scientiarum = old-style PhD). It was abolished in the 1990s; i.e., no more dr. univ. degrees were given. Many of those already having dr. univ. degrees had them converted into PhDs.

'''Educate Now''' is a non-profit education reform organization founded in 2008 and based in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. Its founder is education reform advocate and former [[Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education|State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education]] (BESE) member [[Leslie Jacobs]]. Ms. Jacobs was a key architect of Louisiana’s [[Recovery School District]] and is a former [[Orleans Parish School Board]] member.

The organization is chiefly focused on sustaining and enhancing the major transformation and reorganization of the previously failing [[New_Orleans_Public_Schools#Reorganization_of_school_system_following_Hurricane_Katrina|public school system in New Orleans]]. Educate Now is a strong supporter of decentralized school administration, including the expansion of publicly funded [[charter schools]], and performance metrics as major components of public school reform.

In addition to its advocacy role, Educate Now also serves as a source for information on school performance and education policy, with an emphasis on highlighting innovative and effective means for enhancing and facilitating school reform. Educate NOW! has become a useful tool that provides in-depth information regarding education such as school governance, facilities, academics and enrollment.  In addition to providing current news, the website also has an extensive archive of relative articles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17596">'''Educator effectiveness''' is a [[K–12 (education)|K-12 school system]] education policy initiative that measures the quality of an [[Teacher|educator]] performance in terms of improving student learning. It describes a variety of methods, such as observations, student assessments, student work samples and examples of teacher work, that education leaders use to determine the effectiveness of a K-12 educator.

The drive for educator effectiveness programs stem from [[Race to the top]] where states were awarded points for meeting educational policies based on the teacher's effectiveness. This policy was the basis of the emergence of statewide educator effectiveness programs.

Educator effectiveness programs vary from state to state.  Typically, an educator effectiveness program describes a cycle of observations and assessments that apply to different groups of teachers during an academic year. New teachers are evaluated more frequently, and veteran teachers are evaluated across multiple year cycles. Evaluated teachers have multiple scheduled classroom observations and conferences with the evaluator in addition to unannounced classroom observations. A controversial aspect of  The purpose of evaluations is to help educators determine what is effective in their practices and provides them a medium to reflect upon and change their practice to help teachers become more effective.

== Definition ==
Educator effectiveness is a method used in the K-12 school system that uses multiple measures of assessments including classroom observations, student work samples, assessment scores and teacher artifacts, to determine the impact a particular teacher has on student's learning outcomes. While schools have used teacher evaluation practices and policies for many years, the emergence of educator effectiveness policies combines these existing practices with rubrics and test scores to provide more robust perspectives on the work of teachers. Educator effectiveness initiatives often use descriptions of effective teaching practices, such as [[Charlotte Danielson]]'s "Framework for Teaching", to organize teaching separate domains for assessment. Danielson's domains include: Planning and Preparation, Classroom Environment, Professional Responsibilities, and Instruction.

== Purpose ==
Teacher evaluations have changed over time and have had different standards across the United States. Evaluation systems often have been comprised an administrator observing a teacher a couple times per year. In some locations, teacher observations were only done on a three-year or longer cycle. In the past, a Widget Effect, as described by [[The New Teacher Project]] has been established that has developed a culture where all teachers feel as though they deserve the highest marks on evaluations. Schools used to see their job as filling positions and thought that any teacher who was given a license was high quality, and thus scored them according to that thought process. Therefore, all teachers were getting scores that were good or great and no variation was able to be determined between any two teachers.

Today, federal and state policies have encouraged school systems to design more comprehensive evaluation systems that rely on multiple measures of how a teacher performs by looking at items such as student performance gains, classroom observations, teacher reflections, content specific knowledge and student reflections. Some policy makers and researchers encourage the design of systems to identify and sort good and bad teachers; others are designed to provide meaningful feedback and professional development to teachers in order to enhance their skills.

Overall, the purpose of educator effectiveness is to build the capacity for teachers to enhance their skills. The effective teachers have an effect on student's ability to have a higher level of conceptual understanding of a topic and have displayed the ability to think more abstractly than peers taught by less effective teachers. Quality teaching also has been identified as a key influence for positive learning outcomes for the diverse body of students in the classroom.

== How it is being used ==
As of 2013, US schools United States had very little cohesiveness in their teacher effectiveness requirements and implementations. In 2013, 25 states required that student achievement is a big or the biggest part of teacher evaluations. Twenty-seven states required teacher evaluations be based on a variety of student assessments and work samples and 44 states required classroom observations to be put into teacher evaluations. Overall, 11 states require a statewide teacher evaluation system; 10 states gave a statewide evaluation model that districts can either do or decide to do a similar model. To date only a small handful of states have adopted policies connecting the performance of students to their teachers and the colleges where the teachers were trained.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, K.M &amp; Jacobs, S. (2013).  State of the States 2013: Connect the Dots – Using evaluations of teacher effectiveness to inform policy and practice. Washington, D.C. The National Council on Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have national policies that decide what teacher evaluation systems that schools will have to follow. Some countries such as [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], Iceland, Norway and [[Sweden]] provide annual feedback on teaching practices. Other countries, such as Norway and Iceland leave the decision about how the teacher evaluations systems will be done to be determined at a local level. The quality of teaching in these countries is compared to the curriculum they follow and with the school instructional plan. Finland does not use any standardized testing as a measure of teacher effectiveness. Singapore is another country that does not use test scores but rather focuses on how teachers work together as a main part of their evaluation system. Singapore also focuses heavily on professional development around evaluation, coaching, mentoring and collaborating with other educators with an overall goal of getting a high quality teaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, T. (2013, March 25). How Do High-Performing Nations Evaluate Teachers? - NEA Today. Retrieved April 22, 2015, from http://neatoday.org/2013/03/25/how-do-high-performing-nations-evaluate-teachers/&lt;/ref&gt;

There is significant debate in the U.S. about how to reward teachers for performance as measured by educator effectiveness policies. Some schools rewards teachers by paying them more based upon their student's test scores, which is linked to the Race to the Top funding in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, J. (2004). Pay based on test scores? What educators need to know about linking teacher pay to student achievement. National Education Association.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other reward systems are being created based on the idea that improving a teacher's capacity to learn and improve upon their practice will have a direct impact on student achievement. These schools increase pay for teachers who have a  National Board Certification using [[National Board for Professional Teaching Standards]], advanced degrees, engaging in professional development, mentor new colleagues and paying more for these qualified teachers in hard to staff schools &lt;ref&gt;Flannery, M.E. &amp; Jehlen, A. (2008). Where is your pay plan heading? National Education Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection of teacher effectiveness and merit pay varies in different countries. In Finland and Canada, they do not to use merit-pay approaches but encourage conversations between the evaluator and teacher about student progress and success. In contrast, Chinese and Singaporean teachers, get financial bonuses and promotions for high performance. High-performing countries have a strong system of professional and school-level accountability but look at success on things such as school improvement goals, professional contributions, and indicators of student well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, V. (2010). Raising Teacher Quality Around the World. Educational Leadership, 68(4), 16-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods of evaluating teachers ===
Most educator effectiveness programs rely two kinds of data: observations of teaching practices and student outcomes data. There are four main sources of observational data collected by schools:
# Classroom observations happen when someone comes into a teacher's classroom to observe their teaching practice, typically done by a school administrator. The methods of commenting on teaching practice within classroom observations varies from district created to purchased evaluation forms.&lt;ref&gt;Goe, L. &amp; Croft, A. (2008). Methods of Evaluating Teacher Effectiveness. Research-to-Practice Brief. National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some schools use Self-Evaluation as a reflective tool for teachers to look at their current practice and change what they are doing to have a greater educational impact on students. Teachers often use a variety of tools to reflect and change their practice including self-monitoring, recording their own practice, and student's feedback through survey's and questionnaires.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, M. (2015). Self-Evaluation of Teaching. Ryerson University: The Learning and Teaching Office.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Teacher Portfolios are used to compile a variety of evidence of teacher practices for the purpose of showing development of teaching over time. It is often used in conjunction with self-reflection or peer-reviewing of teaching practices.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Teaching. (2015) Teaching Portfolios from http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/teaching-portfolios/&lt;/ref&gt;
# Peer-Review of Teaching is a method for teaching to discuss their practice with another teacher or group of teachers that gives feedback about teaching and learning. Often an evaluation of the teaching materials is done with the purpose of providing feedback to change teaching practices.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Teaching and Learning (2015). Peer Review of Teaching.  University of Minnesota from http://www1.umn.edu/ohr/teachlearn/resources/peer/&lt;/ref&gt;

The new part of educator effectiveness policies is the integration of outcome data into the evaluation process. The biggest component of the outcome data is growth of student learning as measured by standardized tests. Most educator effectiveness programs rely on some form of value-added measures to determine student growth. Value-added measure use longitudinal measures of student achievement to estimate the growth in student learning that can be attributed to individual teachers. If the students of a specific teacher demonstrate growth in learning better than predicated on standardized tests, the teacher is said to be effective; if the students score below the predicted scores, the teacher is said to be ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Goe, L. &amp; Croft, A. (2008). Methods of Evaluating Teacher Effectiveness. Research-to-Practice Brief. National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;  Parent and student surveys are another method of collecting data on teachers and their educational practices.&lt;ref&gt;Teaching and Learning Center (2015).  General Education Improvement. University of the Science from http://www.usciences.edu/teaching/tips/improvement.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Many argue that it is difficult to measure the effect that teachers have on student learning. Many teachers who are in the K-12 system, teach subjects that are not assessed on state mandated testing. In order to effectively implement an educator effectiveness system, some argue that states need to create different evaluation systems for the teachers who teach students in non-tested areas such as submitted portfolios of student work, lesson logs, video clips of them teaching and reflective commentaries on lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Darling-Hammond, . (2012). Creating a comprehensive system for evaluating and supporting effective teaching. Stanford, CA. Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue about the methodology as some districts are using value added models to determine the effectiveness to teachers. They state that it is an unreliable measurement tool because the makeup of classes differ greatly from teacher to teacher and from year to year. Some say that it ends up penalizing teachers who traditionally do not score well on standardized assessments such as students who receive free and reduce lunch and students with disabilities. They state that this may cause the highly effective teachers to work at schools with a low disability rate and a middle to high socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;Darling-Hammond, . (2012). Creating a comprehensive system for evaluating and supporting effective teaching. Stanford, CA. Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different ways to calculate the value-added effect of teachers that changes depending on how they define value-added and what they use to calculate it.  It typically does not account for the expectations put on students who go into a classroom reading below grade level and are expected to have a much higher growth rate than their peers.  Through many research studies, it has shown that the estimates of teacher effectiveness were not through the same throughout different years or content areas  such as reading and math and may be difficult to compare gains from tests from year to year when they don't measure the same content &lt;ref&gt;David, J.L ( 2010). What research says about using value-added measures to evaluate teachers. Educational Leadership (67)8&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have commented that evaluators in states with teacher evaluation systems do not have through enough training. Furthermore, these evaluators often do not have to prove themselves as effective teachers themselves. As of 2013, only 13 states require a certification for their evaluators that require evaluators are effective teachers. Furthermore, often the same evaluator is observing students every time. In order to have high quality teacher feedback, some would argue that multiple perspectives by highly effective educators would create the dialogue and feedback that would help teachers to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, K.M &amp; Jacobs, S. (2013).  State of the States 2013: Connect the Dots – Using evaluations of teacher effectiveness to inform policy and practice. Washington, D.C. The National Council on Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harlan Philip Hanson''' (February 18, 1925 – November 28, 1996), also known as "Harpo" Hanson, was an American educator and the Director of the [[Advanced Placement]] Program from 1965 to 1989.&lt;ref name =Saxon1/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mathews"/&gt;

==Harvard and WWII==
Born in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] in 1925, Hanson attended [[Harvard University]] in the early 1940s but his education at Harvard was interrupted in 1943 when he was drafted into service with the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]].  After [[World War II]], he returned to Harvard where he graduated ''[[Summa cum laude#Types|summa cum laude]]'' in 1948.&lt;ref name=Saxon1&gt;{{cite news |first=Wolfgang |last= Saxon|authorlink= |title=Harlan P.

&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period, Hanson was senior tutor at Kirkland House where he resided with his wife and [[Radcliffe College|Radcliffe]] graduate, Dorothea Reynolds.&lt;ref name=Cliffedweller1&gt;{{cite web |last=No writer attributed |title='Cliffedweller Dwelling at Kirkland House |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=266229 |date=29 Sep 1950 |website= |publisher=The Harvard Crimson |accessdate=24 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson received his Ph.D from Harvard in 1959. Prior to his graduation, he lived in [[Alsace]] and studied in Europe on a scholarship.&lt;ref name=Saxon1/&gt;

==Career==

In 1954, Harvard began to offer students credit and advanced standing for work completed in high school, including [[Advanced Placement|Advanced Placement (AP)]] courses,&lt;ref name=Wofford2&gt;{{cite web |last= Wofford|first=John G. |title=Hanson States Need for Uniformity In College Exemption Requirements |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=210469 |date=8 Dec 1955 |website= |publisher=The Harvard Crimson |accessdate=23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hanson, then a graduate student was given the task of implementing the new program.&lt;ref name=Gottlieb1&gt;*{{cite web |last= Gottlieb|first=Joshua D. |title=Advanced Standing Option Debuts |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=502738 |date=7 June 2004 |website= |publisher=The Harvard Crimson |accessdate=23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With two colleagues, Hanson, started the Office of Advanced Standing at Harvard University,&lt;ref name="Reichard1"/&gt; and as Director of Harvard's Office of Advanced Standing in 1955, Hanson worked to get all academic departments to standardize their award-granting requirements and to align their policies with the standards outlined by the [[College Board|College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB)]].&lt;ref name=Wofford2/&gt; Hanson was a member of the Committee of Examiners for the 1956–1957 [[AP German]] syllabus.&lt;ref name=Reichard1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reichard|first=Joseph R. |title=The College Board and Advanced Placement in German | journal=The German Quarterly | volume=29 | issue=4 | pages=220–224 |date=Nov 1956|doi=10.2307/401493|jstor=401493 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanson quit his position with Harvard's office of Advanced Standing in November 1957 to accept an assistant professorship at [[Williams College]]. By the time Hanson left Harvard, Advanced Standing existed in 174 colleges, and Harvard alone grew from 39 students admitted with advanced standing the first year, to 174 the year Hanson left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Bryce E. |title=Director of Advanced Standing Will Quit to Teach at Williams: Wilcox Successor |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=268096 |date=6 Nov 1957 |website= |publisher=The Harvard Crimson |accessdate=24 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained through the mid  1960s at Williams College.&lt;ref name=DiYanni1&gt;{{cite web|last=DiYanni|first=Robert |title=The History of AP Program |url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/21502.html |year=2008 |work= CollegeBoard.com|accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he translated ''History of the Weimar Republic'' and also translated and edited a German anthology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Library of Congress Online Catalog |url=http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;Search_Arg=harlan+hanson&amp;Search_Code=GKEY%5E*&amp;CNT=100&amp;hist=1&amp;type=quick |website= |publisher= |accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson also served as Chief Reader for the AP German examinations while at Williams College.&lt;ref name=Harlan1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanson|first=Harlan P. |title=The View from One Seat in the Boat | journal=The German Quarterly | volume=38 | issue=Membership Issue | pages=427–435 |date=Sep 1965|doi=10.2307/3806697|jstor=3806697 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Hanson succeeded Jack Arbolino as Director of the Advanced Placement program for the [[College Board]] and he remained at this position until 1989.&lt;ref name=DiYanni1/&gt;  For 23 of these years, Hanson "administered the program single-handedly, with some secretarial help and advice from the [[Educational Testing Service]],"&lt;ref name=Saxon1/&gt; yet under his leadership the AP program nonetheless "grew exponentially."&lt;ref name=DiYanni1/&gt; By the time he left the post of Director, the number of high schools offering AP courses had increased from 93&lt;ref name=Lohnes1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lohnes|first=Walter F.

In the mid-1960s, Hanson was one of the original council members of the International Schools Examinations Syndicate, which later became the [[International Baccalaureate|International Baccalaureate Organisation]]. He was instrumental in acquiring funding from the [[Ford Foundation]] for IB and securing university recognition from Ivy League schools such as Harvard and Princeton for the [[IB Diploma Programme]].&lt;ref name = "Mathews"&gt;{{cite book |title=Supertest |last= Mathews|first=Jay |authorlink= |first2=Ian |last2=Hill |year=2005 |publisher=Open Court |location= |isbn=978-0-8126-9577-9  |url= https://books.google.com/?id=D356tnugGYwC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=harpo+hanson|accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Peterson1&gt;{{cite book |title=Schools Across Frontiers |last= Peterson|first= A.D.C.|authorlink= |year=2003|edition= 2nd |publisher= Open Court|location= |isbn=978-0-8126-9505-2 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nTUjMNjNo3EC&amp;dq=peterson+international+baccalaureate&amp;printsec=frontcover |accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson was also a founding member of the board of International Baccalaureate North America (IBNA).&lt;ref name=Bagnall1&gt;*{{cite journal | last = Bagnall | first = Nigel Fraser | title = The International Baccalaureate in Australia and Canada: 1980–1993 | journal = Ph.D Dissertation |page=52 | date = Sep 1994 | url = http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/817/1/adt-NU20020624.142124whole02.pdf | accessdate = 24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Education in the U.S.}}
The '''Higher Education Act of 1965''' ('''HEA''') ({{USPL|89|329}}) was legislation signed into [[Law of the United States|United States law]] on November 8, 1965, as part of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] domestic agenda. Johnson chose [[Texas State University]] (then called "[[Texas State University#Name changes|Southwest Texas State College]]"), his [[alma mater]], as the signing site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/Johnson/lbjforkids/edu_whca370-text.shtm |title=Johnson signs legislation into law |publisher=LBJ Library and Museum |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714005531/http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/lbjforkids/edu_whca370-text.shtm |archivedate=July 14, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was intended "to strengthen the educational resources of our colleges and universities and to provide financial assistance for students in postsecondary and higher education". It increased federal money given to universities, created scholarships, gave low-interest loans for students, and established a National Teachers Corps.  The "financial assistance for students" is covered in [[Title IV]] of the HEA.

The Higher Education Act of 1965 was reauthorized in 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1986, 1992, 1998, and 2008. Current authorization for the programs in the Higher Education Act expired at the end of 2013, but has been extended through 2015 while Congress prepares changes and amendments. Before each re-authorization, Congress amends additional programs, changes the language and policies of existing programs, or makes other changes.

== 1965 Act ==
In January 1965, Representative [[Edith Green]] of Oregon introduced H. R. 3220 as a bill to "strengthen the educational resources of our colleges and universities and to provide financial assistance for students in postsecondary education."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://acsc.lib.udel.edu/exhibits/show/legislation/higher-education-act|title=Higher Education Act|last=|first=|date=|website=The Great Society Congress|publisher=Association of Centers for the Study of Congress|access-date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Senator [[Wayne Morse]] of Oregon introduced the Senate version of the bill, S. 600.  The bills sought to create an advisor council to review teacher training programs and to create a [[National Teachers Corps|National Teacher Corps]], which would recruit teachers to serve in low-income areas and train teachers through internships.  Other provisions of the bills included financial aid, scholarships, work study, and library enhancements.  Throughout 1965 numerous hearings were held by Special Subcommittee on Education and the Education Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare held numerous hearings.  Based on the recommendations of University administrators, educators and student aid officers, a new bill was introduced:  H. R. 9567.  It was passed by the House of Representatives on August 26 and the Senate passed the bill on September 2.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In signing the Higher Education Act of 1965 into law, President Johnson said that the act, along with the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965]] as "keystones of the great, fabulous 89th Congress" that would spread "the roots of change and reform" throughout the nation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Changes in 1998==
The [[Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs]] (GEAR UP) was first authorized under the Higher Education Amendments of 1998.  Also in the amendments of 1998 is the Aid Elimination Provision, which prevents students with drug charges from receiving federal aid for colleges and universities.  This is where question 31 on the [[FAFSA]] forms originates. The question asks whether the student has ever been convicted of a [[drug-related crime|drug crime]] while receiving federal financial aid. This statutory provision was upheld by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] in the face of a constitutional challenge by the [[ACLU]] in the case of ''Students for Sensible Drug Policy v. Spellings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source | case = ''Students for Sensible Drug Policy v.

The amendments also included a provision [HEA Section 487(a)(23)] requiring universities to make a good faith effort to encourage voter registration of students on their campuses. This requirement applies only to institutions located in states that require voter registration prior to election day and do not allow registration the day of the election. Institutions receive registration forms from the state after requesting them at least 120 days prior to the voter registration deadline, and must make them "widely available" to students.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rit.edu/fa/grms/compliance/statutes/Voter_Registration_Provision_in_Higher_Education_Amendments_of_1998.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in 2003==
&lt;!-- None of the links in these references work!--&gt;In 2003, much of the Higher Education Act was set to expire. As a result, a number of minority groups united to ask for certain changes. Calling themselves the Alliance for Equity in Higher Education, this group was made up of "the [[American Indian Higher Education Consortium]], the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, and the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, an advocacy group for [[historically black colleges and universities]], [and they] presented their joint recommendations for the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act."&lt;ref name="burd"&gt;Stephen Burd, "Institutions Serving Minority Students Propose Changes to Higher Education Act," ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' 49, no. 26 (2003), http://web.ebscohost.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance aimed to help minority students enter fields where they seemed to be underrepresented and to give incentives to minorities to enter these programs. These incentives included more lenience on loan collection and full government funding for minority education. The Alliance also called for the government to create funding for students in graduate programs of universities serving the minority population.&lt;ref name="burd"/&gt;

Even though the Alliance's request to change the Higher Education Act was heard, significant parts were denied. In 2003, the request for increasing the amount offered in a [[Pell Grant]], to better cover a student's expenses, was denied by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;"Capital briefs," ''Community College Week'' 16, no. 4 (2003): 3, http://web.ebscohost.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, other issues were corrected. There was a section passed, by the House, that did allow more funds to go to institutions, in order to keep them current; and a grace period for colleges asking for more loans was eliminated. So, if more funding were needed, minority institutions would not have to wait.&lt;ref&gt;Kristina Lane, "Bill Would Expand Higher Ed. Access for Minorities, Low-Income Students," ''Community College Week'' 16, no. 4 (2003): 3, http://web.ebscohost.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 reauthorization==
{{US student loans}}
With the changes proposed in 2003, the actual Higher Education Act was not reauthorized. Instead, many of its sections were renewed, with little radical change. Numerous extensions have followed, with the most recent extension lasting through August 15, 2008. The Senate passed an HEA reauthorization bill in July 2007, as did the House of Representatives in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Strong Step for Students: House Higher Education Bill Promotes Innovation and Student Success|publisher=[[Center for Law and Social Policy]]|url=http://www.clasp.org/admin/site/publications/files/0401.pdf|accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 14, 2008, the [[Higher Education Opportunity Act]] (Public Law 110-315) (HEOA) was enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congress Expands Basic Aid and Supports Innovation in Student Success, Basic Skills, and Workforce Partnerships|publisher=Center for Law and Social Policy|url=http://www.clasp.org/admin/site/publications/files/0430.pdf|accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reauthorized the amended version of the Higher Education Act of 1965.&lt;ref name="ED.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/hea08/index.html|title=Higher Education Opportunity Act - 2008|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act made major changes in student loan discharges for disabled people. Previously, to qualify for a discharge, a disabled person could have no income. This has been changed to a no "substantial gainful activity" test, which is the same standard used by the [[Social Security Administration]] in determining eligibility for [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] (SSDI). The changes took effect on July 1, 2010.

Also included in the 2008 revision of the HEOA were provisions requiring action by U.S. colleges and universities to combat illegal file sharing.&lt;ref name="Educause.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educause.edu/library/higher-education-opportunity-act-heoa|title=Higher Education Opportunity Act Anti-P2P provisions - 2008|publisher=Educause|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following significant lobbying by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) and [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), the additions to the HEOA of 2008 included requirements that all U.S. colleges and universities (1) release and annual disclosure to students regarding copyright laws and associated campus policies, (2) a written plan, submitted to the Department of Education, to combat copyright abuse using one or more technology-based deterrents, and (3) an offer to students of alternatives to illegal downloading.&lt;ref name="Law Offices of Zick Rubin Memo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/EPO0938.pdf|title=Dealing With the Higher Education Opportunity Act's New Copyright Protection Requirement|publisher=Law Offices of Zick Rubin|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant controversy surrounded the inclusion of anti-P2P legislation into HEOA of 2008, resulting in a letter from a number of leaders in higher education.&lt;ref name="Opposing Letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/CSD5226.pdf|title=Letter Opposing The Inclusion Of The Entertainment Industry Proposal On Illegal File Sharing In The HEA Sent By The Higher Education Members Of The Joint Committee|publisher=Educause|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the [[College Cost Reduction and Access Act]] (CCRA), a budget reconciliation bill signed into law in September 2007, made significant changes to federal financial aid programs included in HEA. In addition to increasing the maximum [[Pell Grant]] award and reducing interest rates on subsidized student loans, this bill capped loan repayment at 15% of an individual’s [[discretionary income]], raised the income protection allowance, enacted loan forgiveness for public servants in the Direct Loan program, set publicly funded student loans to fixed rates from variable rate loans, and took actions to address problematic practices in the lending industry. Most CCRA provisions took effect on October 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Association of University Women]]. ''Increasing Access to Higher Education''. January 2008. [http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/issue_advocacy/actionpages/upload/higherEdAct.pdf http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/issue_advocacy/actionpages/upload/higherEdAct.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The law for the first time also required post-secondary institutions be more transparent about costs and required the nearly 7,000 post-secondary institutions that receive federal financial aid funds (Title IV) to post net price calculators on their websites as well as security and copyright policies by October 29, 2011.

As defined in HEOA, the net price calculator's purpose is "to help current and prospective students, families, and other consumers estimate the individual net price of an institution of higher education for a student. The [net price] calculator shall be developed in a manner that enables current and prospective students, families, and consumers to determine an estimate of a current or prospective student’s individual net price at a particular institution."

The law defines "estimated net price" as the difference between an institution's average total Price of Attendance (the sum of tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, and other expenses including personal expenses and transportation for a first-time, full-time undergraduate students who receive aid) and the institution's median need- and merit-based grant aid awarded.

Elise Miller, program director for the [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System]] ([[IPEDS]]), stated the idea behind the requirement: "We just want to break down the myth of sticker price and get beyond it. This is to give students some indication that they will not [necessarily] be paying that full price."&lt;ref&gt;U''niversity Business: Preparing for the Net Price Calculator: Avoid Potential Pitfalls by Taking These Steps Today'' By Haley Chitty, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The template was developed based on the suggestions of the IPEDS' Technical Review Panel (TRP), which met on January 27–28, 2009, and included 58 individuals representing federal and state governments, post-secondary institutions from all sectors, association representatives, and template contractors. Mary Sapp, assistant vice president for planning and institutional research at the University of Miami, served as the panel's chair. She described the mandate's goal "to provide prospective and current undergraduate students with some insight into the difference between an institution's sticker price and the price they will end up paying".

The TRP faced the difficult challenge of creating one tool that could be used by a wide variety of institutions – from small, for-profit career schools to major research universities – while balancing simplicity for users.

To meet the requirement, post-secondary institutions may choose either a basic template developed by the U.S. Department of Education or an alternate net price calculator that offers at least the minimum elements required by law.

As part of its cost-transparency measures, HEOA of 2008 requires also on the College Navigator Web site a report giving the average institutional net price of attendance for first-time, full-time students who receive financial aid. This also forms the basis for transparency lists; a report on the College Navigator Web site the institutional net price of attendance for Title IV aid recipients by income categories; and for the [[U.S. Department of Education]] to develop a multi-year tuition and required-fees calculator for undergraduate programs for the College Navigator Web site.

The HEA has been criticized for establishing statutory pricing of federal student loans based on political considerations rather than pricing based on risk.&lt;ref name = Simkovic&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1941070 Risk-Based Student Loans] (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act also maintained the requirement that universities must make an effort to register students to vote. A 2013 Dear Colleague letter from the U.S. Department of Education stated that universities “must make the voter registration forms widely available to [their] students and distribute the forms individually to [their] degree or certificate program students who are physically in attendance at [their] institution. Distribution by regular or electronic mail is permitted.”&lt;ref&gt;https://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/GEN1317.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title VI==

During this reform period of 2008, Title VI of the HEA was reviewed.&lt;ref name="Hegji, Alexandra 2014"&gt;Hegji, Alexandra. 2014. The Higher Education Act (HEA): A Primer. Congressional Research Service.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Title VI provides federal funds to 129 international studies and foreign language centers at universities nationwide.&lt;ref name="brandeiscenter.com"&gt;Brandeis Center 2014- http://brandeiscenter.com/publications/research_opinion_full/joint_statement_on_the_misuse_of_federal_funds_under_title_vi&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of this act is to ensure and encourage diverse perspectives in order to enhance national security. As such, Title VI supplies grants for international language studies, business and international education programs as well as international policy.&lt;ref name="Hegji, Alexandra 2014"/&gt; Moreover, the recipients of these funds are required to engage in ‘public outreach’ for K-12, teachers, educators and the general public.&lt;ref name="brandeiscenter.com"/&gt;

Over the past decade concerns have been raised over these title VI funded programs. Conservative critics have emphasized that many of the international programs funded engage in biased, anti-American and anti-Israel rhetoric, with no offers of counterbalance.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Kurtz 2007- the national review -taking sides on title VI- http://www.nationalreview.com/article/223078/taking-sides-title-vi-stanley-kurtz&lt;/ref&gt;

Certainly, a 2006 review mandated by Congress found that the programs were not reaching their goals. Seeking to rectify this, Congress expressed the need for greater oversight by the Department of Education, as well as an investigation to ensure these programs reflected "diverse perspectives".&lt;ref&gt;U.S Department of Education- http://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/hea08/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these reforms, the issues within Title VI have been deemed endemic. Writing in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', [[Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights under Law|Louis D. Brandeis Center]] Founder [[Kenneth L. Marcus]] argued that "title VI doesn’t need to be tweaked-it needs to be overhauled".&lt;ref name="The Hill"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/218110-title-vi-and-campus-bias | title=Title VI and campus bias | work=The Hill | date=September 19, 2014 | accessdate=February 17, 2017 | author=[[Marcus, Kenneth L.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration followed a joint statement released by 10 groups on September 17, 2014, which the Brandeis Center coordinated.

This joint statement expressed the deep concerns over the misuse of tax payer money, arguing that "these outreach programs, which have no congressional oversight, often disseminate anti-American and anti-Israel falsehoods."&lt;ref name="chronicle.com"&gt;Peter Schmidt, 2014, [http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/supporters-of-israel-say-programs-in-middle-east-studies-misuse-u-s-funds/86245 Supporters of Israel Say Programs in Middle East Studies Misuse U.S. Funds]
&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the groups voiced the opinion that " too often exclude scholars with diverse perspectives while stifling discourse on critical issues. The biased learning environment that results suppresses the academic freedom of students and faculty with different views. At some institutions, students are afraid to disagree with their professors."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://brandeiscenter.com/images/uploads/news/jointstatement.pdf Joint Statement on the Misuse of Federal Funds Under Title VI, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; 
This statement was accompanied by a white paper published by the Brandeis Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://brandeiscenter.com/images/uploads/practices/antisemitism_whitepaper.pdf | title=The Morass of Middle East Studies: Title VI of the Higher Education Act and Federally Funded Area Studies (Rev. Ed.) | publisher=Louis D. Brandeis Center | date=November 2014 | accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a report by the [[AMCHA Initiative]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amchainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CNES-Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; underscoring the negative effects this biased perspective produces on campuses, UCLA specifically.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;Inside Higher ED- Pro-Israel Groups Question Federal Funds for Middle East Centers https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/09/18/pro-israel-groups-question-federal-funds-middle-east-centers&lt;/ref&gt; The AMCHA study found that "any time UCLA’s center sponsored or co-sponsored an event mentioning Israel from Fall 2010 to Spring 2013, 93% of the time the mention was negative and critical – as if Israel is a blight on the planet."&lt;ref name="The Hill"/&gt;

UCLA's media relations office issued a statement saying that the university "remains dedicated to complying with all federal laws and respecting the free and open exchange of ideas representing diverse viewpoints." &lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

In light of such issues, the joint statement calls for changes in the Title VI program which would 1) "[r]equire recipients of Title VI funds to establish grievance procedures to address complaints that programs are not reflecting diverse perspectives and a wide range of views" and 2) "[r]equire the [[U.S. Department of Education]] to establish a formal complaint-resolution process similar to that in use to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." &lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

Responding to this statement Amy W. Newhall, executive director of the [[Middle East Studies Association of North America]] (MESA), asserted that MESA "resolutely opposes all forms of hate speech and discrimination, including anti-Semitism," but "is concerned that some of the reports issued by partisan political groups based outside academia may actually weaken efforts to combat anti-Semitism by portraying all criticism of Israeli policies as a form of anti-Semitism or as ‘anti-Israel.’" &lt;ref name="chronicle.com"/&gt;

However, as Kenneth L. Marcus asserts in a letter to the editor of ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' the co-signatories of the joint statement " urge the opposite: accountability systems to ensure that these programs offer the diversity of perspectives that existing law requires."&lt;ref&gt;http://chronicle.com/blogs/letters/our-goal-is-not-to-shut-down-open-discussion/&lt;/ref&gt;
As said statement concludes: "Arguably, Title VI programs no longer serve a legitimate purpose...  In 2011, Congress reduced Title VI funding nationwide by 40 percent, from $34 million to $18 million.  Unless effective and necessary reforms can be enacted, Congress may have to consider reducing or eliminating Title VI funding from Middle East studies centers." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Extension of HEA==
After being reauthorized in 2008, the Higher Education Act was set to expire in 2013, but was re-extended to allow Congress time to work on the next reauthorization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acenet.edu/advocacy/Pages/Higher-Education-Act.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, House Republicans announced that they had finalized an overhaul of the act, authored primarily by Representative Virginia Foxx of (R - N.C.), the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. The new bill is called the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success and Prosperity Through Education Reform (PROSPER) Act. The act aims to simplify the federal financial aid process and expand federal work study programs. It would also repeal two Obama-era programs -  “gainful employment” and “borrower defense” - aimed at preventing financial exploitation of undergraduates, as well as bar their readoption.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/us/politics/house-republican-higher-education-bill-obama.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Committee spokesman Michael Woeste, “the reforms within the PROSPER Act are necessary to provide students with a high-quality education, and fix a system that has not been serving their needs.”&lt;ref&gt; https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/02/07/cbo-estimates-show-house-higher-ed-bill-could-hit-student-loan-borrowers-hard/?utm_term=.7595e5ca5cba &lt;/ref&gt;

Some concerns have been raised by advocacy groups about how the PROSPER Act would affect LGBTQ students. According to the Human Rights Campaign, “The PROSPER Act contains several provisions that would allow for the use of religion to justify otherwise prohibited discrimination that could negatively impact LGBTQ students.”&lt;ref&gt;http://democrats-edworkforce.house.gov/media/press-releases/the-prosper-act-what-people-are-really-saying-continued_&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the PROSPER Act includes a weaker version of the provision requiring universities to increase student voter registration, a requirement present in the Higher Education Act since 1998. Critics worry that this change will lead to lower youth turnout in elections, as voter turnout is already historically lowest among young voters.

'''Kahoot!''' is a [[Game based learning|game-based learning]] platform, used as [[educational technology]] in schools and other educational institutions. Its learning games, "Kahoots", are multiple-choice quizzes that allow user generation and can be accessed via a [[web browser]].

Kahoot! can be used to review students' knowledge, for [[formative assessment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cit.duke.edu/blog/2015/07/kahoot-as-formative-assessment/|title=Kahoot! as Formative Assessment - Center for Instructional Technology|date=2015-07-02|work=Center for Instructional Technology|access-date=2017-08-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a break from traditional classroom activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tomorrowslearners.com/why-kahoot-is-one-of-my-favourite-classroom-tools/|title=Why Kahoot is one of my favourite classroom tools — Tomorrow's Learners|access-date=2017-08-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahoot! also includes [[trivia]] quizzes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acpl.lib.in.us/home/explore/teens/notes-from-the-underground/teens/2017/05/22/kahoot-trivia|title=Kahoot Trivia|website=www.acpl.lib.in.us|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== History ==
Kahoot was founded by Johan Brand, Jamie Brooker and Morten Versvik in a joint project with the Norwegian University of Technology and Science, they teamed up with Professor Alf Inge Wang, and were later joined by Norwegian entrepreneur Åsmund Furuseth.[https://kahoot.com/company/]
== Overview ==
[[File:Kahoot Oslo.jpg|thumb|left|A game of Kahoot! being played in a lecture-hall at the [[University of Oslo]].]]

Kahoot was designed for [[Social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]], with learners gathered around a common screen such as an [[interactive whiteboard]], projector or a computer monitor. The site can also be used through [[Videotelephony|screen-sharing]] tools such as [[Skype]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://education.microsoft.com/skypekahoot|title=Skype in the Classroom &amp; Kahoot - Microsoft in Education|website=education.microsoft.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Google Hangouts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kahoot.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/827223-can-i-play-kahoot-with-others-remotely|title=Can I play Kahoot! with others remotely?|last=|first=|date=|website=Kahoot! Support|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[game design]] is such that the players are required to frequently look up from their devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inclusivedesign.no/ict/kahoot-article172-261.html|title=Kahoot! - Inclusive Design|last=www.corepublish.no|first=CorePublish -|website=www.inclusivedesign.no|language=en|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gameplay is simple; all players connect using a generated game [[Personal identification number|PIN]] shown on the common screen, and use a device to answer questions created by a teacher, business leader, or other person. These questions can be changed to award points. Points then show up on the leaderboard after each question. 

Kahoot can be played through different [[web browser]]s and mobile devices through its web interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kahoot.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/498970-is-my-browser-device-suitable-to-host-or-play-a-ka|title=Is my browser/device suitable to host or play a Kahoot? – Kahoot!

=== Kahoot Jumble ===
Kahoot added a new feature in 2016, called Jumble. Users create quizzes with exactly four options (it is always exactly four) in the correct order. Kahoot automatically randomizes the answers during the game. Users have to move the triangle, diamond, circle and square up and into the right order. Then users have to press a blue, circular button with a white text that says "K!" under the rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l17T4T5wGKQ&lt;/ref&gt; If a user suspects that the answers are in the wrong order, the rectangles will have to be moved down back to its original position before it can be moved back up to the correct position again.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The '''Keller Plan''', also called the '''Personalized System of Instruction''' (PSI), was developed by [[Fred S. Keller]] with J. Gilmour Sherman, Carolina Bori, and Rodolpho Azzi in the middle 1960s as an innovative method of instruction for the then-new [[University of Brasília]]&lt;ref&gt;Keller, F. S. (1967). Engineering personalized instruction in the classroom. Revista Interamericana de Psicologia/Interamerican Journal of Psychology, 1(3).&lt;/ref&gt;. PSI was conceived of as an application of [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]]'s theories of learning, grounded in [[operant conditioning]] strategies of [[behaviorism]].

==Principles==
Keller argued that effective instruction should incorporate five principles, the essential elements of the Keller Plan:&lt;ref&gt;Keller, F. S. (1968). Goodbye teacher… Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis 1, 79-89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=physicspsikeller&lt;/ref&gt;

* Written materials—The primary presentation of new content should be through written texts.  Given the forms of media available at the time when the Keller Plan was developed (e.g., lectures, movies, audio records, television, radio, paper-based text, etc.), paper-based texts gave students the greatest freedom; books and texts are portable, can be read at one's own pace, can be started and stopped at any time, can be easily reviewed, and can be marked by the reader.  As an application of [[behaviorism]], the Keller Plan was meant to maximize the number of operant behaviors that could be reinforced; this could best be done with written materials rather than have the learner be a passive observer of other media.  [[Digital media]] available today could provide the same kinds of learner control and presumably could be incorporated in a contemporary implementation of PSI.
* Units of content—Subject matter material should be broken down into separable, meaningful units. These units could have various kinds of relationships; for example, one could provide prerequisites for understanding a second, or the second could provide deeper elaboration of a proceeding unit.  In any case, specific learning objectives should be definable for each discrete unit of content.
* Self-paced instruction—Students should be allowed to advance through the course material at their own pace.  While an instructor might specify the order in which learning units are completed, the learners should decide when and at what rate they learn.  Learners could move through a course as quickly or slowly as they choose.
* Unit mastery—Students must satisfy a mastery requirement in one unit before proceeding to the next.  Typically, a unit in PSI would have more than one equivalent form of assessment—for example, three quizzes of equal difficulty or three primary sources or data sets to be analyzed.  Students must demonstrate mastery of a unit's objectives to a certain level of quality.  If the student does not reach the threshold, they are redirected to unit materials (or supplements if provided) and then take an equivalent form of the unit assessment.  From the point of view of behaviorism, demonstrating mastery and being allowed to continue to a subsequent unit was presumed to be reinforcing
* Proctors—Human [[proctor#Education|proctors]] are an important part of the Keller Plan.  The proctors could be "external" to the course (adults or peers brought to the course from external sources) or "internal" (advanced students in the course who are doing well, have completed all units to date, and have good interpersonal skills).  Proctors were the arbiters of unit mastery; they would "certify" mastery, discuss areas of weakness, and direct students to the next units.  Behaviorists were always concerned about bringing conditioned behaviors under the control of "natural" reinforcers; interactions with the proctors were presumed to provide natural social reinforcers that encouraged learning behaviors and perseverance in the course.

While traditional teaching is "same pace, different learning", a key distinguishing factor of PSI is that it instead advocates "different pace, same learning". A traditional course might have all students follow the same weekly lectures, exercises, etc., and then sit an end-of-course exam at the same date — but possibly with huge variation in learning outcomes (e.g., 95% achievement for a strong student, but just 55% for a weak one). In a course run according to PSI, all students must pass a high threshold of achievement on each module within the course (for instance 90%). The difference between weak and strong students would then be that the stronger ones be able to finish the course quicker, while the weaker ones would need more time.&lt;ref name = buskist91&gt;Buskist, W., Cush, D., &amp; DeGrandpre, R. J. (1991). The life and times of PSI. Journal of Behavioral Education, 1(2), 215-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
The Keller Plan has mainly been used in [[higher education]], particularly as a more personalized form of instruction in large classes, but there is nothing inherent in Keller's formulation to restrict its application to particular grade levels, content, or types of courses&lt;ref name=buskist91 /&gt;; for instance the papers &lt;ref&gt;Klishis, M. J., Hursh, D. C., &amp; Klishis, L. A. (1980). Individualized spelling: An application and evaluation of PSI in the elementary school. Journal of Personalized Instruction, 4, 148-156.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;Callahan, C., &amp; Smith, R. M. (1990). Keller's personalized system of instruction in a junior high gifted program. Roeper Review, 13(1), 39-44.&lt;/ref&gt; report on usage in elementary school and junior high school, respectively. There has been a good deal of research on the effectiveness of PSI which indicated that it had robust, significantly positive effects on learning when compared to more traditional lecture-based formats.&lt;ref&gt;Kulik, J. A., Kulik, C. L. C., &amp; Cohen, P. A. (1979). A meta-analysis of outcome studies of Keller's personalized system of instruction. American Psychologist, 34(4), 307.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ironsmith, M., &amp; Eppler, M. A. (2007). Faculty forum: Mastery learning benefits low-aptitude students. Teaching of Psychology, 34(1), 28-31.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some cases, self-pacing was also seen to have problems with student withdrawal and procrastination &lt;ref&gt;Reiser, R. A., &amp; Sullivan, H. J. (1977). Effects of self-pacing and instructor-pacing in a PSI course. The Journal of Educational Research, 71(1), 8-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Semb, G., Glick, D. M., &amp; Spencer, R. E. (1979). Student withdrawals and delayed work patterns in self-paced psychology courses. Teaching of psychology, 6(1), 23-25.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In spite of much documented success, PSI has not taken off massively. Education is still dominated by "same pace, different learning" approaches, and the number of new research publications about PSI gradually declined after its heyday in the 70's&lt;ref name=buskist91 /&gt;. Several possible reasons are given for this, not the least that PSI represented a too radical deviation from established teaching practices and educational management routines &lt;ref name=buskist91 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sherman92&gt;Sherman, J. G. (1992). Reflections on PSI: Good news and bad. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 25(1), 59-64.&lt;/ref&gt;. Other explanations include conflicts within the PSI movement&lt;ref name=sherman92 /&gt; and the challenge that PSI demands more teaching effort&lt;ref&gt;Grant, L. K., &amp; Spencer, R. E. (2003). The personalized system of instruction: Review and applications to distance education. The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 4(2).&lt;/ref&gt;. However, it has been speculated that PSI might see a revival with modern educational technology, as information technology could gradually alleviate teacher burdens related to frequent testing and feedback, as well as mitigate the increased administrative complexity that courses with student self-pacing have over those with instructor-set pace.&lt;ref&gt;Eyre, H. L. (2007). Keller's Personalized System of Instruction: Was it a Fleeting Fancy or is there a Revival on the Horizon?. The Behavior Analyst Today, 8(3), 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12332">'''''Last in First Out''''' (LIFO) (or otherwise known as "Last One Hired is the First One Fired" is a policy often used by school districts and other employers to prioritize [[layoff]]s by [[seniority]].  Under LIFO layoff rules, junior teachers and other employees lose their jobs before senior ones.  Laying off junior employees first is not exclusive to the education sector or to the United States, but is perhaps most controversial there.  LIFO's proponents claim that it protects teachers with [[tenure]] and gives them job stability, and that it is an easily administered way of accomplishing layoffs following a budget cut.  LIFO's critics respond that it is bad for students. They prefer that the best teachers remain regardless of how long they have been teaching.

LIFO and tenure were originally intended to provide college [[professor|professors]] with [[academic freedom]] and ensure that they could research topics of their own choosing. In the K-12 sector, tenure was introduced to lower high teacher turnover rates. In 1932, over 20% of teachers were dismissed due to personal disagreements and difference of opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Butsch, R. (1937). Tenure of teachers. Teacher Personnel, 7(3), 292-295.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2010, LIFO was criticized on grounds that "seniority based layoffs result in promising, inexperienced teachers losing their positions, while their less effective, but more senior, peers continue to teach."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, D. J., Lankford, H., Loeb, S., &amp; Wyckoff, J. H. (2010). Teacher layoffs: An empirical illustration of seniority vs. measures of effectiveness. brief 12.National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/864940729&lt;/ref&gt; As of early 2014, 2 states provided that seniority could not be considered when deciding which teachers to layoff, 18 states and the District of Columbia left the layoff criteria to school district discretion, 20 states provided that seniority could be considered among other factors, and 10 states provided that seniority was the sole factor, or one that had to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara v. California - Judgment | court = Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles |date = August 27, 2014 |pinpoint = page 14, lines 10-14 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of seniority-prioritized layoffs ==

LIFO has a more severe impact in poor or high minority schools, since those schools tend to have newer and less experienced teachers. In schools where 34% or less of the students receive [[Reduced price meal|Free and Reduced meals]], more than 82% of teachers have 4 or more years of experience. However, in schools where more than 75% of the student body receives Free and Reduced meals,  only 77% of the teachers have more than 4 years of experience.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey, "Public School Teacher, BIE School Teacher, and Private School Teacher Data Files," 2007-2008&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in California, it was seen that in schools in the lowest quartile of minority students, only 8 of every 100 teachers had two or less years of teaching whereas in schools with the highest [[quartile]] of minority students, 13 of every 100 teachers had two or less years of teaching, meaning that under LIFO-based layoffs, schools with larger minority populations would lose 60% more teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Sepe, Cristina, and Marguerite Roza. The Disproportionate Impact of Seniority Based Layoffs on Poor, Minority Students. Rep. Seattle: Center on Reinventing Public Education, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, teachers in high need areas, such as secondary math and special education, are often less experienced due to the difficulty of recruiting these positions, and districts who adhere strictly to seniority based systems for layoffs face the added burden of recruiting teachers in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, Dan and Theobold, Roddy (2010). "Assessing the Determinants and Implications of Teacher Layoffs." Center for Education Data &amp; Research, University of Washington-Bothell.&lt;/ref&gt; In Los Angeles, it was noted that of the hundreds of promising new teachers cut in from the district in 2010 due to LIFO, 190 were in the top fifth overall of teachers in raising math and reading scores.&lt;ref&gt;Felch, Jason; Song, Jason; and Smith, Doug (2010). "When layoffs come to L.A. schools, performance doesn't count." Los Angeles Times, December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that the effectiveness of teachers does not change after the first few years in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hanushek]] and Steven G. Rivkin, "The Distribution of Teacher Quality and Implications for Policy." Annual Review of Economics 4 (2012): 7.1-7.27.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the implications of using LIFO rules for layoffs instead of basing layoffs on classroom effectiveness appear huge.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, Dan and Theobold, Roddy (2010). "Assessing the Determinants and Implications of Teacher Layoffs." Center for Education Data &amp; Research, University of Washington-Bothell; Steven Glazerman, Susanna Loeb, Dan Goldhaber, Douglas Staiger, Stephen Raudenbush, and Grover Whitehurst, ''Evaluating Teachers: The Important Role of Value-Added'' (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 2010); Donald Boyd, Hamilton Lankford, Susanna Loeb, and James Wyckoff, "Teacher Layoffs: An Empirical Illustration of Seniority versus Measures of Effectiveness." ''Education Finance and Policy'' 6, no. 3 (Summer 2011): 439-454.&lt;/ref&gt;{{elucidate|date=November 2015}}  With LIFO, more teachers must be dismissed to meet budgetary targets than with effectiveness-based layoffs because the youngest teachers are the least paid, but the teachers dismissed under the LIFO policy are only slightly below average in effectiveness.  An effectiveness-based policy on the other hand leads to dramatic improvements in average teacher quality, and these improvements have lasting effects on students throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hanushek]], "Valuing teachers: How much is a good teacher worth?" ''Education Next'' 11, no. 3 (Summer 2011); Raj Chetty, John N. Friedman, and Jonah E. Rockoff, "The Long-Term Impacts of Teachers: Teacher Value-Added and Student Outcomes in Adulthood," WP17699 (Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic Research, December 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==LIFO and value-added economic modeling==
{{POV-section|date=July 2017}}
In many states, tenure is given to teachers after 3 years, without much indication of job performance. A [[Value-added modeling|value added model]] (VAM) could be used in tenure decisions for teachers in order to estimate teacher quality. A VAM would predict how well a teacher would do based on his or her previous experience teaching. Data shows that the VAM based on standardized test scores, is a better indicator of teacher performance than any observable attributes. 
&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, Dan, &amp; Hansen, M. (2010). Using performance on the job to inform teacher tenure decisions. The American Economic Review, 100(2), 250-250-255. {{doi|10.1257/aer.100.2.250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In using a VAM to evaluate teachers for a tenure decision, school districts can ensure that the teachers they retain (and the teachers who in turn become the most senior) are effective educators, thereby eliminating some of the discrepancy between LIFO and performance-based layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, D. (2003). Evaluating value-added models for teacher accountability. Santa Monica: Rand Publishing.Retrieved from https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2004/RAND_MG158.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy and the overhaul of LIFO ==

Since less experienced teachers typically have lower salaries, it is estimated that if districts in the [[United States]] cut 5% of their budget through seniority based layoffs, approximately 79,000 more teachers would lose their jobs versus seniority neutral layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;The Case Against Quality Blind Teacher Layoffs. Publication. The New Teacher Project, Feb. 2011. Web. 10 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://tntp.org/files/TNTP_Case_Against_Quality_Blind_Layoffs_Feb2011.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of New York State parents regarding teacher quality versus seniority,  voters said they did not care how long a teacher had taught so long as the teacher was effective and produced good results.&lt;ref&gt;New York voters oppose "last-in, first-out" for teacher layoffs - NYPOST.com. (n.d.). . Retrieved April 24, 2011, from http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/voters_ax_the_worst_X4kKxTM7P75e9enFpDuTkI&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with Arizona in 2009, certain states and districts have been passing laws which prohibit seniority from being the deciding factor in layoff decisions. Maine, Louisiana, and District of Columbia use multiple criteria in determining layoffs, and numerous other states are trending towards performance based over seniority based layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;Teacher Layoffs: Rethinking "Last-Hired, First Fired" Policies. Rep. National Council on Teacher Quality, Feb. 2010. Web. 10 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.nctq.org/p/docs/nctq_dc_layoffs.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michelle Rhee]], the former Chancellor of Washington, D.C. public schools, opposes the Last in First Out policy, instead suggesting performance based evaluation to determine layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;End "last in, first out" teacher layoffs - CNN.com. (n.d.). . Retrieved May 2, 2011, from http://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/02/23/rhee.layoff.policy/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  As Chancellor, she introduced the [http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/impact IMPACT] evaluation for teachers, which measured teacher performance and was the primary factor for layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;The Case Against Quality Blind Teacher Layoffs. Publication. The New Teacher Project, Feb. 2011. Web. 10 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://tntp.org/files/TNTP_Case_Against_Quality_Blind_Layoffs_Feb2011.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  She is the CEO of  [http://www.studentsfirst.org Students First], a [[grassroots]] movement "designed to mobilize parents, teacher, students, and administrators, and citizens" to demand a better American education system.&lt;ref&gt;"About Students First." Studentsfirst.org. Web. 10 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.studentsfirst.org/pages/about-students-first&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding in 2010, Studentsfirst has been behind legislation across the country which promotes alternative [[teacher quality assessment]] methods through its "Save Great Teachers" Campaign. Victories from this campaign have been seen in Florida, Utah, Michigan, Nevada and Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;"Save Great Teachers." Save Great Teachers- Studentsfirst.org. Web. 10 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.studentsfirst.org/lifo&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 court case of ''[[Vergara v. California]]'' struck down California's LIFO layoff rules as having a disproportionately negative impact on poor and minority public school students, thus violating the California Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara v. California - Judgment | court = Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles |date = August 27, 2014 |pinpoint = page 3, lines 19-27 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Vergara'' trial judge noted that teacher layoffs prioritized solely by seniority prevented senior and ineffective teachers from being laid off before junior but effective teachers.  In this situation, "[n]o matter how gifted the junior teacher, and no matter how grossly ineffective the senior teacher, the junior gifted one . . . is separated from [the students] and a senior grossly ineffective one . . . is left in place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 13, lines 19-23 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge concluded that "[t]he logic of [this scheme] is unfathomable and therefore constitutionally unsupportable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 14, lines 4-5 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leadership for Learning''' ('''LfL''') is a framework and set of principles that arose from the ''Carpe Vitam'' project{{fact|date=August 2015}} in which practitioners and researchers worked together to develop the practice of [[leadership]] for [[learning]].  
Leadership for Learning: the Cambridge Network, based in the [[University of Cambridge Faculty of Education]], draws together practitioners, schools and organisations concerned with these ideas.  The LfL framework and principles have been used in a wide variety of contexts to frame discussions and to inform the evaluation of practice.

==History==
The Leadership for Learning Project (known as Carpe Vitam after its [[Sweden|Swedish]] commissioning body) was a research and development project focusing on the process by which schools made, and then grew, the connections between learning and leadership. It was funded for three years (2002–2005) by the [[Wallenberg Foundation]] in Sweden, with further financial support from participating countries. The project was directed from the [[University of Cambridge]] in collaboration with eight different groups of university researchers and their nominated schools in eight cities: [[Athens]], [[Brisbane]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Innsbruck]], [[London]], [[Oslo]], [[Seattle]], and [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] ([[New Jersey]]).
Seven countries, eight higher education institutions and 24 schools participated in exploring the connections between leadership and learning through conferences, workshops, school visits and inter-country exchanges.

The researchers did not start from a blank slate or from a neutral stance but from a set of democratic values about leadership and learning. How those values could be translated into practical strategies at school and classroom level, however, was something they planned to discover through experimentation, reflection and collective debate over the life of the project.
Part way through that process they began to identify ‘principles for practice’ that would help to clarify and focus attention on the transformations in learning and leadership that were beginning to take place. These five principles were refined and developed throughout the project.

==Leadership for Learning principles for practice==
The most significant outcome of the project was a set of principles that could be used by researchers, by school leaders, by teachers and students to make the connections between leadership and learning through reflecting on, or researching, their own practice. Five statements came to represent these principles.

Leadership for Learning practice involves:
  
* Maintaining a focus on learning as an activity 
* Creating conditions favourable to learning as an activity
* Creating a dialogue about Leadership for Learning
* The sharing of leadership
* A shared sense of accountability

These five principles are dynamically interrelated, with dialogue forming the connections, a focus on learning and shared leadership mediated by conditions for learning, and all framed by the fifth principle of accountability. ‘A focus on learning’ is quite deliberately placed first because it can be considered as the prime principle, reflecting a commitment to making learning the number one priority – the core of Leadership for Learning. 
Each headline principle is elaborated through sub-principles that amplify and illustrate.

==The Cambridge Network==
LfL is under the leadership of Professor John MacBeath and is coordinated by a management team that includes David Frost, Sue Swaffield, John Bangs, Megan Crawford, Panayiotis Antoniou, Ruth Sapsed and Caroline Jestaz. It is part of the Leadership for Learning academic group.

The network exists to:
* Improve leadership practices for the benefit of all learners.
* Explore leadership for learning in educational contexts nationally and internationally.
* Support practitioners with advice based on research.
* Help young people to play an active role in improving learning at their school.
* Undertake and facilitate research on leadership for learning.
* Contribute to a leadership for learning knowledge base.
* Influence educational policy.

with the belief that:
* Learning and leadership are a shared, as much as an individual enterprise.
* Leadership should be 'distributed' and exercised at every level.
* Collaborative modes of working strengthen both teams and individuals.
* An independent, critical perspective, informed by research is vital.
* The status quo and received wisdom should be persistently questioned.

'''The Learning and Skills Act 2000''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It made changes in the funding and administration of [[further education]], and of work-based learning (or [[apprenticeship]]s) for young people, within [[England and Wales]]. 

The main changes were:
* Establishment of the [[Learning and Skills Council]] (LSC) to secure the provision of education and training for young people and adults, in England, and to encourage employers and individuals to participate, and the LSC's funding powers.
* Provisions for the appointment of [[governor]]s in the further education sector.
* Other duties and powers of the LSC, including [[equal opportunities]] and the needs of people with [[learning disabilities|learning difficulties]], powers to provide information, advice and guidance services and a duty to publish its strategy and annual plans.
* Establishment of local LSCs, including planning and consultation arrangements and the power of the [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Secretary of State]] to make directions to local education authorities in respect of adult and community learning provision.
* Creation of the LSC’s Young People’s and Adult Learning Committees. 
* Creation of [[Academy (English school)|academies]] (originally known as "city academies"), publicly funded schools operating outside of local government control and with a significant degree of autonomy.
* Powers for the Secretary of State to give directions to the LSC, to pay it its annual grant-in-aid and require the LSC to make an annual report.
* Similar arrangements for Wales.

The Act also established arrangements for Inspections of further education in England and Wales, and abolished the [[Further Education Funding Council for England]].

NOTE TO EDITORS ABOUT THIS LIST:
Before adding to or re-ordering this list, please make sure you are
using the proper, credible information:

1) Please report the standardized enrollment figures from the Common
Data Set (search the school's website for "Common Data Set" and you 
should find it). The reason to use the CDS is that it makes sure that
all schools calculate enrollment in exactly the same way, so it is the
only good way to compare enrollment counts between schools.

2) This page is for individual campuses only. There is a separate article
for universities, and a separate article for undergraduate enrollment.
Please make sure that the enrollment figures you use are only for a single
campus of a public four-year university.

3) Do not vandalize the list or otherwise edit the information in a manner
which cannot be verified by reputable sources.

This '''list of largest United States public university campuses by enrollment''' includes only individual four-year campuses, not four-year [[university|universities]].  Universities can have multiple campuses with a single administration.

'''What this list includes:'''
*A single Individual campus with a single physical location of a four-year [[public university]] within the [[United States]]
*Enrollment is the sum of the headcount of undergraduate and graduate students
*Enrollment is counted by the 21st-day headcount, as provided to the [[United States Department of Education]] under the [[Common Data Set]] program.
*Campuses that have small secondary physical locations that are not reported separately (for extended education, outreach, etc.) are indicated with a footnote.

'''What this list does not include:'''
*[[University system]]s, or universities that have multiple physical campuses.

Not all enrollment counts are directly comparable. See notes. For other lists that measure university enrollment, see the [[#See also|see also]] section below.

The '''Microsoft Student Partners''' is a worldwide recognizable program to sponsor students majoring in disciplines related to [[technology]]. The MSP program enhances students' [[employability]] by offering training in skills not usually taught in [[academia]], including knowledge of [[List of Microsoft products|Microsoft technologies]].

The program is available in most countries, and all students in [[college]] and [[university]] level are eligible to apply. If accepted, Student Partners are assumed to further share the knowledge among the academic community by, for example, arranging courses, giving presentations and initiating projects.

==History==
The MSP Program was initiated in 2001, and operated in 15 countries for five years. In late 2006, the program was expanded to 50 countries worldwide,&lt;ref name="GlobalInitiativePressRel"/&gt; and as of July 2010, there are more than 2800 members worldwide across 101 countries and regions.&lt;ref name="OfficialSite"/&gt;

{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}

==Purpose==
The MSP program is an educational and promotional program to sponsor [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] students majoring in disciplines related to technology, typically [[computer science]], [[computer information systems]], and [[information technology]]. MSP program aims to enhance students' employability and increase students' awareness of Microsoft technologies. Student Partners are offered training especially in product-specific [[skill]]s not typically taught in academia.

The program aims to increase awareness of Microsoft products, programs and initiatives. Consequently, the program helps expanding the [[End-user (computer science)|user base]] of Microsoft products, and results in better availability of properly educated [[workforce]] in those technologies.

==Membership==
The MSP program is active around the world to college and university level students{{#tag:ref|Attending at [[high school]] level, or earlier, may also be possible, depending on the individual. Youngest MSP are [[Praneet Sah]] and [[Babar Iqbal]], both being 13 years old. The youngest [[Microsoft Certified Professional]], M. Lavinashree, is 9 years old.&lt;ref name="YoungestMCP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2008/12/youngest-microsoft-certified-professional-just-9-years-old.ars|title=Youngest Microsoft Certified Professional just 9 years old | accessdate = 2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}. Microsoft chooses one skilled student from each institution at a time to serve as representatives. Typically, a Microsoft Student Partner is science major from [[engineering]] or [[business school]] of [[higher education]].

[[Microsoft]] offers compensation to the members of the Student Partners program through salaries (in some countries only) and [[software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]] packages which are distributed to them for testing and promotional purposes. Student Partners are given access to [[MSDN]] Premium Subscriptions to support their promotional activities. At times, Student Partners are invited to technology-related [[Academic conference|conferences]].

The candidate students are evaluated on the following attributes:
* '''Technical expertise'''
:A strong understanding of the overall set of Microsoft Visual languages and the .NET Framework is preferred, along with specific demonstrable skills in one or more languages or technologies. Students skilled in multiple platforms, languages, and technologies are especially encouraged to join the program. 
* '''Be a campus leader'''
:Nominees should be actively involved in student technical clubs, societies, and organizations, preferably in leadership roles. 
* '''Be an active part of the online community'''
:Nominees should be actively involved in online communities, academic or professional. Examples include blogs, newsgroups, forums, online clubs, and related. 
* '''Embrace new technology'''
:Nominees should seek out new technologies, explore them, and share that experience and knowledge gained with fellow students and faculty. 
* '''Work well with faculty'''
:Nominees should be well regarded by faculty within their department and across campus. 
* '''Keep an outgoing personality and mature attitude'''
:Nominees should have an outgoing personality in public situations. They should also have a positive, mature attitude towards responding to criticism and engaging in debate.

==Activities==
Student Partners are given access to the latest Microsoft software, [[Programming tool|development tools]], reference material, industry events, and training opportunities.&lt;ref name="GlobalInitiativePressRel"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/emea/presscentre/pressreleases/MSSPTechEdPR_7112006.mspx | title = Microsoft Rolls Out Global Initiative to Promote Career Development for Students | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | accessdate = 2010-03-24 | date = 2006-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MSPs are assumed to further share the knowledge among the academic community by arranging courses; giving presentations and lectures; and initiating projects among the students. MSPs are also used to promote incentives, for example, the Microsoft [[Imagine Cup]];&lt;ref group="note" name="ICNote"&gt;Student Partners may also actively compete in [[Imagine Cup]]; they are not directly affiliated to the organizers of the incentive.&lt;/ref&gt; and programs, such as the Ultimate Steal&lt;ref name="TheUltimateSteal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/student/discounts/theultimatesteal-us/default.aspx | title=Microsoft Office Discount for US Students - The Ultimate Steal - Office 2007 Software for $59.95 | accessdate = 2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its affiliate program.&lt;ref name="TheUltimateStealAffiliateProgram"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://student.theultimatesteal.com/public_interface.html?pi=1&amp;pic=4 |title=The Ultimate Steal Affiliate Program |accessdate=2010-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717040513/https://student.theultimatesteal.com/public_interface.html?pi=1&amp;pic=4 |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Student Partners (based on a selection criteria) are provided internships and job opportunities at a few Microsoft Divisions through the program.

Local MSP activities include, for example, attending the Student Technology Day in [[United Kingdom|UK]],&lt;ref name="StudentTechnologyDay"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/uk/academia/studenttechnologyday/default.mspx | title = Student Technology Day - Making Computer Science Matter | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | accessdate = 2009-03-23 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which included high-profile presentations, such as one by the CEO of Microsoft, [[Satya Nadella]]; and TechDays, for instance in [[France]],&lt;ref name="TechDaysFrance"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/france/mstechDays | title = Microsoft Techdays : le rendez-vous des professionnels de l’informatique | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | accessdate = 2009-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="TechDaysCanada"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/canada/techdays | title = Microsoft Tech Days Canada 2008 | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | accessdate = 2009-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Zealand]], the MSPs developed a programmed called the Microsoft Student Accelerator (MSA), which aims to not only train the students throughout the year but also place the students in various internship programmes over the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msa.azurewebsites.net/ | title = Microsoft Student Accelerator.

The '''Montessori Method of education''', developed by [[Maria Montessori]], is a child-centered educational approach based on scientific observations of children. Montessori's method has been used for over 100 years in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name="intro-to-montessori"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Montessori Method|website=American Montessori Society|url=https://amshq.org/Montessori-Education/Introduction-to-Montessori}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montessori method views the child as one who is naturally eager for knowledge and capable of initiating learning in a supportive, thoughtfully prepared learning environment. It attempts to develop children physically, socially, emotionally and cognitively.&lt;ref name="intro-to-montessori"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Montessori Method|website=American Montessori Society|url=https://amshq.org/Montessori-Education/Introduction-to-Montessori}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a range of practices exist under the name "Montessori", the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) and the [[American Montessori Society]] (AMS) cite these elements as essential:&lt;ref name=AMI-USA&gt;{{cite web|title=AMI School Standards|url=http://amiusa.org/ami-schools/ami-school-standards|accessdate=2011-04-22|publisher=Association Montessori Internationale-USA (AMI-USA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intro-to-montessori" /&gt;
*Mixed age classrooms; classrooms for children ages 2½ or 3 to 6&amp;nbsp;years old are by far the most common, but 0–3, 3-6, 6–9, 9–12, 12–15, and 15–18 year-old classrooms exist as well.
*Student choice of activity from within a prescribed range of options. 
*Uninterrupted blocks of work time, ideally three hours.
*A [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] or "discovery" model, where students learn concepts from working with materials, rather than by direct instruction.
*Specialized educational materials developed by Montessori and her collaborators often made out of natural, aesthetic materials such as wood, rather than plastic.
* A thoughtfully prepared environment where materials are organized by subject area, within reach of the child, and are appropriate in size.
*Freedom of movement within the classroom.
*A trained Montessori teacher who follows the child and is highly experienced in observing the individual child's characteristics, tendencies, innate talents and abilities.

==History==
[[File:Edward Harden Mansion, Sleepy Hollow, NY.jpg|thumb|The [[Scarborough School]] at the [[Edward Harden Mansion]] in [[Sleepy Hollow, NY]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the site of the first American Montessori school in 1911|alt=A wide brick building with dormer windows projecting from its roof and a white wooden wing on the left, seen from slightly downhill]]
Following her medical training, Maria Montessori began to develop her educational philosophy and methods in 1897, attending courses in [[pedagogy]] at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] and reading the educational theory of the previous two hundred years.&lt;ref name=Kramer&gt;{{cite book|last=Kramer |first=Rita|title=Maria Montessori|year=1976|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-201-09227-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}} While visiting an [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]], during her schooling with a teacher, she used her observations of mistreatment of the kids there, especially those with [[autism]], to create her new form of education. In 1907, she opened her first classroom, the Casa dei Bambini, or Children's House, in a tenement building in Rome.&lt;ref name=Kramer/&gt;{{rp|112}} From the beginning, Montessori based her work on her observations of children and experimentation with the environment, materials, and lessons available to them. She frequently referred to her work as "[[Maria Montessori#Scientific pedagogy|scientific pedagogy]]".

In 1901, Maria Montessori met Alice and [[Leopoldo Franchetti]] (Baroness &amp; Baron) of [[Città di Castello]]. They found many matching points between their work. Maria Montessori was invited to hold her first course for teachers and to set up a "Casa dei Bambini" at Villa Montesca, the home of the Franchettis in Città di Castello. Maria Montessori decided to move to Città di Castello where she lived for 2 years and where she refined her methodology together with Alice Franchetti. In that period, she published her book in Città di Castello. The Franchetti Barons financed the publication of the book and the methodology had the name "Method Franchetti-Montessori". Alice Franchetti died in 1911 at the age of 37 years old.

Montessori education had spread to the United States by 1912 and became widely known in educational and popular publications. However, conflict arose between Montessori and the American educational establishment. The 1914 critical booklet ''The Montessori System Examined,'' by influential education teacher [[William Heard Kilpatrick]], limited the spread of her ideas, and they languished after 1914. Montessori education returned to the United States in 1960 and has since spread to thousands of schools there. Montessori continued to extend her work during her lifetime, developing a comprehensive model of psychological development from birth to age 24, as well as educational approaches for children ages 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 12.

Montessori education also spread throughout the world, including Southeast Asia and [[India]], where Maria Montessori [[Montessori in India|was interned during World War II]].

==Montessori education theory==
[[File:Montessori Classroom.jpg|thumb|A Montessori classroom in the United States.]]
Montessori education is fundamentally a model of [[Developmental psychology|human development]], and an educational approach based on that model. The model has two basic principles. First, children and developing adults engage in psychological self-construction by means of interaction with their environments. Second, children, especially under the age of six, have an innate path of psychological development. Based on her observations, Montessori believed that children who are at liberty to choose and act freely within an environment prepared according to her model would act spontaneously for optimal development.

Montessori saw universal, innate characteristics in human psychology which her son and collaborator Mario Montessori identified as "human tendencies" in 1957. There is some debate about the exact list, but the following are clearly identified:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Mario|title=The Human Tendencies and Montessori Education|year=1966|publisher=Association Montessori Internationale|location= Amsterdam|url=http://amiusa.org/shop/the-human-tendencies-and-montessori-education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{columns-list|colwidth=26em|
* [[Abstraction#Abstraction in psychology|Abstraction]]
* Activity
* Communication
* Exactness
* Exploration
* Manipulation (of the environment)
* Order
* Orientation
* Repetition
* Self-Perfection
* Work (also described as "purposeful activity")
}}

In the Montessori approach, these human tendencies are seen as driving behavior in every stage of development, and education should respond to and facilitate their expression.

Montessori education involves free activity within a "prepared environment", meaning an educational environment tailored to basic human characteristics, to the specific characteristics of children at different ages, and to the individual personalities of each child.&lt;ref name="Lillard2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paula Polk Lillard|title=Montessori Today: A Comprehensive Approach to Education from Birth to Adulthood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHo6zlV1j8MC|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=7 September 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-76132-3|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The function of the environment is to help and allow the child to develop independence in all areas according to his or her inner psychological directives. In addition to offering access to the Montessori materials appropriate to the age of the children, the environment should exhibit the following characteristics:&lt;ref name=Standing&gt;{{cite book|last=Standing|first=E. M.|title=Maria Montessori: Her Life and Work|year=1957|publisher=Plume|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|263–280}}

}}

===Planes of development===
Montessori observed four distinct periods, or "planes", in human development, extending from birth to 6 years, from 6 to 12, from 12 to 18, and from 18 to 24. She saw different characteristics, learning modes, and developmental imperatives active in each of these planes, and called for educational approaches specific to each period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=The Four Planes of Development|journal=AMI Communications|year=1969|issue=2/3|pages=4–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grazzini|first=Camillo|title=The Four Planes of Development: A Constructive Rhythm of Life|journal=Montessori Today|date=Jan–Feb 1988|volume=1|issue=1|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first plane extends from birth to around six years of age. During this period, Montessori observed that the child undergoes striking physical and psychological development. The first-plane child is seen as a concrete, sensorial explorer and learner engaged in the developmental work of psychological self-construction and building functional independence. Montessori introduced several concepts to explain this work, including the absorbent mind, sensitive periods, and normalization.

Montessori described the young child's behavior of effortlessly assimilating the sensorial stimuli of his or her environment, including information from the senses, language, culture, and the development of concepts with the term "absorbent mind". She believed that this is a power unique to the first plane, and that it fades as the child approached age six.&lt;ref name=Montessori1967&gt;{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=The Absorbent Mind|year=1967|publisher=Delta|location=New York|isbn=0-440-55056-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montessori also observed and discovered periods of special sensitivity to particular stimuli during this time which she called the "sensitive periods". In Montessori education, the classroom environment responds to these periods by making appropriate materials and activities available while the periods are active in each individual young child. She identified the following periods and their durations:&lt;ref name=Standing/&gt;{{rp|118–140}}

* [[Language acquisition|Acquisition of language]]—from birth to around 6 years old
* Interest in small objects—from around 18&amp;nbsp;months to 3 years old
* Order—from around 1 to 3 years old
* Sensory refinement—from birth to around 4 years old
* [[Social behavior]]—from around 2½ to 4 years old

Finally, Montessori observed in children from three to six years old a psychological state she termed "normalization".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.montessori-namta.org/The-Process-of-Normalization The Process of Normalization]." ''North American Montessori Teacher's Association.''&lt;/ref&gt; Normalization arises from concentration and focus on activity which serves the child's developmental needs, and is characterized by the ability to concentrate as well as "spontaneous discipline, continuous and happy work, social sentiments of help and sympathy for others."&lt;ref name=Montessori1967/&gt;{{rp|207}}

The second plane of development extends from around six years to twelve years old. During this period, Montessori observed physical and psychological changes in children, and developed a classroom environment, lessons, and materials, to respond to these new characteristics. Physically, she observed the loss of baby teeth and the lengthening of the legs and torso at the beginning of the plane, and a period of uniform growth following. Psychologically, she observed the "herd instinct", or the tendency to work and socialize in groups, as well as the powers of reason and imagination. Developmentally, she believed the work of the second plane child is the formation of intellectual independence, of moral sense, and of social organization.&lt;ref name=Montessori1994&gt;{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=From Childhood to Adolescence|year=1994|publisher=ABC-Clio|location=Oxford, England|isbn=1-85109-185-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–16}}

The third plane of development extends from around twelve years to around eighteen years of age, encompassing the period of [[adolescence]]. Montessori characterized the third plane by the physical changes of [[puberty]] and adolescence, but also psychological changes. She emphasized the psychological instability and difficulties in concentration of this age, as well as the creative tendencies and the development of "a sense of justice and a sense of personal dignity." She used the term "valorization" to describe the adolescents' drive for an externally derived evaluation of their worth. Developmentally, Montessori believed that the work of the third plane child is the construction of the adult self in society.&lt;ref name=Montessori1994/&gt;{{rp|59–81}}

The fourth plane of development extends from around eighteen years to around twenty-four years old. Montessori wrote comparatively little about this period and did not develop an educational program for the age. She envisioned young adults prepared by their experiences in Montessori education at the lower levels ready to fully embrace the study of culture and the sciences in order to influence and lead civilization. She believed that economic independence in the form of work for money was critical for this age, and felt that an arbitrary limit to the number of years in university level study was unnecessary, as the study of culture could go on throughout a person's life.&lt;ref name=Montessori1994/&gt;{{rp|82–93}}

In short, four core aspects of montessori school include, practical life, sensorial, math, and language arts. Some smaller aspects that could be integrated into montessori schools include geography, art, and gardening.

===Education and peace===
As Montessori developed her theory and practice, she came to believe that education had a role to play in the development of world peace.&lt;ref name=Standing/&gt;{{rp|80}} She felt that children allowed to develop according to their inner laws of development would give rise to a more peaceful and enduring civilization. From the 1930s to the end of her life, she gave a number of lectures and addresses on the subject saying in 1936,

{{quotation |Preventing conflicts is the work of politics; establishing peace is the work of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=Education and Peace|year=1992|publisher=ANC-Clio|location=Oxford|isbn=1-85109-168-8|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She received a total of six nominations for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in a three-year period: 1949, 1950, and 1951.&lt;ref name=Kramer/&gt;{{rp|360}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/nomination/nomination.php?string=Montessori&amp;action=simplesearch |title=Nomination Database – Peace |publisher=Nobelprize.org|year= |accessdate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elementary Montessori peace curriculum starts with Five Great Lessons that give a big picture of the world and life. They are educational stories that also spark the imagination of the students. The Five Great Lessons are - The Beginning of the Universe and Earth, Life Comes to Earth, Human Come to Earth, How Writing Began, and How Numbers Began. It is important to not rush through them and give time for research in between. It is also important to share these lessons as early in the year as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://montessoritraining.blogspot.com/2009/09/introducing-and-exploring-five-great.html |title=The Five Great Lessons for Montessori Elementary: An Introduction and Lesson Idea List |publisher= North American Montessori Center |year= 2009|accessdate=2018-02-01}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Infant and toddler programs===
Montessori classrooms for children under three fall into several categories, with a number of terms being used. A ''{{lang|it|nido}}'', Italian for "nest", serves a small number of children from around two months to around fourteen months, or when the child is confidently walking. A "Young Child Community" serves a larger number of children from around one year to 2½ or 3 years old. Both environments emphasize materials and activities scaled to the children's size and abilities, opportunities to develop movement, and activities to develop independence. Development of independence in toileting is typically emphasized as well. Some schools also offer "Parent-Infant" classes, in which parents participate with their very young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Montessori Infant-Toddler Program |url=http://www.montessori-namta.org/Index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=85|publisher=North American Montessori Teachers Association|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preschool and kindergarten===
Montessori classrooms for children from 2½ or 3 to 6 years old are often called Children's Houses, after Montessori's first school, the Casa dei Bambini in Rome in 1906. This level is also called "Primary". A typical classroom serves 20 to 30 children in mixed-age groups, staffed by fully trained teachers and assistants. Classrooms are usually outfitted with child-sized tables and chairs arranged singly or in small clusters, with classroom materials on child-height shelves throughout the room. Activities are for the most part initially presented by the teacher, after which they may be chosen more or less freely by the children as interest dictates. Classroom materials usually include activities for engaging in practical skills such as pouring and spooning, washing up, scrubbing tables and sweeping. Also materials for the development of the senses, mathematical materials, language materials, music, art and cultural materials, including more science based activities like 'sink and float', Magnetic and Non magnetic and candle and air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Montessori Preschool Program|url=http://www.montessori-namta.org/Index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=86|publisher=North American Montessori Teachers Association|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities in Children's Houses are typically hands on, tactile materials to teach concepts. For example, to teach writing, students use sandpaper letters. These are letters created by cutting letters out of sandpaper and placing them on wooden blocks. The children then trace these letters with their fingers to learn the shape and sound of each letter. Another example is the use of bead chains to teach math concepts, specifically multiplication. Specifically for multiples of 10, there is one bead that represents one unit, a bar of ten beads put together that represents 1×10, then a flat shape created by fitting 10 of the bars together to represent 10×10, and a cube created by fitting 10 of the flats together to represent 10×10×10. These materials help build a concrete understanding of basic concepts upon which much is built in the later years.

===Elementary classrooms===
Elementary school classrooms usually serve mixed-age 6- to 9-year-old and 9- to 12-year-old groupings; 6- to 12-year-old groups are also used. Lessons are typically presented to small groups of children, who are then free to follow up with independent work of their own as interest and personal responsibility dictate. Montessori educators give interdisciplinary lessons examining subjects ranging from biology and history to theology, which they refer to as "great lessons." These are typically given near the beginning of the school term and provide the basis for learning throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourkids.net/montessori-schools.php Guide to Montessori Education].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessons include work in language, mathematics, history, the sciences, the arts, etc. Student-directed explorations of resources outside the classroom are integral to the education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Montessori Elementary Program|url=http://www.montessori-namta.org/Index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=87|publisher=North American Montessori Teachers Association|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montessori used the term "cosmic education" to indicate both the universal scope of lessons to be presented, and the idea that education should help children realize the human role in the interdependent functioning of the universe.

===Middle and high school===
Montessori education for this level is less well-developed than programs for younger children. Montessori did not establish a teacher training program or a detailed plan of education for adolescents during her lifetime. However, a number of schools have extended their programs for younger children to the middle school and high school levels. In addition, several Montessori organizations have developed teacher training or orientation courses and a loose consensus on the plan of study is emerging. Montessori wrote that, "The essential reform of our plan from this point of view may be defined as follows: during the difficult time of adolescence it is helpful to leave the accustomed environment of the family in town and to go to quiet surroundings in the country, close to nature".&lt;ref&gt;Montessori, 1989, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Montessori schools for adolescents 12–18 are set in rural locations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Studies==
Lillard (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lillard|first=Angeline|title=Montessori: The Science Behind the Genius|year=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-19-998152-6|pages=351–376}}&lt;/ref&gt; reviews recent research on the outcomes of Montessori education. A 2006 study published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'' magazine]] found that "when strictly implemented, Montessori education fosters social and academic skills that are equal or superior to those fostered by a pool of other types of schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lillard|first1=Angeline|last2=Else-Quest|first2=Nicole|title=Evaluating Montessori Education|journal=Science|date=29 September 2006|volume=313|page=1894|url=http://www.montessori-science.org/Science_Evaluating_Montessori_Education_Lillard.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study had a relatively small sample size and was severely criticized&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindenfors|first=Patrik|date=2007-02-02|title=Studying Students in Montessori Schools|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/315/5812/596.2|journal=Science|language=en|volume=315|issue=5812|pages=596–597|doi=10.1126/science.315.5812.596b|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17272701}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Another study in the Milwaukee Public Schools found that children who had attended Montessori from ages 3–11 outperformed their high school classmates several years later on mathematics and science;&lt;ref&gt;Dohrmann KR, Nishida TK, Gartner A, Lipsky DK, Grimm KJ (2007). "High school outcomes for students previously in a public Montessori program", ''Journal of Research in Childhood Education'' 22/2, pp. 205–217&lt;/ref&gt; another found that Montessori had some of the largest positive effects on achievement of all programs evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Borman,2003, ''Review of Education Research''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have not found positive outcomes for children in Montessori classrooms, but this might be due to the implementation of Montessori. For example, a 2005 study in a Buffalo public Montessori magnet school "...failed to support the hypothesis that enrollment in a Montessori school was associated with higher academic achievement."&lt;ref&gt;Lopata, Christopher; Wallace, Nancy V; Finn, Kristin V (2005). "Comparison of Academic Achievement Between Montessori and Traditional Education Programs", ''Journal of Research in Childhood Education'' 20/1, pp. 5–13&lt;/ref&gt; Explicitly comparing outcomes of Montessori classrooms in which children spent a lot of time with Montessori materials, less time with the Montessori materials, or no time at all with the materials (because they were in conventional classrooms), Lillard&lt;ref&gt;Lillard, A. S. (2012) Preschool children's development in classic Montessori, supplemented Montessori, and conventional programs, "Journal of School Psychology", 50/3, pp. 379–401&lt;/ref&gt; found the best outcomes for children in classic Montessori. Further research should take care to determine the fidelity of the program.

The review on evaluations of Montessori education studies, that was published in 2017, states that wide evidence exist that certain elements of the Montessori method (e.g. teaching early literacy through a phonic approach embedded in a rich language context, and providing a sensorial foundation for mathematics education) are effective. At the same time it was concluded that while some evidence exist that children may benefit cognitively and socially from Montessori education which sticks to original principles, it is less clear whether modern adapted forms of Montessori education are as effective.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Chloë; [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-017-0012-7 Montessori education: a review of the evidence base], "npj Science of Learning", Volume 2, id. 11 (10/2017) &lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of terminology==
In 1967, the US Patent Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ruled that "the term 'Montessori' has a generic and/or descriptive significance."&lt;ref&gt;American Montessori Society, Inc. v. Association Montessori Internationale, 155 U.S.P.Q. 591, 592 (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in the United States and most other countries, the term can be used freely without giving any guarantee of how closely, if at all, a program applies Montessori's work. The ruling has led to "tremendous variation in schools claiming to use Maria Montessori's methods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://humboldt.edu/cdblog/CD356-Hansen/montessori/|title=CD356-Hansen, Curriculum Development for Early Childhood-Montessori|author=(Staff writer(s); no by-line.)|publisher=Humboldt State University|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norwegian Digital Learning Arena (NDLA)'''  ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Nasjonal digital læringsarena'') is a joint [[Counties of Norway|county]] enterprise offering open [[digital learning assets]] for [[Upper secondary school (Norway)|upper secondary education]]. In addition to being a compilation of [[Open educational resources|open educational resources (OER)]], NDLA provides a range of other online tools for sharing and cooperation. The legal liability for the joint county programme is carried by [[Hordaland County Municipality|Hordaland County Council]].

NDLA does not take on its own employees, but manages co-workers within the county resource system, as well as co-workers from [[private sector]].
Core activities are organised in teams: Subject material development, technical development, applications management, content management, NDLA interactive, and desk support.&lt;ref&gt;From Chapter 2 in NDLAs Annual Report for 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2006 The [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]] allocated NOK 50 mill for the development of digital learning resources for subjects in secondary education. Among the targets was the intention to enhance the access to and use of digital learning resources in secondary education, and increase the volume and the variety of such resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/kd/dok/andre/brev/utvalgte_brev/2006/digitale-laremidler-i-videregaende-oppla.html?id=91754 Letter from the Ministry of Education dated 19.06.2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Increased volume and diversity were seen as significant conditions for the introduction of free learning material in upper secondary education. The incentive was an amendment imposing the counties to provide free educational material, in print as well as digital, including digital hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/1998-07-17-61#KAPITTEL_3 Norwegian Education Act § 3-1. The right to upper secondary education for youth]&lt;/ref&gt;

20 September 2006 the county chief executives of education agreed to establish a joint project to develop digital subject material for all subjects in secondary education. The project was named Norwegian Digital Learning Arena (NDLA).&lt;ref&gt;"Digitale læremiddel i vidaregåande opplæring - Nasjonal digital læringsarena", political issue with case number 200702708-9 in Hordaland County Council&lt;/ref&gt; The preliminary project work started early 2007; all counties except Oslo were parts of the collaboration. The first year the project was fully funded by the Ministry of Education and Research, and on 26 September Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg officially opened Norwegian Digital Learning Arena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hordaland.no/Aktuelt/Arkiv-nyhende/2007/September/Nasjonal-digital-laringsarena-opna-av-statsminister-Stoltenberg/ Norwegian Digital Learning Arena opened by PM Jens Stoltenberg. (From the web site of Hordaland County.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605052740/http://www.hordaland.no/Aktuelt/Arkiv-nyhende/2007/September/Nasjonal-digital-laringsarena-opna-av-statsminister-Stoltenberg/ |date=5 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic year 2008–2009 subject material for Norwegian, natural science, and health and social care, first year course, was published.

The 18 participating counties took over the further funding of the project, and for the academic year 2009–2010 digital subject material was provided for 17 curricula and more than 30 subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;Many curricula cover more than one subject; it is for example normal that a curriculum for a vocational syllabus is split into three or four different subject areas. Curricula for Norwegian, mathematics, and English also cover more than one subject.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent increases by the year and by school start in 2014 subject material covering approximately 40 curricula and 60 subject areas within upper secondary education is available.

In 2013 [[Akershus]] County decided to withdraw from the project, however, the county resumed its participation from January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akershus.no/file/ec32575da10d58b6582107d0d4343d8c/Sakskart%202%20til%20fylkestinget%2023.09.13.pdf Agenda from the Akershus County Assembly of 23 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of visits to the digital learning resources on ndla.no has been rising since the start of the project. Based on ratings by [[Google Analytics]] the figures are:&lt;ref&gt;Figures of ratings quoted from [http://om.ndla.no/brukerstatistikk/ NDLA]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2010: 1 431 017
* 2011: 2 876 541
* 2012: 4 799 181
* 2013: 7 022 812
* 2014: 8 200 000
* 2015 10 000 000
* 2016: 11 800 000
* 2017: 12 400 000 

[[Oslo]] County does not take part in the NDLA project, but is the county with most visits and use of the resources on ndla.no. In 2013 there were 1 139 129 visits from Oslo.

NDLA was candidate for the prize with the entry: NDLA Innovation in Acquisition, Development and Distribution of Digital Learning Resources. A total of 274 initiatives were evaluated, and 15 candidates were shortlisted for the prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://om.ndla.no/pressemelding-norsk-metode-til-topps-i-europa Press release: Norwegian Way on Top in Europe (from om.ndla.no)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727043551/http://om.ndla.no/pressemelding-norsk-metode-til-topps-i-europa |date=27 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


In 2014 NDLA won the [[Boldic Award]] for its open and innovative web repository at ndla.no.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boldic.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Boldic_Award_2014_diplom1_original_us_final1.pdf BOLDIC AWARD 2014, Stockholm 23 October 2014, The Boldic Award Jury 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; In the jury statement, it was pointed out that NDLA's project strategy and solutions can be scalable across the Nordic and Baltic countries, and that NDLA provides a unique way of working together to promote distance learning and ICT-supported flexible lifelong learning.


In 2017 NDLA won the [http://www.oeconsortium.org/projects/open-education-awards-for-excellence/2017-oe-award-winners-oer-categories/ Open Educational Resources Awards for best OER Site].

==External evaluations==
The NDLA learning resources are continually evaluated by independent third parties. An external users’ study from 2013 revealed that NDLA was mostly used as supplement to a traditional textbook, and the use was largely managed by the teacher. Students pointed out e-lectures and differentiated tasks as most useful. Both teachers and students emphasized the value of the possibility to differentiate material and tasks designed for students with varying learning capability.&lt;ref&gt;Athenae AS [http://om.ndla.no/system/files/Brukerundersøkelse%20NDLA%202013.pdf Evaluation of NDLA -- User Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022222111/http://om.ndla.no/system/files/Brukerunders%C3%B8kelse%20NDLA%202013.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procurement and Production==
By publicly inviting tenders NDLA searches the market for digital learning resources to cover the competence aims of the different subject areas. NDLA asks for production services, developing groups of digital learning material, for either parts of, or prospective total solutions for a complete curriculum.

The responsibility for the editorial work, organising, meta-tagging, and putting together the material in the respective subject areas lies with competent editing groups recruited from upper secondary schools in the counties. The contents of each site are quality controlled by academy and university expertise, or otherwise specialists in that particular field. All the core material is published in the two forms of Norwegian.

When the demand is not met by the supply, the editing groups will produce their own material. The publishing companies are invited to collaborate in every round of purchase, and are free to make an offer of their material that will benefit their interests.

==Funding==
The basic income of NDLA rests on a joint contribution from the part-taking counties, of NOK 400, - per student, which constitutes an annual income of estimated NOK 64 mill. In 2013 this figure was lower due to Akershus’ leaving the project.&lt;ref&gt;From chapter 7 in NDLA’s annual report 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 66% of NDLA’s net expenses in 2013 were spent on purchase in the market.&lt;ref&gt;From chapter 8 in NDLA’s annual report 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 NDLA was indicted by the [[Norwegian Publishers' Association]] before the [[European System of Financial Supervisors|European Surveillance Authority]] (ESA). The publishers claimed that the state funding of more than NOK 150 mill did not comply with the international regulation of financial state support, and represented an obstacle to the establishing of a free market for digital learning resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forleggerforeningen.no/filemanager/download_file/file/506285.pdf/rsberetning%202010.pdf Annual Report from Norwegian Publishers' Association 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105033/http://www.forleggerforeningen.no/filemanager/download_file/file/506285.pdf/rsberetning%202010.pdf |date=20 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indictment was initially rejected by the [[EFTA Surveillance Authority]] on 12 October 2011,&lt;ref&gt;EFTA Surveillance Authority Press Release 2011-10-12: [http://www.eftasurv.int/press--publications/press-releases/state-aid/nr/1535 State aid: Norwegian support to provider of digital learning material cleared] 12.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eftasurv.int/media/decisions/311-11-COL.pdf EFTA Surveillance Authority decision] 2011-10-12&lt;/ref&gt; but in December 2012 the dismissal was set aside by the EFTA Court after an appeal from the Publishers’ Association. In March 2013 the [[EFTA Court]] announced a formal investigation of the funding of NDLA,&lt;ref&gt;EFTA Surveillance Authority Press Release 2013-03-27: [http://www.eftasurv.int/press--publications/press-releases/state-aid/nr/1905 State Aid: Investigation opened into funding of Norwegian provider of digital learning material]&lt;/ref&gt; and ESA reopened the case. After a close examination ESA reached the same conclusion; the funding of NDLA is in compliance with the rules of state funding.&lt;ref&gt;EFTA Surveillance Authority Press Release 2014-06-26: [http://www.eftasurv.int/press--publications/press-releases/state-aid/nr/2278 State aid: Norwegian support to the provider of digital learning material does not involve state aid]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''opsimath''' is a person who begins, or continues, to [[Knowledge|study]] or [[Learning|learn]] late in life.&lt;ref&gt;''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', page 2010. Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ὀψέ (''opsé''), meaning 'late', and μανθάνω (''manthánō''), meaning 'learn'.&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, Peter: ''The Superior Person's Book of Words'', page 101. Bloomsbury, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Opsimathy''' was once frowned upon, used as a put-down with implications of laziness,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9603/articles/revessay.html FirstThings.com essay] regarding "exposure" of opsimathy, implying negativity.

(URL accessed April 15, 2006) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051118204240/http://www.gcal.ac.uk/magnus/ceremony_speech_text.html |date=November 18, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that this approach may, in fact, be desirable.

Notable opsimaths include 19th century army officer and [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] [[Sir Henry Rawlinson]], [[Grandma Moses]], mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] (who published papers until his death at age 83), [[Rabbi Akiva]] (according to the [[Talmud]] he began studying at age 40), and [[Cato the Elder]], who learned [[Greek language|Greek]] only at the age of 80.

The '''Postgraduate Research Experience Survey (PRES)''' is a survey amongst graduate students at universities in the United Kingdom. It is developed by the [[Higher Education Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Postgraduate Research Experience Survey (PRES)|url=http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/pres|author=The Higher Education Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participating institutions can collect feedback on the student experience and benchmark against their peers. The data is shared in a way so that comparisons (with the national average, for instance) are possible, but league tables cannot be constructed. The aim is to enhance the student experience. 

The equivalent for graduate students on taught courses is the Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey (PTES).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7589">'''''READ 180 is a''''' reading intervention program in wide use by students in Grades 4–12 who read at least two years below grade level. It was created by [[Scholastic Corporation]]. In 2011, Scholastic released its newest version, '''''READ 180'' Next Generation''', which has been fully aligned to meet the demands of the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]].&lt;ref name="R180"&gt;[http://read180.scholastic.com/reading-intervention-program A webpage] about READ 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholastic sold READ 180 to [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmhco.com/media-center/press-releases/2015/april/scholastic-acquisition#sthash.uQY0qwGH.dpuf  Houghton Mifflin Harcourt to Acquire Scholastic’s Educational Technology and Services Business for $575 Million]&lt;/ref&gt;

== How It Works ==
''READ 180'' is based on a blended instructional model that includes whole-group instruction and three small-group rotations, adaptive software, [[differentiated instruction]], and [[independent reading]].

The program has three different versions: Upper Elementary (Grades 4–5), Middle School (Grades 6-8), and High School (Grades 9–12).

== Placement ==
The Scholastic Reading Inventory (SRI) is a technology-based universal screener and progress monitor.  SRI is used to generate a [[Lexile]], or [[readability]] level, for each student. The purpose of administering the SRI is to determine if the student is a candidate for intervention. SRI is software that “assesses students’ reading levels, tracks students’ growth over time, and helps guide instruction according to students’ needs.” &lt;ref name="SRI"&gt;[http://teacher.scholastic.com/products/sri_reading_assessment/index.htm A webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213080038/http://teacher.scholastic.com/products/sri_reading_assessment/index.htm |date=2012-12-13 }} about SRI.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program Components ==
''READ 180'' is a reading intervention program that provides individualized instruction to meet each student’s reading needs.  The technology collects data based on individual responses and adjusts instruction to meet each students’ needs at their level, accelerating their path to reading mastery.&lt;ref name="R180Research"&gt;[http://read180.scholastic.com/pdf/research/1_2011_ResearchFoundationPapers_R180NG_READ180.pdf A PDF] Research Foundation Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers begin and end each class session with whole-group instruction. Next students break into one of three rotations.  First, the teacher leads small-group instruction, using the ''READ 180'' worktext called the ''rBook'', teachers monitor reading and differentiate instruction based on students’ needs. Second, students work independently in the ''READ 180'' software. The software leads students through five Learning Zones: the Reading Zone, the Word Zone, the Spelling Zone, the Success Zone, and the Writing Zone. Third, the students read independently in Independent Reading. Students select from the ''READ 180'' paperback or audiobook library and read a [[fiction]] or [[nonfiction book]] (or eRead).&lt;ref name="R1802"&gt;[http://read180.scholastic.com/about/instructional-model A webpage] regarding how ''READ 180'' is used.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
''READ 180'' is the result of research that began in 1985 with the work of Dr. Ted Hasselbring and members of the Cognition and Technology Group at [[Vanderbilt University]]. With a grant from the [[United States Department of Education]]’s Office of Special Education, Dr. Hasselbring developed software that used student performance data to individualize and differentiate the path of computerized reading instruction.&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;[http://read180.scholastic.com/pdf/research/read180_Heritage_of_Research_.pdf A PDF] READ 180: A Heritage of Research.&lt;/ref&gt; This software became the prototype for the READ 180 program.

Between 1994 and 1998, Dr. Hasselbring and his team put their work to the test in [[Orange County, Florida|Orange County]], Florida. The Orange County Literacy Project used this ''READ 180'' prototype with more than 10,000 struggling students. The dramatic results Orange County public schools experienced were documented in the ''Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness''.&lt;ref name="Slavin"&gt;[http://research.scholastic.com/sites/default/files/publications/READ180_ProfessionalPaper_MTSS_2012.pdf A PDF] An Alignment Guide.&lt;/ref&gt; These results led Scholastic to partner with Orange County public schools and [[Vanderbilt University]] to license the software, and to launch ''READ 180''. 

After the initial launch of ''READ 180'', Scholastic released Enterprise Edition in 2006 in collaboration with Dr. Kevin Feldman and Dr. Kate Kinsella. ''READ 180'' Enterprise Edition featured the ''READ 180'' ''rBook'', structured engagement routines for [[English language learners]], and the Scholastic Achievement Manager (SAM).&lt;ref name="Research"&gt;[http://read180.scholastic.com/pdf/research/1_2011_EfficacyStudy_ResearchCompendium2011_READ180.pdf Compendium of ''READ 180'' Research ] History of ''READ 180''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports==
A number of studies have been conducted regarding the [[effectiveness]] of using ''READ 180''  in the classroom. The company's [[webpage]] includes a searchable list of research articles. 

Below is a sample of some of the current research available on ''READ 180''. 

The U.S. Department of Education Striving Readers Project shows ''READ 180'' effective in combating adolescent illiteracy.&lt;ref name="Striving"&gt;[http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/node/517 A Press Release] Research Shows ''READ 180'' Effective in Combating Adolescent Illiteracy.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for Educational Science (IES) What Works Clearinghouse recognized ''READ 180'' for potentially positive effects in comprehension and general literacy achievement. 
&lt;ref name="WWC"&gt;[http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/node/258 A Press Release] What Works Clearinghouse Confirms Scholastic Read 180 Works.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavin, Cheung, and Groff, and Lake (2008) placed ''READ 180'' in a select group of [[adolescent]] literacy programs that showed more evidence of effectiveness than 121 other programs reviewed.

Harty, Fitzgerald, and Porter (2008) indicated that ''READ 180'' can be successfully implemented in an afterschool setting. 
Lang, Torgesen, Vogel, Chanter,  Lefsky, and Petscher (2009) published a study which indicated that ninth-grade students enrolled in ''READ 180'' exceeded the benchmark for expected yearly growth on the [[Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test]]. 

De La Paz (1997) documented the foundational research conducted by Dr. Ted Hasselbring and his team from [[Peabody College]] at [[Vanderbilt University]].

'''Russian School Defense Staff''' or '''Headquarters for the Protection of Russian Schools''' ({{lang-ru|Штаб защиты русских школ}}; {{lang-lv|Krievu skolu aizstāvības štābs}}) — movement in [[Latvia]] for protection of public secondary education in Russian. Leaders: [[Vladimir Buzayev]], [[Gennady Kotov]], [[Yury Petropavlovsky]], [[Miroslav Mitrofanov]], [[Mihail Tyasin]], [[Viktor Dergunov]], [[Vladislav Rafalsky]], for some time also [[Alexander Yuryevich Kazakov|Alexander Kazakov]] (deported out of Latvia in 2004), one of the most prominent spokesmen — [[Yakov Pliner]].&lt;ref&gt;''Boguševiča T.''

==Aims of the movement==
Cancelling the Education law provisions, which originally ordered the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Forms 10-12) to be only Latvian (later - at least 60% Latvian) since 2004. It also supports providing effective learning of Latvian language in the Latvian language and literature lessons and specific preparation of teachers for Russian schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shtab.lv/main.php?w2=about Штаб защиты русских школ, официальный сайт&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Staff was founded&lt;ref&gt;Заявление о создании штаба по защите русских школ. Published in: "Ракурс" No. 1/2003 The text of the founding statement is available [http://www.rusojuz.lv/ru/party/istorija/18988-/ online {{ru icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2003 as a coalition of various organizations, most prominent being [[ForHRUL]], and later expanded, involving nonpartisan people. In 2003–2004, the Staff has organized political demonstrations (according to the [[Freedom House]] and political scientist T. Boguševiča, the biggest ones in Latvia since the beginning of the 1990s) to protest to expanding use of Latvian language in Russian schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=search&amp;docid=473c550523 Freedom in the World 2005.

As a result, the Education law was amended in February 2004, allowing to teach up to 40% in the forms 10-12 in minority languages. The proportion of teaching 60% of subjects in Latvian and 40% in Russian, according to BISS research, was supported by 20% of the teachers, 15% of pupils and 13% of parents in minority schools and most stated that they would rather support bilingual instruction in all subjects; only 15% of teachers thought that no reform was needed, while this opinion was expressed by 36% of parents and 44% of pupils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://providus.lv/article_files/1091/original/cittaut.pdf?1326906351 Cittautiešu jauniešu integrācija Latvijas sabiedrībā izglītības reformas kontekstā.

Baltijas Sociālo zinātņu institūts, 2004 — 79. lpp.]&lt;/ref&gt; The parliamentary opposition started two cases before the [[Constitutional Court of Latvia]] (abjudicated in May and September, 2005) with most of its demands being refused.

'''[[School uniform]]''' is a practice which dates to the 16th century in the United Kingdom. It is believed that the [[Christ's Hospital]] school in London in 1552 was the first [[school]] to use a uniform for its [[student]]s.&lt;ref&gt;see https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-29047752&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest documented proof of institutionalised use of a standard academic dress dates back to 1222 when the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] ordered the wearing of the ''cappa clausa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite  book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of wearing school uniform has been adopted by many other countries, and is now common in many parts of the world. Uniforms can be regarded as promoting social equality among students and an [[esprit de corps]], but have also been criticised for promoting a form of uniformity characteristic of militarism.

The decision as to whether to implement school uniform policy or not is a controversial one and also polarised in societies and countries. In countries such as the United Kingdom, South Africa and a number of Asian nations, school children have to wear approved school uniforms that conform to the uniform policy of their school. In modern Europe, Britain and Ireland stand out as the only countries where school uniform is widely adopted by state schools and generally supported by national and local governments, although there is no legislation governing school uniform in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Australia ==
[[File:Barack Obama at Campbell High School.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3| Former U.S. President Obama with students at an Australian school in 2011.]]
In Australia, each school or school system can set its own uniform policy. Wearing a uniform is compulsory in most Australian private and all Catholic schools, as well as in most public schools, although it is sometimes less enforced in primary schools that have uniforms. Uniforms usually have a color scheme based on the school colors. Uniform and appearance are generally strictly enforced in private and Catholic schools, although public schools are beginning to become increasingly strict about their uniforms. Most, if not all, public and private schools have the school logo incorporated in the uniform ensemble, typically on the necktie and the blazer breast pocket.

For boys, the uniforms generally include a button-up or polo shirt with either [[short pants|shorts]] (especially for summer wear) or long trousers, usually in grey or navy blue or the school colour. Some schools allow boys to wear shorts only in younger years, and they must wear long trousers once they are a senior (17-18). At others, even older boys wear shorts in summer due to the heat.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://www.dobsons.com.au/static_site/pdf/St%20Kevins%20College.pdf School uniform price list] making a distinction between summer uniform and winter uniform.&lt;/ref&gt; Where short trousers are to be worn, socks in school colors (more commonly white) are often required. Girls' uniforms generally include a checkered or striped dress (usually sleeveless or short-sleeved) worn over a blouse for summer and, in most secondary schools, girls wear a skirt as well as a button-up or polo shirt in winter with a blazer and tie. In a number of schools, girls are also permitted to wear a button-up or polo shirt and dark trousers.

In public schools, the uniform is usually a polo shirt for juniors and a different one for seniors and  trousers or skirt. This set may be complemented by a school [[necktie]] and, typically, a v-neck jumper (pullover or sweater) or a blazer. In the summer, boys usually do not wear ties, pullovers, or blazers. Instead, they wear a short-sleeved version of the shirt and short trousers. A neck-tie, blazer, and hat are also common in private and Catholic schools.

In most high schools a PE uniform is the norm for sports days only. At many high schools, children are required to change into and out of their PE uniform around the PE lesson. The PE uniform usually consists of shorts and a polo shirt, as well as a light weatherproof rain jacket (mainly at private or Catholic schools), usually made of polyester, for winter and wet weather and sometimes a netball skirt for girls. It is common for students in their final year of primary school or secondary school to have their own jersey, jumper or jacket to denote their final-year status.

== Brazil ==

There is no legal requirement for school uniforms in Brazil. On a state-by-state or city-by-city basis, governments may issue uniforms to public school pupils but may not require their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/educacao/um%20em%20cada%20quatro%20alunos%20de%20escola%20estadual%20recebe%20uniforme/n1238146989999.html|title=Um em cada quatro alunos de escola estadual recebe uniforme|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private schools are free to set their own uniform policy.

Brazilian school uniforms can vary widely by school. There are many schools that opt for a more elegant outfit, while others opt for a simpler one (social shirt, shorts). Some schools use "intelligent uniforms" embedded with locator chips that allow computers to automatically record whether pupils have arrived in school or not. If pupils do not turn up for school or classes, an automated message is sent to inform the parents accordingly. The benefit of the automated system is to curb absenteeism and class skipping. &lt;ref&gt;see http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/23rfid-chip-brazil-student_n_1374886.html&lt;/ref&gt; In this country, where schools have set a uniform, it is the student's obligation to wear it.

Most schools in Brazil choose the use of uniforms. The average Brazilian school uniform for boys is a T-shirt with the school's logo, sweatpants or bermuda shorts and a sweatshirt or hoodie. The uniform for girls is very similar, but instead leggings or short shorts are worn, although ballerina pants are also highly popular. Younger girls may have the choice to wear a skirts with shorts underneath. Most schools require sneakers.

== Burundi ==

School uniforms are compulsory for school children in [[Burundi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betterplace.org/projects/2112-educational-for-street-children-in-burundi|title=Bildungschancen für Straßenkinder in Burundi|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burundi, like most African countries, has a compulsory school uniform policy. Burundi's school uniform policy dates back to the colonial days. During those days, chiefs' sons wore a white uniform and all other children wore khaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/iiep/PDF/pubs/2008/Burundi.pdf|title=IIEP UNESCO|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uniform policy is still in force in Burundi to date. However, schools decide on what uniform the pupils wear. It is also argued that the cost of buying the school uniform and poverty, especially in the rural areas, negatively affect school enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagine-burundi-terimbere.com/contact/school-uniform-and-little-sun.html|title=SCHOOL UNIFORM AND LITTLE SUN|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cambodia ==
[[File:Écoliers au Cambodge.jpg|thumb|School children wearing uniforms in [[Cambodia]]]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
In Cambodia, students of all ages (pre-school to college) wear school uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cctnz.org.nz/education-projects|title=- The Cambodia Charitable Trust|date=13 August 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uniforms differ by school and age level. Generally, boys wear a white dress shirt and a pair of shorts. The colour and length of the shorts varies at each school.  Male college students wear the same kind of uniform, but instead of shorts, they wear black dress trousers. Girls usually wear white blouses and a skirt. Their skirts vary in colour and length depending upon the school and their ages. Generally, the younger students wear long skirts that almost reach their ankles and older students, particularly in college, wear shorter ones. Skirts are generally blue or black but may be other colours as well, depending on the school. Some schools also have alternative uniforms which students of both genders wear every other day. These often consist of a coloured shirt and slacks. High school girls must wear black or blue long skirts. High school boys wear long black or blue trousers. The white shirt can be short-sleeved or long-sleeved for both genders. High school students are also required to wear name tags on the left hand side of their shirts.

==Canada==
[[File:Maison Piacente highschool uniforms.jpg|thumb|right|Highschool uniforms on sale at a warehouse store in [[Montreal, Quebec]].]]
In Canada, school uniforms are not required in most public schools or [[separate schools]], except in exceptional circumstances such as school performances or international field trips. However, the majority of Catholic high schools in [[southern Ontario]] (Grade 9-12) do require uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.owensoundsuntimes.com/2010/01/19/st-marys-committee-asks-parents-about-uniforms&lt;/ref&gt; These uniforms generally have long- or short-sleeved shirts with the school logo or crest near the collar and trousers or kilted skirts. Schools often allow girls the option of choosing to wear the skirt or trousers. Some schools also mandate dress shoes and a particular type and length of socks to go with the uniform. A cardigan sweater, vest, or blazer may be part of the ensemble, particularly in winter. Additionally, as of 2011, the [[Toronto Catholic District School Board]] has implemented an ''Appropriate Dress Code'' of navy blue and white in all elementary separate schools which do not already have their own uniforms.&lt;ref name=TCDSB&gt;{{cite web|title=Dress Code in TCDSB Schools|url=https://www.tcdsb.org/FORPARENTS/DressCode/Pages/default.aspx|website=TCDSB|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uniforms are used in most private schools, and also in special or alternative programs of public and Catholic schools, such as the Traditional Learning Centres, a program that takes a [[liberal arts]] approach, while focusing on high levels of academic excellence. In [[Quebec]], most metropolitan anglophone school boards require a uniform.

== Chile ==

{{Main article|Chilean school uniform}}
In Chile, most schools have a uniform.

Until 1930, it was uncommon for students to wear a uniform. Under the government of [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]], all students became obliged to wear a school uniform. During the administration of [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], a unified uniform was introduced for all public and private schools and other education centers. Today, these uniforms have disappeared in private schools, who prefer to use a customised one.

== China ==
[[File:School uniforms in China - 03.jpg|thumb|300px|Chinese high school students in their summer school uniforms.]]
Uniforms are a common part of the schools in China. Almost all secondary schools as well as some elementary schools require students to wear uniforms. Uniforms in mainland China usually consist of five sets: 2 formal sets and 3 everyday sets. A formal set is worn on Mondays or special occasions (school anniversaries, school ceremonies, etc.) They consist of a white collared shirt with a sweater on top and a skirt for girls or a suit for boys. There is one formal set for summer and one set for winter. Everyday uniforms for boys in the winter usually consist of a zippered [[sweater]] and trousers and a collared shirt (usually white). Thinner materials are worn in the spring and fall and short or long trousers may be worn in the summer. The everyday uniforms for girls are very similar to the boys' uniform. It is relatively common for there to be some kind of sponsored advertisement on some non-formal school uniform shirts, though this trend has fluctuated in recent years.

== Colombia ==
[[File:Mr. Shake Amargosa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Colombian primary school students with their teacher.]]
In Colombia, all students are required to wear uniforms in public and private schools. Uniforms in Colombia consist of two sets, one for everyday use and a sports one for physical education. Everyday uniforms for girls generally include a knee-length skirt, a white T-shirt with a vest, and white calf-length socks. For boys, the uniform generally includes dark-coloured long trousers and a short- or long-sleeved shirt. The shoes for both girls and boys are black lace-up shoes (sometimes the shoes may be dark blue or wine-coloured, depending on the uniform colours) and the shirts usually have the school's symbol at the left side. The sports uniform includes sweat pants, a collared T-shirt, and white sports shoes. The designs and the colours of the uniforms depend on the school's colours and the principal's preference.

== El Salvador ==
[[File:Independencia desfile Santa Tecla 2012.jpg|thumb|204x204px|Salvadoran school students celebrating independence day]]
In El Salvador, all students from public schools  and private schools are required to wear uniforms.  Uniforms vary depending on the school.

== France ==

Since 1968, uniforms have not been enforced in French schools, with a few exceptions (such as [[Maison d'éducation de la Légion d'honneur]], les Écoles TUNON, and Vatel).  [[Xavier Darcos]], a former teacher and [[Department of Education|Minister of Education]] from 2007 to 2009, is an advocate of the reintroduction of uniforms:  "This is not outrageous. This removes the visible differences in social status or wealth. This is an additional factor of integration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2009/01/17/525744-Darcos-ressort-l-uniforme-du-placard.html|title=Darcos ressort l'uniforme du placard|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since March 2012, the students of the Boarding School of Excellence [[Sourdun]] wear a uniform with the insignia of their establishment.

Les lycées de la défense, formerly known as [[Military school#France|military schools]], require their students to wear uniforms.  At some universities, the [[academic dress]] is becoming popular.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In the [[French Antilles]] ([[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]), as well as French Guiana, a uniform has been required since September 2008.

== Germany ==

{{Refimprove section|date=September 2010}}
[[File:Waldgrundschule Schulkleidung.jpg|thumb|German school children wearing voluntary "Schulkleidung" (2009).]]

There is no tradition of wearing school uniforms in Germany, and today, almost all students of state schools, private schools or universities do not wear school uniforms. However, certain garments have been common to students in former times:

From the 16th century, students (especially of secondary or grammar schools and similar institutions) were often subject to regulations that prescribed, for example, modest and not too stylish attire. In many cases these regulations were part of wider laws concerning the clothing of all citizens of certain social classes.

A blue coat became a widespread obligatory status symbol of students of secondary schools; it fell out of use during the latter half of the 18th century. In more recent times, school uniforms in any real sense did not exist outside of convent schools and private boarding schools. At times, certain fashions became so widespread that they approached uniform status; this is true in particular for so-called student hats (''Schülermützen'') that became widespread from the 1880s on and remained somewhat popular until they were banned by the Nazis. Their wearing was advocated by teachers and the students themselves and occasionally made mandatory, but never on a national or statewide level. Another instance are the [[sailor suits]] that became fashionable around the turn of the 19th century. These, too, were not usually a prescribed uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Handbuch der Geschichte des Bayerischen Bildungswesens
| author = M. Freyer
| chapter = Geschichte der Schulkleidung
| editor = H. Liedtke
| pages = 273 ff.
| volume = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis banned student hats – the last remaining, if voluntary, form of unified student clothing – because they considered them an attribute of class society. They did, however, institute mandatory membership in the uniformed [[Hitler Youth]] (''HJ'') from 1936 until their fall. HJ uniforms were worn in the HJ training academies and in the [[National Political Institutes of Education|Napolas]]; students of other schools sometimes wore them to school at their own discretion.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In recent times, the introduction of school uniforms has been discussed, but usually the expression "uniform" (the word is the same in German) is avoided in favour of terms like "school clothing" ("Schulkleidung"). School clothing has been introduced in a small number of schools, for example in [[Hamburg]]-Sinstorf in 2000, and in [[Friesenheim (Baden)|Friesenheim]] and [[Haag in Obb|Haag (Oberbayern)]] in 2005. In these cases the clothes are collections of shirts, sweaters, and the like, catering to contemporary fashion senses. Uniforms in a more traditional sense are almost never proposed in earnest.

The debate on mandatory school uniforms intensified in Germany when two Muslim girls dressed in burkas arrived at a school in Bonn in 2006. The girls' actions were interpreted as political action and were subsequently suspended from school. Then-Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries  in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag stated that the simple solution to the issue under consideration is mandatory introduction of school uniforms for boys and girls across Germany. She further argued that school uniforms would help to prevent conflicts arising from religious or political differences.  Her stance was supported by then-Minister Of Education Annette Schavan. The proposal was met with opposition from the teacher union and opposition political parties. The teacher union argued that school uniforms are not the solution for integration problems nor the issue of fashion obsession. The leader of the teacher union  Heinz-Peter Meidinger also added that the school uniforms have been a controversial issue in Germany over the years.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4753623.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - School uniform row grips Germany|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to school uniforms===
A senior member of the Green Party, Krista Sager, also said that the introduction of school uniforms would be unacceptable state interference in religious matters. She then proposed that individual schools have to find their own solutions and rejected solutions imposed by government. She further noted that school uniforms are no longer up to date and their imposition would be rejected by the current generation of students. The Conference of Education Ministers, a body which decides on school policies, also kicked back against school uniforms. They cited historical reasons dating back to WWII with memories of Hitler Youth's uniform still fresh in people's minds. They also concluded that the imposition of school uniforms would be excessive government encroachment on personal liberty of pupils and parents.&lt;ref name="dw.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/in-germany-veiled-students-stir-up-uniform-debate/a-1996295|title=In Germany, Veiled Students Stir Up Uniform Debate - Germany - DW.COM - 08.05.2006|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, a number of schools sell branded clothing that can be worn as a sign of school pride.&lt;ref name="dw.de"/&gt;

The [[Bildungsstreik]] movement fights against school uniforms due to their belief that it represents some kind of [[militarism]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

== Ghana ==

[[File:Ghana students.jpg|thumb|left| Students in [[Ghana]] wearing their uniform]]

All children have to wear school uniforms in [[Ghana]]. Pupils in public schools have the same type of school uniform with the school's emblem is imprinted on the left chest. This helps to distinguish pupils of one school from the other. Private schools determine which uniforms their pupils wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4690000/newsid_4697700/4697717.stm |title=Worksheets: My school is linked with Africa |date=19 July 2005 |work=CBBC Newsround |publisher =BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://allafrica.com/stories/201012210852.html |title= North Tongu District Distributes Free School Uniforms, Exercise Books to 40 Schools |work =The Ghanaian Chronicle |location =Accra |date=18 December 2010 |author= Agebewode, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/globalcafe/peacecorps/ghana/ghana_nicholas5.html |title= Nicholas's Story |publisher=PBS |work=NewsHour |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghana like most African countries is characterised by low incomes and high levels of poverty. Hence the cost of school uniforms acts as one of the barriers to educational access.  In an effort to achieve universal primary education the government, as part of its educational policy, initiated free school uniform distribution throughout the country in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/upload/Ghana/Ghana_MDG_Report_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to government data, a total of 170,221 pupils were supplied with free school uniforms in 2013 and it planned to supply 10,000 uniforms in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/2012-02-08-08-24-49/ministry-of-education&lt;/ref&gt; There are public programs to offer poor families financial help to buy uniforms. Over 8,000 school uniforms have been distributed by the government to needy students in the communities from the Tarkwa Nsuaem municipality, one of the mining districts in Ghana, which is severely affected by poverty. This is part of a program instituted in 2010 to supply disadvantaged  children with school uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/ghana-education:-over-8,000-school-uniforms-distributed-to-pupils-of-tarkwa-nsuaem-201102111143.html |title= Over 8,000 school uniforms distributed to pupils of Tarkwa Nsuaem |date= 10 February 2011 |work= The Ghanaian Chronicle |location= Accra |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120606164557/http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/ghana-education:-over-8,000-school-uniforms-distributed-to-pupils-of-tarkwa-nsuaem-201102111143.html |archivedate= 6 June 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hong Kong ==

[[File:Cheungsamuniform.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Cheongsam]] as School Uniform. Note- uniform is plain - markings are [[signatures]] of owner's classmates.]]
The vast majority of schools in the former British colony adopted uniforms similar to that of British schools, while Catholic schools in Hong Kong usually follow the tradition of  [[Catholic school uniform]]s. A number of older Christian girls' schools established before WWII, however, retain the heritage of using the Chinese [[cheongsam]] as their uniform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/hsc/evrev/cheungsam.htm|title=Evolution and revolution: Chinese dress 1700s-1990s - Cheungsam|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[St. Stephen's Girls' College]], [[True Light Middle School of Hong Kong|True Light Middle School]] and [[Heep Yunn School]]. [[Sailor suit]]s are also used as uniforms in some kindergartens for boys and girls, and secondary schools but for girls only, for example the [[Bishop Hall Jubilee School]] and [[New Method College]].

== India ==

[[File:Indian schoolgirls.jpg|thumb|upright|Schoolgirls in Delhi, India. As seen here, Indian schoolgirls can have uniform of both shirt and skirt, as well as ''[[shalwar kameez]]''.]]
Uniforms are compulsory in India in both public and private schools. The boys' uniforms are often made of a light-coloured shirt, long trousers usually blue, white or black, and those of the girls are often a shirt and a skirt. At the state level, the secondary schools are required to use a [[Shalwar Kameez]]. This is not compulsory but they do have certain specific dress code.

Many schools require students to wear shoes, ties and ID cards, and comb their hair down and keep it clean and short. Long hair is tied in braids. Uniform is one of the most important components of school life and is taken very seriously in India.

Some institutions also require the use of a tie, especially the schools run by [[Christian]] missionaries, and the Indian government does not prohibit the children to have religious symbols, so the [[Muslim]] girls can wear the veil (hijab) ([[burqa|burka]]) and [[Sikh]] boys a [[turban]] in addition to the uniform. However, most of the schools, whether public or private, prohibit students to have a ponytail or dyed hair.

== Indonesia ==

In [[Indonesia]], school uniforms are mandatory for every student. They can be simply described as below for each stage of education:
[[File:Anak SD di Ciwidey.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|An elementary school student.]]
* Primary schools or ''Sekolah Dasar'' (''SD'') students wear a white short-sleeve shirt with red shorts for male students, and below-knee skirts for females.
* Lower secondary schools or ''Sekolah Menengah Pertama'' (''SMP'') require navy blue shorts or trousers with a short-sleeve white shirt for male students. Females wear a below-knee-length or long navy blue skirt and short-sleeve white shirt.
* Upper secondary schools ''Sekolah Menengah Atas'' (''SMA'') require blue-grey trousers with a short-sleeve white shirt. Females wear a below-knee-length or long blue-grey skirt, and wear short-sleeve or long-sleeve white shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pendidikan.jogja.go.id/index.php?pilih=hal&amp;id=9|title=Republic of Indonesia Ministry of Education: School Uniforms|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Public schools in Indonesia tolerate religious freedoms. For example, [[Muslim]] girls may opt to wear long-sleeve shirts, longer skirts, and [[jilbab]] to cover their heads. Most schools in Indonesia also have a [[batik]] uniform, usually worn on Thursday or Friday. This kind of uniform consists of a batik short-sleeve or long-sleeve shirt, with long or short trousers for SMA and below-knee or long skirts for females. The motifs and colours of batik depend on the school. Some schools tend to issue neckties and/or vests for their students. These neckties and vests may vary from school to school in colour and sewing pattern, even among public schools.

Nowadays, with the increase of private schools in Indonesia, most private schools have their own signature school uniform. Most consist of shirts with shorts or trousers for males, and skirts for females, only with differences on the colour.

Every school has its own standard grooming. Males are not allowed to have long hair. Accessories are also normally prohibited for males, except for watches. Females are usually allowed to use simple accessories such as watches, earrings, and sometimes bracelets. All students are prohibited from colouring their hair or having tattoos.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Wearing nail polish is usually not allowed.

Most schools pay attention to the shoes that can be worn. Black or white sneakers with white laces are the most common shoes. Few higher-level students, such as in ''SMA'' or ''SMK'', are normally required to wear black leather shoes.

The school badge is usually put on the right sleeve of a shirt, consist of school's name and location, and some have their own school's logo. Others prefer to wear the school's logo as a lapel or breast plastic or metal pin. The emblem of OSIS (''Organisasi Siswa Intra Sekolah''), or School's Intern Student Organization, is put on the shirt's left pocket. Students' names are usually on the right side of the shirt and embedded by sewing, ironing or as a detachable badge. Some schools (usually "SMP" and "SMA") distinguish the grade of their students by stripes on the official neckties issued or an emblem below the school emblem (it can be stripes, chevrons or numbers). Nowadays some schools require the students to wear an Indonesian flag school badge sewn on top of their left pocket. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The [[scouts]] (pramuka) uniform is used in many schools in Indonesia at least once a week. It consists of light-brown short-sleeve or long-sleeve shirts, with dark-brown shorts or trousers, and below-knee skirts or longer for females. The common day to wear the scout uniform usually falls on Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday. Furthermore, on certain occasions (usually on ceremonies or competitions), the uniform should be worn as full dress, with red and white scarf/necktie, dark brown beret, rope, dagger and scout's stick.

The scout uniform has two breast pockets. Above right pocket is the student's name. The [[Gerakan Pramuka Indonesia]] (Indonesian Scout Movement) logo is sewn on the left pocket (for male students). On the right sleeve there are scouting organization's location, number and logo, while on the left sleeve usually are the student's scouting team logo and chevrons denoting his/her grade. Male students wear International Scout Organization logo above their name and female students on their lapel.

== Israel ==

According to former Education Minister [[Limor Livnat]], about 1,400 Israeli public schools require pupils to wear uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/QA.jhtml?qaNo=111 Israel QA File news, Israel diplomatic map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403111140/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/QA.jhtml?qaNo=111 |date=2009-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

School uniforms used to be the norm in the state's early days, but have since fallen out of favour. However, in recent years, the number of schools using school uniforms has been increasing once more. Many teachers, parents and students are in favour of returning the school uniform to common use to prevent the deepening of the gap between affluent children and those less well-off. Nowadays school uniforms are mainly associated with "national religious" schools within the [[Education in Israel|Israeli system of education]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Zvi Zameret, [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Modern%20History/Israel%20at%2050/Fifty%20Years%20of%20Education%20in%20the%20State%20of%20Israel ''Fifty Years of Education in the State of Israel''], Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 14 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Schools for [[Arab citizens of Israel]]  also frequently require uniforms: for girls, it is often a [[pinafore]] to be worn over trousers and shirt.

In the [[Haredi]] or ultra-Orthodox school system, uniforms are compulsory in essentially all girls' schools. In the vast majority of these, the style adopted by the [[Bais Yaakov|Beit Ya'akov]] network is used: a sky-blue, button-down, open-collar, loose-fitting blouse with an Oxford-blue, pleated skirt which comes to just below the knee and dark stockings. In cold weather, a Yale-blue sweater may be added. A small fraction of schools alter the color scheme to pink and burgundy, while otherwise retaining the same overall appearance. In boys' schools there is usually not an identifiable school uniform, distinct from what is considered acceptable for ordinary street wear. However, the standards of acceptable street wear for boys and men in Haredi communities are so precise and exacting that in almost all cases all of the boys in a particular school will be dressed identically.

In non-Haredi schools today, school uniforms in Israel consist only of a shirt with the school logo. In the summer, the uniform shirt is a simple T-shirt, while in the winter, the shirts worn are warm or hooded sweaters. Although the shirts are uniform, they usually come in various colours, and allow students to customise and express themselves even while wearing a uniform. The shirts sell for a very small amount of money, so that even the less well-off can acquire them.

== Italy ==

In Italy, school uniforms are uncommon, partially because child uniforms are associated with the era of [[Benito Mussolini]] before World War II when children were placed according to their age into [[Italian Fascist]] youth movements and had to wear uniforms inside and outside school.

However, until the early 1960s many high schools required girls to wear black ''grembiule'' (resembling a doctor smock) on top of their clothes: no uniform was required for boys. Perhaps this was because at one time high schools were the only public schools to admit both sexes (as opposed to junior schools and elementary), and girls may be required to "cover up" not to distract their male counterparts. Indeed, this policy was highly disputed during the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s and later abolished.

Nowadays, many pre-schools advise parents to dress their children with a ''grembiulino'', i.e., a small ''grembiule'', usually shorter and more colourful, that can be purchased cheaply.

Some elementary schools advise some kind of ''grembiule'' for the younger pupils. Sometimes girls are required to wear a pink or white ''grembiulino'', while boys may be required to wear a short cotton jacket, usually blue or black. In other cases both boys and girls may be required to wear a more neutral blue ''grembiule''.

Some parents send their children to school in a ''grembiule'' even if the school does not require it.

Poet and children's writer [[Gianni Rodari]] has described adult life as "a school without ''grembiule'' and school desk".&lt;ref&gt;[http://tuttomio.splinder.com/post/10825033/la+scuola+dei+grandi "la scuola dei grandi"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716120550/http://tuttomio.splinder.com/post/10825033/la+scuola+dei+grandi |date=2011-07-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the Italian chapter of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] warned that synthetic ''grembiuli'' were harmful to pupils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=47573 "WWF: attenti ai tessuti di grembiuli e abitini per bambini"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821185319/http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=47573# |date=2006-08-21 }}, ''VITA'' magazine, 13 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008 Education Minister Mariastella Gelmini proposed the re-introduction of the compulsory smock in public schools, provoking a debate in the Italian press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency= Associated Press |url= http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=6137276 |title= Students Protest as Italian Senate Passes Reforms |work=ABC News |location =New York |date=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Japan ==
{{main article|Japanese school uniform}}

[[file:制服 (5346443876).jpg|thumb|[[Arashiyama]] schoolgirls in [[loose socks]]]]
Japan introduced school uniforms in the late 19th century. Today, school uniforms are almost universal in the public and private school systems. They are also used in some women's colleges. The Japanese word for uniform is {{Nihongo|''seifuku''|制服}}.

In the majority of elementary schools, students are not required to wear a uniform to school. Where they are required, many boys wear white shirts, short trousers, and caps. Young boys often dress more formally in their class pictures than they do other days of the school year. Girls' uniforms might include a grey pleated skirt and white blouse. Occasionally the sailor outfit is used for girls. The uniform codes may vary by season to work with the environment and occasion. It is common for  boys and girls to wear brightly coloured caps to prevent traffic accidents. It is normal for uniforms to be worn outside of school areas. However, this is going out of fashion and many students are wearing casual dress.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The Japanese junior- and senior-high-school uniform traditionally consists of a [[Gakuran|military style]] for boys and a [[Japanese school uniform#Sailor outfit|sailor outfit]] for girls. These uniforms are based on [[Meiji era]] formal military dress, themselves modeled on European-style naval uniforms. The sailor outfit replace the undivided [[hakama]] (andon bakama 行灯袴) designed by [[Utako Shimoda]] between 1920 and 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyogo-c.ed.jp/~kaibara-hs/gaiyo/100nen/33.htm|title=制服でたどる百年|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this style is still in use, many schools have moved to more Western-pattern [[parochial school]] uniform styles. They consist of a white shirt, tie, [[blazer]] or [[sweater vest]] with school crest, and tailored trousers (often not of the same colour as the blazer or sweater vest) for boys and a white blouse, tie, blazer with school crest, and [[tartan]] skirt for girls.

Much like the male uniform, the [[gakuran]], the sailor outfit bears a similarity to military-styled [[naval]] uniforms. The uniform generally consists of a [[blouse]] attached with a sailor-style collar and a [[pleat]]ed [[skirt]]. There are seasonal variations for summer and winter: sleeve length and fabric are adjusted accordingly. A ribbon is tied in the front and laced through a loop attached to the blouse. Several variations on the ribbon include [[necktie]]s, [[bolo tie]]s, [[neckerchief]]s, and bows. Common colours are navy blue, white, grey, light green and black.
[[File:ギリギリ短 (15580964194).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kogal]] culture: [[Miniskirt]] used as school uniform in Japan, including during winter season.]]

Shoes, socks, and other accessories are sometimes included as part of the uniform. The socks are typically navy or white. The shoes are typically brown or black [[penny loafer]]s. Although not part of the prescribed uniform, alternate forms of legwear (such as [[loose socks]], knee-length stockings, or similar) are commonly matched by more fashionable girls with their sailor outfits.

Regardless of what type of uniform any particular school assigns its students, all schools have a summer version (usually consisting of a white dress shirt and dark slacks for boys and a reduced-weight traditional uniform or blouse and tartan skirt with tie for girls) and a sports-activity uniform (a polyester track suit for year-round use and a T-shirt and shorts for summer activities). Depending on the discipline level of their school, students may wear seasonal and activity uniforms in the same classroom during the day. Students may attempt to subvert the system of uniforms by wearing them incorrectly or by adding prohibited elements such as large [[loose socks]] or badges.

Miniskirts have been very popular in Japan, where they became part of school uniforms, and they came to be worn within the [[Kogal]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2003/11/12/business/man-who-gave-us-loose-white-socks-eyes-comeback/|title=Man who gave us loose white socks eyes comeback|first=Taiga|last=Uranaka|date=12 November 2003|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|via=Japan Times Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/japans-schoolgirls-set-the-trend-1295844.html|title=Japan's schoolgirls set the trend|date=23 November 1997|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lebanon ==

In Lebanon, all private schools require uniforms. Most of the uniforms are made of a skirt, a shirt, and a pull-over for girls, and for boys it's made of trousers, a shirt, and a pull-over.
Some public schools there do not require school uniforms.

== Malaysia ==
{{main article|Malaysian school uniform}}
In [[Malaysia]], school uniforms ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Pakaian Seragam Sekolah'') are compulsory for all students who attend public schools. Western-style school uniforms were introduced to present-day Malaysia in the late 19th century during the British colonial era. The present design was standardised beginning in January 1970. Today, school uniforms are almost universal in the public and private school systems.

The uniforms at Malaysian public schools are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia 1997. ''Surat Pekeliling lkhtisas Bil. 3/1983 - Pakaian Seragam Murid-murid Sekolah''. Retrieved 4 June 2007. Available online at http://www.pibg.net.my/pekeliling.e.php&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Malaysia Primary School Girls.jpg|thumb|Malaysian school girls in tunics]]

Students are required to wear white socks and white shoes with the above uniform. For modesty reasons, most schools require female students who wear the [[baju kurung]] to wear a plain-coloured [[camisole]] underneath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabah.edu.my/smkperempuan_sdk/peraturan_sekolah.pdf SMK Perempuan Sandakan.

In addition to these, schools usually have badges which must be sewn or ironed on to the uniform &amp;mdash; generally at the left chest. Some schools require students to sew their name tags in addition to the badge. For upper forms, students generally have to wear a school-specific tie, except those who are wearing the baju kurung.

In Malaysia, Muslim girls tend to wear the baju kurung. Most of them start wearing a white ''tudung'' (Malaysian version of the Muslim headscarf or hijab) upon entering secondary school, for religious reasons. Non-Muslim girls tend to wear the pinafore. Some non-Muslim girls wear the baju kurung.
[[File:Sandakan Sabah School-boys-in-their-school-uniform-01.jpg|thumb|left|Malaysian secondary school boys uniform.]]
Muslim boys may wear [[baju melayu]] at school on Fridays, often with a [[songkok]] hat, to be dressed for going to the mosque for prayers at lunchtime.

Girls who choose to wear the pinafore, especially those attending co-ed schools, usually wear shorts under their pinafore to allow for carefree movement as the skirt only covers up to the knee. Those who wear the baju kurung tend not to wear shorts under their long skirt as their skirt covers their legs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

[[Neckties]] are often worn by prefects, class monitors, librarians, and other students of rank. Some schools have neckties as standard issue; even then, the neckties are generally reserved for school events and public appearances, and are not part of the everyday school uniform. The tropical climate makes them uncomfortable.

The [[hairstyle]] of students is given attention by schools and the Ministry of Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pibg.net.my/pekeliling.e.php Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia 1997. ''Surat Pekeliling lkhtisas Bil. 2/1976 - Potongan Rambut Murid-murid']'. Retrieved 5 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Schools do not allow students to colour their hair. For boys, there is usually a maximum length allowed, for example, the hair must be a few centimetres above the collar, and no sideburns are allowed. Violation of boys' hair regulations is often punished with a [[caning]]; some offer the alternative of an enforced haircut at the school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/mysc9808.htm "Students get a trimming from their peers"], ''The Star'', Kuala Lumpur, 12 August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[hair gel]] is prohibited in some of the stricter schools, to prevent excessive hairdressing. Girls' long hair must be properly tied up, often into a [[ponytail]]. Some schools dictate the colour and type of hair accessories that can be used. Some prohibit even girls from having long hair. Wearing [[make up]] in school is prohibited.

Schools usually enforce their uniform code thoroughly, with regular checks by teachers and prefects. Students who fail to comply may be warned, given demerit points, publicly punished, sent home from school, or [[School corporal punishment|caned]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.ppk.kpm.my/article.cfm?id=110 Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia 2003.

== Mauritius ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
School uniforms in Mauritius are generally compulsory. Mauritius being a former British colony, has been using the system from back then. The students have to wear uniforms from primary school until higher secondary level. However, there are a few private schools that are based on the French system and do not require the student to wear school uniform.

== Mexico ==

In Mexico, students from all public (and most private) schools are required to wear uniform (except on special days and/or occasions like holidays in which the school allows students to wear normal clothing rather than the uniform). The uniforms have the school's logo and colors. Most Mexican schools have 2 types of uniforms; one for P.E. and another for regular school days. Uniforms usually consist of the following (but may vary by school):
* '''Regular''' 
** '''Boys'''
*** Polo shirt
**** Vest or sweater
**** Cloth pants
**** Socks
**** Shoes
** '''Girls'''
*** Polo shirt
*** Vest or sweater
*** Pleated skirt (plaid most of the time)

* '''P.E.'''
Note: The uniform is unisex most of the time.
* Polo or shirt
** Hoodie or sweater
** Athletic pants, socks and sneakers

== New Zealand ==

Traditionally, many New Zealand [[Middle school|intermediate]] and [[high school]]s, and [[state-integrated school|state-integrated]] and private [[primary school]]s, have followed the British system of school uniforms,&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Webster, [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/cos/2008/00000042/00000001/art00012 "New Zealand School Uniforms in the Era of Democracy: 1965 to 1975"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024010817/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/cos/2008/00000042/00000001/art00012 |date=2012-10-24 }} in ''Costume'', Volume 42, Number 1, 2008 , pp. 169-183 (15).&lt;/ref&gt; although it is common in state schools for the boy's uniform to have a jersey and grey [[short trousers]] rather than a blazer with tie and long trousers. This usually consists of a variety of the following apparel: for boys, a business-style shirt with an official school tie, and long or short trousers; and for girls, a blouse, and a plain and/or [[Plaid (pattern)|plaid]] (usually [[tartan]]) skirt, and in some schools, especially in the [[South Island]], kilts. Both sexes wear an 'official' school jersey. Blazers and jackets are of varied colours according to the school - dark or light blue, grey, crimson, scarlet, green or black. Some follow the British practice of having contrasting colours edging the lapels and jacket fronts. Caps have generally been discarded since the 1970s but in many primary schools there is a compulsory broad-brimmed floppy hat, in the school colours, to help prevent sunburn. Where short trousers are worn, boys are usually required to wear long dark socks, which may require garters to hold them up.&lt;ref&gt;Pictured at [http://histclo.com/Schun/hist/schun-hist.html The History of School Uniforms].&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1990 an increasing number of school include sandals as the standard summer footwear.

During the 1980s and 1990s there was a tendency for the traditional uniform to be replaced by cheaper and more 'modern' options: [[polo shirt]]s,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://www.lphs.school.nz/files/Uniform.pdf Uniform rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529200611/http://www.lphs.school.nz/files/Uniform.pdf |date=2009-05-29 }} at Logan Park High School.&lt;/ref&gt; [[polar fleece]] tops, or a complete doing away with uniforms in favour of mufti. Intermediate schools usually provide the option of skirts or culottes for girls and sometimes shorts while boys will wear shorts. Bike shorts or tights are sometimes worn under girls' skirts and dresses.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Some high schools have introduced trousers as an option for girls instead of skirts, however demand is low with several [[Christchurch]] high schools estimating only 1% of girls at their respective schools wear trousers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/fashion/6020025/Are-school-uniforms-too-short |title= Are school uniforms too short? |work= [[Stuff.co.nz]] |first= Jane |last= Dunbar |date= 24 November 2011 |accessdate= 15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school uniforms are compulsory in most schools in Pakistan. Both the public and the private schools have mandated uniforms. Boys uniforms are often made of a light-coloured shirt, long trousers usually brown or blue. The girls often wear Shalwar Qameez suit or in some schools shirt and skirt.

==Philippines==

School uniforms ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''uniporme'' or ''kasuotang pampaaralan'', "school attire"), much like Mexico, are commonplace in public schools and required in private schools. In some private schools, there are specified days when students can wear civilian clothing, typically in special occasions like a holiday or last day of school. There is usually no uniform in universities and progressive schools except for uniforms used in P.E classes, and in specific schools such as the [[University of Santo Tomas]].

Public school uniforms for primary levels are typically white, short-sleeved, buttoned-up shirts, with long skirts for girls and light brown knee-length trousers for boys. Uniforms for public high schools and private schools vary widely in pattern and colour, but most often are in the official school  colours. Muslim girls in some higher institutions are often required to wear a white [[hijab]] versus other colours. Some school uniforms in the Philippines can bare resemblance to Japanese school uniforms 

The material for these usually loose uniforms is often light and suited to the country's tropical climate (e.g. cotton).

This was to allow poorer families to save money for basic needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deped.gov.ph/index.php/issuances/deped-orders/2008/document/dos200846pdf?limit=20&amp;format=raw&amp;start=20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080603-140499/DepEd-No-more-uniforms-for-public-school-students&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poland ==

School uniforms are not compulsory in Poland and absent from the vast majority of Polish schools. The idea of school uniforms in Poland did not exist before the early 20th century. In the [[People's Republic of Poland]], uniform ceased to be compulsory in most schools during the 1980s due to economic issues. Since then, there has been made only one effort to reintroduce uniform into Polish schools - by the former minister of education [[Roman Giertych]], in 2006. It was then decided that school uniform would not be enforced by the state onto the whole country, but would be a matter decided upon by the [[head teacher|principal]] of each school respectively. Initially this was meant to permit only a [[dress code]], but this was later modified in 2007 to address school uniform. From 2007, all [[primary school]]s and [[Gimnazjum#Countries with gymnasium schools|middle schools]] were to enforce compulsory uniform, whilst [[Liceum#Poland|high schools]] and other forms of further education were given the choice to decide on their own. The appearance of school uniform was decided upon locally, which meant that "uniform" in most schools consisted of a jacket or shirt only - selected by the school management purely to avoid breaking regulations (the rest of clothing was still up to the students to decide). By mid-2008, compulsory school uniforms were repealed and it remains so to this day.

== Republic of Ireland ==

In the [[Republic of Ireland]], almost all primary and secondary schools require the wearing of a compulsory uniform. These can vary from school to school but for the most part include a trousers for males and a skirt or pinafore for female students a shirt a jumper and a necktie. In recent years many schools offer the option of trousers also for female students. Some schools require blazers rather than jumpers. Some primary schools now let their pupils wear a school tracksuit rather than a formal uniform.

In recent years there has been criticism, including by the [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education]] of the requirement a school uniform jumper must have the school crest or name imprinted onto it and of the practice, where a schools uniform can only be bought from a certain supplier, which can markedly increase the price of a uniform. As well as rules regarding the wearing of a uniform many schools have regulations regarding hair, footwear, the growth of facial hair for males, the wearing of makeup and the length of school skirts. Since the late 90s students are no longer required to wear uniform during state examinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/department-issues-guidelines-on-wearing-of-uniforms-for-exams-1.26079|title=Department issues guidelines on wearing of uniforms for exams|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-09-24|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russia ==
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet period]], a standardised "universal" school uniform was worn by all schools. Originally of a military style with peaked cap and high collared tunic, by the 1980s boys wore a functional dark blue pattern with shoulder patches identifying the school. For formal occasions such as the first day of term, girls wore white lace collars and aprons dating back to the reign of [[Catherine the Great]]. During the initial post Soviet period from 1994 to 2013, the mandatory uniform policy was abandoned and pupils generally wore casual clothing such as jeans, T-shirts and sweaters. However, uniforms were reintroduced under a new education law in September 2013.&lt;ref name="one-europe.info"&gt;http://one-europe.info/school-uniform-the-russian-experience&lt;/ref&gt; Among the supporters of the new uniform law of 2013, arguments included tackling social inequality, but also putting an end to the controversial problem of whether school students are allowed to wear traditional religious clothing to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tass.ru/en/opinions/762985|title=Mandatory school uniform stages comeback in Russia|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each school can now choose its own uniform.&lt;ref name="one-europe.info"/&gt;. Also, there are many instances in which schools do not enforce the rules on school uniform

== South Africa ==

[[File:Carl Redelinghuis Sentrum.jpg|thumb|Typical example of an assembly in a South African school. All students are in uniform, with a sharp difference between the sexes.]]
[[File:Gr 12A Feb 2013.JPG|thumb|left|Students of [[Sinenjongo High School]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]].]]
As in many other former British colonies, all South African private and public schools have a uniform, and it is compulsory in all public schools and in the vast majority of private schools for children above pre-school level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southafrica.info/services/education/edufacts.htm#21 "A parent's guide to schooling"], SouthAfrica.info.&lt;/ref&gt; Uniform types vary less between public and private schools than they do across regions, where schools in more rural areas tend to forgo the daily wearing of ties and/or blazers for boys and girls regardless of their public or private nature. However, many of these same schools will have a "number ones" uniform for special occasions which include such items. In cities such as Cape Town, on the other hand, it is more common to see formal apparel required in public and private schools on a daily basis.

Many schools across South Africa also provide the choice between a summer and winter uniform, with khaki uniforms and brown shoes being very common in the summer. South African law has not required gender neutrality in school dress codes and a distinction between girls' and boys' uniforms remains. Boys of all ages are normally required to wear grey or khaki long or [[short trousers]] with socks, and the socks are usually long when worn with shorts, as in the illustration (right). Until recently, the straw boater was a common accessory in affluent public and private high schools, although these have now become optional in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/rules2.htm#zaschools Picture of senior high school boys in blazers, short trousers and straw boaters].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all schools, public or fee paying, have sports' kits (uniforms) that require bare feet for health reasons, regardless of the season.

== South Korea ==
{{Main article|Korean school uniform}}
[[File:Jin Jung-seon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|South Korean school uniform]]
Almost all South Korean [[Education in South Korea#Secondary education|secondary]] students wear a uniform called "''gyobok''" ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 교복, 校服). The majority of elementary schools, except some private ones, do not have uniforms; however, the uniform is strictly monitored from the start of middle school and up. Based on Western-style ones, the South Korean uniform usually consists of a shirt, blazer and tie, with skirts for girls and trousers for boys.

More recently, the uniform is often worn by celebrities who target the younger, teen audience to sell entertainment products. The school uniform and school setting is frequently used as a venue for romance. As a result, the uniform has become something akin to an expression of fashion among students.

Name tags that are worn usually have different colors per grade. Oftentimes the writing is in black or white, whereas the background is colored.

== Spain ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
In Spain the use of school uniforms is not compulsory in the public school at any stage. Their use depends on school councils involving parents. However, it is customary to wear uniforms in private schools, where typically girls wear uniform shirt and jersey skirt and boys wear white shirt and tie and sometimes jacket.

== Sri Lanka ==
It is mandatory for Sri Lankan school students to wear a uniform regardless of them attending a government, semi-government or private school. In most government and semi-government schools, boys will wear a short-sleeved white shirt and a navy blue short when they are in the junior grades. This will later transition to white shorts and then to white trousers towards the latter part of the school life. A tie is not always worn, but may be worn for special school events along with a long-sleeved shirt. Proper black dress shoes and socks are also a part of this uniform. Certain schools also require the uniform to have the school's insignia stitched to a corner of the pocket of the shirt.

Girls who attend government and semi-government schools will wear a white one-piece dress. This may or may not have sleeves. Certain schools make wearing a tie mandatory for girls and some may have a plastic badge or the school's insignia stitched to the dress. Proper dress shoes and socks are mandatory in most schools.

On special occasions, students who bear a post in a sports team, club or association, would wear a blazer which would normally be white and having accents based on the school colors.

In privately run schools, the suit is very similar but the colors might differ. They range from khaki and dark green to bright blue.

== Taiwan ==

As Taiwan experienced a long period of Japanese colonial rule, it is influenced by Japanese culture and the uniform style can be said to be close. However the school uniforms in the two regions are not identical.

There are a total of 471 Taiwanese high schools. All schools have two sets of uniforms, a summer uniform and an uniform for winter. According to the provisions, sportswear is worn.

'''Summer'''

Primary school：White short pants and shirts are most common for the boys, while girls will wear a pleated skirt

Secondary school：Males wear short-sleeved shirts with shorts. Females wear shirts with pleated skirts or skirt pants. Some schools have sailor uniforms.

High school：Short sleeved shirts with long pants for males, pleated skirts or shorts for females in public schools; private schools will always have skirts

'''Winter'''

Long pants and long sleeved shirts are worn in most schools.

In the past, many schools had khaki uniforms but this has been phased out with the exception of a few schools.

== Thailand ==
:{{Main article|School uniforms in Thailand}}
:: ''{{wikisource-inline|Student Uniform Act, BE 2551 (2008)}}''
[[File:ปัจฉิมโรงเรียนศรีวิชัยวิทยา 01.jpg|thumb|Students in [[Thailand]].]]
Uniforms are compulsory for all students with very few variations from the standard model throughout the public and private school systems, including colleges and universities.

The dress code in primary and secondary grades for boys comprises dark blue, khaki, or black shorts with a white open-collar short-sleeved shirt, white ankle socks or long dark socks, and brown or black trainers. Female students, wear a knee-length dark blue or black skirt, and a pale white blouse with a loosely hanging bow tie. The bow tie is dropped in favour of an open-necked pale blue shirt from Matthayom 4.

The girls' uniform is complemented by white ankle socks and black school shoes. The student's name, number, and name of the school are often embroidered on the blouse or shirt. Some independent or international schools have uniforms more closely resembling British school uniform standards, and boys in senior high school grades may be allowed to wear long trousers. The standard dress for children in kindergarten is a red skirt and white blouse for girls, and red short trousers and a white shirt for boys. In all Thai schools, one day per week, usually Wednesday, is dedicated to scouting, when beige scout uniforms for boys and dark green guide uniforms are the rule, both wearing yellow neckerchiefs.

The hairstyle of students is also given attention by schools and the Ministry of Education. Males are not allowed to have long hair. Some prohibit even girls from having long hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asiancorrespondent.com/95321/thailand-whats-hair-got-to-do-with-childrens-rights/ |title=Thailand: What has hair got to do with children's rights? |author= Saksith Saiyasombut &amp; Siam Voices  |date=13 January 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oknation.net/blog/print.php?id=165611 |script-title=th:เผด็จการเนียน ๆ ในโรงเรียน |author= "หนึ่งลมหายใจ" |date= November 2007 |accessdate=7 February 2013|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of accessories is prohibited for males, while females are sometimes allowed to use simple accessories. Some schools dictate the colour and type of hair accessories that females can use. All students are prohibited from colouring their hair or having tattoos on any part of the body.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Thailand however has a few international schools which do not require uniforms.

== Tonga ==

In Tonga all schools require a uniform. Uniforms are usually in the colours of their respective churches and Red for Government Schools. Catholic schools are usually light blue, Wesleyan (Royal Blue), Anglican (Navy Blue) and LDS Schools (Green). A [[Ta'ovala]] bordered with school colours and a tupenu are usually worn by boys with a white button-up shirt. Primary school students usually wear shorts and a white button up shirt. Nearly all Tongan secondary schools require girls to wear a pinafore dress with a white shirt except for Catholic schools which allow a striped blouse and skirt. Students are usually required to wear Roman sandals in English-medium schools and thongs in most other schools.

== Turkey ==

[[File:08913-Perspective Run.jpg|thumb|Turkish school uniforms.]]

School uniforms were used in all public and private institutions. There were several exceptions and most kindergartens did not require school uniforms. The uniforms varied in their appearance; primary schools used one-piece blue uniforms, while in secondary and high schools boys wore dark grey trousers with white shirts, jackets and a tie. Girls had skirts and shirts coloured like the boys' uniform, plus a tie. Most private institutions have their own uniforms. School uniforms for primary schools were black until the 1990s. None of the universities or higher-education institutes have uniforms.

School uniforms abolished in 2012 and schools gave an poll to families to select uniform or casual cloths. Dress code says that students' shoulder should be covered, girls cannot wear leggings or miniskirts. This caused a controversy in Western cities since some students were wearing mini's, shorts and leggings. New law says that students can wear hijabs at school but it's prohibited to wear makeup, tattoos, piercings, dye ın hair etc.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

School uniforms have a long history in Turkey. They were first introduced because normal clothing would give hints about the child's family's economic situation. In order to prevent groupings amongst children from different social classes, uniforms were accepted.

However, school uniforms were officially abolished on 27 November 2012, when the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Turkish Ministry of Education]] suddenly abolished the nationwide uniform requirement in schools (international/foreign schools are excluded) and lifted the headscarf ban for religious imam-hatip schools, prompting fierce criticism from opposition parties, unions and educators. Opponents claim that economic differences cause pedagogical traumas for children and that permitting headscarves harms secular education. Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] defended the move, saying education in uniform has drawn complaints for many years. But students attending minority schools (Greeks, Jews and Armenians), which are also part of the Turkish Ministry of Education, have been excluded from this change, and are still required to wear school uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/145198/obligatory-school-uniforms-abolished-amid-criticisms.html "Obligatory School Uniforms Abolished amid Criticisms"]. ''Hürriyet Daily News''. 28 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Arab Emirates ==

Uniforms are compulsory in many schools across the United Arab Emirates.

In June 2013, the Abu Dhabi Education Council standardised the uniforms for pupils in public school across Abu Dhabi. [http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/education/abu-dhabi-school-pupils-wear-a-whole-new-look-1.1380600]  Earlier, each school had its own uniform. 
Uniforms include options for varying weather conditions. [http://www.adec.ac.ae/en/MediaCenter/Pages/Downloads.aspx]
Boys in Kindergarten and Cycle 1 (Grades 1 to 5) can wear either a long-sleeved shirt and trousers or a short-sleeved shirt and shorts. Tie, winter blazer, and cardigan are optional.
Boys in Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 (Grades 6 to 12) wear a [[kandoora]] (traditional white robe) and [[ghetra]] (head scarf). Pullover sweater or blazer are optional
Girls in Kindergarten or Cycle 1 (Grades 1 to 5) wear a long sleeved shirt with either a school dress or skirt. Cardigan, blazer, and scarf are optional.
Girls in Cycle 2 or 3 (Grades 6 to 12) wear a long sleeved shirt with a choice of a skirt or two different styles of dress plus a scarf. Cardigan or blazer are optional. These are only for the schools with the Arabic curriculum, not the other schools.

Private schools in the UAE require a school uniform. It can range from a T-shirt or a simple white/black polo bearing the school logo to a more complete uniform with a button up shirt worn with a skirt, shorts or trousers. In the British schools, there is a blouse and either a skirt or trousers for the girls or a button up shirt with trousers. Shirts bear the school logo. Certain schools have certain codes on the use of makeup (some don't condone it at all) and the sporting of bracelets/jewellery.

== United Kingdom ==
While school uniform is common in the United Kingdom, there is no legislation enforcing it in any of the three separate legal jurisdictions of England &amp; Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, and enforcement of school uniform policy and dress codes is generally for individual schools to determine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCourt|first1=Laura|title=School Uniform Policy in Scotland, England, Wales and the Republic of Ireland briefing paper 48/13|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/globalassets/documents/raise/publications/2013/education/4813.pdf|website=Northern Ireland Assembly|publisher=Northern Ireland Assembly Research and Information Service|accessdate=9 November 2015|date=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, schools do have to take into account Equality legislation in dress policies to prevent discrimination on grounds such as age, sex, race, disability, religion or belief and sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The schools provisions of the Act|url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/private-and-public-sector-guidance/education-providers/schools-guidance/introduction/schools-provisions-act|website=Equality and Human Rights Commission|publisher=EHRC|accessdate=9 November 2015|date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; School uniforms are required to be similar in cost for both boys and girls,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/514978/School_Uniform_Guidance.pdf|title=School uniform: Guidance for governing bodies, school leaders, school staff and local authorities|last=|first=|date=September 2013|website=education.gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be reasonably low cost, and to tolerate religious freedoms, e.g. allowing male Sikhs to wear turbans and female Muslims to wear headscarfs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/find_out/guides/2003/school_uniform/newsid_3181000/3181847.stm "School uniform"], ''CBBC Newsround'', retrieved on 28 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to ensure that policies are fair and non-discriminatory schools are expected to consult widely with staff, pupils, parents and governors when introducing or amending dress policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bircham Dyson Bell|title=School uniform policies and the Equality Act 2010|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=cc30c04f-9785-49ef-b0bd-c0f9b07904b7|website=Lexology|publisher=Globe Business Publishing|accessdate=9 November 2015|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== England ===

[[File:School uniforms GBR.jpg|thumb|English girls in modern school uniform.]]
{{Main article|School uniforms in England}}

In 2011, more than 90% of English secondary schools had a compulsory uniform.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jan/18/school-uniform-results&lt;/ref&gt; School uniforms were first introduced on a large scale{{fact|date=June 2018}} during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]].&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://histclo.com/schun/hist/schun-hist.html|title=The History of School Uniforms|publisher=Historical Boys Clothing|accessdate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uniforms of the time were referred as "bluecoats", as they consisted of long trench-coat-style jackets dyed blue. Blue was the cheapest available dye and showed humility amongst all children. The first school to introduce this uniform was [[Christ's Hospital]] in London (now in Sussex).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archivist.f2s.com/bsu/Blcoat.htm|title=Bluecoat Schools|publisher=Boys School Uniform |accessdate=28 August 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070708213229/http://www.archivist.f2s.com/bsu/Blcoat.htm |archivedate = 8 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Elementary Education Act 1870]] introduced free primary education for all children. The popularity of uniforms increased, and eventually most schools had a uniform.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; During this period most uniforms reflected the trends of the age, with boys wearing [[short trousers]] and blazers until roughly the age of puberty and then long trousers from about 14 or 15. Girls mainly wore [[blouse]]s, tunic dress and pinafores.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I{{cite web|url=http://www.objectlessons.org/ol/index.php?mod=PageMod.showComponent&amp;component_id=137|title=Victorian Girls' School Uniform|publisher=Object lessons|accessdate=28 August 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060427090834/http://www.objectlessons.org/ol/index.php?mod=PageMod.showComponent&amp;component_id=137 |archivedate = 27 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; worn together with a blouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.album1900.com/uk/0005_ukschooluniform/0005_ukschooluniforms_girls.php|title=School uniforms in the UK|publisher=Album 1900|language=English|accessdate=3 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021151611/http://www.album1900.com/uk/0005_ukschooluniform/0005_ukschooluniforms_girls.php#|archive-date=2016-10-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These uniforms continued until the 1950s when after the [[Education Act 1944|Butler reforms]] secondary education was made free and the school leaving age was raised to 15. These reforms encouraged schools to implement uniform codes which were similar to other schools. Distinct "summer" and "winter" uniforms were sometimes required, particularly for girls, for whom dresses were mandated for summer and gymslips for winter.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

In the 21st century, the typical primary school uniform is fairly casual while secondary school uniform is often formal. Uniform in primary school is generally a polo shirt or [[T-shirt]], a jumper with the school logo, and trousers or shorts or a skirt. The typical secondary school uniform is a blazer, white shirt or blouse, a tie, trousers or skirt, and black shoes. Some primary schools have more formal uniform, with tie and blazer, and for secondary schools to require only a jumper. Uniforms sometimes match the school colours, but are most commonly found in blue, black and grey.

=== Scotland ===
[[File:Schoolshorts.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A school uniform worn in Scotland – [[Marr College]] in [[Troon]] &lt;small&gt;(socks and shorts are not part of the uniform, pupils can wear either trousers or skirts and shorter socks)&lt;/small&gt;]]
[[Scottish law]] is not specific on the question of school uniform. Generally, the school must provide information on its policy on clothing and uniform and the Education Authority must provide written information on its general policy on wearing school uniform. Some Education Authorities do not insist on students wearing a uniform as a precondition to attending and taking part in curricular activities.&lt;ref name="Gourock High School"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gourockhigh.inverclyde.sch.uk/GetAsset.aspx?id=fAAxADYANAB8AHwARgBhAGwAcwBlAHwAfAA0AHwA0 |title=Authority Strategic Statement of Inverclyde Education Service |publisher=Gourock High School |accessdate=28 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314064212/http://gourockhigh.inverclyde.sch.uk/GetAsset.aspx?id=fAAxADYANAB8AHwARgBhAGwAcwBlAHwAfAA0AHwA0 |archivedate=March 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children cannot be disciplined for not wearing a uniform if their parents do not want their child to wear it. However, a child that simply refuses to wear the school uniform can be disciplined by the school if it thinks that academic or disciplinary problems might be caused by the refusal. Many schools do have a policy covering the wearing of school clothing. The policy may state that certain items must be worn and that other items cannot be worn, for example, jeans. Schools must take religious and cultural requirements into account when drawing up a school uniform policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Although the way that the uniforms are worn is usually not an issue, some state schools may have regulation on the subject (e.g. height of ties, whether the shirt is tucked in or not), the selection of clothes worn, whether they follow the policy, can be very strict. For example, in black and white uniform schools, wearing colours such as grey or wearing white shoes is forbidden. However, in schools that only use a basic uniform (e.g. jumper and trousers) the policy is often less strict.

=== Wales ===

The [[Welsh Assembly Government]] issued detailed guidance to governing bodies on uniform and appearance policies that begins by making explicit, "There is no education legislation specifically covering the wearing of school uniform or other aspects of appearance such as hair colour and style, and the wearing of jewellery and makeup. However, as part of its responsibility for the conduct of the school, a governing body can specify a uniform which pupils are required to wear and other rules relating to appearance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wales.gov.uk/dcells/publications/publications/guidanceandinformation/uniformandappearance/guidanceschooluniforme.pdf?lang=en Guidance to Governing Bodies on Uniform and Appearance Policies]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Welsh Government. 25 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Northern Ireland ===

The [[Northern Ireland Executive]] supports poor families with the cost of paying for school uniforms with a £35 primary school uniform allowance. This is claimed via local Education and Library Boards for parents in receipt of income support. At the end of August 2009, there were 24,135 successful applications for the grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/news/news-de/news-de-september-2009/news-de-150909-ruane-welcomes-new.htm | title = Ruane welcomes new uniforms for the new school term | date = 15 September 2009 | publisher = Northern Ireland Executive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common secondary school uniform in Northern Ireland is a shirt, blazer and sweater with a tie and a skirt or trousers. The uniform (most likely the sweater and tie) may change after Year 12. The uniform in primary school is similar to those used in the Republic of Ireland.

== United States ==
Most schools in the United States do not require uniforms, but instead enforce a [[dress code]] delineating what types of clothing are appropriate and inappropriate for students to wear to school. Dress codes vary from school to school, but are normally based on broader policies set by the school district's elected school board. Private schools and other specialized schools sometimes require uniforms.

A study conducted in 2000 found that only 23% of public, private, and sectarian schools had any sort of uniform policy in the United States at or before 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationbug.org/a/public-school-uniform-statistics.html|title=Public School Uniform Statistics - Education Bug|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade, more public schools, specifically those in urban areas, have instituted stricter dress codes; roughly half the public schools in the United States have these more limiting dress codes.&lt;ref&gt;http://nces.ed.gov/programs/crimeindicators/crimeindicators2011/tables/table_20_1.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The schools that do require uniforms, or a more common [[standardized|standard]] [[dress code]] in towns and suburbs, tend to be more casual than those in Britain or other commonwealth nations. Commonly, students wear collared, buttoned shirts, with a tie for boys and a tie for girls, worn with khaki trousers, and a belt, depending on the age of the school's student body. Skirts of a modest length are occasionally an option for girls.

For instance, red, white or blue polo shirts, with a logo, with navy or khaki bottoms and a belt, was the uniform policy imposed at Palmer Elementary School in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/25/us/dress-for-success-public-school-uniforms.html?pagewanted=3&amp;src=pm | work=The New York Times |title=Dress for Success: Public School Uniforms |date=25 September 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools may also have polo shirts and trousers as a uniform. Dress codes vary widely among private schools, although a [[Catholic school uniform]] tends to keep the shirt and tie.&lt;ref name="naesp.com"&gt;http://www.naesp.com/articles/American_school_uniforms.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2013, almost one fifth of all American schools required their students to wear uniforms (Flam). This 20 percent of schools requiring uniforms is six percent higher than in 2003, the U.S. Department of Education reported.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The uniform requirement is more common in lower socio-economic schools, where more than three-fourths of the school's student population receives free or reduced lunch ("Fast"). Forty-seven percent of low income schools require uniforms, whereas only about six percent of high socio-economic schools require uniforms ("Fast").{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Research studies and legislation ===

The National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) conducted a phone survey of 755 principals in 2000, which revealed that 21% of public schools had a uniform policy; 23% had firm plans to create one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationbug.org/a/public-school-uniform-statistics.html Public School Uniform Statistics]. Retrieved on 21 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this only accounts for those with school uniform policies and not for standardised dress codes, which provide for allowable student dress but are slightly more lax: For instance, instead of requiring everyone to wear the same shirt, or set of shirts, they may specify "any solid collared three-button polo/oxford shirt" and leave more specific details up to the parents. In 2007-2008, 55% of public school principals said their schools enforce a strict dress code, requiring students at least wear a collared shirt and trousers with an acceptable belt to school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=50 NCST Fast Facts - School Uniforms].

Adolfo Santos, a political science professor at the [[University of Houston–Downtown]], stated that many [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic communities in the United States]] choose uniforms because many immigrants originate from countries with schools requiring uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;Viren, Sarah.

Sylvan I. Alleyne, Velma LaPoint, Jennifer Lee and Harold W. Mitchell of ''[[The Journal of Negro Education]]'' stated that little empirical research exists regarding how effective school uniforms are in enhancing academic performance and social environments, and that little research exists regarding teachers' beliefs regarding issues related to dress codes, especially so regarding racial and ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Alleyne418"&gt;Alleyne et al 418&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, literature regarding public school student clothing and behavior cites anecdotal viewpoints from teachers. The literature discussed opinions on faculty, staff, and other employees on how to deal with student dress issues.&lt;ref name="Alleyne418419"&gt;Alleyne et al 418-419&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 article of ''The Journal of Negro Education'' said that research and reports regarding the beneficial impact of school uniforms was not conclusive. Despite the [[federal government of the United States]] issuing a set of guidelines encouraging school uniforms in public schools, as of 2003 political support varied.&lt;ref name="Alleyne419"&gt;Alleyne et al 419&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[Long Beach Unified School District]], in [[Southern California]], required school uniforms in all elementary and middle schools. This began a trend for uniforms in American [[Primary education|elementary]] public schools, especially in [[Urban area|urban]] school districts. [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] praised the idea in his 1996 [[State of the Union Address]], saying that "if it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms."[http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/New/other/sotu.html] The adoption of school- or district-wide uniform policies (or "standardised dress codes", less rigid than uniform requirements and allowing some leeway in parameters) has been motivated by a need to counter "[[gang signals|gang clothing]]" or the pressure for families to purchase upscale-label clothing (to avoid the ostracism of their children by "fashion cliques"), as well as to improve [[morale]] and [[school discipline]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The proportion of U.S. public schools requiring uniforms had increased from 3% in 1996 to 25% in 2010.

In [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Puerto Rico Department of Education|Department of Education]] requires all students to wear school uniforms, with only medical exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.de.gobierno.pr/dePortal/Descargas/REGLAMENTOCONDENSADO20042005.pdf VOLANTE SUPLETORIO REGLAMENTO GENERAL DE ESTUDIANTES DEL SISTEMA DE EDUCACIÓN PÚBLICA DE PUERTO RICO QUE DEROGA EL REGLAMENTO NÚMERO 5364 DE 17 DE ENERO DE 1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902053940/http://www.de.gobierno.pr/DEPortal/Descargas/REGLAMENTOCONDENSADO20042005.pdf |date=2009-09-02 }}," ''[[Puerto Rico Department of Education]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vietnam ==

Most schools in [[Vietnam]] requires uniform, and the rules on uniform vary from schools and areas. The most common type of uniform consists of a white shirt with school logo on left sleeve and navy/black trousers, with a [[red scarf]] for students from grade 3 to grade 9. This kind of uniform is often seen in public schools in North Vietnam or in rural areas, and there is no differences between boy's and girl's uniforms. However, many schools (private or famous public schools) have their own designed uniforms, which often replace trousers with skirts for girls or include bows, ties or vests/blazers.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of different school uniforms in Vietnam http://www.asiafinest.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=305508&amp;st=0&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KHAIGIANGLSTS.jpg|thumb|School uniforms of Lawrence S. Ting School in 7th District, [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Vietnam]]]]

The white [[áo dài]] is also a tradition uniform for high school girls in Vietnam, but most schools in [[Northern Vietnam]] only require it for important events or ceremonies, since wearing áo dài is uncomfortable for daily use. Otherwise, áo dài is very familiar with school girls in [[Mekong Delta]], where it is "daily uniform" of all them. The image of a high school girl with [[nón lá]] and white áo dài on a bike is still considered symbolic nowadays.

There are also uniform for [[Physical Education]] in Vietnam schools, usually includes T-shirt and [[tracksuit]], which the T-shirts have school logo on them. The tracksuit jacket is popular and often used as winter uniform, even out of gym activity.

There are no specific [[shoes]] for Vietnamese students, however flip-flops, slippers and high heels are forbidden. Sandals and boots are allowed, although students would wear sneakers or flats to school. [[Dyeing hair]], nail polish and make-up are banned in many schools.

== Venezuela ==

School uniforms are used in [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualcampuses.eu/index.php/Venezuela|title=Venezuela - Researching Virtual Initiatives in Education|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Venezuelan decree, uniforms are required at all schools in all grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ediplomat.com/np/post_reports/pr_ve.htm|title=Venezuela - Post Report - e Diplomat|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boys wear navy trousers and girls wear navy skirts or trousers, depending on the school. The shirts have short sleeves and the colour varies by the level in which the student is. Students in nursery wear yellow shirts, while students in kindergarten wear red shirts. From first to sixth grade, students wear white polo shirts. From seventh to ninth grade they wear light blue polo shirts, and from tenth to eleventh grade they wear beige polo shirts. These shirts are to be stuffed inside the trousers with a black belt. Black dress shoes are the norm in public school, however some private schools can be more flexible with the shoes to be worn.

Jones III]] concluded that intelligent design is not science and "cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents".&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#H.|''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', Conclusion]] (pages 136-138)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dover'' ruling also characterized "teaching the controversy" as part of a religious ploy.&lt;ref name="Establishment Clause Page 134"&gt;"has the effect of implicitly bolstering alternative religious theories of origin by suggesting that evolution is a problematic theory even in the field of science." . . . The effect of Defendants’ actions in adopting the curriculum change was to impose a religious view of biological origins into the biology course, in violation of the Establishment Clause. [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#Page 134 of 139|Conclusion, Page 134 of 139]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of phrase==
The term "teach the controversy" originated with [[Gerald Graff]], a professor of English and education at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]],&lt;ref name = Graff&gt;[http://insidehighered.com/views/2005/09/28/graff "To Debate or Not to Debate Intelligent Design?"] by Gerald Graff, Inside Higher Ed, September 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; as an admonition to teach that established knowledge is not simply given as a settled matter, but that it is created in a crucible of debate and controversy. To the chagrin of Graff, who describes himself as a liberal secularist,&lt;ref name = Graff /&gt; the idea was later appropriated by [[Phillip E. Johnson]], Discovery Institute program advisor and father of the ID movement. Discussing the 1999-2000 Kansas State Board of Education controversy over the teaching of intelligent design in public school classrooms, Johnson wrote "What educators in Kansas and elsewhere should be doing is to 'teach the controversy'." In his book Johnson proposed casting the conflicting points of view and agendas as a scholarly controversy. Johnson's usage differs somewhat from Graff's original concept. While Graff advocated that a comprehensive understanding of what are considered to be "established" concepts must include teaching the debates and conflicts by which they were established, Johnson appropriated the phrase to cast doubt upon the very concept of established knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/evolution.html?pg=2 The Crusade Against Evolution], Evan Ratliff, October 2004, ''Wired'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was picked up by other Discovery Institute affiliates [[Stephen C. Meyer]], David K. DeWolf, and Mark E. DeForrest in their 1999 article, "Teaching the Controversy: Darwinism, Design and the Public School Science Curriculum"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;program=CSC%20-%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Scholarship%20-%20Law%20and%20Policy&amp;id=58 Teaching the Controversy: Darwinism, Design and the Public School Science Curriculum] David K. DeWolf, Stephen C. Meyer, Mark E. DeForrest. Foundation for Thought and Ethics, October 1, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[Foundation for Thought and Ethics]]. The Foundation for Thought and Ethics also publishes the controversial pro-intelligent design biology textbook ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'', suggested as an alternative to mainstream science and biology textbooks in the Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plans proposed by Teach the Controversy proponents.

==Development of the strategy==
The roots of the intelligent design movement's strategy are found in the past attempts of creationists to force religious views into public school science classes. The most recent of these had been [[creation science]], which sought to provide a scientific veneer for the biblical account of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. The characteristics of the intelligent design movement are a direct response to the tactical and legal failings of earlier creationist movements. Design proponents' strategies represent a natural evolution of the "creation science" movement, proceeding still further in the direction of claiming the mantle of science while denying their religious intentions in argument.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Comparisons of the drafts of the intelligent design textbook ''Of Pandas and People'' before and after the 1987 ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' ruling showed that the definition given in the book for creation science in pre Edwards drafts is identical to the definition of intelligent design in post Edwards drafts; cognates of the word creation—creationism and creationist, which appeared approximately 150 times were deliberately and systematically replaced with the phrase 'intelligent design'; and the changes occurred shortly after the Supreme Court ruled in ''Edwards'' that creation science is religious and cannot be taught in public school science classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District 2: context#Page 32 of 139|Ruling - context, pg. 32]] ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was devised by Stephen C. Meyer and Discovery Institute founder and President Bruce Chapman as a compromise strategy in March 2002. They had come to the realisation that the dispute over intelligent design's (lack of) scientific standing was complicating their efforts to have evolution challenged in the science classroom. This strategy was designed to move the focus onto an approach that stresses open debate and evolution's purported weakness, but does not require students to study intelligent design. The intention was to create doubt over evolution and avoid the question of whether the [[intelligent designer]] was [[God]], while giving the institute time to strengthen their purported theory of intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32444-2005Mar13.html?referrer=email Battle on Teaching Evolution Sharpens] Peter Slevin. Washington Post, March 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage of this strategy was to allay teacher fears of legal action.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest and Gross(2004) p206&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment of the strategy==
The Discovery Institute's strategy has been for the institute itself or groups acting on its behalf to lobby state and local boards of education, and local, state and federal policymakers to enact policies and/or laws, often in the form of textbook disclaimers and the language of state science standards, that undermine or remove evolutionary theory from the public school science classroom by portraying it as "controversial" and "in crisis;" a portrayal that stands in contrast to the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community that there is no controversy, that evolution is one of the best-supported theories in all of science, and that whatever controversy does exist is political and religious, not scientific.&lt;ref name="nap"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/intelligentdesignwatch/teach-controversy.html Turn out the lights, the "Teach the controversy" party’s over]&lt;/ref&gt; The Teach the Controversy strategy has benefitted from 'stacking' municipal, county and state school boards with intelligent design proponents&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/dfiles/file_161.pdf Creationism in 2001: A State-by-State Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615102746/http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/dfiles/file_161.pdf |date=2006-06-15 }} [[People For the American Way]]. (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt; as alluded to in the Discovery Institute's [[Wedge Strategy]].

As the primary organizer and promoter of the Teach the Controversy campaign, the Discovery Institute has played a central role in nearly all intelligent design cases, often working behind the scenes to orchestrate, underwrite and support local campaigns and intelligent design groups such as the Intelligent Design Network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intelligentdesignnetwork.org/ Intelligent Design Network.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It has provided support ranging from material assistance to federal, state and regionally elected representatives in the drafting of bills to the provision of support and advice to individual parents confronting their school boards. DI's goal is to move from battles over standards to curriculum writing and textbook adoption while undermining the central positions of evolution in biology and [[methodological naturalism]] in science. In order to make their proposals more palatable, the Institute and its supporters claim to advocate presenting evidence both for and against evolution, thus encouraging students to evaluate the evidence.

Though Teach the Controversy is presented by its proponents as encouraging [[academic freedom]], it, along with the [[Santorum Amendment]], is viewed by many academics as a threat to academic freedom&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bemidjistate.edu/dsiems/ID/teach.html Intelligent Design: Teach the Controversy?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910141925/http://www.bemidjistate.edu/dsiems/ID/teach.html |date=2006-09-10 }} Dann P.

Along with the objection that there is no scientific controversy to teach, another common objection is that the Teach the Controversy campaign and intelligent design arise out of a [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]] and [[evangelism|evangelistic]] movement that calls for broad social, academic and political changes.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context|Context]] Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District. Pages 17-35&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligent design proponents argue their concepts and motives should be given independent consideration. Those critical of intelligent design see the two as intertwined and inseparable, citing the foundational documents of the movement such as the ''Wedge Document'' and statements made by intelligent design proponents to their constituents. The judge in the ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial considered testimony and evidence from both sides on the question of the motives of intelligent design proponents when he ruled that "ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents"&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#H. Conclusion|Ruling]], Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, Case No. 04cv2688. December 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and "that ID is an interesting theological argument, but that it is not science."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v.

In the debate surrounding the linking of the motives of intelligent design proponents to their arguments, following the [[Kansas evolution hearings]] the chairman of the Kansas school board, Steve Abrams, cited in The New York Times as saying that though he's a creationist who believes that God created the universe 6,500 years ago, he is able to keep the two separate:
{{quotation|In my personal faith, yes, I am a creationist, ... But that doesn't have anything to do with science. I can separate them. ... my personal views of Scripture have no room in the science classroom.&lt;ref name="nyt_kansas"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/01/us/01evolution.html?ei=5088&amp;en=da489440c39ebbb4&amp;ex=1312084800&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all Evolution’s Backers in Kansas Start Counterattack] Ralph Blumenthal. The New York Times, August 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Afterward, [[Lawrence Krauss]], a Case Western Reserve University physicist and astronomer, in a New York Times essay said: {{quotation|A key concern should not be whether Dr. Abrams's religious views have a place in the classroom, but rather how someone whose religious views require a denial of essentially all modern scientific knowledge can be chairman of a state school board. ... As we work to improve the abysmal state of science education in our public schools, we will continue to do battle with those who feel that knowledge is a threat to religious faith ... we should remember that the battle is not against faith, but against ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/15/science/sciencespecial2/15essa.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin How to Make Sure Children Are Scientifically Illiterate] Lawrence M. Krauss. The New York Times, August 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A rudimentary form of the teach the controversy strategy had emerged first among creationists following the Supreme Court's ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' decision. The [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) prepared an evaluation of what the movement should try next, suggesting "school boards and teachers should be strongly encouraged at least to stress the scientific evidences and arguments against evolution in their classes . . . even if they don't wish to recognize these as evidences and arguments for creationism." [[Glenn Branch]] of the [[National Center for Science Education]] says this comment shows that the teach the controversy strategy was "pioneered in the wake of Edwards v. Aguillard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.waronscience.com/excerpt.php?p=2|title=The Republican War on Science|author=Chris Mooney|publisher=Basic Books|date=August 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the September 2005 start of the ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'' trial, the "Dover trial," prominent intelligent design proponents gradually shifted to a "Teach the Controversy" strategy. They had realised that mandates requiring the teaching of intelligent design were unlikely to survive challenges based on the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and that an unfavorable ruling had the effect of legally ruling intelligent design a form of religious creationism.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Thus, the Discovery Institute repositioned itself. It publicly abandoned advocating for any policies or laws that required the teaching of intelligent design in favor of a Teach the Controversy strategy.&lt;ref&gt;"In a country in which more than 50 percent of adults consistently tell pollsters that they believe God created humans in their present form within the past 10,000 years, however, there will undoubtedly be a fourth wave that will feature yet another strategy to promote creationism by questioning evolution. It looks as if this next wave will jettison the creationist and intelligent-design baggage and concentrate exclusively on a "teach the controversy" strategy." [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/21/2277 Intelligent Judging — Evolution in the Classroom and the Courtroom] George J. Annas, New England Journal of Medicine, Volume 354:2277-2281 May 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Institute Fellows reasoned that once the "fact" that a controversy indeed exists had been established in the public's mind, then the reintroduction of intelligent design into public school criteria would be much less controversial later.&lt;ref name=show_me&gt;[http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/dennett05/dennett05_index.html Show Me The Science] Daniel C. Dennett. New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best illustration of this shift in strategy is comparing the Discovery Institute's 1999 guidebook ''Intelligent Design in Public School Science Curricula'' which concludes "school boards have the authority to permit, and even encourage, teaching about design theory as an alternative to Darwinian evolution"&lt;ref name=guidebook&gt;[http://arn.org/docs/dewolf/guidebook.htm Intelligent Design in Public School Science Curricula: A Legal Guidebook] David K. DeWolf, Stephen C. Meyer, Mark E. DeForrest 1999, Foundation for Thought and Ethics.&lt;/ref&gt; to 2006 statements by Phillip E. Johnson, that his intent was never to use public school education as the forum for his ideas and that he hoped to ignite and perpetuate a debate in universities and among the higher echelon of scientific thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/content/news/education/story/14254103p-15069795c.html Father of intelligent design]{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Kim Minugh, Sacramento Bee, May 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

With the December 2005 ruling in ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', wherein Judge John E. Jones III concluded that intelligent design is not science, intelligent design proponents were left with the Teach the Controversy strategy as the most likely method left to realize the goals stated in the [[Wedge strategy|wedge document]]. Thus, the Teach the Controversy strategy has become the primary thrust of the Discovery Institute in promoting its aims. Just as intelligent design is a [[stalking horse]] for the campaign against what its proponents claim is a materialist foundation in science that precludes God, Teach the Controversy has become a stalking horse for intelligent design. But the ''Dover'' ruling also characterized "teaching the controversy" as part of a religious ploy.&lt;ref name="Establishment Clause Page 134"/&gt;{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2011}}

==Shift to the "Critical Analysis of Evolution"==
{{See also|Critical Analysis of Evolution}}
By May 2006{{Chronology citation needed|date=June 2011}} the Discovery Institute sought to replace the failed "teach the controversy" strategy with a strategy broadened to include examples of other supposedly legitimate scientific controversies. In Ohio and Michigan where school boards were again reviewing science curricula standards the Discovery Institute and its allies proposed lesson plans that included [[global warming]], [[cloning]] and [[stem cell research]] as further examples of controversies that are akin to the alleged scientific controversy over evolution. All four topics are widely accepted by the majority of the scientific community as legitimate science, and all four are areas where US political conservatives have been known to be critical of the [[scientific consensus]]. Members of the scientific community have responded to this tactic by pointing out that like evolution whatever controversy may exist over cloning and stem cell research has been largely social and political, while dissident viewpoints over global warming are often viewed as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=hoppe&gt;[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/ohio_here_we_go_1.html Ohio: Here We Go Again] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180810/http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/ohio_here_we_go_1.html |date=2007-09-30 }} Richard B.

Dispatches from the Culture Wars, June 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Richard B. Hoppe, holder of a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from the University of Minnesota, described the tactic in the following way:
{{quotation|Like the attacks on evolution, the attack on climate science is driven by the sectarian conviction that 'materialistic' science is untrustworthy and must be replaced. As with intelligent design creationism, science-deniers' so-called evidence takes the form of claims for the insufficiency of current scientific explanations rather than concrete, testable alternative hypotheses. As in the evolution debate, religious extremists use the clever strategy of denigrating the scientific consensus on causality (global warming is human-caused via pollution) by pretending it contrasts sharply with an alternative scientific theory that, properly-understood, is really just a more nuanced view that's not really in opposition (current global warming is part of the earth’s natural cycle but is being exacerbated by pollution). This exaggerates the intensity of normal scientific debate in order to suggest there's something wrong with climate science, and then uses this manufactured controversy to cloak the anti-science view and smuggle it into classrooms — sectarian religious evangelism masquerading as science.&lt;ref name=hoppe/&gt;}}

With the ''Dover'' ruling describing "teach the controversy" as "at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard",&lt;ref&gt;''Kitzmiller v. Dover'' decision, [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 89 of 139|p89]]&lt;/ref&gt; intelligent design proponents have moved to a fallback position, emphasizing contrived flaws in evolution and overemphasizing remaining questions in the theory what they call the ''Critical Analysis of Evolution''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligentdesign.podomatic.com/entry/2006-07-11T09_38_44-07_00 Critical Analysis of Evolution is Not the Same as Teaching Intelligent Design] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828121119/http://intelligentdesign.podomatic.com/entry/2006-07-11T09_38_44-07_00 |date=2006-08-28 }} Casey Luskin. Intelligent Design The Future, July 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Critical Analysis of Evolution'' strategy is viewed by [[Nick Matzke]] and other intelligent design critics as a means of teaching all the intelligent design arguments without using the intelligent design label.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/no_one_here_but.html No one here but us Critical Analysis-ists...] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906051325/http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/no_one_here_but.html |date=2015-09-06 }} Nick Matzke. The Panda's Thumb, July 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Critical Analysis of Evolution]]'' continues the themes of the teach the controversy strategy, emphasizing what they say are the "criticisms" of evolutionary theory and "arguments against evolution," which continues to be portrayed as "a theory in crisis." Early drafts of the Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan referred to the lesson as the "great evolution debate"; one of the early drafts of the lesson plan had one section titled "Conducting the Macroevolution Debate". In a subsequent draft, it was changed to "Conducting the Critical Analysis Activity". The wording for the two sections is nearly identical, with just "debate" changed to "critical analysis activity" wherever it appeared, in the manner of how intelligent design proponents simply replaced "creation" with "intelligent design" in ''Of Pandas and People'' to repackage a creation science textbook into an intelligent design textbook.

==Repercussions==
The campaigns of intelligent design proponents seeking curricular challenges have been disruptive, divisive and expensive for the affected communities. In pursuing the goal of establishing intelligent design at the expense of evolution in public school science classes, intelligent design groups have threatened and isolated high school science teachers, school board members and parents who opposed their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/Day2PMSession.pdf Testimony, Aralene Callahan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201142541/http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/Day2PMSession.pdf |date=2007-12-01 }} Kitzmiller v.

Dembski, uncommondescent.com, endorsed bullying the children of the plaintiffs in the Kitzmiller v.

For example, as a result of the Dover trial, the Dover Area School District was forced to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages for pursuing a policy of ''teaching the controversy''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130105132526/http://www.yorkdispatch.com/searchresults/ci_3535139 Dover gets a million-dollar bill] Christina Kauffman.

Four days after the six-week ''Dover'' trial concluded, all eight of the Dover school board members who were up for reelection were voted out of office. [[Televangelist]] [[Pat Robertson]] in turn told the citizens of Dover, "If there is a disaster in your area, don't turn to God. You just rejected him from your city." Robertson said if they have future problems in Dover, "I recommend they call on Charles Darwin. Maybe he can help them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/10/politics/main1036232.shtml Robertson: PA Voters Rejected God] CBS News, November 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics, like [[Wesley R. Elsberry]], say the Discovery Institute has cynically manufactured much of the political and religious controversy to further its agenda, pointing to statements of prominent proponents like Johnson:
{{quotation|Whether educational authorities allow the schools to teach about the controversy or not, public recognition that there is something seriously wrong with Darwinian orthodoxy is going to keep on growing. While the educators stonewall, our job is to continue building the community of people who understand the difference between a science that tests its theories against the evidence, and a pseudoscience that protects its key doctrines by imposing philosophical rules and erecting legal barriers to freedom of thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arn.org/docs/pjweekly/pj_weekly_010611.htm The Pennsylvania Controversy] Phillip E. Johnson, Phillip Johnson's Weekly Wedge Update. June 11, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To the absence of actual scientific controversy over the validity of evolutionary theory, Johnson said:
{{quotation|If the science educators continue to pretend that there is no controversy to teach, perhaps the television networks and the newspapers will take over the responsibility of informing the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arn.org/docs/pjweekly/pj_weekly_010507.htm Icons of Evolution exposed on CNN] Phillip E. Johnson, Phillip Johnson's Weekly Wedge Update. May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And to the resistance of science educators over portraying evolution as controversial or disputed, Johnson said:
{{quotation|If the public school educators will not "teach the controversy," our informal network can do the job for them. In time, the educators will be running to catch up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arn.org/docs/pjweekly/pj_weekly_020409.htm Passing the Torch] Phillip E. Johnson, Phillip Johnson's Weekly Wedge Update. April 9, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Elsberry and others allege that statements like Johnson's are proof that the alleged scientific controversy intelligent design proponents seek to have taught is a product of the institute's members and staff. In the ''Dover'' trial's ruling the judge wrote that intelligent design proponents had misrepresented the scientific status of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;"ID proponents support their assertion that evolutionary theory cannot account for life’s complexity by pointing to real gaps in scientific knowledge, which indisputably exist in all scientific theories, but also by misrepresenting well-established scientific propositions."

According to published reports, the nonprofit Discovery Institute received grants and gifts totaling $4.1 million for 2003 from 22 foundations. Of these, two-thirds had primarily religious missions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050911/OPINION02/509110732/1087/opinion Intelligent design group is just a religious front] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627201715/http://www.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050911%2FOPINION02%2F509110732%2F1087%2Fopinion |date=2006-06-27 }} by Fred Barton, Lansing State Journal.

==Political action==
The Discovery Institute aggressively promotes its Teach the Controversy campaign and intelligent design to the public, education officials and public policymakers. Its efforts are largely aimed at conservative Christian policymakers, where it is cast as a counterbalance to the liberal influences of "atheistic scientists" and "Dogmatic Darwinists." As a measure of their success in this effort, on 1 August 2005, during a round-table interview with reporters from five Texas newspapers, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] said that he believes schools should discuss intelligent design alongside evolution when teaching students about the origin of life. Bush, a conservative Christian, declined to go into detail on his personal views of the origin of life, but advocated the ''Teach the Controversy'' approach - "I think that part of education is to expose people to different schools of thought... you're asking me whether or not people ought to be exposed to different ideas, the answer is yes." Christian conservatives, a substantial part of Bush's voting base, have been central in promoting the Teach the Controversy campaign.

In some state battles, the ties of Teach the Controversy and intelligent design proponents to the Discovery Institute's political and social activities have been made public resulting in their efforts being temporarily thwarted. The Discovery Institute takes the view that all publicity is good and that no defeat is real. The Institute has shown a willingness to back off, even to not advocate for the inclusion of ID, to ensure that all science teachers are required to portray evolution as a "theory in crisis." The Institute's strategy is to move, relentlessly, from standards battles, to curriculum writing, to textbook adoption, and back again doing whatever it takes to undermine the central position of evolution in biology. Critics of this strategy and the movement contend that the intelligent design controversy diverts much time, effort and tax money away from the actual education of children.

===Political battles involving the Discovery Institute===
{{Off topic|date=June 2011}}&lt;!-- This section involves little that is of direct relevance to TtC specifically, as opposed to various other ID-related articles --&gt;
{{Main article|Intelligent design in politics}}
*'''2000 Congressional briefing''': In 2000, the leading ID proponents operating through the Discovery Institute held a congressional briefing in [[Washington, D.C.]], to promote ID to lawmakers. Sen. [[Rick Santorum]] was and continues to be one of ID's most vocal supporters. One result of this briefing was that Sen. Santorum inserted pro-ID language into the No Child Left Behind bill calling for students to be taught why evolution "generates so much continuing controversy," an assertion heavily promoted by the Discovery Institute.
*'''2001 Santorum Amendment''': As a result of the 2000 Congressional briefing, the Discovery Institute drafted and lobbied for the Santorum Amendment to the [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind]] education act. The amendment encouraged the "teach the controversy" approach to evolution education. The amendment was passed by the U.S. Senate, but was left out of the final version of the Act, and remains only in highly modified form in the conference report, where it does not carry the weight of law. The conference report language is commonly touted by the Discovery Institute as model language for bills and curricula. The Discovery Institute lobbies states, counties, and municipalities, and offers them legal analysis and Institute-developed curricula and text books they proclaim meet constitutional criteria established by the courts in previous creationism/evolution First Amendment cases.
*'''2002-2006 Ohio Board of Education''': The Discovery Institute proposed a model lesson plan that featured intelligent design prominently in its curricula. It was adopted in part in October 2002, with the Board's advising that the science standards do "not mandate the teaching or testing of intelligent design." This was touted by the Discovery Institute as a significant victory. By February 2006 the Ohio Board of Education voted 11-4 to delete the science standard and correlating lesson plan adopted in 2002. [http://www.cnn.com/2006/EDUCATION/02/15/evolution.debate.ap/index.html] The board also rejected a competing plan from the institute to request a legal opinion from the state attorney general on the constitutionality of the science standards. Intelligent design proponents pledged to force another vote on the issue.
*'''2005 [[Kansas evolution hearings]]''': A series of hearings instigated by the institute held in Topeka, Kansas May 2005 by the Kansas State Board of Education to review changes how the origin of life would be taught in the state's public high school science classes. The hearings were boycotted by the [[scientific community]], and views expressed represented largely those of intelligent design advocates. The result of the hearings was the adoption of new science standards by the Republican-dominated board in defiance of the State Board Science Hearing Committee that relied upon the institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan and adopted the institute's Teach the Controversy approach. In August 2006 conservative Republicans lost their majority on the board in a primary election. The moderate Republican and Democrats gaining seats vowed to overturn the 2005 school science standards and adopt those recommended by a State Board Science Hearing Committee that were rejected by the previous board.
*'''2005 [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]''': Eleven parents of students in the [[school district]] of [[Dover, Pennsylvania]], sued the [[Dover Area School District]] over a statement that the school board required to be read aloud in ninth-grade science classes when evolution was taught endorsing intelligent design as an alternative to evolution. The plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy thus violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. In December, 2005 United States federal court judge John E. Jones III [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#H. Conclusion|ruled that]] intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature.

==Criticism==
The theory of evolution is accepted by the vast majority of biologists and by the scientific community in general, in such overwhelming numbers that the theory of evolution is viewed as having scientific [[consensus]]. Over 70 scientific societies, institutions, and other professional groups representing tens of thousands individual scientists have issued policy statements supporting evolution education and opposing intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of scientific societies rejecting intelligent design]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 83 of 139|Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover]] page 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific controversies are minor and concern the details of the mechanisms of evolution, not the validity of the overarching theory of evolution. In the absence of an actual professional controversy between groups of experts on evolution, critics say intelligent design proponents have merely renamed the conflict that already existed between biologists and creationists, and that the controversy to which intelligent design proponents refer is political in nature and thus, by definition, outside of the realm of science and scientific educational curricula. Critics contend that intelligent design proponents ignore this point by continuing to make the claim of a "scientific controversy." According to Thomas Dixon, "The 'controversy' in question has not arisen from any substantial scientific disagreement but is the product of a concerted public relations exercise aimed at the Christian parents of America."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dixon| first = Thomas| title = Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2008| location = Oxford| page = 102| isbn = 978-0-19-929551-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the National Association of Biology Teachers, in a statement endorsing evolution as noncontroversial, quoted [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]]: "[[Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution]]" and went on to state that the quote "accurately reflects the central, unifying role of evolution in biology. The theory of evolution provides a framework that explains both the history of life and the ongoing adaptation of organisms to environmental challenges and changes." They emphasized that "Scientists have firmly established evolution as an important natural process" and that "The selection of topics covered in a biology curriculum should accurately reflect the principles of biological science. Teaching biology in an effective and scientifically honest manner requires that evolution be taught in a standards-based instructional framework with effective classroom discussions and laboratory experiences."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nabt.org/sub/position_statements/evolution.asp Statement on Teaching Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927160040/http://www.nabt.org/sub/position_statements/evolution.asp |date=2006-09-27 }} National Association of Biology Teachers, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent evolutionary biologists such as [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Jerry Coyne]] have proposed various "controversies" that are worth teaching, instead of intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/life/feature/story/0,13026,1559743,00.html One side can be wrong] The Guardian. September 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins compares teaching intelligent design in schools to teaching [[Flat Earth|flat earthism]]: perfectly fine in a history class but not in science. "If you give the idea that there are two schools of thought within science, one that says the earth is round and one that says the earth is flat, you are misleading children."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1090909,00.html The Evolution Wars] Claudia Wallis. TIME magazine. August 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Time Magazine, 15 August 2005, page 32--&gt; [[Tufts University]] Professor of Philosophy [[Daniel C. Dennett]], author of ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', describes how they generate a sense of controversy: "The proponents of intelligent design use an ingenious ploy that works something like this: First you misuse or misdescribe some scientist's work. Then you get an angry rebuttal. Then, instead of dealing forthrightly with the charges leveled, you cite the rebuttal as evidence that there is a 'controversy' to teach."&lt;ref name=show_me/&gt;

Critics of the Teach the Controversy movement and strategy can also be found outside of the scientific community. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], described the approach of the movement's proponents as "a disarming subterfuge designed to undermine solid evidence that all living things share a common ancestry." "The movement is a veneer over a certain theological message. Every one of these groups is now actively engaged in trying to undercut sound science education by criticizing evolution," said Lynn. "It is all based on their religious ideology. Even the people who don't specifically mention religion are hard-pressed with a straight face to say who the intelligent designer is if it's not God."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32444-2005Mar13.html Battle on Teaching Evolution Sharpens] Peter Slevin. Washington Post, March 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Maher]] said of Teach the Controversy, "You don't have to teach both sides of a debate if one side is a load of crap."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/new_rules/20050819.html New Rules] Bill Maher. Real Time with Bill Maher, HBO, August 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Discovery Institute===
According to critics of the Discovery Institute's efforts through the Teach the Controversy campaign and the intelligent design movement, the Wedge strategy betrays the Institute's political rather than scientific and educational purpose. The Discovery Institute and its [[Center for Science and Culture]] (CSC) has an overarching conservative Christian social and political agenda that seeks to redefine both law and science and how they are conducted, with the stated goal of a religious "renewal" of American culture.

Critics also allege that the Discovery Institute has a long-standing record of misrepresenting research, law and its own policy and agenda and that of others:
*In announcing the Teach the Controversy strategy in 2002, the Discovery Institute’s Stephen C. Meyer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Meyer.cfm Meyer's Hopeless Monster] Alan Gishlick, Nick Matzke, and Wesley R. Elsberry. TalkReason.org, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; presented an annotated bibliography of 44 peer-reviewed scientific articles that were said to raise significant challenges to key tenets of what was referred to as "Darwinian evolution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?program=CSC&amp;command=view&amp;id=1134 Teach the Controversy] Stephen C. Meyer. Cincinnati Enquirer, March 30, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this claim the National Center for Science Education, an organization that works in collaboration with National Academy of Sciences, the National Association of Biology Teachers, and the National Science Teachers Association that support the teaching of evolution in public schools,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseweb.org/about About the NCSE] National Science Teachers Association&lt;/ref&gt; contacted the authors of the papers listed and twenty-six scientists, representing thirty-four of the papers, responded. None of the authors considered his or her research to provide evidence against evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncseweb.org/media/Analysis-of-the-Discovery-Institute.pdf Analysis of the Discovery Institute's "Bibliography of Supplementary Resources for Ohio Science Instruction"] National Center for Science Education (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Discovery Institute, following the policies outlined by Phillip E. Johnson, obfuscates its agenda. Opposed to the public statements to the contrary made by the Discovery Institute, Johnson has admitted that the goal of intelligent design movement is to cast creationism as a scientific concept:
{{quotation|
*Our strategy has been to change the subject a bit so that we can get the issue of intelligent design, which really means the reality of God, before the academic world and into the schools.&lt;ref name=intelligent_darwin&gt;[http://www.christianity.ca/news/social-issues/2004/03.001.html Let's Be Intelligent About Darwin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608233455/http://www.christianity.ca/news/social-issues/2004/03.001.html |date=2007-06-08 }} Elizabeth Nickson. Christianity.ca, February, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
*This isn't really, and never has been a debate about science. It's about religion and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leaderu.com/pjohnson/world2.html Witness For The Prosecution, Darwin on Trial author brings together anti-Darwin coalition to bring down evolution] Joel Belz. World Magazine, Volume 11, Number 28, p. 18. November 30, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
*If we understand our own times, we will know that we should affirm the reality of God by challenging the domination of materialism and naturalism in the world of the mind. With the assistance of many friends I have developed a strategy for doing this....We call our strategy the 'wedge.'&lt;ref&gt;Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds. Phillip E. Johnson. 1997. pp. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt;
*So the question is: "How to win?" That’s when I began to develop what you now see full-fledged in the "wedge" strategy: "Stick with the most important thing" —the mechanism and the building up of information. Get the Bible and the Book of Genesis out of the debate because you do not want to raise the so-called Bible-science dichotomy. Phrase the argument in such a way that you can get it heard in the secular academy and in a way that tends to unify the religious dissenters. That means concentrating on, "Do you need a Creator to do the creating, or can nature do it on its own?" and refusing to get sidetracked onto other issues, which people are always trying to do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touchstonemag.com/docs/issues/15.5docs/15-5pg40.html Berkeley’s Radical An Interview with Phillip E.

Johnson}}
*[[Rob Boston]] of the Americans United for Separation of Church and State described Johnson's vision of the Wedge as: "The objective [of the Wedge Strategy] is to convince people that Darwinism is inherently atheistic, thus shifting the debate from creationism vs. evolution to the existence of God vs. the non-existence of God. From there people are introduced to 'the truth' of the Bible and then 'the question of sin' and finally 'introduced to Jesus.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010508032051/http://www.au.org/churchstate/cs4995.htm ''Missionary Man''], Rob Boston, ''Church &amp; State'', April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
* Instead of producing original scientific data to support ID’s claims, the Discovery Institute has promoted ID politically to the public, education officials and public policymakers through its Teach the Controversy campaign.

Johnson's statements validate the criticisms leveled by those who allege that the Discovery Institute and its allied organizations are merely stripping the obvious religious content from their anti-evolution assertions as a means of avoiding the legal restriction on establishment. They argue that ID is simply an attempt to put a patina of secularity on top of what is a fundamentally religious belief and agenda.

Given the history of the Discovery Institute as an organization committed to opposing any scientific theory inconsistent with "the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubtheo.com/savedpages/discovery-institute-wedge-document.pdf The "Wedge Document": So What?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050512085720/http://www.pubtheo.com/savedpages/discovery-institute-wedge-document.pdf |date=2005-05-12 }} Discovery Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; many scientists regard the movement purely as a ploy to insert creationism into the science curriculum rather than as a serious attempt to discuss scientific evidence. In the words of [[Eugenie Scott]] of the National Center for Education:
{{quotation|Teach the controversy' is a deliberately ambiguous phrase. It means 'pretend to students that scientists are arguing over whether evolution took place.' This is not happening. I mean you go to the scientific journals, you go to universities... and you ask the professors, is there an argument going on about whether living things had common ancestors? They'll look at you blankly. This is not a controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2005/US/418_creation_conflict_in_schools_3_29_2005.asp "Creation Conflict in Schools"] National Center for Science Education.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though Teach the Controversy proponents cite the current public policy statements of the Discovery Institute as belying the criticisms that their strategy is a creationist ploy and decry critics as biased in failing to recognize that the intelligent design movement's Teach the Controversy strategy as really just a question of science with no religion involved, is itself belied by Discovery Institute's former published policy statements,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19970514072337/http://www.discovery.org/crsc/aboutcrsc.html What is The Center for the Renewal of Science &amp; Culture All About?] &lt;br/&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/19970514073708/http://www.discovery.org/crsc/crscmisn.html The Mission of The Center for Renewal of Science &amp; Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; its "Wedge Document", and statements made to its constituency by its leadership, and in particular Phillip E. Johnson.

Writes Johnson in the foreword to &lt;cite&gt;Creation, Evolution, &amp; Modern Science&lt;/cite&gt; (2000):
{{quotation|The Intelligent Design movement starts with the recognition that "In the beginning was the Word," and "In the beginning God created." Establishing that point isn't enough, but it is absolutely essential to the rest of the gospel message. ... The first thing that has to be done is to get the Bible out of the discussion. ...This is not to say that the biblical issues are unimportant; the point is rather that the time to address them will be after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/le_wedge.htm The Wedge Breaking the Modernist Monopoly on Science] Phillip E. Johnson. ARN.org.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Johnson's words bolster the claims of those critics who cite Johnson's admission that the ultimate goal of the campaign is getting "the issue of intelligent design, which really means the reality of God, before the academic world and into the schools."&lt;ref name=intelligent_darwin/&gt;

Amid this political and religious controversy the clear, categorical and oft-repeated view of established national and international scientific organizations remains that there is no ''scientific'' controversy over teaching evolution in public schools.

===University course===
[[George Mason University]] Biology Department introduced a 1-credit course on the creation/evolution controversy, and Emmett Holman, an associate professor of philosophy from the university, found that as students learn more about biology, they find [[objections to evolution]] less convincing. He concluded that "teaching the controversy" would undermine creationists’ criticisms, and that the scientific community’s resistance to this approach was bad public relations. Rather than being taught in a mainstream science course, it would be a separate elective course, probably taught by a scientist but called a course on "philosophy of science", "history of science", or "politics of science and religion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/02_Events/Lectures/2006/02_Lecture_2006_0420.shtml AAAS Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421015554/http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/02_Events/Lectures/2006/02_Lecture_2006_0420.shtml |date=2006-04-21 }}, 20 April 2006, Emmett Holman, Associate Professor of Philosophy from George Mason University, retrieved 2007-04-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist Tom A. Langen argues in a journal letter entitled ''"What is right with ‘teaching the controversy’?"'' that offering a specific course about this controversy will help students understand the demarcation between science and other ways of obtaining knowledge about nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=What is right with ‘teaching the controversy’? |first=Tom A. |last=Langen |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=114–115 |year=2004 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2003.12.005 |pmid=16701239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar positions have been expressed by atheists [[Julian Baggini]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julian |last=Baggini |authorlink=Julian Baggini |date=2007-06-15 |title=Why we should learn Intelligent Design |work=Times Educational Supplement |publisher=TSL Education Ltd |url=http://www.tes.co.uk/search/story/?story_id=2397963 |accessdate=2008-06-27 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aaron Sloman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Aaron |last=Sloman |authorlink=Aaron Sloman |title=Why scientists and philosophers of science should teach intelligent design (ID) alongside the theory of evolution |url=http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/id/ |accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3427">'''The Edublog Awards''' were an annual, community based programme which recognised and celebrated excellent practice in the use of weblogs and social media to facilitate education. Entries were accepted from any country, in any language, from educators working with any age group or type of learner, including learner led initiatives. Nominations opened within categories in November of each year, with the Awards event taking place in December following a community vote.

==History==
The Awards were founded in 2004 by [[James N. Farmer]], based in part on a suggestion by [[Alexander Halavais]]. The following year, [[Josie Fraser]] took over the awards management, working with [[Dave Cormier]] and [[Jeff Lebow]] from 2005 onwards. In 2007 [[James N. Farmer]] rejoined the team, and [[Jo Kay]] joined the team for the first time, providing the awards ceremony with a home in the virtual world platform [[Second Life]]. They were last awarded in 2015.

==Goals==
The three main aims behind the awards were to:

* Provide an opportunity for an international community who are interested and involved in scholarly and education based blogging ([[edublog]]) and the use of social media an opportunity to come together as a community, discover new ways of using blogging and social media to support learning, and highlight the wealth of effective, innovative work being carried out globally.
* Provide a concrete, annually updated resource for those involved in or thinking about using social software and user generated content sites to support education communities of all kinds. They also demonstrate the diverse use made of blogs, wikis, audiovisual tools, virtual worlds and social networking platforms.
* Demonstrate that new technologies can be used in positive, innovative, safe and effective ways. The Awards programme is designed to act as an argument against a moral panic approach to the use of technologies in education that threatens innovative and creative practice. The Awards argue that digital literacy and social participation for learners, educational employees and institutions as the effective way to address potential dangers, as opposed to banning and restricting access within education and library services.

'''The Nova Project''', also known as '''Nova''', is a small public [[alternative school|alternative]] [[high school]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], operated by the [[Seattle Public Schools|Seattle Public School District]]. Its goal is to be a "democratically governed learning community of broadly educated, creative, and independent thinkers who work collaboratively and demonstrate a high degree of individual responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;"School History - The Nova Project", http://www.novafolios.com/school-history&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==

Nova was founded by a group of students, parents and teachers in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Loveless, Douglas, Sullivan, Pamela, Dredger, Katie, Burns, Jim. ''Deconstructing the Education-Industrial Complex in the Digital Age'', p. 16-17. https://books.google.com/books?id=O5vgDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum is multidisciplinary and project-oriented, with an emphasis on individualized learning contracts,&lt;ref&gt;Weinstock, Chuck, ''Learning Contracts: Facilitating Academic Change,'' p. 7. https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED080107&lt;/ref&gt; internships and community service.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan, Joe; Febey, Karen. ''Smaller, Safer, Saner, Successful Schools'', p. 53-54. https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED455680&lt;/ref&gt;.

Nova functions through student-run, teacher-supported "committees" that decide school budgeting, the hiring and review process of staff, orientation of new students, and cultural affairs. 

The grading system is competency-based and is credit/no credit with 80% mastery required for credit. Each student works with a coordinator to design a personal learning plan to graduate. Nova students have the option of creating "independent contracts" with their teachers to earn credit for extracurricular goals and activities they commit to. It is common for Nova students to co-teach classes with their teachers, generating curriculum and building facilitation skills in line with Nova's student-led philosophy. Like other Seattle Public Schools students, Nova students may participate in the [[Running Start]] program and take classes at a local [[community college]]. 

In early summer of 2009, Nova was relocated from the Mann Building to the Meany Middle School site, where it was co-housed with the World School. Nova returned to the newly remodeled Mann Building in 2015.

A '''university''' ({{lang-la|universitas}}, "a whole") is an [[educational institution|institution]] of [[higher education|higher]] (or [[Tertiary education|tertiary]]) [[education]] and [[research]] which awards [[academic degree]]s in various [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]]. Universities typically provide [[undergraduate education]] and [[postgraduate education]].

The word ''university'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''universitas magistrorum et scholarium'', which roughly means "community of teachers and scholars".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Universities|short=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; While antecedents had existed in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]],&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt; the modern university system has roots in the European [[medieval university]], which was created in [[Italy]] and evolved from Catholic [[Cathedral school]]s for the clergy during the [[High Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haskins | first1 = Charles H. | year = 1898 | title = The Life of Medieval Students as Illustrated by their Letters | url = | journal = The American Historical Review | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 203–229 | doi=10.2307/1832500| jstor = 1832500 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Academia#History{{!}}History of academia}}

===Definition===
The original [[Latin]] word ''universitas'' refers in general to "a number of persons associated into one body, a society, company, community, guild, [[corporation]], etc".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Charlton T. | last2 = Short | first2 = Charles | title = A Latin Dictionary | place = Oxford | publisher = Clarendon Press | origyear = 1879 | year = 1966 | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the emergence of urban town life and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[guild]]s, specialized "associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes, prelates, or the towns in which they were located" came to be denominated by this general term. Like other guilds, they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia L. Colish, ''Medieval Foundations of the Western Intellectual Tradition, 400-1400,'' (New Haven: Yale Univ. Pr., 1997), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern usage the word has come to mean "An institution of higher education offering tuition in mainly non-vocational subjects and typically having the power to confer degrees,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = university, n. | year = 2010 | title = OED Online | edition = 3rd  | contribution-url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/214804?rskey=Owl6ZY&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false |accessdate = 27 August 2013 | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press| title-link = OED Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the earlier emphasis on its corporate organization considered as applying historically to Medieval universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = university, n. | year = 2010 | title = OED Online | edition = 3rd  | contribution-url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/214804?rskey=Owl6ZY&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false |accessdate = 27 August 2013 | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | quote = …In the Middle Ages: a body of teachers and students engaged in giving and receiving instruction in the higher branches of study … and regarded as a scholastic guild or corporation.| title-link = OED Online }} Compare {{Citation | contribution = University | year = 1989 | title = Oxford English Dictionary | edition = 2nd  | editor-last = | editor-first = | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | quote = The whole body of teachers and scholars engaged, at a particular place, in giving and receiving instruction in the higher branches of learning; such persons associated together as a society or corporate body, with definite organization and acknowledged powers and privileges (esp. that of conferring degrees), and forming an institution for the promotion of education in the higher or more important branches of learning….| title-link = Oxford English Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Latin word referred to degree-awarding institutions of learning in [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]], where this form of legal organisation was prevalent, and from where the institution spread around the world.

====Academic freedom====
An important idea in the definition of a university is the notion of [[academic freedom]]. The first documentary evidence of this comes from early in the life of the [[University of Bologna]], which adopted an academic charter, the ''[[Authentica habita|Constitutio Habit]]a'',&lt;ref&gt;Malagola, C. (1888), Statuti delle Università e dei Collegi dello Studio Bolognese. Bologna: Zanichelli.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1158 or 1155,&lt;ref name="Rüegg, W. 2003 pp 4-34"&gt;Rüegg, W. (2003), Mythologies and Historiography of the Beginnings, pp 4-34 in H. De Ridder-Symoens, editor, A History of the University in [[Europe]]; Vol 1, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which guaranteed the right of a traveling scholar to unhindered passage in the interests of education. Today this is claimed as the origin of "academic freedom".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, P. (2005), Ideas. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, page 373&lt;/ref&gt; This is now widely recognised internationally - on 18 September 1988, 430 university rectors signed the ''[[Magna Charta Universitatum]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.unibo.it/avl/charta/charta.htm |title=Magna Charta delle Università Europee |publisher=.unibo.it |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115001914/http://www2.unibo.it/avl/charta/charta.htm |archivedate=15 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; marking the 900th anniversary of Bologna's foundation. The number of universities signing the ''Magna Charta Universitatum'' continues to grow, drawing from all parts of the world.

Their endowment by a prince or monarch and their role in training government officials made early [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] universities similar to Islamic [[madrasa]]s, although madrasas were generally smaller, and individual teachers, rather than the madrasa itself, granted the license or degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Pryds | first = Darleen | editor-last = Courtenay | editor-first = William J. | editor2-last = Miethke | editor2-first = Jürgen | editor3-last = Priest | editor3-first = David B. | publication-date = 2000 | title = Universities and Schooling in Medieval Society | chapter = ''Studia'' as Royal Offices: Mediterranean Universities of Medieval Europe | series = Education and Society in the Middle Ages and Renaissance | volume = 10 | publisher = Brill | publication-place = Leiden | pages = 96–98 | url = https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:9004113517 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars like [[Arnold H.

===Medieval universities===
[[File:Bologna-vista02.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The [[University of Bologna]] in [[Italy]], founded in 1088, is the oldest university, the word ''university'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''universitas'') having been coined at its foundation.]]
{{Main|Medieval university|List of medieval universities}}
The university is generally regarded as a formal institution that has its origin in the [[History of Christianity|Medieval Catholic]] tradition.&lt;ref name="Rüegg, Walter 1992, pp. XIX"&gt;Rüegg, Walter: "Foreword. The University as a European Institution", in: ''A History of the University in Europe. Vol. 1: Universities in the Middle Ages'', Cambridge University Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-521-36105-2}}, pp. XIX–XX&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Verger |first=Jacques |title=Gentes del saber: en la Europa de finales de la Edad Media |year=1999 |publisher=Editorial Complutense |pages=259 |isbn=9788489784697 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=Wf3aqgLY-_wC&amp;printsec=frontcover |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; European higher education took place for hundreds of years in [[Christianity|Catholic ]] [[cathedral school]]s or [[monastic school]]s (''scholae monasticae''), in which [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Riché, Pierre (1978): "Education and Culture in the Barbarian West: From the Sixth through the Eighth Century", Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, {{ISBN|0-87249-376-8}}, pp. 126-7, 282-98&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the [[Latin Church]] by [[papal bull]] as ''[[Studium Generale|studia generalia]]'' and perhaps from Catholic cathedral schools. It is possible, however,  that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Leff, ''Paris and Oxford Universities in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries. An Institutional and Intellectual History'', Wiley, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Later they were also founded by Kings ([[University of Naples Federico II]], [[Charles University in Prague]], [[Jagiellonian University|Jagiellonian University in Kraków]]) or municipal administrations ([[University of Cologne]], [[University of Erfurt]]). In the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval period]], most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, P. (2000). The Renaissance : a short history. Modern Library chronicles (Modern Library ed.). New York: Modern Library, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Gregory VII]] was critical in promoting and regulating the concept of modern university as his 1079 Papal Decree ordered the regulated establishment of Catholic cathedral schools  that transformed themselves into the first European universities.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Oestreich (1913). "Pope St. Gregory VII". In Herbermann, Charles. Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first universities in Europe with a form of corporate/guild structure were the [[University of Bologna]] (1088), the [[University of Paris]] (c.1150, later associated with the [[Sorbonne]]), and the [[University of Oxford]] (1167).

The University of Bologna began as a law school teaching the ''[[jus gentium|ius gentium]]'' or [[Roman law]] of peoples which was in demand across Europe for those defending the right of incipient nations against empire and church. Bologna's special claim to ''[[Alma Mater Studiorum]]''{{Clarify|date=May 2011}} is based on its autonomy, its awarding of degrees, and other structural arrangements, making it the oldest continuously operating institution&lt;ref name="Rüegg, W. 2003 pp 4-34"/&gt; independent of kings, emperors or any kind of direct religious authority.&lt;ref&gt;Makdisi, G. (1981), Rise of Colleges: Institutions of Learning in Islam and the West. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daun, H. and Arjmand, R.

The conventional date of 1088, or 1087 according to some,&lt;ref&gt;Huff, T. (2003), The Rise of Early Modern Science. Cambridge University Press, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; records when [[Irnerius]] commences teaching Emperor Justinian's 6th century codification of Roman law, the ''[[Corpus Iuris Civilis]]'', recently discovered at Pisa. Lay students arrived in the city from many lands entering into a contract to gain this knowledge, organising themselves into 'Nationes', divided between that of the Cismontanes and that of the Ultramontanes. The students "had all the power … and dominated the masters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Kerr|first = Clark|date=2001|title = The Uses of the University|publisher = Harvard University Press|pages =16 and 145|isbn = 978-0674005327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, W. (2003), Mythologies and Historiography of the Beginnings, pp 4-34 in H. De Ridder-Symoens, editor, A History of the University in Europe; Vol 1, Cambridge University Press.p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, young men proceeded to university when they had completed their study of the [[trivium (education)|trivium]]–the preparatory arts of [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[dialectic]] or [[logic]]–and the [[quadrivium]]: [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[music]], and [[astronomy]].

All over Europe rulers and city governments began to create universities to satisfy a European thirst for knowledge, and the belief that society would benefit from the scholarly expertise generated from these institutions. Princes and leaders of city governments perceived the potential benefits of having a scholarly expertise develop with the ability to address difficult problems and achieve desired ends. The emergence of humanism was essential to this understanding of the possible utility of universities as well as the revival of interest in knowledge gained from ancient Greek texts.&lt;ref&gt;Grendler, P. F. (2004). "The universities of the Renaissance and Reformation". Renaissance Quarterly, 57, pp. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rediscovery of [[Aristotle]]'s works–more than 3000 pages of it would eventually be translated–fuelled a spirit of inquiry into natural processes that had already begun to emerge in the 12th century. Some scholars believe that these works represented one of the most important document discoveries in Western intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;Rubenstein, R. E. (2003). Aristotle's children: how Christians, Muslims, and Jews rediscovered ancient wisdom and illuminated the dark ages (1st ed.). Orlando, Florida: Harcourt, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Dales, for instance, calls the discovery of Aristotle's works "a turning point in the history of Western thought."&lt;ref&gt;Dales, R. C. (1990). Medieval discussions of the eternity of the world (Vol. 18). Brill Archive, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; After Aristotle re-emerged, a community of scholars, primarily communicating in Latin, accelerated the process and practice of attempting to reconcile the thoughts of Greek antiquity, and especially ideas related to understanding the natural world, with those of the church. The efforts of this "[[scholasticism]]" were focused on applying Aristotelian logic and thoughts about natural processes to biblical passages and attempting to prove the viability of those passages through reason. This became the primary mission of lecturers, and the expectation of students.

The university culture developed differently in northern Europe than it did in the south, although the northern (primarily Germany, France and Great Britain) and southern universities (primarily Italy) did have many elements in common. Latin was the language of the university, used for all texts, lectures, [[disputation]]s and examinations. Professors lectured on the books of Aristotle for logic, [[natural philosophy]], and [[metaphysics]]; while [[Hippocrates]], [[Galen]], and [[Avicenna]] were used for medicine. Outside of these commonalities, great differences separated north and south, primarily in subject matter. Italian universities focused on law and medicine, while the northern universities focused on the arts and theology. There were distinct differences in the quality of instruction in these areas which were congruent with their focus, so scholars would travel north or south based on their interests and means. There was also a difference in the types of degrees awarded at these universities. English, French and German universities usually awarded bachelor's degrees, with the exception of degrees in theology, for which the doctorate was more common. Italian universities awarded primarily doctorates. The distinction can be attributed to the intent of the degree holder after graduation – in the north the focus tended to be on acquiring teaching positions, while in the south students often went on to professional positions.&lt;ref&gt;Grendler, P. F. (2004). "The universities of the Renaissance and Reformation". Renaissance Quarterly, 57, pp. 2-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of northern universities tended to be modeled after the system of faculty governance developed at the University of Paris. Southern universities tended to be patterned after the student-controlled model begun at the University of Bologna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scott | first1 = J.

===Early modern universities===
{{See also|List of early modern universities in Europe|List of colonial universities in Latin America}}

During the [[Early Modern period]] (approximately late 15th century to 1800), the universities of Europe would see a tremendous amount of growth, productivity and innovative research. At the end of the Middle Ages, about 400 years after the first European university was founded, there were twenty-nine universities spread throughout Europe. In the 15th century, twenty-eight new ones were created, with another eighteen added between 1500 and 1625.&lt;ref&gt;Grendler, P. F. (2004). The universities of the Renaissance and Reformation. Renaissance Quarterly, 57, pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; This pace continued until by the end of the 18th century there were approximately 143 universities in Europe, with the highest concentrations in the German Empire (34), Italian countries (26), France (25), and Spain (23) – this was close to a 500% increase over the number of universities toward the end of the Middle Ages. This number does not include the numerous universities that disappeared, or institutions that merged with other universities during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Frijhoff, W. (1996). Patterns. In H. D. Ridder-Symoens (Ed.), Universities in early modern Europe, 1500-1800, A history of the university in Europe. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of a university was not necessarily obvious during the Early Modern period, as the term is applied to a burgeoning number of institutions. In fact, the term "university" was not always used to designate a higher education institution. In Mediterranean countries, the term ''[[studium generale]]'' was still often used, while "Academy" was common in Northern European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Frijhoff, W. (1996). Patterns. In H. D. Ridder-Symoens (Ed.), Universities in early modern Europe, 1500-1800, A history of the university in Europe. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Class at Salamanca.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|17th century classroom at the [[University of Salamanca]]]]
The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression, as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion. Many wars, and especially the [[Thirty Years' War]], disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times. War, plague, famine, [[regicide]], and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities. Internal strife within the universities themselves, such as student brawling and absentee professors, acted to destabilize these institutions as well. Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula, and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Grendler, P. F. (2004). The universities of the Renaissance and Reformation. Renaissance Quarterly, 57, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; This era was also affected by the rise of the [[nation-state]]. As universities increasingly came under state control, or formed under the auspices of the state, the faculty governance model (begun by the University of Paris) became more and more prominent. Although the older student-controlled universities still existed, they slowly started to move toward this structural organization. Control of universities still tended to be independent, although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scott | first1 = J. C. | year = 2006 | title = The mission of the university: Medieval to Postmodern transformations | url = | journal = Journal of Higher Education | volume = 77 | issue = 1| pages = 10–13 | doi=10.1353/jhe.2006.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the structural model provided by the University of Paris, where student members are controlled by faculty "masters", provided a standard for universities, the application of this model took at least three different forms. There were universities that had a system of faculties whose teaching addressed a very specific curriculum; this model tended to train specialists. There was a collegiate or tutorial model based on the system at [[University of Oxford]] where teaching and organization was decentralized and knowledge was more of a generalist nature. There were also universities that combined these models, using the collegiate model but having a centralized organization.&lt;ref&gt;Frijhoff, W. (1996). Patterns. In H. D. Ridder-Symoens (Ed.), Universities in early modern Europe, 1500-1800, A history of the university in Europe. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: [[natural philosophy]], logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and [[rhetoric]]. Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated.&lt;ref&gt;Ruegg, W. (1992). Epilogue: the rise of humanism. In H. D. Ridder-Symoens (Ed.), Universities in the Middle Ages, A history of the university in Europe. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the [[studia humanitatis]]. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives.&lt;ref&gt;Grendler, P. F. (2002). The universities of the Italian renaissance. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts.&lt;ref&gt;Grendler, P. F. (2002). The universities of the Italian renaissance. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Professors of medicine such as [[Niccolò Leoniceno]], [[Thomas Linacre]] and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts. The critical mindset imparted by humanism was imperative for changes in universities and scholarship. For instance, [[Andreas Vesalius]] was educated in a humanist fashion before producing a translation of Galen, whose ideas he verified through his own dissections. In law, Andreas Alciatus infused the ''[[Corpus Juris]]'' with a humanist perspective, while [[Jacques Cujas]] humanist writings were paramount to his reputation as a jurist. [[Philipp Melanchthon]] cited the works of [[Erasmus]] as a highly influential guide for connecting theology back to original texts, which was important for the reform at Protestant universities.&lt;ref&gt;Ruegg, W. (1996). Themes. In H. D. Ridder-Symoens (Ed.), Universities in Early Modern Europe, 1500-1800, A history of the university in Europe. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, pp. 33-39.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galileo Galilei]], who taught at the Universities of [[University of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[University of Padua|Padua]], and [[Martin Luther]], who taught at the [[University of Wittenberg]] (as did Melanchthon), also had humanist training. The task of the humanists was to slowly permeate the university; to increase the humanist presence in professorships and chairs, syllabi and textbooks so that published works would demonstrate the humanistic ideal of science and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Grendler, P. F. (2004). The universities of the Renaissance and Reformation. Renaissance Quarterly, 57, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the initial focus of the humanist scholars in the university was the discovery, exposition and insertion of ancient texts and languages into the university, and the ideas of those texts into society generally, their influence was ultimately quite progressive. The emergence of classical texts brought new ideas and led to a more creative university climate (as the notable list of scholars above attests to). A focus on knowledge coming from self, from the human, has a direct implication for new forms of scholarship and instruction, and was the foundation for what is commonly known as the humanities. This disposition toward knowledge manifested in not simply the translation and propagation of ancient texts, but also their adaptation and expansion. For instance, Vesalius was imperative for advocating the use of Galen, but he also invigorated this text with experimentation, disagreements and further research.&lt;ref&gt;Bylebyl, J. J. (2009). Disputation and description in the renaissance pulse controversy. In A. Wear, R. K. French, &amp; I. M. Lonie (Eds.), The medical renaissance of the sixteenth century (1st ed., pp. 223-245). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The propagation of these texts, especially within the universities, was greatly aided by the emergence of the printing press and the beginning of the use of the vernacular, which allowed for the printing of relatively large texts at reasonable prices.&lt;ref&gt;Füssel, S. (2005). Gutenberg and the Impact of Printing (English ed.). Aldershot, Hampshire: Ashgate Pub., p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examining the influence of humanism on scholars in medicine, mathematics, astronomy and physics may suggest that humanism and universities were a strong impetus for the scientific revolution. Although the connection between humanism and the scientific discovery may very well have begun within the confines of the university, the connection has been commonly perceived as having been severed by the changing nature of science during the scientific revolution. Historians such as [[Richard S. Westfall]] have argued that the overt traditionalism of universities inhibited attempts to re-conceptualize nature and knowledge and caused an indelible tension between universities and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, R. S. (1977). The construction of modern science: mechanisms and mechanics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; This resistance to changes in science may have been a significant factor in driving many scientists away from the university and toward private benefactors, usually in princely courts, and associations with newly forming scientific societies.&lt;ref&gt;Ornstein, M. (1928). The role of scientific societies in the seventeenth century. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other historians find incongruity in the proposition that the very place where the vast number of the scholars that influenced the scientific revolution received their education should also be the place that inhibits their research and the advancement of science. In fact, more than 80% of the European scientists between 1450–1650 included in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were university trained, of which approximately 45% held university posts.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoigne, J. (1990). A reappraisal of the role of the universities in the Scientific Revolution. In D. C. Lindberg &amp; R. S. Westman (Eds.), Reappraisals of the Scientific Revolution, pp. 208-209.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable, and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development. There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system, which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world. However, university professors still utilized some autonomy, at least in the sciences, to choose epistemological foundations and methods. For instance, Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Westman | first1 = R. S. | year = 1975 | title = The Melanchthon circle:, rheticus, and the Wittenberg interpretation of the Copernicantheory | doi = 10.1086/351431| journal = Isis | volume = 66 | issue = 2| pages = 164–193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities, and the debates surrounding that adoption, which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change. There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoigne, J. (1990). A reappraisal of the role of the universities in the Scientific Revolution. In D. C. Lindberg &amp; R. S. Westman (Eds.), Reappraisals of the Scientific Revolution, pp. 210-229.&lt;/ref&gt; Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged, when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability, and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoigne, J. (1990). A reappraisal of the role of the universities in the Scientific Revolution. In D. C. Lindberg &amp; R. S. Westman (Eds.), Reappraisals of the Scientific Revolution, pp. 245-248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the way the tension between universities, individual scientists, and the scientific revolution itself is perceived, there was a discernible impact on the way that university education was constructed. Aristotelian epistemology provided a coherent framework not simply for knowledge and knowledge construction, but also for the training of scholars within the higher education setting. The creation of new scientific constructs during the scientific revolution, and the epistemological challenges that were inherent within this creation, initiated the idea of both the autonomy of science and the hierarchy of the disciplines. Instead of entering higher education to become a "general scholar" immersed in becoming proficient in the entire curriculum, there emerged a type of scholar that put science first and viewed it as a vocation in itself. The divergence between those focused on science and those still entrenched in the idea of a general scholar exacerbated the epistemological tensions that were already beginning to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Feingold, M. (1991). Tradition vs novelty: universities and scientific societies in the early modern period. In P. Barker &amp; R. Ariew (Eds.), Revolution and continuity: essays in the history and philosophy of early modern science, Studies in philosophy and the history of philosophy. Washington, D.C: Catholic University of America Press, pp. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The epistemological tensions between scientists and universities were also heightened by the economic realities of research during this time, as individual scientists, associations and universities were vying for limited resources. There was also competition from the formation of new colleges funded by private benefactors and designed to provide free education to the public, or established by local governments to provide a knowledge hungry populace with an alternative to traditional universities.&lt;ref&gt;Feingold, M. (1991). Tradition vs novelty: universities and scientific societies in the early modern period. In P. Barker &amp; R. Ariew (Eds.), Revolution and continuity: essays in the history and philosophy of early modern science, Studies in philosophy and the history of philosophy. Washington, D.C: Catholic University of America Press, pp. 46-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when universities supported new scientific endeavors, and the university provided foundational training and authority for the research and conclusions, they could not compete with the resources available through private benefactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = See | first1 =  | last2 = Baldwin | first2 = M | year = 1995 | title = The snakestone experiments: an early modern medical debate | doi = 10.1086/357237 | pmid =  7591659| journal = Isis | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 394–418 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the early modern period, the structure and orientation of higher education had changed in ways that are eminently recognizable for the modern context. Aristotle was no longer a force providing the epistemological and methodological focus for universities and a more mechanistic orientation was emerging. The hierarchical place of theological knowledge had for the most part been displaced and the humanities had become a fixture, and a new openness was beginning to take hold in the construction and dissemination of knowledge that were to become imperative for the formation of the modern state.

===Modern universities===
{{Main|History of European research universities|List of modern universities in Europe (1801–1945)}}
[[File:Strand102.jpg|thumb|[[King's College London]], established by Royal Charter having been founded by [[King George IV]] and [[Duke of Wellington]] in 1829, is one of the founding colleges of the [[University of London]].]]
[[File:Uni KA Portal.jpg|thumb|[[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]], a German technical university, founded in the 19th century]]
By the 18th century, universities published their own [[academic journal|research journals]] and by the 19th century, the German and the French university models had arisen. The German, or Humboldtian model, was conceived by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and based on [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]'s liberal ideas pertaining to the importance of [[academic freedom|freedom]], [[seminar]]s, and [[laboratory|laboratories]] in universities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The French university model involved strict discipline and control over every aspect of the university.

Until the 19th century, [[religion]] played a significant role in university curriculum; however, the role of religion in research universities decreased in the 19th century, and by the end of the 19th century, the German university model had spread around the world. Universities concentrated on science in the 19th and 20th centuries and became increasingly accessible to the masses. In the United States, the [[Johns Hopkins University]] was the first to adopt the (German) [[research university]] model; this pioneered the adoption by most other American universities.  In Britain, the move from [[Industrial Revolution]] to [[modernity]] saw the arrival of new civic universities with an emphasis on [[science]] and [[engineering]], a movement initiated in 1960 by Sir Keith Murray (chairman of the University Grants Committee) and [[Samuel Curran|Sir Samuel Curran]], with the formation of the [[University of Strathclyde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/69524 |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxforddnb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306083652/http://oxforddnb.com/view/article/69524 |archivedate=6 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British also established universities worldwide, and [[higher education]] became available to the masses not only in Europe.

In 1963, the [[Robbins Report]] on universities in the [[United Kingdom]] concluded that such institutions should have four main "objectives essential to any properly balanced system: instruction in skills; the promotion of the general powers of the mind so as to produce not mere specialists but rather cultivated men and women; to maintain research in balance with teaching, since teaching should not be separated from the advancement of learning and the search for truth; and to transmit a common culture and common standards of citizenship."&lt;ref name="historyandpolicy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-98.html|title=The 'Idea of a University' today|last=Anderson|first=Robert|date=March 2010|work=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=[[United Kingdom]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127065822/http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-98.html|archivedate=27 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, concerns were raised over the increasing managerialisation and standardisation of universities worldwide. Neo-liberal management models have in this sense been critiqued for creating "corporate universities (where) power is transferred from faculty to managers, economic justifications dominate, and the familiar 'bottom line' ecclipses pedagogical or intellectual concerns".&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Berg &amp; Barbara Seeber. The Slow Professor: Challenging the Culture of Speed in the Academy, p. x. Toronto: Toronto University Press. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Academics' understanding of time, pedagogical pleasure, vocation, and collegiality have been cited as possible ways of alleviating such problems.&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Berg &amp; Barbara Seeber.

===National universities===
A [[national university]] is generally a university created or run by a national state but at the same time represents a state autonomic institution which functions as a completely independent body inside of the same state. Some national universities are closely associated with national [[cultural]], [[religious]] or [[political]] aspirations, for instance the [[National University of Ireland]], which formed partly from the [[Catholic University of Ireland]] which was created almost immediately and specifically in answer to the non-denominational universities which had been set up in Ireland in 1850. In the years leading up to the [[Easter Rising]], and in no small part a result of the Gaelic Romantic revivalists, the NUI collected a large amount of information on the [[Irish language]] and [[Irish culture]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Reforms in Argentina were the result of the [[University Revolution]] of 1918 and its posterior reforms by incorporating values that sought for a more equal and laic{{explain|date=August 2016}} higher education system.

===Intergovernmental universities===
[[File:Cornell University, Ho Plaza and Sage Hall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Campus university|Campus universities]] with most buildings clustered closely together became especially widespread since the 19th century ([[Cornell University]])]]
Universities created by bilateral or multilateral treaties between states are [[intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]]. An example is the [[Academy of European Law]], which offers training in European law to lawyers, judges, barristers, solicitors, in-house counsel and academics. [[EUCLID (Pôle Universitaire Euclide, Euclid University)]] is chartered as a university and umbrella organisation dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries, and the [[United Nations University]] engages in efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are of concern to the United Nations, its peoples and member states. The [[European University Institute]], a post-graduate university specialised in the social sciences, is officially an intergovernmental organisation, set up by the member states of the [[European Union]].

==Organization==
[[File:SydneyUniversity MainQuadrangle panorama 270.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The [[University of Sydney]] is [[Australia]]'s oldest university.]]
Although each institution is organized differently, nearly all universities have a board of trustees; a president, [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]], or [[Rector (academia)|rector]]; at least one vice president, vice-chancellor, or vice-rector; and deans of various divisions. Universities are generally divided into a number of academic departments, schools or [[faculty (division)|faculties]]. [[Public university]] systems are ruled over by government-run higher education boards. They review financial requests and budget proposals and then allocate funds for each university in the system. They also approve new programs of instruction and cancel or make changes in existing programs. In addition, they plan for the further coordinated growth and development of the various institutions of higher education in the state or country. However, many public universities in the world have a considerable degree of financial, research and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] autonomy. [[private university|Private universities]] are privately funded and generally have broader independence from state policies. However, they may have less independence from business corporations depending on the source of their finances.

==Around the world==
{{See also|List of universities and colleges by country}}

The funding and organization of universities varies widely between different countries around the world. In some countries universities are predominantly funded by the state, while in others funding may come from donors or from fees which students attending the university must pay. In some countries the vast majority of students attend university in their local town, while in other countries universities attract students from all over the world, and may provide university accommodation for their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=798|title=Basic Classification Technical Details|publisher=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|accessdate=2007-03-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613225633/http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=798|archivedate=13 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

{{Further|Category:Higher education by country}}

The definition of a university varies widely, even within some countries.  Where there is clarification, it is usually set by a government agency.  For example:

In Australia, the [[Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency]] (TEQSA) is Australia's independent national regulator of the higher education sector.  Students rights within university are also protected by the Education Services for Overseas Students Act (ESOS).

In the United States there is no nationally standardized definition for the term ''university'', although the term has traditionally been used to designate [[research institution]]s and was once reserved for doctorate-granting research institutions. Some states, such as [[Massachusetts]], will only grant a school "university status" if it grants at least two [[doctoral degree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mass.edu/forinstitutions/academic/documents/610CMR.pdf |title=Massachusetts Board of Education: Degree-granting regulations for independent institutions of higher education |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] is responsible for approving the use of the word ''university'' in the name of an institution, under the terms of the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]].&lt;ref name="privy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page27.asp |title=Higher Education |accessdate=2007-12-06 |author= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Privy Council Office (United Kingdom)|Privy Council Office]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090223084511/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page27.asp |archivedate= 2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, a new designation [[deemed university|deemed universities]] has been created for institutions of higher education that are not universities, but work at a very high standard in a specific area of study ("An Institution of Higher Education, other than universities, working at a very high standard in specific area of study, can be declared by the Central Government on the advice of the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] as an Institution 'Deemed-to-be-university'"). Institutions that are 'deemed-to-be-university' enjoy the academic status and the privileges of a university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deemed University|url=http://mhrd.gov.in/deemed-university|website=mhrd.gov.in|publisher=MHRD|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207204836/http://mhrd.gov.in/deemed-university|archivedate=7 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this provision many schools that are commercial in nature and have been established just to exploit the demand for higher education have sprung up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=&amp;mdash; Peter Drucker |url=http://learnhub.com/news/1254- |title='Deemed' status distributed freely during Arjun Singh's tenure - LearnHub News |publisher=Learnhub.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707120057/http://learnhub.com/news/1254- |archivedate=7 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, ''college'' generally refers to a two-year, non-degree-granting institution, while ''university'' connotes a four-year, degree-granting institution. Universities may be sub-classified (as in the [[Rankings of universities in Canada|Macleans rankings]]) into large research universities with many PhD-granting programs and medical schools (for example, [[McGill University]]); "comprehensive" universities that have some PhDs but are not geared toward research (such as [[University of Waterloo|Waterloo]]); and smaller, primarily undergraduate universities (such as [[St. Francis Xavier University|St. Francis Xavier]]).

In [[Germany]], universities are institutions of higher education which have the power to confer bachelor, master and PhD degrees. They are explicitly recognised as such by law and cannot be founded without government approval. The term Universitaet (i.e. the German term for university) is protected by law and any use without official approval is a criminal offense. Most of them are public institutions, though a few private universities exist. Such universities are always research universities. Apart from these universities, Germany has other institutions of higher education (Hochschule, [[Fachhochschule]]). Fachhochschule means a higher education institution which is similar to the former [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnics]] in the British education system, the English term used for these German institutions is usually 'university of applied sciences'. They can confer master degrees but no PhDs. They are similar to the model of [[teaching universities]] with less research and the research undertaken being highly practical. Hochschule can refer to various kinds of institutions, often specialised in a certain field (e.g. music, fine arts, business). They might or might not have the power to award PhD degrees, depending on the respective government legislation. If they award PhD degrees, their rank is considered equivalent to that of universities proper (Universitaet), if not, their rank is equivalent to universities of applied sciences.

==Colloquial usage==
{{main|College}}
Colloquially, the term ''university'' may be used to describe a phase in one's life: "When I was at university..." (in the United States and Ireland, ''college'' is often used instead: "When I was in college..."). In Ireland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Nigeria, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and the [[German-speaking countries]], ''university'' is often contracted to ''uni''. In Ghana, New Zealand, Bangladesh and in South Africa it is sometimes called "varsity" (although this has become uncommon in New Zealand in recent years).  "Varsity" was also common usage in the UK in the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} "Varsity" is still in common usage in Scotland.

==Cost==

In many countries, students are required to pay tuition fees.
Many students look to get 'student grants' to cover the cost of university. In 2016, the average outstanding student loan balance per borrower in the United States was US$30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/18/pf/college/average-student-loan-debt/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921095420/http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/18/pf/college/average-student-loan-debt/index.html |archivedate=21 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In many U.S. states, costs are anticipated to rise for students as a result of decreased state funding given to public universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Students at Public Universities, Colleges Will Bear the Burden of Reduced Funding for Higher Education|url=http://business.time.com/2012/01/25/students-bear-the-burden-of-state-higher-ed-cuts/|accessdate=14 January 2013|work=Time|date=25 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309192745/http://business.time.com/2012/01/25/students-bear-the-burden-of-state-higher-ed-cuts/|archivedate=9 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several major exceptions on tuition fees. In many European countries, it is possible to study without tuition fees. Public universities in [[Nordic countries]] were entirely without tuition fees until around 2005. Denmark, Sweden and Finland then moved to put in place tuition fees for foreign students. Citizens of [[EU]] and EEA member states and citizens from Switzerland remain exempted from tuition fees, and the amounts of public grants granted to promising foreign students were increased to offset some of the impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.government.se/content/1/c6/05/71/00/9316e296.pdf "Studieavgifter i högskolan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515222157/http://www.government.se/content/1/c6/05/71/00/9316e296.pdf |date=15 May 2013 }} [[Statens offentliga utredningar|SOU]] 2006:7 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation in Germany is similar; public universities usually do not charge tuition fees apart from a small administrative fee. For degrees of a postgraduate professional level sometimes tuition fees are levied. Private universities, however, almost always charge tuition fees.

'''University charter''' is a [[charter]] given by [[Province|provincial]], [[State (administrative division)|state]], [[regional]], and sometimes [[nation]]al governments to legitimize the university's existence.

==Canada==
In most [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]]s university charters are in the form of '''Acts''' (e.g. York University Act). "The Royal Military College of Canada Degrees Act" of 1959 enables the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]] to offer degrees in [[Arts]], [[Science]], and [[Engineering]] at the [[undergraduate]] and [[graduate student|graduate]] levels.

==United States==

===Federal===

In the United States, [[American University]], [[Gallaudet University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Howard University]], and [[George Washington University]] are the only Congressionally chartered universities, due to their location within the [[District of Columbia|US's federal district]].

The [[United States service academies|United States service (military) academies]] are not chartered as they are agencies of the federal government itself.

===State===
Other universities are chartered by the colonial governments or by state legislatures.

The [[German language|German]] term '''''Volksschule''''' generally refers to [[compulsory education]], denoting an educational institution every person (i.e. the [[people]], ''[[Volk (German word)|Volk]]'') is required to attend. 

In [[Education in Germany|Germany]] and [[Education in Switzerland|Switzerland]] it is equivalent to a combined [[primary education|primary]] (''Grundschule'' and ''Primarschule'', respectively) and lower [[secondary education]] (''[[Hauptschule]]'' or ''Sekundarschule''), usually comprising a mandatory attendance over a period of nine years. In [[Education in Austria|Austria]], ''Volksschule'' solely is used for [[primary school]] from Year One to Year Four. In the Nordic countries they are referred to as ''Folkskolen'' and in Finnish, in a direct translation, as ''Kansakoulu''; these schools covered the first years of primary education, from the ages of 7 to 11 or 12.

==History==
In medieval times, church schools were established in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] to educate the future members of the [[clergy]], as stipulated by the 1215 [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]], later adopted by the [[sunday schools]] of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. First secular schools followed during the [[pietism]] movement from the late 17th century onwards and were further promoted by the advocates of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. In 1717 King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]] decreed the compulsory education of children from the age of five to twelve. They had to be able to read and write and were obliged to memorise the Protestant [[catechism]]. In 1763 King [[Frederick the Great]] enacted a first Prussian general school law, elaborated by the theologian [[Johann Julius Hecker]].

Similar ''Volksschulen'' were established in the [[Electorate of Saxony]] and in the German-speaking parts of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], backed by [[Johann Ignaz von Felbiger]], through a system of state-supported primary [[one-room school]]s. Attendance was supposedly compulsory, but a 1781 census reveals that only one fourth of school-age children attended. At the time, this was one of the few examples of state-supported schooling. Sending one's children to school was binding by law only from 1840 in the [[Austrian Empire]].

'''William Spady''' is the head of ChangeLeaders. William Spady is a sociologist and is the father of [[Outcome-based education|Outcome-Based Education]] (OBE). OBE is referred to by over 20 different names including Systemic [[education]] restructuring, [[Performance]] Based Education, [[Standards based education reform]], High Performance [[Learning]], [[Total Quality Management]], Transformational Education, and [[Skill|Competency]]-Based Education.

His research is still widely cited in nations such as Australia which are still adopting OBE. Nevertheless, the names have been changed in the US largely due strong negative responses to these programs when they have been introduced to actual students and parents. All of these titles refer to a similar philosophy and a plan which implements radical and "systemic" change into schools. Many have researched the thousands of articles on the internet referring to Spady, with many showing the beneficial effects of his theories on actual children.&lt;ref&gt;"Last December, the School Board approved the hiring of William Spady of ChangeLeaders, .. is sociologist and the self-proclaimed father of OBE" [http://www.watchd46schools.org/SpadyInfo.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060111235313/http://www.watchd46schools.org/SpadyInfo.html |date=2006-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spady was honored for his OBE work in the Philippines in 2015, where they are implementing OBE in some of their schools for grade level 10-12.

Spady is the author or co-author of nine books. His latest book, &lt;u&gt;Bringing Heart and Soul to Education&lt;/u&gt;, was published in 2014.

'''Youth voice''' refers to the distinct ideas, opinions, [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s, [[knowledge]], and [[Action (philosophy)|action]]s of [[youth|young people]] as a collective body. The term '''youth voice''' often groups together a diversity of perspectives and experiences, regardless of backgrounds, identities, and cultural differences. It is frequently associated with the successful application of a variety of [[youth development]] activities, including [[service learning]],&lt;ref&gt;Garvey, J., McIntyre-Craig, C., &amp; Myers, C. (2000). "Youth voice: The essential element of service-learning," In C. Myers and M. Bellener (Eds.) ''Embedding service-learning into teacher education: Issue briefs.''

(2006) "[http://www.joe.org/joe/2006december/tt6.shtml Listening to the Youth Voice in Planning Leadership Development Programs]," ''Journal of Extension. 44''6. December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional research has shown that engaging youth voice is an essential element of effective organizational development among community and youth-serving organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Zeldin, S. (2004) "Youth as Agents of Adult and Community Development: Mapping the Processes and Outcomes of Youth Engaged in Organizational Governance
," ''Applied Development Science. 8''(2), pp 75-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Many [[youth organizations]] and community activities cite youth voice as an important factor to their successful operations.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2006) [http://www.commonaction.org/publications.htm Washington Youth Voice Handbook] Olympia, WA: CommonAction(2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The field of [[Positive Youth Development]] also promotes youth voice by striving to inspire confidence and social engagement for young people.&lt;ref name="Lerner PYD"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lerner|first=R.M.|author2=Almerigi, J.B. |author3=Theokas, C. |author4=Lerner, J.V. |title=Positive Youth Development|journal=Journal of Early Adolescence|year=2005|volume=25|issue=1|pages=10–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of [[School]]-oriented youth voice efforts include the [[VicSRC]], an Australian [[student voice]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A.

==Movement==
A broad international movement exists to promote youth voice, born from earlier [[youth service]] and [[youth rights]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2004) [http://www.nylc.org/rc_downloaddetail.cfm?emoid=14:176 "The Youth Voice Movement: A New Vision for the Future, or a Lost Dream of the Past?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928135712/http://www.nylc.org/rc_downloaddetail.cfm?emoid=14:176 |date=September 28, 2007 }} ''The Generator'', Spring 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] was the first international mechanism to stipulate the systemic engagement of youth voice. Specific aims are stated in Articles 5 and 12 that clearly acknowledge the youth have a voice, that youth voice is constantly changing, and that all areas of our society are morally responsible for engaging youth voice. Annual events which center on youth voice include [[Global Youth Service Day]] and the [[National Service Learning Conference]].

[[Ephebiphobia]] and [[adultism]] have been identified as the factors preventing widespread recognition of youth voice throughout communities.&lt;ref&gt;Felix, A. (2003) [http://www.ysa.org/yvi/resources/MakingYouthVoiceACommunityPrinciple.pdf Making Youth Voice a Community Principle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221181122/http://www.ysa.org/yvi/resources/MakingYouthVoiceACommunityPrinciple.pdf |date=February 21, 2007 }} ''Youth Service Journal'', October 2003, Youth Service America.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it is commonly acknowledged that "little quantitative research has been conducted regarding the issue of youth voice",&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, J., &amp; Caldwell, L. L. (2001). [http://rptsweb.tamu.edu/Faculty/Witt/conpubs/Caldwell%20Teen%20Center.PDF "Increasing youth voice through participation in a recreation-based teen center"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230102920/http://rptsweb.tamu.edu/Faculty/Witt/conpubs/Caldwell%20Teen%20Center.PDF |date=December 30, 2006 }}. College Park, PA: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; while the qualitative research on youth voice is often seen as minimally effective, as well, due to a limited scope focused on [[youth participation]] in decision-making and opinion-sharing.&lt;ref&gt;Beilenson, J. (1993). "Looking for young people, listening for youth voice." ''Social Policy, 24''1, pp 8–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, K. &amp; Perkins, D. (2005) [http://www.joe.org/joe/2005october/a5.shtml "Determining the Quality of Youth-Adult Relationships Within Community-Based Youth Programs"], ''Journal of Extension. 43''(5).&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth voice also faces criticism from the [[youth rights]] movement that it does not go far enough, or that it is using youth.  Critics claim that youth voice advocates only advance a shallow analysis of [[ageism]] and propose solutions that do not go far enough to give youth any substantive power in society.  Coupled with [[youth service]] this can lead to young people being pressured to help fix adult problems without ever addressing the problems youth face.&lt;ref&gt;Koroknay-Palicz, Alex. [http://oneandfour.org/archives/2006/02/a_critique_of_t.html "A Critique of the Youth Service Movement"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928045853/http://oneandfour.org/archives/2006/02/a_critique_of_t.html |date=September 28, 2007 }}.
