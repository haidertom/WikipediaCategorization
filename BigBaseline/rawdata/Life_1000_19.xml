'''0010x0010''' is a Dutch-born [[audiovisual art]]ist, currently living in Los Angeles.

==Early years==
In his early years, being inspired by underground techno, he released a series of [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]] under various pseudonyms (only one using his real name) and he performed live [[acid techno]] sets at underground parties such as Acid Rain at Amsterdam Graansilo. During the recording sessions for one of the tracks he produced for ex [[Soul II Soul]] and [[The Shamen]] singer Victoria Wilson James's album on Sony Music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Victoria-Wilson-James-Colorfields/release/591843|title=Victoria Wilson-James - Colorfields|website=Discogs|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was suggested that he audition for the "De Bende van Venlo", a theatre piece based on a true crime story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theaterencyclopedie.nl/wiki/De_bende_van_Venlo_-_Stichting_Theaterwerkplaats_Limburg_Het_Kruis_van_Bourgondi%C3%AB_-_1997-07-04|title=De bende van Venlo - Stichting Theaterwerkplaats Limburg Het Kruis van Bourgondië - 1997-07-04 - TheaterEncyclopedie|website=theaterencyclopedie.nl|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was cast in one of the lead roles and performed over thirty European shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/1997/07/05/vooral-sfeer-en-spektakel-in-stuk-de-bende-van-venlo-7359654-a1211521|title=Vooral sfeer en spektakel in stuk De Bende van Venlo|website=nrc.nl|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/toneelstuk-over-bende-van-venlo-begint-met-rap-gewetenloze-killers-een-gruwelijke-afslachting~a484780/|title=Toneelstuk over Bende van Venlo begint met rap 'Gewetenloze killers, een gruwelijke afslachting' – Binnenland – de Volkskrant|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/theater/de-bende-van-venlo-zit-vol-met-gemiste-kansen~a494401/|title=De Bende van Venlo zit vol met gemiste kansen – Theater – de Volkskrant|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Los Angeles==
After the theatre experience, Universal / [[Island Records]] won the label-bidding and signed him as an artist and producer.He released one single and one video before he left the label due to creative differences and moved from London to Los Angeles to work on his art, film, photography and editing &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2011/01/in-the-works-new-doc-from-paris-is-burning-director-sundances-pariah-chicago-mob-boss-more-243995/|title=In the Works: New Doc from "Paris is Burning" Director, Sundance’s "Pariah," Chicago Mob Boss &amp; More - IndieWire|first=Bryce J.|last=Renninger|website=www.indiewire.com|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; career. He took a break from that to release the track ''LA Mellow'' (as D'ray), a collaboration with Dutch Dj, producer [[Gregor Salto]].

== Early life ==
Innocent Idibia was born in [[Jos]], Nigeria
. He is from the [[Idoma people|Idoma]] ethnic group in the southern part of [[Benue State]], in central Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newswatchngr.com/editorial/prime/bob/10109113755.htm |title=Rise and Rise of Tu-Face |publisher=newswatchngr.com |date=9 January 2006 |accessdate=6 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715031503/http://www.newswatchngr.com/editorial/prime/bob/10109113755.htm |archive-date=15 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Mount Saint Gabriel's Secondary School in Makurdi, Benue State. He enrolled at Institute of Management &amp; Technology, [[Enugu]] (IMT), where he did his preliminary National Diploma course in business administration and management. While attending IMT, he performed at school organised shows and parties, as well as other regional schools such as the [[University of Nigeria]] and [[Enugu State University of Science &amp; Technology]]. He eventually dropped out to pursue his music career. While attending IMT, 2face Idibia started composing and singing [[jingles]] at the GB Fan Club at [[Enugu State Broadcasting Services]] (ESBS) in 1996.

Also in 1996, he adopted the stage name "2Face" (Tuface). He cited the reason as "trying to demarcate my personal life with my business life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLOjyMuKH20  |title=2Face Idibia Live in London |via=YouTube |accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Plantashun Boiz ==
He moved to [[Lagos, Nigeria|Lagos]] and started performing with rapper [[Blackface Naija]]. He had met BlackFace while attending IMT.&lt;ref name=Idomaland&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idomaland.org/icon/innocent-ujah-idibia-2face |title=Innocent Ujah Idibia (2Face) |publisher=Idomalang.org |accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Blackface (Ahmedu Augustine Obiabo) and with musician [[Faze (musician)|Faze]] (Chibuzor Oji), he went on to form the trio band [[Plantashun Boiz]].

Plantashun Boiz released two successful albums: ''Body and Soul'' (2000) and ''Sold Out'' (2003)under the Nelson Brown's owned Label (Dove Records)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenet.ng/2013/06/2face-idibia-working-with-nelson-brown-on-upcoming-album/|title=2face Idibia working with Nelson Brown on upcoming album|author=Editor|work=Nigerian Entertainment Today – Nigeria's Number 1 Entertainment Daily|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; before disbanding in 2004. Relations were marred for many years during which the band broke up and its members started their solo careers. Long after the break-up known as the "Faze vs Tuface" beef, the band came back together in 2007 for the purpose of recording a third and final album entitled ''Plan B'' (2007).&lt;ref name=Idomaland /&gt;

==Solo career==
After the disbandment of Plantashun Boyz in 2004, all band members sought separate musical careers. 2face Idibia released his debut solo album ''[[Face 2 Face (2face Idibia album)|Face 2 Face]]'' (2004), which established him as a viable solo artist.

Following the release of his debut album, he released his second album ''[[Grass 2 Grace]]'' in 2006, which contained hits "One Love", "True Love, "4 Instance". He is the founder of Hypertek Entertainment.

He released a promotion album in 2008 called ''[[The Unstoppable]]'' releasing the single "Enter the Place". Problems with album distribution in 2007 caused as shift of the release date of the album from 2008 to early 2009. In 2010, 2face released an "international edition" of the same under the title ''[[The Unstoppable International Edition]]'' making him the first Nigerian artist to have an appropriately priced international album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.com.ng/sat/index.php/entertainment-extra/1108-tuface-checks-piracy-with-classy-album-price.html|title=TuFace Checks Piracy With Classy Album Price|publisher=tribune.com.ng|accessdate=9 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322200436/http://www.tribune.com.ng/sat/index.php/entertainment-extra/1108-tuface-checks-piracy-with-classy-album-price.html|archive-date=22 March 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Welcome&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellanaija.com/2011/04/28/watch-2face-idibias-bet-international-welcome-to-america-interview-with-lola-ogunnaike |title=2Face Idibia's BET International "Welcome to America" Interview |publisher=Bellanaija.com  |date=27 April 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2face released two more singles from the international version of his ''Unstoppable'' album.

'''Tauheed Epps''' (born September 12, 1977),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2012/09/13/video-2-chainz-gets-his-big-booty-birthday-wish/ |title=2 Chainz Gets His Big Booty Birthday Wish |website=Rap-Up.com|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsagents.net/index.php/content/content17/176-2-chainz |title=2 Chainz |website=Sportsagents.net |date= |accessdate=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; known professionally as '''2 Chainz''' (formerly '''Tity Boi'''), is an American rapper, songwriter, television personality, activist, and actor. Born and raised in [[College Park, Georgia]], he initially gained recognition for being one-half of the [[Southern hip hop]] duo [[Playaz Circle]], alongside his longtime friend and fellow rapper Earl "Dolla Boy" Conyers. The duo was signed to fellow Georgia-based rapper [[Ludacris]]' [[Disturbing tha Peace]] label, and are best known for their debut single "[[Duffle Bag Boy]]".

In February 2012, Epps signed a solo [[record deal]] with [[Def Jam Recordings]], an imprint of [[Universal Music Group]]. The following August, he released his debut studio album ''[[Based on a T.R.U. Story]]'', to mixed reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/based-on-a-tru-story/2-chainz/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Based on a T.R.U. Story |website=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album spawned three successful singles: "[[No Lie (2 Chainz song)|No Lie]]," "[[Birthday Song]]," and "[[I'm Different (2 Chainz song)|I'm Different]]", all of which charted in the top 50 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and were certified Gold or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], along with the album being certified Gold. His second studio album ''[[B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time]]'' was released on September 11, 2013. It was supported by the singles "[[Feds Watching]]" and "[[Used 2]]". Mr. Chainz began working with the TV Network [[Viceland]] on a show called [[Most Expensivest]], which debuted its first episode on November 15, 2017, and is currently in its second season.

==Early life and education==
2 Chainz was born '''Tauheed Epps''' in [[College Park, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/2-chainz-might-run-for-mayor-of-college-park-georgia-2015281|title=2 Chainz Might Run for Mayor of College Park, Georgia: Rapper Gets Political|website=Us Weekly|first=Madeline|last=Boardman|date=January 28, 2015|accessdate=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[North Clayton High School]], where he played basketball and graduated second in his class.&lt;ref name=beast&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/27/2-chainz-is-no-donald-trump-fan.html|title=2 Chainz Is No Donald Trump Fan|website=The Daily Beast|first=Marlow|last=Stern|date=March 27, 2016|accessdate=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in high school, he dealt [[marijuana]] and was arrested for felony [[cocaine]] possession when he was 15 years old.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt; He later attended [[Alabama State University]] on a scholarship, and played on its basketball team from 1995 to 1997.&lt;ref name="sports-reference"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/tauheed-epps-1.html|title=Tauheed Epps|accessdate=July 4, 2017|work=S-R CBB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/playbooksounds/post/_/id/3120/how-good-was-2-chainz-at-basketball |website=espn.go.com |publisher=ESPN |title=How good was 2 Chainz at basketball? |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' about longstanding rumors that he had graduated from Alabama State with a 4.0 GPA, which had been widely reported on many sources including [[Wikipedia]], 2 Chainz said: "Don't believe anything on Wack-ipedia. There's a lot of false stuff on there, to the point that every time I try to fix one thing, something else comes out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-suddenly-2-chainz-is-everywhere-20120813 | title=Five Reasons Why 2 Chainz Should Make A Presidential Bid | work=The Observer | date=September 25, 2012 | accessdate=January 10, 2016 | author=Vanessa Quilantan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he transferred to [[Virginia State University]] due to circumstances he was reluctant to speak about.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt; "I got into some trouble, went somewhere else, and came back. But I graduated, and that’s that. That was then," he said.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt;

==Career==

===1997–2010: Playaz Circle and Disturbing tha Peace===
Epps formed the hip hop duo [[Playaz Circle]] (the word "Playaz" being a [[bacronym]] for "Preparing Legal Assets for Years from A to Z")&lt;ref name=dubmagazine&gt;{{cite web|title=Playaz Circle|url=http://dubmagazine.com/stars/musicians/410-playaz-circle|work=Dub Magazine|publisher=Dub Publishing |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[College Park, Georgia]] in 1997, with his high school friend Earl Conyers (known as Dolla Boy), while Epps adopted "Tity Boi" as his [[moniker]].&lt;ref name=allmusicbio&gt;{{cite web |last=Cordor|first=Cyril|title=Playaz Circle – Biography|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/playaz-circle-p733429/biography|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the release of an [[Independent music|independent album]] titled ''United We Stand, United We Fall'' (2002),&lt;ref name=dubmagazine/&gt; the duo were introduced to fellow Atlanta rapper [[Ludacris]], when he moved into their College Park apartment complex, whilst he was acting as a [[disc jockey|DJ]].&lt;ref name=allmusicbio/&gt; After taking interest in Playaz Circle, Ludacris began to record several songs with the group, playing some of them on his [[radio station]].&lt;ref name=dubmagazine/&gt;

Ludacris soon became one of the highest-selling rappers in the [[Southern United States]].&lt;ref name=allmusicbio/&gt; After hearing of their situation, Ludacris requested of Epps that the duo join his newly formed record label [[Disturbing Tha Peace]], a subsidiary of [[Def Jam Recordings]]. Epps agreed to sign, although Conyers did not officially join the label until his mother regained her health, a year after the initial signing.&lt;ref name=allmusicbio/&gt;

Their debut album ''[[Supply &amp; Demand (Playaz Circle album)|Supply &amp; Demand]]'', was released on October 30, 2007. The [[lead single]] and their debut single, "[[Duffle Bag Boy]]", became an urban [[hit single]]. The song features [[Lil Wayne]], and was performed by the duo at the [[BET Hip Hop Awards]]. The duo released their second studio album ''[[Flight 360: The Takeoff]]'', on September 29, 2009. In January 2010, Playaz Circle filmed a music video for their single "Big Dawg" [[featuring]] Lil Wayne and [[Birdman (entertainer)|Birdman]] at Studio Space Atlanta. Shortly afterwards, Epps left Disturbing tha Peace, a move he claimed was taken in order to advance his career. Although Ludacris was initially reluctant to allow Epps to leave the label (as he felt Epps could still prove financially successful), he eventually accepted the decision.&lt;ref name=albumtitle&gt;{{cite web|last=Vasquez|first=Andres|title=2 Chainz Reveals Album Title, Speaks On Leaving Ludacris' Label|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.19019/title.2-chainz-reveals-album-title-speaks-on-leaving-ludacris-label|work=HipHopDX|publisher=Cheri Media Group|accessdate=May 20, 2012|date=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011–12: Name change and ''Based on a T.R.U. Story''===
Throughout Epps's career, critics and fans alike have speculated the [[pseudonym]] "Tity Boi" was meant to be derogatory towards women, although he repeatedly denied such accusations.&lt;ref name=vibenamechange&gt;{{cite web|title=2 Chainz Opens Up About Why He Was Named 'Tity Boi,' T.R.U.

REALigion,'' which became his first mixtape to appear on the music charts, peaking at number 58 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2 Chainz – Charts &amp; Awards – ''Billboard'' Albums|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/2-chainz-p2450987/charts-awards|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the success of the mixtape, Epps has made numerous [[guest appearance]]s on tracks by prominent recording artists such as&lt;ref name=vibenamechange/&gt; Kanye West ("[[Mercy (GOOD Music song)|Mercy]]") and Nicki Minaj ("[[Beez in the Trap]]").

On March 24, 2012, Epps announced his debut [[studio album]], whose title he had changed to ''[[Based on a T.R.U.

On June 11, 2013, Epps was arrested while on board a departing flight at [[LAX]] airport for possession of a controlled substance after TSA agents found that his checked bag contained [[marijuana]] and [[promethazine]]. He was booked and charged with [[felony]] narcotics possession. Later that day he posted $10,000 bond and was released. He was due back in court on June 21, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/06/2-chainz-arrested-in-lax-for-possession-of-marijuana-and-promethazine/ |title=2 Chainz Arrested In LAX For Possession Of Marijuana And Promethazine – XXL |work=Xxlmag.com |date=June 11, 2013 |accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before midnight on August 21, 2013, Epps' tour bus was pulled over in [[Oklahoma City|Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], because the passenger side taillights were out.  The arresting officer reported that he smelled marijuana and saw smoke through the open door of the bus after he had stopped and pulled over the bus. The driver of the bus shut the door and told officers he was not authorized to allow them on the bus. The officer said the [[marijuana]] smell gave him probable cause to search, but the driver refused to open the door. After many attempts to enter, the bus was towed with the men still aboard to the police training center in Oklahoma City. Officers obtained a search warrant and the 10 men, including Epps, got off the bus. Police discovered two semi-automatic pistols and a 12-gauge pump shotgun, along with some prescription painkillers and marijuana residue, on the tour bus according to papers filed [[Oklahoma County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma County]] district Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MICHAEL MCNUTT mmcnutt@opubco.com • |url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-city-police-found-weapons-painkillers-on-rappers-tour-bus-court-papers-show/article/3878935 |title=Oklahoma City police found weapons, painkillers on rapper's tour bus, court papers show |website=News OK |date=September 3, 2013 |accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noah James Shebib''' (born March 31, 1983), better known as '''40''', is a Canadian [[record producer]] and former [[child actor]] from [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. He is best known for his musical collaborations with Canadian rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]; he has produced all of Drake's albums. Shebib's style of production, which is often down-tempo and ambient, has become heavily associated with Drake's music. 

Shebib and Drake are two of the three co-founders of the [[OVO Sound]] label. Shebib has also produced for artists including [[Lil Wayne]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Action Bronson]], and [[Jamie Foxx]].

==Early life==
Noah James Shebib is the son of director [[Donald Shebib]] and actress [[Tedde Moore]], who is known for appearing in the 1983 film ''[[A Christmas Story]]''; she was pregnant with him during the production of that film.&lt;ref name="mssociety" /&gt; On his mother's side, he is the grandson of actor and educator [[Mavor Moore]], the great-grandson of Canadian theatre figure [[Dora Mavor Moore]], and the great-great-grandson of Scottish-born economist [[James Mavor]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/radio/tapestry/the-redemptive-power-of-hip-hop-1.4752075/ovo-producer-noah-40-shebib-and-his-sister-suzanna-empower-youth-through-hip-hop-1.4752159&lt;/ref&gt; His father is of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/noah-40-shebib-recording-drakes-headlines&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/11/interview-noah-40-shebib-talks-take-care-drake/page/2|title=Interview: Noah "40" Shebib Talks Drake, "Take Care," and The History of Toronto Hip-Hop|publisher=|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has one sibling, a younger sister, Anna Oniell.

==Acting career==
Shebib began as a [[child actor]], playing roles in television shows and films. His first role was in the 1996 "Go Eat Worms" episode of the ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'' television series.  He also played a consistent role on the [[Gemini Award]]-winning television series, ''[[Wind at My Back]]''. His best-known role came in his teen years, when he was featured as one of the lead males in the critically acclaimed ''[[The Virgin Suicides (film)|The Virgin Suicides]]''. He also had smaller roles in ''[[The Last Don]]'' and ''[[Perfect Pie]]''; the latter was his last movie before he retired from acting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0790520/ Noah's acting career] "IMDB". Accessed on April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.complexmag.ca/music/2010/06/the-acting-career-of-drakes-producer-noah-40-shebib/goosebumps The Acting Career of Drake's Producer Noah "40" Shebib] "Complex". Accessed on August 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
Early in Noah's career, before he started crafting beats, he DJ'd under the name DJ Decibel and performed alongside MC Elite (Everett MacLean). Shebib eventually made the shift from DJ to music producer, working with local Toronto artists like Empire, Knamelis, Stolenowners, and Christopher Morales, and Saukrates. He earned the nickname "40 Days &amp; 40 Nights" (which was later reduced to "40") early on in his career, as he would work in the studio throughout the night, with no sleep.&lt;ref name="cnnvid" /&gt; 

He began working with then ''[[Degrassi: The Next Generation|Degrassi]]'' star [[Drake (musician)|Aubrey Graham]] (Drake) in 2005. He was shown producing with Drake on ''Degrassi Unscripted''. When Shebib first started working with Drake, he was originally just a recording  and mixing engineer, providing no songwriting or production input at all.&lt;ref name="sos" /&gt; However, after the third day of work, Shebib decided to build an exclusive relationship with Drake, proclaiming that they were "going to take over the world together." &lt;ref name="cnnvid" /&gt; 

Shebib's big break came in 2009, when he [[executive producer|executive produced]] Drake's mixtape ''[[So Far Gone (mixtape)|So Far Gone]]'' with Toronto-based producer, [[Boi-1da]]. He recorded and mixed every song off the mixtape, and also produced a few notable tracks such as "The Calm", "Houstatlantavegas", "Bria's Interlude" and "[[Successful (song)|Successful]]", all of which ended up defining Drake's sound going forward.&lt;ref name="gqinterview"&gt;[https://www.gq.com/entertainment/music/201111/noah-shebib-40-drake-take-care-producer Noah "40" Shebib interview on Take Care by Drake]. "GQ". Accessed on August 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked on Drake's debut album ''[[Thank Me Later]]'', and second album ''[[Take Care (album)|Take Care]]''.&lt;ref name="allmusiccredits"&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/noah-shebib-mn0001088755/credits Noah Shebib Credits]. "AllMusic". August 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the latter, Shebib co produced almost every song, alongside his usual duties of recording and mixing the entire album.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hiphop-n-more.com/2011/11/drake-take-care-booklet-production-credits/ Drake - Take Care Album Credits] "Hip Hop n More". Accessed on August 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Shebib also produced the song "I'm Single" from [[Lil Wayne]]'s "[[No Ceilings]]" mixtape, "[[Un-Thinkable (I'm Ready)]]" for [[Alicia Keys]] and "[[Demonstrate (song)|Demonstrate]]" for [[JoJo (singer)|JoJo]]. 

Shebib, along with Drake and Oliver El-Khatib, founded the [[October's Very Own|OVO]] record label in 2012. Music produced under the imprint is uploaded to the label's blog site for streaming, before the album is officially released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://octobersveryown.blogspot.ca/ OVO Blog] "October's Very Own". Accessed on August 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the single "[[Marvins Room]]", which was first posted to the blog site five days after its conception, before it was even slated to be a single off the album.&lt;ref name="sos" /&gt; Recently Shebib has helped produce Drake's newer material, co producing the lead single "[[Started from the Bottom]]", among other records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=TBTENTGROUP|title=Noah "40" Shebib talks "Started from the Bottom" and Drake's new album with Hollywood Reporter|url=http://www.hip-hopvibe.com/2013/02/07/noah-40-shebib-talks-started-from-the-bottom-and-drakes-new-album-with-hollywood-reporter/|publisher=Hip Hop Vibe|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shebib also worked on Drake's third album, ''[[Nothing Was the Same]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/drake-dream-team-how-noah-418975 The Drake Dream Team]. "The Hollywood Reporter". Accessed on August 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/08/02/drakes-new-album-nothing-was-the-same_n_3691516.html#slide=2765350 Drake's New Album]. "The Huffington Post". Accessed on August 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; his 2015 surprise release mixtape ''[[If You're Reading This It's Too Late]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/Drake-if-youre-reading-this-its-too-late-credits-lyrics Drake - If You're Reading This It's Too Late Credits]. "(rap)genius.com". Accessed on March 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and his fourth studio album ''[[Views (album)|Views]]''.

==Production style==
Shebib has been instrumental in creating [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]]'s music, and together their "atmospheric, brooding sound has revitalised hip-hop."&lt;ref name="sos"&gt;[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar12/articles/it-0312.htm Noah '40' Shebib: Recording Drake's 'Headlines'] "Sound On Sound". Accessed on August 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Shebib's production is described as "sparse, ambient, slow-jam-like tracks dominated by brooding synths, minimalist piano or guitar parts, stripped-down, often muffled drums, and cinematic atmospheric treatments."&lt;ref name="sos" /&gt; An example is the song "[[Marvins Room]]", where Shebib mixed the record so that it is "very dark and quiet and muddy and with the vocals cutting through like a razor" and is notorious for being heavy on the low end.&lt;ref name="sos" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2005, at the age of 22, Shebib was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name="cnnvid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/17/the-beat-goes-on-for-music-producer-diagnosed-with-multiple-sclerosis/?hpt=hp_c3|title=The beat goes on for music producer diagnosed with multiple sclerosis|publisher=CNN|author=Tinker, Ben|date=2012-04-17|accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mssociety"&gt;[http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Living-Well-With-MS/Personal-Stories/Ambassadors-Familiar-Faces/Noah-40-Shebib Noah "40" Shebib: The rap on MS] "National MS Society".

==Music career==
9th Wonder's first significant career breakthrough came in 2003 when, as an up-and-coming producer, he released an unofficial remix album of [[Nas (rapper)|Nas]]' 2002 album ''[[God's Son (album)|God's Son]]'' entitled ''[[God's Stepson]]''.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt; Released through internet outlets, the album garnered significant attention and acclaim.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt; The producer has said that he was not thinking in terms of using it to generate a buzz or promote his skills at that point: "I never thought any of this of me as a producer was going to happen."&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt; The album has since been credited as starting the now regular trend for unofficial 'home-made' remixes of whole albums.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt;

9th Wonder began his career as the main producer for the group [[Little Brother (group)|Little Brother]]. As part of Little Brother he gained recognition and critical acclaim for his production on their debut 2003 release, ''[[The Listening (Little Brother album)|The Listening]]''. [[Jay-Z]]'s studio engineer Young Guru was impressed with his work, and contacted 9th Wonder, which led to 9th Wonder producing "Threat" for Jay-Z's 2003 ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|The Black Album]]''.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt; The cut proved to be a mainstream breakthrough for 9th Wonder, most immediately in the major production role he secured on Destiny's Child's 2004 ''[[Destiny Fulfilled]]'' album that Jay-Z was instrumental in helping bring about.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt; On the album, 9th Wonder produced the tracks "[[Girl (Destiny's Child song)|Girl]]" and "Is She the Reason," plus the bonus track "Game Over".

9th Wonder left Little Brother in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopgame.com/news.php3?id=1510 |title=Hip Hop News Audio, News, Videos, Albums, Ringtones, Lyrics, Urban Wear |publisher=HipHopGame.com |date=January 27, 2007 |accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Listen to More: Producer, Underground |url=http://www.djbooth.net/index/interviews/entry/9th-wonder-interview-1011071/ |title=9th Wonder Interview |publisher=Djbooth.net |date=October 10, 2007 |accessdate=May 12, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613162350/http://www.djbooth.net/index/interviews/entry/9th-wonder-interview-1011071/ |archivedate=June 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 29, 2007, 9th Wonder made a rare public appearance on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s ''[[Rap City (BET program)|Rap City]]'', alongside collaborator [[Talib Kweli]]. [[Madlib]], [[Jean Grae]] and [[Erykah Badu]] appeared as well. In 2010, he appeared on BET's ''[[106 &amp; Park]]'' countdown with [[David Banner]].

9th Wonder, E. Jones, and rapper [[J. Cole]] served as the lead producers of the soundtrack to the [[EA Sports]] video game ''[[NBA Elite 11]]''. 9th Wonder and J. Cole also appear as "secret characters" in ''[[NBA Jam (2010 video game)|NBA Jam]]'' with a team name of Cole &amp; Wonder.

9th Wonder debuted his rapping alter-ego 9thmatic in late 2009. 9thmatic appeared on songs with [[Khrysis]] and [[Sean Boog]], Big Remo, [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]] and Thee Tom Hardy.

9th Wonder worked with Mississippi rapper [[David Banner]] on a collaborative album entitled ''[[Death of a Pop Star]]'' which was released on December 21, 2010.  After forming Jamla Records in 2010, he then went on produce for Jill Scott, Dilated Peoples, Big Boi of Outkast, and Anderson .Paak.

==It's a Wonderful World Music Group==
In January 2009, 9th Wonder announced plans to start two independent record labels, Jamla and The Academy, under his imprint [[It's A Wonderful World Music Group]] (IWWMG). Jamla originally consisted of [[Skyzoo]], GQ, [[Rapsody]], Tyler Woods and Big Remo, while The Academy consisted of Thee Tom Hardy, Actual Proof (Sundown &amp; Enigma), TP, and [[The Away Team (group)|The Away Team]] ([[Khrysis]] &amp; [[Sean Boog]]). The Academy artists were later folded into the Jamla label. Halo and Heather Victoria were announced as the newest members of IWWMG in October 2010.  Jamla Records now consists of artists GQ, Rapsody, Actual Proof, TP, Halo, &amp; Heather Victoria.

In July 2004 a.d., 9th Wonder officially debuted his production team for IWWMG. The Soul Council consists of [[Khrysis]], E. Jones, Ka$h Don't Make Beats, AMP, Eric G., Nottz, Hi-Tek and 9th Wonder himself.

==Recent and current projects==
In 2010, independent filmmaker Kenneth Price documented 9th Wonder's travels for an entire year. This included his times in the studio, classes he taught at [[Duke University]], and performances with Murs at the [[Rock the Bells#2010 Festival Series|2010 Rock the Bells Festival]], along with interviews with 9th Wonder about his life and career. All of this was compiled in a [[Lifted Research Group]]-sponsored documentary film titled ''The Wonder Year''. The film features appearances by [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]], DJ Premier, [[DJ Green Lantern]], J. Cole, Murs, Lucas Rivers, [[Sha Money XL]], Young Guru, [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]] and others. Price went on to direct music videos for artists on 9th Wonder's Jamla Records label.   In 2016, 9th Wonder's Jamla Records imprint signed a joint venture with [[Jay-Z]] and [[Roc Nation]].

In August 2010, Drake exchanged tweets with 9th Wonder on Twitter, expressing his desire to work with him again (the first time being the production of "Think Good Thoughts" featuring [[Phonte]] and [[Elzhi]] for his 2007 mixtape ''[[Comeback Season (mixtape)|Comeback Season]]''). It was revealed in October 2010 that 9th Wonder would be producing for Drake on his second album ''[[Take Care (album)|Take Care]]'', which was released on November 15, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horowitz |first=Steven J. |url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/10/07/drake-shares-producers-on-second-album-still-uncertain-of-title/ |title=Drake Shares Producers on Second Album, Still Uncertain of Title |publisher=Rap-Up Magazine |date=October 7, 2010 |accessdate=October 11, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101010102448/http://www.rap-up.com/2010/10/07/drake-shares-producers-on-second-album-still-uncertain-of-title/| archivedate= October 10, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a month prior to the release, 9th Wonder said in an interview that he would not appear on ''Take Care'' due to [[A&amp;R]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Iraheta|first=Mark|title=9th Wonder Will Not Appear on Drake's 'Take Care'|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/10/9th-wonder-will-not-appear-on-drakes-take-care|accessdate=October 16, 2011|newspaper=Complex Magazine|date=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer [[Chris Brown (American entertainer)|Chris Brown]] recorded a series of rap freestyles over 9th Wonder beats. The first was released on July 18, 2011, on YouTube under the title "Real Hip Hop #3." This was followed a day later by "Real Hip Hop #4" featuring [[Kevin McCall]]. These tracks were included in Brown's rap mixtape ''Boy In Detention'', released on August 5, 2011.&lt;ref name=9th-brownmixtape&gt;{{cite news|last=Markman|first=Rob|title=Chris Brown Drops Rap Mixtape, Boy In Detention|url=http://rapfix.mtv.com/2011/08/05/chris-brown-drops-rap-mixtape-boy-in-detention/|accessdate=August 5, 2011|publisher=MTV|date=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

9th Wonder produced [[Jill Scott]]'s "Beautiful Love" ft. [[BJ The Chicago Kid]] on her 2015 album release "Woman".  Rising Star [[Anderson .Paak]] also sought out 9th Wonder's production for "The Season" and "Without You" featuring [[Rapsody]] on his breakthrough release ''[[Malibu (album)|Malibu]]'' released coincidentally on 9th Wonder's birthday, January 15, 2016. 9th Wonder also collaborated with [[Big Boi]] of [[Outkast]] for the song "Put It On Her" for his release [[Big Grams]] in 2015.  In 2017, [[Kendrick Lamar]] tapped 9th Wonder to produce [[Duckworth (song)|DUCKWORTH.]],  the final track on his 4th studio album, ''[[Damn (Kendrick Lamar album)|DAMN]]'', where Kendrick tells the backstory of the meeting between his father and [[Anthony Tiffith]], also known as "Top Dawg" from [[Top Dawg Entertainment|TDE]].

==Hip hop professor and academia==
2007 saw a sideline move into music academia for 9th Wonder when he, along with [[Christopher "Play" Martin]] from hip hop group [[Kid-n-Play]], was appointed Artist-In-Residence by the Chancellor of [[North Carolina Central University]], and began instructing a hip hop history class in NCCU's Music Dept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nccu.edu/directory/details.cfm?id=pdouthit&amp;search=&amp;department=Music |title=Online Campus Directory |publisher=Nccu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His role as a music professor has proven an ongoing one as in January 2010 it was announced that 9th Wonder would co-teach a class titled "Sampling Soul" with Dr. Mark Anthony Neal at Duke University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=67160 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209234152/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=67160 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-09 |title=9th Wonder to Teach Course at Duke University &amp;#124; XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=2010-01-07 |accessdate=2012-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[HitQuarters]], he explained the reason for the move into academia: "Educating the youth on where hip-hop comes from and the history of it, using the records we use, gives hip-hop a longer life. I decided to become an advocate of that."&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_9thWonder_Interview.html |title=Interview With 9th Wonder |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=May 31, 2010 |accessdate=Jun 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 9th Wonder also recently took on a course titled "Intro To Hip Hop Production" &lt;ref&gt;[https://trinity.duke.edu/directory/people/d]&lt;/ref&gt;

9th has only continued his trek into the world of education, recently receiving acceptance from [[Harvard University]] to become a fellow in the Hip Hop Archive. 9th will spend three years working on a research project at Harvard’s W.E.B. Dubois Institute. For 9th's project titled "These Are The Breaks" he will be researching the original records that created his top 10 produced albums. He recently told XXL that he one day hopes to leave producing behind for good to focus on academics. A documentary also created by Kenneth Price, "The Hip-Hop Fellow" chronicled  9th becoming a W.E.B. Dubois Fellow at [[Harvard University]] under the direction Dr. [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] and Dr. Marcy Morgan at the Dubois Institute at The Hutchins Center.

He has continued his involvement with higher education by lecturing at various universities across the United States. In September 2012, 9th Wonder visited the [http://www.umich.edu/ University of Michigan] to speak on his beginnings in the music industry and hip hop's role in the classroom. His involvement with some of the top academic institutions in the country has validated hip hop as a true art form.  9th Wonder served as Artist In Residence at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in the Spring of 2016. In March 2017, 9th Wonder was the Artist in Residence at the [[University of Virginia]], giving his final lecture in [[The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|The Rotunda]] on the University grounds. Several other hip hop artists have found themselves on similar paths into the education realm including [[Questlove]] of [[The Roots]] and [[Bun B]] of [[UGK]].  9th is currently Artist of Residence at [[North Carolina Central University]] and [[Duke University]].

9th Wonder was also appointed to the Executive Committee of Hip-Hop and Rap at The [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] at [[The Smithsonian]] in Washington, DC.  He also has an exhibit on the 4th Floor in the Music Crossroads Section.

==Early life==
Born into a family of six as the last child, A-Q real name Gilbert Bani was raised in Surulere where he has lived for most of his life.

A-Q attended Kings College Lagos, and had his tertiary education at the University of Lagos. At a young age he started collecting hip-hop tracks, learning the lyrics and miming them. It didn’t take long before he started writing his own lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9jaolofofo.com.ng/super-sunday-9jaolofofo-meets-rapper-aq-exclusive-interview/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130714002417/http://9jaolofofo.com.ng/super-sunday-9jaolofofo-meets-rapper-aq-exclusive-interview/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-14 |title=9jaolofofo Meets Rapper ‘A-Q’ (Exclusive Interview) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
A-Q signed his first record deal in 2001 with Big Leaf Records where he was for two years before he started working on his own in 2003. His first single "(W)rap Nigeria", produced by kraftmatics, debuted in 2004 followed by a music video. He subsequently released a full compilation album ''Listen and Understand'' in 2005 followed by another single, "Things That We Do", which got him an international online distribution deal. In 2006 A-Q put out a mixtape titled ''Maga Must Pay vol 1.''

A-Q took a break from music to finish his education in [[University of Lagos]] but still managed to release a single, "Make Money", and accompanying video in 2008 produced by Laylow and featuring Morachi and Xtrim off an online mixtape titled ''Love and Money.''

A-Q graduated in 2010 and returned to the entertainment industry, this time co-floating a record label, Hustle Inc, on whose platform he started Black Friday Twitter Freestyles, a weekly free download release. This got him online acknowledgement including from producer Don Jazzy who styled him “one of the sickest rappers alive”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.underdarock.com/blog/don-jazzy-calls-a-q-one-of-the-sickest-rapper-alive/|title= one of the sickest rappers alive (Don Jazzy calls A-Q one of the sickest rapper alive)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded and released ''The Past Present and Future'' album in December 2010 which had the singles "Names" and "Champagne and Rum". He released more music including "Distractions" featuring Vector in 2012, "Machine Gun Flow", "555 (5beats 5verses and 5blessings)", and "Why" featuring Pamela.

He released an EP in December 2012 titled ''Make Your Best Rapper Look Stupid.'' He is currently working on his sophomore album titled ''G.I.L.B.E.R.T (Grace and Glory).''

While still a student, he began using graffiti around the university campus, as a protest against student conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, S, ''Precarious Lives: Waiting and Hope in Iran,'' University of Pennsylvania Press, 2017, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;  He was eventually expelled by the School's President following a disagreement over artistic restrictions. &lt;ref name="artcat"&gt;[http://zine.artcat.com/2008/07/interview.php Rebel Without a Crew: Street Artist A1one in Tehran], ''Artcat.com'', 21 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After being expelled from University, his graffiti activities in the city of [[Tehran]] increased. A1one was the first person to start painting on the city walls. His name can be interpreted as "Alone" or "First One." &lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, S., ''Precarious Lives: Waiting and Hope in Iran,'' University of Pennsylvania Press, 2017, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; A1one started painting walls in the late 1990s. He is the pioneer of the urban art scene in [[Middle East]]. When he began, it was a time when nobody knew what graffiti was in his country. He had a very influential role in the rise of street art and stenciling within Iran.&lt;ref name=theage&gt;{{cite news|title=Graffiti cops a spray|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2008/07/31/1217097393985.html|date=1 August 2008|accessdate=8 April 2015|last=Scott-Norman|first=Fiona}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialactive.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/graffitti-in-teheran-instigating-political-change/ Graffitti&lt;!--sic--&gt; in Tehran: Instigating Political Change], ''Socialactive.wordpress.com'', 16 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Already involved in urban arts in general, he met in 2005 the rapper Nima who told him everything about the graffiti culture which triggered A1one's desire to grow in that direction. His first significant work was a painting under the Tehran-Karaj expressway called ''Searching for Friends''.&lt;ref name="A1one first"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080712042707/http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ A1one: 1st generation Graffiti in Iran], ''Pingmap.jp'', 19 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his street art project in 2003 and inspired his close friends at that time to also begin painting on the streets. Artists such as Elle, isba, K.T. and Magoi were the first people to join him in Tehran. With his public space art, he describes his view on the Iranian society and puts himself regularly in danger.&lt;ref name="A1one first"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When I decided to do my painting on walls I bought some spray cans - at that time we had just some very low quality colors in Iran. My first work was a very simple work titled “searching for friends” painted on a wall right next to the Tehran-Karaj expressway late at night. It was a really frightening night for me… The next morning I got three calls from friends who recognized my style of painting. They were shocked to see my work on a public wall. My first stencil was a [[Edvard Munch|Munch's]] [[The Scream|Scream]] Print on Art University walls and after that , experimented with many techniques and methods, but I continue with stencils, graffiti and [[sticker art]]."&lt;ref name=pingmag&gt;{{cite web|title=A1one: 1st generation Graffiti in Iran |url=http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ |date=19 January 2007 |accessdate=8 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712042707/http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ |archivedate=12 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2007, he was invited to illustrate the cover of a book, ''Young and Defiant in Iran''; a contempary ethnographic work by Shahram Khosravi. &lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, S, ''Precarious Lives: Waiting and Hope in Iran,'' University of Pennsylvania Press, 2017, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he was invited to show his work at the annual Melbourne Stencil Festival, taking 40 pieces of work with him to his first trip in a non-dictatorship country, thus experimenting exhibiting his artwork without the fear of reprisals for the first time.&lt;ref name=theage/&gt;

By 2010, A1One was an established name within Tehran's youth culture and a key figure in the emergence of Iranian street art. &lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, S., "Graffiti in Tehran," ''Anthropology Now,'' Vol. 5, No. 1, 2013, pp 1-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Tehranurbanartalone.jpg|thumb|A1one Spray painted wall in Tehran 2006 ]]
A1one's art world is dynamic and made of many different styles, from portraits to calligraphy and funky characters which he mostly uses for his stickers. A1one's art combines [[Persian calligraphy]] and Western [[graffiti]]. His art has been documented by many photographers and featured in [[Art Asia Pacific]] Magazine.

The artist has been working on a distinctly Iranian style of calligraffiti, which is "a fusion of hip-hop graffiti and Persian typography."&lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, S, m ''Precarious Lives: Waiting and Hope in Iran,'' University of Pennsylvania Press, 2017, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; His style is recognised across the [[Islamic graffiti]] world. He has made a handful of the greatest Style walls with Arabic letter graffiti since 2004.&lt;ref name=fatcap2&gt;{{cite news|title=Le graffiti compte déjà de nombreuses formes. Il n'en est que plus intéressant quand il est développé dans des alphabets différents.

==Arrests==
He has been arrested several times and signed agreements with police not to work in streets.He attacked Iranian Artist Forum with His paintings, while The management of the Iranian artists forum did not understand his aim and stopped him and called the police.
In 2012 A1one was kidnapped by the [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran)]], under the charge of social and political reasons and was held in [[Evin Prison]] for 10 days at Ward 209.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''aaajiao''' （aka.Xu Wenkai） ({{zh|c= 徐文恺}}), is the online handle of Xu Wenkai,  a Shanghai- and Berlin-based artist, avid blogger and free thinker.

Born in 1984, aaajiao grew up in Xi’an, the ancient capital of Qin and Han Dynasty known for the Terracotta Army. The year of 1984, coinciding with [[George Orwell]]’s dystopian masterpiece, seems to explain the perfect alignment between the vivid SciTech-driven imagination and the sometimes-poetic sophistication, frequently seen as the main theme of aaajiao’s work. Many of aaajiao’s works tap into the most current trends of thoughts around the Internet sphere, with a focus on the emerging controversies and phenomenon related to data processing, blogsphere/wemedia and filtered information. In his most recent projects, the artist has adopted a more extended scope of practices, borrowing elements from architecture, electronic music, performance arts, product design, even medicine, to portray the young generation harnessing the power of cyber technology and the ever-present social media.

Being one of the most frequently exhibited Chinese new media artists, aaajiao has been featured in both international and domestic scenes. Highlights include: “Global Control And Censorship - [[ZKM]] | Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe(2015)”, The 2nd “CAFAM Future” Exhibition: Observer-Creator · The Reality Representation of Chinese Young Art Beijing, CAFA Art Museum (2015); Cosmos - Limited and Limitless, Existence and Co-existence Shanghai, 21st Century Minsheng Art Museum (2014),Thingworld - International Triennial of New Media Art Beijing,The [[National Art Museum of China]] (2014),The West Bund Architecture and Contemporary Art Biennale, Shanghai (2013); “One World” Exposition – Chinese Art in the Age of the New Media, Videotage, TransLife: Media Art China 2011 - International Triennial of New Media Art Beijing,The [[National Art Museum of China]] (2011),Hong Kong (2011); [[Transmediale]], Berlin (2010), etc. aaajiao is a winner of the Jury Prize from Art Sanya Awards 2014, a nominee of OCAT – Pierre Huber Art Prize, and most recently, a nominee of the “Young Artist of the Year” of 9th “Award of Art China”.

Although attitudes tend to guide attitude-relevant behavior, those held with ambivalence tend to do so to a lesser extent.

For this reason, researchers have considered two forms of ambivalence, only one of which is subjectively experienced as a state of conflict.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Types of attitudinal ambivalence ==

=== Felt ambivalence ===
The psychological literature has distinguished between several different forms of ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  One, often called '''subjective ambivalence''' or felt ambivalence, represents the [[Subjective experience|psychological experience]] of conflict (affective manifestation), mixed feelings, mixed reactions (cognitive manifestation), and indecision (behavioral manifestation) in the evaluation of some object.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Thompson, M. M., Zanna, M. P., &amp; Griffin, D. W. (1995). Let's not be indifferent about (attitudinal) ambivalence. In R. E. Petty &amp; J. A. Krosnick (Eds.), ''Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences'' (pp. 361-386). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103114000134|title = Wanting other attitudes: Actual-desired attitude discrepancies predict feelings of ambivalence and ambivalence consequences|author1=DeMarree K.G. |author2=Wheeler S.C. |author3=Brinol P. |author4=Petty R.E. |date = July 2014|journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|accessdate = November 3, 2014|doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2014.02.001|pmid =|volume=53|pages=5–18|hdl = 10486/666333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambivalence is not always acknowledged by the individual experiencing it. Although, when the individual becomes aware to a varying degree, discomfort is felt, which is elicited by the conflicting attitudes about a particular stimulus.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Subjective ambivalence is generally assessed using direct [[self-report]] measures regarding one's experience of conflict about the topic of interest.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Attitudes and Attitude Change: Attitudinal Ambivalence|author1=Conner M |author2=Armitage C.J. |publisher = Psychology Press|year = 2008|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = 261–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because subjective ambivalence is a secondary judgment of a primary evaluation (i.e., I'm conflicted ''of'' my positive attitude towards the president), it is considered to be [[Metacognition|metacognitive]]. The point of these measures is to find out how much a person experiences ambivalence in a particular evaluation. Their report may be provided in a number of ways.

Priester and Petty, for example, utilized a rating system where they had subjects rate the level of conflict they were experiencing on a scale from 0 (as in the subject experienced "no conflict at all") to 10 (as in the subject experienced "maximum conflict").&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, people do not like to experience the negative emotions associated with ambivalence and therefore may not acknowledge, or report, their level of conflict as accurately as possible. This makes the measure of felt ambivalence a bit less reliable than a researcher may desire.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Potential ambivalence ===
Another measure of ambivalence that has been developed is called '''objective ambivalence''' or potential ambivalence, which represents the simultaneous acknowledgement of both positive and negative evaluations regarding a particular stimulus. Objective ambivalence is an indirect measure of attitude conflict that allows individuals to answer questions based on more accessible aspects of their attitude and is therefore generally viewed as an advantageous means of measurement. This indirect measure does not assume that the individual has complete knowledge and/or awareness of their attitudinal conflict and helps to eliminate confounding factors that may be affecting their attitudes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Objective ambivalence is generally assessed using a method first developed by Kaplan, in which a standard bipolar attitude scale (e.g., extremely negative to extremely positive) is split into two separate scales, each independently assessing the magnitude of one valence (e.g., not at all negative to extremely negative).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; If a person endorses both positive and negative reactions towards the same object, then at least some objective ambivalence is present.

Kaplan initially operationalized ambivalence as the lesser of the two reactions (i.e., positive or negative evaluations), also called conflicting reactions (and contrasted with dominant reactions).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, if objective ambivalence towards exercising was assessed using two separate 6-point scales, and a person indicated that his or her evaluation was slightly negative (e.g., 2 on a 6-point scale) and extremely positive (e.g., 6 on a 6-point scale), this person's ambivalence would be quantified by the lesser of these two evaluations (i.e., 2 in this example).

&lt;u&gt;Kaplan's measure yields the formula&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;math&gt;Ambivalence = S+L - |S-L|=S&lt;/math&gt;

Here, S is representative of the smaller rating or reaction, and the L is representative of the larger rating or reaction.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

However, Kaplan's measure has largely been replaced in practice by one proposed by Thompson et al.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Thompson' s formula fulfills the three necessary conditions for any scale measuring ambivalence as suggested by Breckler.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/47/6/1191/|title = Empirical validation of affect, behavior, and cognition as distinct components of attitude|author= Breckler, Steven J.|date = 1984|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|accessdate = November 12, 2014|doi =10.1037/0022-3514.47.6.1191 |pmid =|volume=47|issue = 6|pages=1191–1205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three conditions are as follows:
# If the larger value is maintained, while the smaller rating increases, ambivalence will increase. 
# If the smaller value is maintained, while the larger rating increases, ambivalence will decrease.
# If both the larger and smaller values are the same, ambivalence will increase when both ratings increase (as the difference between the two will increase) or decrease as the values decrease.
&lt;u&gt;Thompson et al. refined Kaplan's formula to incorporate Breckler's components:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;math&gt;Ambivalence= (S+L)/2-|S-L|&lt;/math&gt;

The creation of this formula was pivotal because it accounts for both subjective and objective ratings.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Predictors of felt ambivalence ===
Research has shown only a moderate [[correlation]] between felt and potential ambivalence, although, both measures are useful depending on what is being asked. Potential ambivalence is often utilized by ambivalence researchers to gather more information about diversity of attitudes across contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Scope of Social Psychology: Theory and Applications (A Festschrift for Wolfgang Stroebe)|authors = Jonas, K., &amp; Ziegler, R.|publisher = Psychology|year = 2007|isbn = 9781135419745|location = |pages = 32–34|title-link = Wolfgang Stroebe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual experiences the after-effects of unpleasant feelings in a different way, whether or not associated with ambivalence awareness.

There are two primary moderators that link felt and potential ambivalence: ''simultaneous accessibility'' and ''preference for consistency''.

'''Simultaneous accessibility''' is when potential ambivalence depends on how quickly and uniformly conflicting evaluations come to mind.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Positive and negative knowledge regarding beliefs about an attitude object are concurrently known, but not always accessible. Only when the connection of the evaluations are applicable and coinciding to awareness, does potential ambivalence result in felt ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

'''Preference for consistency''' uses incentives to combine incoming stimuli with current variables in order to respond to approaching impulses. In other words, people often review past behaviors when making new decisions; if preference for consistency is high, they are more likely to ignore new information and are thus bias to past behaviors.

== Dimensions of attitudinal assessment as applied to ambivalence   ==

=== One-dimensional perspective ===
Traditionally, attitudes were considered one-dimensional—from positive to negative—but given the rise of research findings, this perspective has lost much of its value. Ambivalence studies were a primary reason that attitudinal assessments demanded a new design. Because the basic assumption of an ambivalent attitude is that it is paradoxical, a one-dimensional perspective is likely to portray faulty information. For instance, a numerical rating of zero can be produced both by someone with a [[Love hate relationship|love-hate relationship]] toward an object, and someone who is completely indifferent about that object.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Psychology of Attitudes and Attitude Change|author1=Maio, Gregory |author2=Haddock, Geoffrey |publisher = Sage Publications Inc.|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1-4129-2974-5|location = Thousand Oaks, California|pages = 33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a significant difference in the behaviors and experiences of those possessing strong conflicting attitudes, compared to those who are simply neutral. This perspective is unsuitable for examining ambivalence and based on current research does not appear to accurately reflect  how attitudes function and are experienced.

=== Two-dimensional perspective ===
The two-dimensional perspective separately rates positive and negative attitudes toward an attitudinal object.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The relative magnitude of positive and negative rankings are recognized by this model, providing a distinction between ambivalence and indifference. By comparing the magnitude of attitudes, the two-dimensional perspective also allows for an approximation of the degree of ambivalence; similarity in the magnitude of an individual’s positive and negative attitude towards an object indicating ambivalence, and the strength of these attitudes reveals its degree. The two-dimensional view can report everything the one-dimensional perspective can, but it has the added ability to account for ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Though this model of attitude is clearly more useful for understanding and potentially assessing ambivalence than a one dimensional model it still suffers numerous paradoxes which are difficult to argue away without acknowledging that there is more contributing to one's attitudes and their stability than perceptions regarding the object alone.  These issues prompt the recent emergence of multidimensional models.

=== Multidimensional perspective ===
The Multidimensional model for attitude deviates from the linear perspectives previously mentioned. Conceptually the multidimensional model can be thought of as a network of attitudinal hubs which form a web of contributions contributing to one's attitude about a particular object.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Thus ones attitude toward an object is a product of the attitudes one holds for all related objects which are activated consciously or unconsciously when considering the object in question, and is not simply an attribution regarding the object alone in a vacuum. Ambivalence occurs when there are near equal weight of contributions of both positive and negative sources according to this perspective. Note in this view the ambivalent attitude is not tied directly to the object but rather the near equivalence of positive and negative contributing attitudes.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

This model is very useful for understanding why attitude towards an object can fluctuate often within a relatively short span. If this model is accurate than a change in the degree of activation of particular objects related to the attitudinal object in question will alter the degree to which they contribute their attitudinal influence towards one's current attitude regarding the object in question.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This allows for variance in attitude towards an object without requiring any permanent change in one's beliefs regarding neither the object nor the objects related to it. According to this model one's attitude towards eating a high calorie dessert food would likely become more positive during times when an individual is hungry, as the centers associated with the satiation property of food are now more active and contributing more influence to the attitude regarding consuming the dessert. The other contributing attitudes do not need to have been suppressed (though they can be) for the temporary change in attitude all that is required, is an increase in the output of one contributor.

Continued or repeated activation of the same related objects to a given attitudinal object will likely be reinforced and over time lend more stability to the attitude, and are likely to diminish the activation of those objects not strongly activated; however it should be noted that the contributing objects are themselves also subject to changes in attitudes regarding
them, so no final resolution of stability will necessarily occur. In addition if the same conflicting attitudinal contributors are continuing to “fire together” they  will both be reinforced and thus may not contribute towards the resolution of ambivalence.

=== Meta-cognitive model ===
Not all attitude objects are linked to both positive and negative relations. This model is built on the idea that [[meta-cognition]] has to do with "knowing about knowing." The process works if someone has the knowledge about cognition and is also able to control their thoughts. An evaluation creates initial thoughts that are then analyzed by a secondary thought which may vary in strength toward an assessment. Once an evaluation is obtained, the strength of the validity affects how the interpretation is perceived. If a successful univalent attitude is achieved, final evaluations are labelled as either true or false based on varying degrees of confidence.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petty, P.E., Brinol, P., DeMarree, K. (2007). The
meta-cognitive model of attitudes: Implications for Attitude measurement,
change, and strength. [[Attitude (psychology)|Social Cognition.]]Vol 25, No. 5, 662, p.[[Attitude (psychology)|657-686]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consistency theories and ambivalence ==

=== Overview ===
Cognitive consistency theories were established on the premise that individuals prefer dependable and coherent cognition. Inconsistency in one's thoughts, feelings, emotions, values, beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors causes tension. In the past, consistency theorists focused primarily on the instinctive drive to reduce this psychological discomfort and return to a simple, balanced state. Unlike classical approaches, however, theories of attitudinal ambivalence are more concerned with the ''perceived ''[[paradoxical]] state itself.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Balance theory ===
[[Fritz Heider]] established the first approach in the growing family of consistency theories; [[balance theory]] seeks to understand one's thoughts regarding their personal relationship with others and with the environment. [[Triadic relation]]ships are used to evaluate the structure and quality of attitudes within a given arrangement.

Social ties, for example, can be analyzed in terms of an individual's perception of the relationships between his or her self ''(p)'', another person ''(o), ''and the topic (e.g., issue, belief, value, object) of focus ''(x)''. According to Heider, a balanced triangle is accomplished when all three links are positive, or two are negative and one is positive (since a positive number is still achieved).

The overall assumption of balance theory is rooted in the philosophy that unbalanced states have a tendency to wreak havoc.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Satisfying relationships require balance, otherwise, it is not uncommon to experience consequences like stress, tension, or ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Evaluative-cognitive consistency theory ===
Evaluative-cognitive consistency theory refers to a condition in which one holds opposing attitudes towards an object that are not of equal magnitude; the focus is the overall difference in evaluations, with no regard to magnitude.

“Ambivalence is a function of the ''amount of conflict'' within an attitude, whereas evaluative-cognitive consistency is a function of the ''magnitude of the difference'' between evaluations.”&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Handbook of Attitudes |last= Albarracin |last2=Johnson |last3=Zanna |first= Dolores |first2=Blair |first3=Mark |publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Mahwah, New Jersey|page = 332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a set of dimension scores, for example, positive 5 and negative 5 have the same degree of consistency as does the set of positive 9 and negative 1. Yet, the degree of ambivalence in each set is vastly different. This distinction is important when examining the implications and effects of ambivalence, since seemingly similar ratings are in fact quite different.

The two-dimensional perspective of attitudinal assessment can distinguish between ambivalence and evaluative-cognitive consistency. As ratings increase, both ambivalence and evaluative-cognitive consistency have a tendency to be less stable and less effective at predicting behavior.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Past studies have linked ambivalent mental states to slower response times (due to low accessibility) and mild attitudes, although theories of evaluative-cognitive consistency have yet to report such findings.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Cognitive dissonance theory ===
The feeling of discomfort that results from inconsistent cognition is a powerful determinant of human behavior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The emergence of research on intellectual tension dates back to the mid-20th century, and has been a hot topic in [[social psychology]] ever since. In 1957, [[Leon Festinger]] was the first to investigate the phenomenon, thereupon coining the theory of [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Concepts of Balance, Congruity, and Dissonance |last=Zajonc |first=Robert B. |author-link=Robert Zajonc |journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]] |date=Summer 1960 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=280–296 |doi=10.1086/266949 |jstor=2746406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Festinger and other early psychologists held the notion that cognitive dissonance was the result of any ''two ''conflicting thoughts or opinions. Currently, however, research has proven that not all cognitive inconsistencies are equally upsetting, for it is not necessarily the dissonance itself that causes strife, rather, it is the individuals construct of the given contention.

Dissonance, then, is characterized as a discrepancy between an attitude held by an individual and the actual behavior that is practiced by that individual, whereas ambivalence is seen as having a disparity within the attitude itself.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Though unique, the ambivalent state, still, is closely connected to dissonance theory, being its most common product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/39/6/735.full.pdf+html|title = Feeling Conflicted and Seeking Information: When Ambivalence Enhances and Diminishes Selective Exposure to  Attitude-Consistent Information |authors=Sawicki, Wegener, Clark, Fabrigar, Smith, Durso |date=2013 |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |doi=10.1177/0146167213481388 |pmid=23482502 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=735–747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals seek to satisfy a stable and positive self-image.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; For this reason, the greatest tension is encountered when there is an incongruity between who one thinks they are and their actual behavior. Such threats to [[self-esteem]] evoke motivation to rid oneself of the distress. According to present research, there are three widely accepted methods to reduce cognitive dissonance:
# Justify the behavior by changing the dissonant cognition
# Justify the behavior by adding new cognitions
# Change the behavior to meet the dissonant cognition

== Motivation and information processing ==
As noted above, the desire to maintain one's preconceived notions can have vast implications. Studies have shown it is not uncommon for people to distort reality while attempting reduce ambivalence. The manner by which one chooses to replace unwanted thoughts is mostly an unconscious process, yet several factors influence the ability and likelihood of doing so.

=== Heuristic-systematic model ===
Information processing for ambivalent attitudes is less efficient and takes longer than processing of attitudes that are relatively univalent. The information is less accessible, so it takes longer for a person to integrate multiple viewpoints regarding an attitude object into one cohesive opinion or judgement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Conner, M., &amp; Armitage, C. J. (2008). Attitudinal ambivalence. In W. D. Crano &amp; R. Prislin (Eds.), ''Attitudes and attitude change'' (pp. 261-286). New York, NY: Psychology Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of accessibility here does serve to reduce a biased thought process. Yet, since it takes a greater amount of effort to resolve two conflicting attitudes, if one desires to form a conclusion, a more extensive thought process is necessary.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Antecedents of ambivalence ==

=== Behavioral indicators ===
Researchers have sought to understand the relationship between objective and subjective ambivalence. Thompson and his colleagues argue that people with positive and negative evaluations which are of similar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -3) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are of dissimilar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -1). Similarly, they argue that even with relatively similar positive and negative evaluations, people whose evaluations are more extreme (e.g., +6 and -5) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are less extreme (e.g., +2 and -1).

&lt;u&gt;The Griffin formula, also known as the similarity-intensity model&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;math&gt;Ambivalence = (P + N) / 2 - |P-N|&lt;/math&gt;

Here, P and N are the magnitude of positive and negative reactions, respectively.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Some research has stated that as the relative contribution of dominant reactions decreases, the magnitude of conflicting reactions increases.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Other studies have found that objective ambivalence predicts subjective ambivalence to a greater extent when both the positive and negative reactions are accessible, or when a decision about the attitude object is imminent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Still, more evidence has demonstrated that objective ambivalence is not the only precursor to subjective ambivalence. For example, '''interpersonal ambivalence''', the presence of attitudes which are in conflict with those of important others, independently predicts subjective ambivalence, as does the mere anticipation of information which may conflict with one's preexisting attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Priester | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Petty | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Park | first3 = K. | year = 2007 | title = Whence univalent ambivalence? From the anticipation of conflicting reactions | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 11–21 | doi = 10.1086/513042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both personal and circumstantial aspects must be considered in order to accurately assess relationship sustainability between subjective and objective ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Individual differences ===
Individual characteristics are essential in deciding the most beneficial coping strategies. Research has shown that certain personality traits may impact an individuals likelihood of experiencing ambivalence. There are certain personality traits that aren't as relevant to ambivalence, such as the need for closure. Other components may alter these traits that may contribute toward ambivalence, such as tolerance to ambiguity. Particularly, those possessing the [[need for cognition]], or the inclination to evaluate the discrepancies between positive and negative emotions, are less likely to experience ambivalence. In other words, the desire to resolve issues, which requires a great deal of cognitive resources, fosters cognitive strength and thus the ability to overcome ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Ambivalent attitudes that demonstrate weakness are accessed slower than strong attitudes. This leads to a conflict called response competition; the process of slowing down responses because of the difficulty to choose between positive and negative beliefs and feelings. Bottom-up processing shows how greater cognitive effort entwined with combined beliefs results in non congruent information. Once individuals are confronted several choices, they are then followed by uncertain outcomes.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009" /&gt; Thus concluding that slower response times may be due to systematic processing.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Individuals with a greater concern for invalidity experience a heightened amount of ambivalence, presumably because they are concerned with making wrongful judgments, and as a result, efforts to adjust attitude become inhibited.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Response to ambivalence, then, is affected by an individual's need for consistency; hence, the higher the need for consistency, the more adverse the reaction will be to maintaining two contradictory attitudes simultaneously, whereas someone with a reduced need for consistency will experience less mental frustration&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Those seeking to rectify inconsistencies and resolve conflict are able to reject ambivalence better than most.

Additionally, some individuals have a more pronounced fear of invalidity than others. When this fear is experienced to a stronger degree, these individuals will not want to acknowledge the ambivalence as it is especially uncomfortable. Since the ambiguity is not being resolved, it will persist within the person.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Gebauer, Maio, and Pakizeh discuss the possibility that many perfectionists, despite the seemingly positive qualities exerted, are at risk of neglecting internal inconsistencies. Consequently, it is not unlikely for those individuals to confront a plethora of unexplained, ambivalent feelings.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Goal conflicts ===
Ambivalence will emerge when two (or more) goals valued by an individual are in conflict regarding the same attitudinal object. The individual becomes ambivalent about the object to which they both reference, not as much when regarding the individual goals themselves.

Many decisions as common as food consumption or selection can invoke some degree of ambivalence
every day. An action can seem to have pleasant outcomes, but it can simultaneously cause issues as well.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Emotions or attitudes that are ambivalent may spark both quick and far-off consequences that are inconsistent.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Harreveld | first1 = F. | last2 = van der Pligt | first2 = J. | last3 = de Liver | first3 = Y. | year = 2009 | title = The agony of ambivalence and ways to resolve it: Introducing the MAID model | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 45–61 | doi = 10.1177/1088868308324518 | pmid=19144904}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chronic dieter, for example, may experience ambivalence between the goals of eating enjoyment and weight control. Each of these goals independently are viewed as positive, but when conjoined in regards to actually eating more food, the resulting conflict prompts ambivalence. The object of eating enjoyment and the object of losing weight are both regarded with positive attitude, but these two goals are incongruent with each other and are both activated when considering eating.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The goal driven ambivalence that produces several forms of behavior modification may have profound implications on the behaviors and outcomes. Some examples are overcoming addiction, procrastination, health maintenance, and many others. Much of the focus of previous work has been concentrated on pain avoidance and pleasure seeking (focus on the ambivalent object itself), and not enough to the "pleasure" goal objectives related to and driving the conflict. Under certain circumstances, people who are exposed to unpleasant experiences are motivated to decrease unpleasant feelings toward ambivalence. One way to accomplish such a task is by acquiring new knowledge that can result in more immediate conclusions about the attitude object, or result in an adjustment in the individuals attitudes regarding the contributing goals which prompted the conflict.

Ambivalent attitudes that demonstrate weakness are accessed slower than strong attitudes and are thought to have less of an influence on behavior. This leads to a conflict called response competition; the process of slowing down responses because of the difficulty to choose between positive and negative beliefs and feelings. Bottom-up processing shows how greater cognitive effort entwined with combined beliefs results in incongruent information. Once individuals are confronted several choices, they are then followed by uncertain outcomes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Thus concluding that slower response times may be due to systematic processing.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009"/&gt;

=== Value conflicts ===
Ambivalence is often the result of conflict arising from personal or social values. Different cultures, and the individuals within them, have different values surrounding race, ethnicity, nationality, class, religion or beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and health status. [[Social constructs]] and perceived norms and [[values]] within a given society create contradictory feelings for many individuals. If opposing values are activated by the same object they are likely to clash upon encounter.

Conflicted value items do not need to come from the same category, but to be considered a contributor of ambivalence, discordance must occur.

The attitudinal object of women in the workplace could, for example, be affected by religious or political values. The contributing value systems are both held in positive regard but are opposed to each other in reference to the attitudinal ambivalent item. The amount of ambivalence experienced corresponds to the positive regard of each value contributing to the conflict. In other words, weakly held conflicting values should not generate as much ambivalence as strongly held values.

=== Affective-cognitive ambivalence ===
Affective ambivalence (A+/A-) refers to disparity between feelings, whereas cognitive ambivalence (C+/C-) focuses on the disagreement between beliefs. Together, the notion of affective-cognitive ambivalence (A+/C-) or (A-/C+) embodies the commonly known conundrum of “''the heart vs. mind conflict.''”

When each state is in balance, the influence on attitude is equal (A+/C+). Yet, there is compelling evidence that affect tends to overpower cognition (A+/C-).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

That is to say, the degree of ambivalence construed at any given moment can alter the mechanisms by which one views the world. When ambivalent cognitive states become psychologically agonizing, motivation rises to eliminate distress.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hass | first1 = R.

== Consequences of ambivalence as a dimension of attitude strength ==

=== Attitude stability ===
Ambivalence is often conceptualized as a negative predictor of attitude strength.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; That is, as an attitude becomes more ambivalent, its strength decreases. Strong attitudes are those that are stable over time, resistant to change, and predict behavior and information processing.&lt;ref&gt;Krosnick, J. A., &amp; Petty, R. E. (1995). Attitude strength: An overview. In R. E. Petty &amp; J. A. Krosnick (Eds.), ''Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences'' (pp. 1-24). Mahwah, NJ:  Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found that ambivalent attitudes are less stable over time, less resistant to change, and less predictive of behavior.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://psp.sagepub.com/content/26/11/1421.short|title = Attitudinal Ambivalence: A Test of Three Key Hypothesis|last = Armitage |last2=Conner|first =Christopher J. | first2= Mark |date = 2000|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |accessdate = November 3, 2014|doi =10.1177/0146167200263009 |pmid =|volume=26|issue = 11|pages=1421–1432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haddock | first1 = G | year = 2003 | title = Making a party leader less of a party member: The impact of ambivalence on assimilation and contrast effects in political party attitudes | url = | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 769–780 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-9221.2003.00353.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambivalent attitudes are subject to change based on the concepts, feelings, or objects that are salient at the time. Since an ambivalent attitude is one in which positive and negative feelings are held simultaneously, the strength of either may wax or wane depending on what context the individual finds themselves in; different aspects of an attitude may be activated across situations.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Attitude pliability ===
Ambivalent attitudes are known to be susceptible to [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Since there is less certainty associated with an ambivalent attitude, both facts and trivial information are assessed, assimilated, and determinant of one's attitude. Accordingly, this may [[bias]] or persuade an individual's attitude. Strong attitudes, on the other hand, are less likely to be manipulated because they are essentially "anchored in knowledge structures".&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Armitage and Conner conducted a study regarding attitudes toward eating a low-fat diet.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Attitudes of a high ambivalence group and a low ambivalence group were recorded two times within five months. Following an attitude change intervention the high ambivalence group demonstrated a significant positive change in attitude toward the diet (compared to a control group) whereas the low ambivalence group demonstrated very little change if any.

In situations that highlight one dimension over the other, individuals who are high in ambivalence are more likely to embrace the clear-cut better aspect of the attitude object.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Ambivalence in clinical psychology ==
=== Bleuler's tripartite scheme ===
The concept of ambivalence was introduced into psychiatric parlance by [[Eugen Bleuler]], who used it in print for the first time in his 1910 article ''Vortrag über Ambivalenz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite journal | last=Bleuler |first=Eugen |authorlink=Eugen Bleuler |title=Vortrag über Ambivalenz |trans-title=Lecture on Ambivalence |url=http://www.sgipt.org/medppp/gesch/ambiv-g.htm#Aus%20dem%20Zentralblatt%20f%C3%BCr%20Psychoanalyse%201,%201911,%20S. |journal=Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse [Central Journal for Psychoanalysis] |location=[[Bern]] |year=1910 |issue=1 |pages=266-268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laplanche |first1=Jean |last2=Pontalis |first2=Jean-Bertrand |authorlink1=Jean Laplanche |authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis |chapter=Ambivalence (pp. 26–28) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Ambivalence+Ambivalenz |title=The Language of Psycho-analysis |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Karnac Books |location=London |year=1988 |edition=reprint, revised |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=tV99AAAAMAAJ 1973] |isbn=978-0-946-43949-2 |page=[https://books.google.it/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=%22Bleuler,+E.+%27Vortrag+iiber+Ambivalenz%27+(1910)%22 28]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Bleuler distinguished three main types of ambivalence: volitional, intellectual, and emotional.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards ed, Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 128n.&lt;/ref&gt; Volitional ambivalence refers to an inability to decide on an action—what [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] called "a spirit justly balanced betweene two equal desires".&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne, ''Essays Vol II'' (1938) p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept (if not Bleuler's term) had a long prehistory, reaching back through [[Buridan's ass]], starving between two equally attractive bales of hay in the Middle Ages, to [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Paradise'' (1975) p. 81-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectual ambivalence—the [[Philosophical scepticism|sceptical belief]] that "There is no reason but hath a contrary to it"&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne, ''Essays Vol II'' (1938) p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; —also follows a long tradition reaching back through Montaigne to [[Sextus Empiricus]] and [[Pyrrho]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Boardman ed, ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (1991) p. 715-6 and p. 842.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Freud]] considered Bleuler's stress on intellectual ambivalence particularly appropriate given his own ambivalence towards Freud's intellectual constructs, alternatively praising and criticizing them).&lt;ref&gt;E. Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (1964) p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional ambivalence involved opposing affective attitudes towards the same object, as with the man who both loved and hated his wife.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

While mainly dealing with ambivalence in relation to the [[Splitting (psychology)|psychological splitting]] of schizophrenia, Bleuler also noted how "in the dreams of healthy persons, affective as well as intellectual ambivalence is a common phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freudian usage ===
Freud was swift to pickup Bleuler's concept of ambivalence, applying it to areas he had previously dealt with in terms of ambiguous language,&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; or the persistent co-existence of love and hatred aimed at the same person.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 118-9&lt;/ref&gt; Freud also extended the scope of Bleuler's term to cover the co-existence of active and passive trends in the same instinctual impulse&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p.  261&lt;/ref&gt;—what Freud called "pairs of contrary component instincts" such as looking and being looked at.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Abraham]] explored the presence of ambivalence in mourning—something he thought to be a universal phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;D. Leader, ''The New Black'' (2008) p. 61-6&lt;/ref&gt; Others in [[psychoanalysis]] have traced the roots of contradictory impulses (usually love and hate) to very early stages of [[psychosexual development]].&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, ''Childhood and Society'' (1973) p. 72-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Defences against feeling both of the two contradictory emotions include [[psychological repression]], [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]] and [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 157 and p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for example, an [[analysand|analytic patient]]'s love for his father might be quite consciously experienced and openly expressed—while his "hate" for the same object might be heavily repressed and only indirectly expressed, and thus only revealed in analysis.  A [[Substance dependence|drug addict]] may feel ambivalently about their drug of choice; they are aware of their drug use as a negative-impact agent in their lives (socially, financially, physically, etc.) while simultaneously seeking and using the drug because of the positive-impact results they receive from the drug's usage (the "high"). (More recent discourse of addiction as a mental health concern and chemically-induced/encoded ''imperative'', rather than as a behavioral ''choice'', complicates the notion of ambivalence as it relates to addiction.)

Another relevant distinction is that whereas the psychoanalytic notion of "ambivalence" sees it as engendered by all [[neurosis|neurotic]] [[Emotional conflict|conflict]], a person's everyday "mixed feelings" may easily be based on a quite realistic assessment of the imperfect nature of the thing being considered.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3902">{{about|the hypothetical self-replicating spacecraft concept|the side game from Space Quest III|Astro Chicken}}

'''Astrochicken''' is the name given to a [[thought experiment]] expounded by [[theoretical physicist]] [[Freeman Dyson]]. In his book ''Disturbing the Universe'' (1979), Dyson contemplated how humanity could build a small, [[Self-replication|self-replicating]] automaton that could explore space more efficiently than a manned craft could. He attributed the general idea to [[John von Neumann]], based on a lecture von Neumann gave in 1948 titled ''The General and Logical Theory of Automata''. Dyson expanded on von Neumann's [[Automata theory|automata theories]] and added a biological component to them.

Astrochicken, Dyson explained, would be a one-kilogram [[spacecraft]] unlike any before it. It would be a creation of the intersection of biology, [[artificial intelligence]] and modern microelectronics&amp;mdash;a blend of organic and electronic components. Astrochicken would be launched by a conventional spacecraft into space, like an egg being laid into space. Astrochicken would then hatch and start growing a solar-energy collector. The solar collector would feed an [[ion drive]] engine that would power the craft. Once Astrochicken entered a planet's vicinity, it would collect material from the moons and rings of the planet, taking in nutrients. It could land and take off using an auxiliary chemical rocket similar to that used by [[bombardier beetle]]s. It would periodically transmit details of its journey when it could make radio contact with Earth.

The term "astrochicken" does not occur in Dyson's earliest essays regarding [[Self-replicating_spacecraft#Von_Neumann_probes|von Neumann-inspired automata]]. The concept was announced in a lecture Dyson was giving in [[Adelaide, Australia]] on the subject of space exploration with [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/cc121802.html|title=Cambridge Conference Correspondence|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An audience member called out "Oh, you mean this is an astro-chicken." and the whimsical name caught on, with Dyson beginning to use it himself in subsequent essays he wrote on his theoretical biotechnology spacecraft.

Today, Dyson's Astrochicken resonates with several theories of how space exploration might proceed in the future. Computer scientist [[Rodney Brooks]] has proposed sending a multitude of cheap, bug-like robots to explore Mars instead of solitary, expensive rovers. Cheaper and smaller means of studying space have also been the primary design philosophy of [[NASA]] for many years, perhaps best exemplified by the [[Mars Pathfinder]] mission. Physicist and noted author [[Michio Kaku]] wrote in his work ''Hyperspace'', "Small, lightweight, and intelligent, Astrochicken is a versatile space probe that has a clear advantage over the bulky, exorbitantly expensive space missions of the past, which have been a bottleneck to space exploration. ... It will not need huge quantities of rocket fuel; it will be bred and programmed to 'eat' ice and hydrocarbons found in the rings surrounding the outer planets".

As a noted author of essays on the possibilities of science in the future, Dyson's theories, such as the [[Dyson sphere]] and the [[Dyson tree]], have become popular in the scientific and [[science fiction]] communities. The more whimsically named "Astrochicken" has not achieved this same level of fame.

In the theory of [[Autowave|autowave phenomena]] an '''autowave reverberator''' is an autowave [[vortex]] in a two-dimensional [[Excitable medium|active medium]].&lt;ref group="note" name="P001"/&gt;

A reverberator appears a result of a rupture in the front of a plane autowave. Such a rupture may occur, for example, via collision of the front with a nonexcitable obstacle. In this case, depending on the conditions, either of two phenomena may arise: a ''[[spiral wave]]'', which rotates around the obstacle, or an ''autowave reverberator'' which rotates with its tip free.

== Introduction ==
{{confusing|section|date=March 2014}}
The ''reverberator'' was one of the first autowave solutions, researchers found, and, because of this historical context, it remains by nowadays the most studied autowave object.

Up until the late 20th century, the term "''auto-wave reverberator''" was used very active and widely in the scientific literature, written by soviet authors, because of active developing these investigations in [[USSR]] (for more details, see "A brief history of autowave researches" in [[Autowave]]). And, inasmuch as the soviet scientific literature was very often republished in English translation (see e.g.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Yakhno-1979en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Yakhno-1987en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Biktashev-1989en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Volobuev-1997en"/&gt;), the term "''autowave reverberator''" became known also in English-speaking countries.

The ''reverberator'' is often confused with another state of the active medium, which is similar to it, - with the ''spiral wave''. Indeed, at a superficial glance, these two autowave solutions look almost identical. Moreover, the situation is further complicated by the fact that the spiral wave may under certain circumstances become the reverberator, and the reverberator may, on the contrary, become the spiral wave!

However, it must be remembered that many features of ''rotating autowaves'' were quite thoroughly studied as long ago as the 1970s,  and already at that time some significant differences in properties of a spiral wave and a reverberator were revealed. Unfortunately, all the detailed  knowledge from those years remains now scattered in different publications of the 1970-1990s, which became little-known now even for the new generations of researchers, not to mention the people that are far from this research topic.  Perhaps, the only book in that it were more or less completely brought together in the form of abstracts basic information about autowaves, known at the time of its publication, remains still the Proceedings „Autowave processes in systems with diffusion“,&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; which was published in 1981 and became already a rare bibliographic edition in nowadays; its content was partially reiterated in another book&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Ardashev-2009p06"/&gt; in 2009.

The differences between a reverberator and a spiral wave are considered below in detail. But for the beginning it is useful to demonstrate these differences with a simple analogy. Everyone knows well the seasons of a year... Under some conditions, winter can turn into summer, and summer, on the contrary, into winter; and, moreover, these miraculous transformations occur quite regularly! However, though a winter and a summer are similar, for example, in regular alternation of day and night, you cannot think of saying that winter and summer are the same thing, can you? Nearly the same things are with reverberator and spiral waves; and therefore they should not be confused.

It is useful also to keep in mind that it is known now, in addition to the rotating-wave, quite a number of other autowave solutions, and every year the number grows continuously with increasing speed. Because of these causes (or as a result of these events), it was found during the 21st century that many of the conclusions about the properties of autowaves, - which were widely known among readers of the early papers on the subject as well as widely discussed in the press of that time, - unfortunately, proved to be a sort of erroneous hasty generalizations.

=== "Historical" definition ===

{{centered pull quote|An important difference between a reverberator and a spiral wave rotating around the hole, which is similar to reverberator in the form, is that the reverberator is not tied to any structure in the medium. Due to this property, reverberators can appear and disappear at different locations of the medium.

=== On the question of terminology  ===

{{centered pull quote|We note here some of the subtleties the established terminology. A ''rotating autowave'' in two-dimensional medium is called by various authors as ''spiral wave'', ''reverberator'', ''rotor'', ''vortex'' or even ''scroll wave''. However, one should take into account that these terms are not functionally interchangeable nevertheless (they are not entire synonyms). Briefly the differences between them are as follows.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ordinarily, the term "spiral wave" refers only to the autowaves rotating around a nonexcitable obstacle in the medium that is of sufficiently large size (that is, in this case, such extent, in which the obstacle is small compared with the size of the medium, and is, however, large enough to provide the autowave break). The tip of the spiral wave moves always along the border of the nonexcitable obstacles.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The most important difference between an autowave reverberator and a close to it in the form spiral wave, which rotates around the obstacle, is that the reverberator is not tied to any structure in the medium. Due to this property reverberators can occur in different places of medium, not only in the absence of nonexcitable obstacles, but generally in a completely homogeneous medium (under appropriate initial conditions). In English scientific literature the most similar in meaning is the term "rotor".&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Winfree-1991"/&gt; However,  we give preference to the term reverberator, although it is now less used (in English literature) than the term "rotor", because it has two advantages being: 1) short enough and 2) not busy with other meaning (while the rotor is  taken already to call [[Rotor (electric)|the moving part of an electric motor]], and, in addition, the term is used in the [[Curl (mathematics)|mathematical theory of the field]]). (...) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for the term "autowave vortex", it can be asserted (at a some stretch, which is especially easy for mathematicians) that reverberator is a two-dimensional vortex (and this is plain truth from the point of view of mathematics). For the natural sciences, which are also biophysics as well as modern medicine, two-dimensional objects do not exist in the real world, and therefore one can say only very conditionally about such two-dimensional objects in these sciences, implying that, in the context of the issues discussed, the thickness of the medium does not affect the behaviour of the phenomenon under consideration. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Looking ahead, we say that a ''simple scroll'' is called a three-dimensional vortex that presents identical reverberators at any given time in each section perpendicular to its axis of rotation, and so its behaviour in each of the section is almost identical with behaviour of the reverberator. But this happens only in very limited circumstances, and, in common way, a simple scroll can easily be transformed into more complex objects. Therefore, the substitution of the terms "scroll" and "reverberator" in this case is completely irrelevant, and the term "scroll", in opinion of the authors, is appropriate to use only for description of rotating autowaves in three-dimensional media — i.e., in the cases where you can not neglect the effects caused by the thickness of the medium.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In light of these terminological remarks, we will write "'''2D-autovortex'''" ("'''two-dimensional autowave vortex'''") in the subsequent text, speaking generally about the autowaves rotating in two-dimensional medium ;  and particularly, describing behaviour of 2D-autovortex, we will use the appropriate clarifying term - for example, "spiral wave" or "reverberator".

Отметим здесь же некоторые тонкости установившейся терминологии. Разные авторы называют вращающиеся в двумерной среде автоволны ''спиральными волнами'' (''spiral wave''), ''ревербераторами'', ''роторами'' (''rotor''), ''автоволновыми вихрями'' (''vortex'') или даже ''свитками'' (''scroll wave''). Однако следует учитывать, что всё же эти термины не являются полными синонимами. Вкратце различия между ними следующие. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Термином «спиральная волна» обозначают обычно лишь  автоволны, вращающиеся вокруг невозбудимого препятствия в среде достаточно большой протяженности, то есть в данном случае такой протяженности, в которой препятствие является малым по сравнению с размером среды, однако достаточно большим, чтобы обеспечивать разрыв автоволны. В спиральной волне ее кончик движется по границе невозбудимого препятствия. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Важнейшим отличием ревербератора от близкой к нему по форме спиральной волны, вращающейся вокруг отверстия, является то, что ревербератор не привязан к какой-либо структуре в среде. Благодаря этому свойству ревербераторы могут возникать в разных местах среды, причем не только при отсутствии невозбудимых препятствия, но и вообще в полностью однородной среде (при подходящих начальных условиях). В англоязычной литературе наиболее близким по смыслу является термин «ротор». Однако в  своем изложении мы будем предпочтение отдавать термину ревербератор: хотя оно в настоящее время менее используется, чем термин «ротор», однако имеет два преимущества, одновременно являясь и достаточно коротким, и не занятым другими значениями (в то время как ротором, например, принято уже называть движущуюся часть электромотора, и, кроме того, этот термин широко используется в математической теории поля). (...) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Что же до терминов «автоволновой вихрь», то с некоторыми натяжками (особенно легкими для математиков) можно утверждать, что ревербератор — это двумерный вихрь (и это с точки зрения математики абсолютно верно). Для естественных наук, каковыми являются и биофизика, и современная медицина, двумерных объектов не существует в реальном мире, и поэтому о двумерных объектах в этих науках говорят лишь очень условно, подразумевая при этом лишь то, что в контексте обсуждаемых вопросов толщина среды не сказывается на поведении рассматриваемого или изучаемого явления. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Забегая вперед, скажем, что свитком ('''''простым свитком''''') называют такой трехмерный вихрь,  который в каждый момент времени в сечении, перпендикулярном своей оси вращения, являет собой идентичные ревербераторы, и поэтому его поведение в каждом из сечений практически тождественно поведению ревербератора. Но это происходит лишь в очень ограниченных условиях, а в остальных случаях простой свиток трансформируется в более сложные объекты. Поэтому в данном случае подмена терминов «свиток» и «ревербератор» является совершенно неуместной, и термин «свиток», по мнению авторов, уместно использовать лишь при описании автоволн, вращающихся в трехмерных средах, — то есть в тех случаях, когда нельзя пренебречь эффектами, обусловленными толщиной рассматриваемой среды. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
В свете этих терминологических замечаний мы в дальнейшем изложении, говоря вообще о вращающихся в двумерной среде  автоволнах, будем использовать сокращение '''''2D-автовихрь''''' ('''''двумерный автоволновой вихрь'''''), а в частных случаях описания поведения 2D-автовихря мы будем использовать соответствующий уточняющий термин: например, «спиральная волна» или «ревербератор».

== Types of  reverberator behaviour ==
{{confusing|section|date=March 2014}}

=== The "classical" regimes ===

[[File:Diagram of reverberator evolution in FitzHugh-Nagumo model.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of the evolution of reverberator for FitzHugh-Nagumo model (in accordance with the results of A.&amp;nbsp;Winfrey&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Winfree-1991"/&gt;): ''β'' — parameter of the model that corresponds to the excitation threshold, ''ε'' — parameter of the model that corresponds to  relaxation ability of the active medium, ''∂P'' — "the propagation boundary", out which any autowave propagation is impossible, ''∂R'' — the boundary of existence of the reverberators (the "rotor boundary"), ''∂M'' —  the meander boundary, ''∂C'' — the boundary of hyper-meander.]]

Various autowave regimes, such as ''plane waves''  or ''spiral waves'' can exist in an active media, but only under certain conditions on the medium properties. Using the [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model|FitzhHugh-Nagumo model]] for a generic active medium, [[Arthur Winfree|Winfree]]&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Winfree-1991"/&gt; constructed a diagram  depicting the regions of parameter space in which the principle phenomena may be observed. Such diagrams are a common way of presenting the different dynamical regimes observed in both experimental and theoretical settings. They are sometimes called ''flower gardens'' since the paths traced by autowave tips may often resemble the petals of a flower. A flower garden for the FitzHugh-Nagumo model is shown to the right. It contains: the line ''∂P'', which confines the range of the model parameters under which impulses can propagate through one-dimensional medium, and ''plane autowaves'' can spread in the two-dimensional medium; the "rotor boundary" ''∂R'', which confines the range of the parameters under which there can be the reverberators rotating around fixed cores (i.e. performing uniform circular rotation); the ''meander'' boundary ''∂M'' and the ''hyper-meander'' boundary ''∂C'', which confine the areas where two-period and more complex (possibly chaotic) regimes can exist. Rotating autowaves with large cores exist only in the areas with parameters close to the boundary ''∂R''.

Similar autowave regimes were also obtained for the other models — Beeler-Reuter model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Efimov-1995"/&gt; Barkley model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Belinec-1977"/&gt; Aliev-Panfilov model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Aliev-1996"/&gt; Fenton-Karma model etc.

It was also shown&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kokoz-1973"/&gt; that these simple autowave regimes should be common to all active media because a system of [[differential equation]]s of any complexity, which describes this or that active medium, can be always simplified to two equations.

In the simplest case without drift (i.e., the regime of ''uniform circular rotation''), the tip of a reverberator rotates around a fixed point along the circumference of a certain radius (the circular motion of the ''tip of the reverberator''). The autowave  cannot penetrate into the circle bounded by this circumference. As far as it approaches the centre of the reverberator rotation, the amplitude of the excitation pulse is reduced, and, at a relatively low excitability of the medium there is a region of finite size in the centre of  reverberator, where the amplitude of the excitation pulse is zero (recall that we speak now about a homogeneous medium, for each point of which its properties are the same). This area of low amplitude in the centre of the reverberator is usually called ''the core of the reverberator''. The existence of such a region in the center of reverberator seems, at first glance, quite incomprehensible, as it borders all the time with the excited sites. A detailed investigation of this phenomenon showed&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; that resting area in the centre of reverberator remains of its normal excitability, and the existence of a quiescent region in the centre of the reverberator is related to the phenomenon of the critical curvature. In the case of "infinite" homogeneous medium, the core radius and the speed of the rotor rotation are determined only by the properties of the medium itself, rather than the initial conditions. The shape of the front of the rotating spiral wave in the distance from the centre of rotation is close to the evolvent of the circumference - the boundaries of its core.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Wiener-1946"/&gt;  The certain  size of the core of the reverberator is conditioned by that the excitation wave, which circulates in a closed path, should completely fit in this path without bumping into its own [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory tail]].

As the ''critical size'' of the reverberator, it is understood as the minimum size of the homogeneous medium in which the reverberator can exist indefinitely. For assessing the critical size of the reverberator one uses sometimes the size of its core, assuming that adjacent to the core region of the medium should be sufficient for the existence of sustainable re-entry. However, the quantitative study of the dependence of the reverberator  behaviour on conductivity  of rapid transmembrane current (that characterize the excitability of the medium), it was found&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; that the critical size of the reverberator  and the size its core are its different characteristics, and the critical size of the reverberator is much greater, in many cases, than the size of its core (i.e. reverberator dies, even the case, if its core fits easily in the boundaries of the medium and its drift is absent)

=== Regimes of induced drift  ===

At meander and hyper-meander, the displacement of the center of autowave rotation (i.e. its drift) is influenced by the forces generated by the very same rotating autowave.

However, in result of  the scientific study of rotating autowaves was also identified a number of external conditions that force reverberator drift. It can be, for example, the heterogeneity of the active medium by any parameter. Perhaps, it is  the works Biktasheva,&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Biktashev-1989en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-1995"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-2010"/&gt; where different types of the reverberator drift are currently represented the most completely (although there are other authors&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Davydov-1988"/&gt; who are also involved in the study of drift of the autowave reverberator).

In particular, Biktashev offers&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-2007"/&gt; to distinguish the following types of reverberator drift in the active medium:
# Resonant drift.
# Inhomogeneity induced drift.
# Anisotropy induced drift.
# Boundary induced drift  (see also&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Biktashev-1989en"/&gt;).
# Interaction of spirals.
# High frequency induced drift.

Note that even for such a simple question, what should be called a drift of autowaves, and what should  not be called, there is still no agreement among researchers. Some researchers (mostly mathematicians) tends to consider as reverberator drift only those of its displacement, which occur under the influence of external events (and this view is determined exactly by the peculiarity of the mathematical approach to the study of autowaves). The other part of the researchers did not find significant differences between the spontaneous displacement of reverberator in result of  the events generated by it itself, and its displacement as a result of external influences; and therefore these researchers tend to believe that meander and hyper-meander are also variants of drift, namely ''the spontaneous drift of the reverberator''. There was not debate on this question of terminology in the scientific literature, but it can be found easily these features of describing the same phenomena by the different authors.

=== Autowave lacet  ===

In the numerical study of reverberator using the Aliev-Panfilov model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Aliev-1996"/&gt; the phenomenon of [[bifurcation memory]] was revealed, when the reverberator changes spontaneously its behaviour from ''meander'' to ''uniform circular rotation''; this new regime was named ''autowave lacet''.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Elkin-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Moskalenko-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Ardashev-2009p06"/&gt;

Briefly, spontaneous deceleration of the reverberator drift by the forces generated by the reverberator itself occurs during the autowave lacet, with the velocity of its drift decreasing gradually down to zero in the result. The regime meander thus degenerates into a simple uniform circular rotation. As already mentioned, this unusual process is related to phenomenon of bifurcation memory.

When autowave lacet was discovered, the first question arose: Does the ''meander'' exist ever or the halt of the reverberator  drift can be observed every time in all the cases, which are called meander, if the observation will be sufficiently long? The comparative quantitative analysis of the drift velocity of reverberator in the regimes of ''meander'' and ''lacet'' revealed a clear difference between these two types of evolution of the reverberator: while the drift velocity quickly goes to a stationary value during meander,  a steady decrease in the drift velocity of the vortex can be observed during the lacet, in which can be clearly identified the phase of slow deceleration and phase of rapid deceleration of the drift velocity.

The revealing of autowave lacet may be important for [[cardiology]]. It is known that reverberators show remarkable stability of their properties, they behave "at their discretion", and their behaviour can significantly affect only the events that occur near the tip of reverberator. The fact that the behaviour of the reverberator can significantly affected only by the events that occur near its core, results, for example, in the fact that, at a meeting with reverberator nonexcitability heterogeneity (e.g. small myocardial scar), the tip of the rotating wave "sticks" to this heterogeneity, and reverberator begins to rotate around the stationary nonexcitability obstacles. The transition  from  polymorphic to monomorphic [[tachycardia]]  is observed on the [[ECG]] in such cases. This phenomenon is called the "''anchoring''" of spiral wave.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kukushkin-2004"/&gt;
However, it was found in the simulations that spontaneous transition of polymorphic tachycardia in monomorphic one can be observed also on the ECG during the autowave lacet&lt;!-- (see. Fig.) --&gt;; in other words, the ''lacet'' may be another mechanism of transformation of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in a monomorphic.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Moskalenko-2007b"/&gt; Thus, the autowave theory predicts the existence of special type of ventricular arrhythmias, conditionally called "lacetic",&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Moskalenko-2012"/&gt; which cardiologists do not still distinguish in diagnostics.

== The reasons for distinguishing between variants of rotating autowaves  ==
{{confusing|section|date=March 2014}}
Recall that from 1970th&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; to the present time it is customary to distinguish three variants rotating autowaves: 
# wave in the ring, 
# spiral wave,
# autowave reverberator.

[[File:Сritical size of reverberator.png|thumb|300px|left|Critical size of reverberator (reconstructed on the base of data of {{nobr|A.M. Percov}} and {{nobr|A.V. Panfilov}},&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; obtained for the FitzHugh-Nagumo model). '''A'''.&amp;nbsp;The relation between the critical size and the size of the core. '''Б'''.&amp;nbsp;The dependence of the critical sizes of the reverberator and the autowave running around the ring on the conduction of rapid current ''g''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; . '''В'''.&amp;nbsp;Dependence of the period of the reverberator and the running around the ring on ''g''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;. '''Г'''.&amp;nbsp;Dependence of the refractoriness of the medium(''R'') on ''g''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; for the plane wave (curvature ''k''=0.83) and the plane wave.]]
Dimensions of the core of reverberator is usually less than the minimal critical size of the circular path of circulation, which is associated with the phenomenon of ''critical curvature''. In addition, the refractory period appears to be longer for the waves with non-zero curvature (reverberator and spiral wave) and begins to increase with decreasing the excitability of the medium  before the refractory period for the plane waves (in the case of circular rotation). These and other significant differences between the reverberator and the circular rotation of excitation wave make us distinguish these two regimes of re-entry.

The figure shows the differences found in the behavior of the plane autowave circulating in the ring and reverberator. You can see that, in the same local characteristics of the excitable medium (excitability, refractoriness, etc., given by the nonlinear member), there are significant quantitative differences between dependencies of the reverberator characteristics and characteristics  of the regime of one-dimensional rotation of impulse, although respective dependencies match qualitatively.
&lt;!-- 
More details about the causes of distinguishing between these three variants will be described in section "[[Автоволны/Вращающаяся автоволна|Вращающаяся автоволна]]"

The theme of [[chirality (chemistry)|chemical chirality]], or the "handedness" of the molecular structure of certain substances, appears in many works of fiction.

==Books==
Although little was known about [[chirality (chemistry)|chemical chirality]] in the time of [[Lewis Carroll]], his work ''[[Through the Looking-glass]]'' contains a prescient reference to the differing biological activities of [[enantiomer]]ic drugs: "Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn't good to drink," Alice said to her cat. A supplemental story to ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' made reference to this, mentioning in passing that after her return from the mirror world, her body was mirror-flipped, presumably down to the molecular level, as she was unable to digest food afterwards.

In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s short story "[[Technical Error]]" (also titled "The Reversed Man"), a technician working on a giant superconducting generator is accidentally "inverted" into his mirror image, right down to the coins in his pocket. When he is found to be starving despite an apparently-healthy diet, the culprit is determined to be the amino acids in his food, which are natural amino acids and opposite in chirality to those his body now requires.

[[Isaac Asimov]]'s short story "[[Left to Right]]" concerns an unknown "change in parity", and mentions biological incompatibilities due to chirality as one possible consequence.

In [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]'s novel ''[[The Documents in the Case]]'', a murder is committed that is designed to appear as accidental death from eating poisonous mushrooms containing [[muscarine]]. The case is proved to be murder because the muscarine found in the deceased's stomach is [[racemic mixture|racemic]] and therefore [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]].

In [[James Blish]]'s Star Trek novella ''[[Spock Must Die!]]'', [[Spock]]'s mirror-duplicate is later discovered to have stolen chemical reagents from the medical bay to convert certain amino acids to opposite-chirality isomers that his metabolism requires.

In [[Spider Robinson]]'s Callahan's Place short story "Mirror/rorriM On the Wall", a mirror is constructed of [[thiotimoline]] which leads to a parallel but inverted universe. A character attempts to smuggle food between the two universes to sell as a diet product, since the amino acids are reversed and provide no [[caloric]] value.

In [[Larry Niven]]'s ''[[Destiny's Road]]'', the title planet's indigenous life is based upon [[right-handed protein]]s. When human colonists arrive from Earth via a [[generation ship]], extreme measures are taken to permit the colony's survival. A peninsula is sterilized with a lander's [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] drive, creating the titular "road" out of fused bedrock. The area is then reseeded with Earth life to provide the colonists with food. Though the soil lacks [[potassium]] due to other factors, necessitating supplements that produce a [[hydraulic empire]] common to Niven's fiction, the colony otherwise prospers. Native viruses and bacteria cannot infect colonists, resulting in longer lifespans. Sealife quickly recovers, and is consumed by the colonists as a "diet" food, as their digestive systems cannot metabolize it into fat.

[[Marti Steussy]]'s ''Dreams of Dawn'' (1988) has a similar premise, where the locals evolved based on right-handed [[amino acids]].

The denouement of [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''[[After Doomsday]]'' relies partly on chirality.

The plot of [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[Doorways in the Sand]]'' centers around a device called the Rhennius Machine, which reverses objects that pass through it, down to the atomic level. It is mentioned that an earlier version of the machine destroyed itself by reversing matter to antimatter.

[[Daniel Suarez (author)|Daniel Suarez]]'s novel ''[[Change Agent]]'' includes a character "the Mirror man" who is immune to neurotoxins due to his mirrored chirality.

In [[Damon Knight]]'s ''[[A For Anything]]'', Leroy Platt uses a matter duplicator to make food; "Eating the food, too: Why not? Just put it through twice, make sure you don't get any reversed peptide chains."

==Computer games==
In the ''[[Trauma Center (video game series)|Trauma Center]]'' series of games, doctors test for a "chiral reaction" in order to determine whether or not a patient is infected with "'''G'''angliated '''U'''trophin '''I'''mmuno '''L'''atency '''T'''oxin," a fictional, parasitic pathogen more commonly referred to as ''GUILT''. A positive reaction means the patient is infected, while a negative reaction means the patient has either been cured or is not infected.

In the video game ''[[Mass Effect]]'', the turian and quarian alien species have biology based upon right-handed amino acids. Because of this, foods from other species which have life forms based upon left-handed amino acids have no nutritional value and may cause fatal allergic reactions. The process works both ways—species based on left-handed acids, such as humans, cannot consume food from the turian or quarian homeworlds. Left-handed amino acids are portrayed as being more common than right-handed versions. The chirality difference is colloquially referred to as "Levo" and "Dextro" by characters in the game.

==Television==
The television series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' features the "Heisenberg" method of [[methamphetamine]] manufacture, which produces a 99% chirally pure product.

The '''Coda''' is a group of [[fictional]] female [[warrior]]s in [[Wildstorm]] [[comic book|comics]]. The Coda first appeared in ''[[WildC.A.T.S.]]'' volume 1 #1 (August, 1992) and were created by [[Brandon Choi]] and [[Jim Lee]]. 

==Fictional background==
The Coda are a particular race of all female aliens who live on the planet Khera. They are trained in their own unique form of martial arts. Their weapon of choice is the Clef Blade, a weapon resembling a harpoon or a lance, though they often wield swords or even modern firearms. Coda warriors usually wear red markings on their face.  A sign (usually a circle) on the forehead and stripes on the cheeks) depicting their ranking within the sisterhood. A second class group of Coda warriors of different species have formed on various planets, carrying the blood of original Coda warriors only.

===Khera===
The Coda was founded on the planet Khera, home to the [[Kherubim]]. The Kherubim were a race blessed with longevity, but the downside was that they had become nearly infertile. Childbirth was a great honor and therefore every Kheran had to participate in a ritual in which a Kheran female and a Kheran male had to couple once. Should the female become pregnant and give birth, she would go on to become a priestess. Otherwise she could do with her life as she pleased. [[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lady Zannah]] had been selected to mate with [[Mister Majestic|Majestros]] and their union did result in childbirth, the child [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Kenesha]]. Zannah, though, loved being a warrior; so her mother, Harmony, proposed a plan: She would tell her people that Zannah's child had died, and would raise Kenesha as her own daughter. Zannah accepted, and Harmony became a figure of legend, the only Kherubim to have given birth to more than one child in ages. This legend was the foundation of the Sisterhood known as the Coda, a completely female [[caste]] of warriors, devoted to the honor of combat. Their male counterpart is known as the Brotherhood of the Sword. Over the millennia, the Coda would grow in power, and at present they are the second largest political faction within Kherubim society. Only the Pantheon is slightly larger. The Coda's headquarters is Zealot's former home, the Tower of Red Lament. Among the Coda on Khera, there is a small cell of elite assassins called the Skein. They have no known counterpart among the Earthborn Coda. The first rule of The Coda is: ''The weapon is the extension of the flesh, the flesh of the mind, the mind of the soul''.

===Earth===
The Kherubim were at war with the [[Daemonite]]s, another spacefaring race. During a ship-to-ship combat, a Kheran and a Daemonite vessel crashlanded on Earth. Both Zannah and Kenesha were on board this vessel. The Kherubim were physically identical to humans and quickly integrated within human society, inspiring tales of superhuman heroes, gods and angels. The Daemonites had the ability to possess human hosts and inspired tales of possession, demons and monsters. Their war continued underground. 

To aid them in their war, Zannah, now called Zealot and two of her fellow Coda generals, Andromache and Artemis, started training human Coda Warriors, giving birth to the myth of the Amazons. They established a hidden Coda city on Mt. Themyscira in [[Greece]]. Kenesha took the name [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]], but had no desire to join the Coda. As the Earthborn sisterhood are not born immortals, the immortal members take part in a ''Blood Dance'' with the newer members worthy of being called Coda Warriors. In the ritual they cut each other in a ritualistic dance and rub each other's wounds, thus mingling the blood, transferring the immortal blood into the non-immortal. The blood of a Kherubim, mingled with a human's during a special ritual, gave the gift of longevity to normal humans and this became an important ritual for Earth's Coda. The Kheran Coda sisterhood have been shown to perform this ritual also, but as they are all immortal, their reasons have more to do with the symbolic than with the need for survival. The Coda's Cleft Blades, both on Khera and on Earth, are considered very sacred to the sisterhood. They are only to be used in a death duel or in their ritual Blood Dance. During a battle near Troy (presumably the [[Trojan War]]), Zealot's actions branded her as a traitor to the rest of the Coda, to be killed on sight. The Coda general Andromache took over the role of [[Majestrix]]. Under her rule the Coda began selling their skills to the highest bidders and became less noble warriors and more power hungry conquerors. They also began establishing smaller Coda bases around the world. Though Mt. Themyscira still proved to be the oldest and most sacred of homes to the Amazons, the Coda have also been shown to reside in a massive island off the coast of Africa which they refer to as the Coda Citadel, as discovered by members of [[Gen¹³]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gen¹³'' (vol. 2), #3-5&lt;/ref&gt;  As Zealot was seen as a traitor to the sisterhood, she became a constant target of The Coda for several centuries.

[[Image:CodaWarrior.JPG|thumb|[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Zealot]] displays standard Coda weapons, such as the Cleft Blade]]
In the mid 20th century, Zealot trained [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]] in the fighting style of the Coda, making him the first male Coda. When the Coda discovered this they marked Grifter a target for extermination as they believed the Coda ways are only to be carried by women. By now many Coda were working for the Cabal, an organisation founded by the Daemonites. Zealot, Grifter and Savant all were part of the [[WildC.A.T.s]] and Zealot also eventually trained WildC.A.T.s member [[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]] in the Coda martial arts. The WildC.A.T.s and Coda fought often. The WildC.A.T.s returned once to Khera where Zealot was nearly assassinated by her own Coda Sisters, just to make her a martyr for their cause. Zealot was disgusted with the Sisters betrayal of their ideals and returned to Earth with the other WildC.A.T.s.

Several months later on Earth, Zealot apparently died on a mission causing the WildC.A.T.s to disband. She decided that the actions of the Coda on Earth and on Khera proved that the Coda had become corrupt and decided that the corruption had to be destroyed. She set out to single-handedly erase the Coda from the face of the Earth. She killed all Coda in America she could find, but spared Grifter, because of their shared romantic past. She warned him not to follow her.

Zealot continued her quest in Europe and destroyed most of the Coda there, but was captured by their top agent, The Grand Sarin. Grifter gathered several allies to save her, resulting in a war between his forces and the Coda. In the end, his small group turned out not to be enough, but Grifter called in the help of former WildC.A.T.s member and his current employer, [[Spartan (comics)|Jack Marlowe]], who used his powers to teleport part of the Mediterranean Sea on top of the Coda, drowning many of them. Majestrix Andromache survived and with her surviving troops she faced Grifter and his friends. At the same time FBI-agent Chandler, whose partner had been killed by the Coda, had found the Coda's armory. Chandler detonated the armory, blowing up the entire Coda base. Grifter and his friends were teleported away by Marlowe in time, but Andromache and her soldiers were caught in the blast.

Currently there are only few Earth-born Coda left. Majestrix Andromache was among the Coda fighting Grifter and his allies and died in the explosion. Recently, in the pages of ''Majestic'', [[Mister Majestic]] and Zealot have encountered Kherubim Coda Warriors on Earth. Also the Coda-traitor Charis (known as [[Nemesis (Wildstorm)|Nemesis]]) recently joined forces with the former WildC.A.T.s in the pages of ''Wildcats: Nemesis''. During the ''Wildstorm Armageddon'' story line The few remaining Coda were gathered up by the thought long dead Devin, formerly excommunicated acolyte of their order who survived into obscurity until the end of the world occurred. Gathering up the few remaining Coda survivors of the Post Apocalyptic world to create her own sisterhood, with her as Majestrix, which expanded its numbers through the weary travelers and soccer moms looking for safe respite that only her sect could provide, all while keeping any capable males captured as breeding labor in order to proliferate their ranks; Devin would eventually come into conflict with a past [[Caitlin Fairchild]] and her weathered survivor friends of [[Gen 13]].

==Notable members==
*Andromache, Kheran Majestrix of the Coda on Earth. Presumed dead.
*Artemis, a Kheran general who followed Zealot to Earth.
*Olympia Atreides, WildC.A.T.S. member and possibly the sole [[Daemonite]] Coda.
*Baroness Destine, killed by Zealot.
*Christine Blaze, Agent of [[International Operations]], infiltrated the Coda.
*Cassandra, Coda warrior stationed in the Himalayas. She killed Susanna Chaste and in return was killed by [[Divine Right (comic)|Max Faraday]] using her life-energy to resurrect Susanna. 
*Cordelia, Matriarch of the Coda and ruler of Melanesia. Former ally of [[Team 7]].
*Delphae, the Coda mystic/shaman with the power to open teleportation portals.
*Devin, disfigured assassin charged to capture Voodoo. Thought to have been expired in the second attempt but survives unto the future World's End event as Majestrix of remaining coda.
*The Grand Sarin, Coda assassin in special powered armour. Said to be the best assassin among the Earth-born Coda. Killed by Grifter in [[Ladytron (comics)|Ladytron]]'s body.
*[[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]], sole male Coda.
*Lady Harmony, mother of Lady Zannah and head of the Kheran Coda sect called the Skein. She was killed in battle.
*Sister Maxima is the only known over-weight Coda warrior. She's an earth born Coda and resides at the Coda Citadel off the coast of Africa.
*[[Nemesis (Wildstorm)|Nemesis]] (real name: Charis), a member of the Adrastea class from [[Kherubim|Khera]].
*[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Zealot]], former Majestrix of the Coda of Earth

Note: both [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]] and [[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]] have had Coda-training, but neither have devoted themselves enough to be considered true Coda warriors.

'''Codd's cellular automaton''' is a [[cellular automaton]] (CA) devised by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[computer science|computer scientist]] [[Edgar F. Codd]] in 1968. It was designed to recreate the computation- and construction-universality of [[von Neumann cellular automaton|von Neumann's CA]] but with fewer states: 8 instead of 29. Codd showed that it was possible to make a self-reproducing machine in his CA, in a similar way to von Neumann's [[von Neumann Universal Constructor|universal constructor]], but never gave a complete implementation.

==History==
In the 1940s and '50s, [[John von Neumann]] posed the following problem:&lt;ref name=vonNeumann66&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/index.html| title=''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata.''|last=von Neumann|first=John|last2=Burks|first2=Arthur W.|year=1966|publisher=www.walenz.org|accessdate=2012-01-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105213853/http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/index.html|archivedate=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*What kind of logical organization is sufficient for an automaton to be able to reproduce itself?
He was able to construct a [[von Neumann cellular automaton|cellular automaton]] with 29 states, and with it a [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]]. Codd, building on von Neumann's work, found a simpler machine with eight states.&lt;ref name=Codd68&gt;{{cite book|author=Codd, Edgar F.|title=Cellular Automata|publisher=Academic Press, New York|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; This modified von Neumann's question:
*What kind of logical organization is ''necessary'' for an automaton to be able to reproduce itself?

Three years after Codd's work, Edwin Roger Banks showed a 4-state CA in his PhD thesis that was also capable of universal computation and construction, but again did not implement a self-reproducing machine.&lt;ref name=Banks1971&gt;{{cite book|title=Information Processing and Transmission in Cellular Automata|year=1971| first=Edwin| last=Banks|publisher=PhD thesis, MIT, Department of Mechanical Engineering|url=http://www.bottomlayer.com/bottom/banks/banks_commentary.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Devore, in his 1973 masters thesis, tweaked Codd's rules to greatly reduce the size of Codd's design, to the extent that it could be implemented in the computers of that time. However, the data tape for self-replication was too long; Devore's original design was later able to complete replication using [[Golly (program)|Golly]]. [[Christopher Langton]] made another tweak to Codd's cellular automaton in 1984 to create [[Langton's loops]], exhibiting self-replication with far fewer cells than that needed for self-reproduction in previous rules, at the cost of removing the ability for universal computation and construction.&lt;ref name=Langton84&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0167-2789(84)90256-2|title=Self-Reproduction in Cellular Automata|author=Langton, C. G.|year=1984| journal=Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena|volume=10|issue=1-2|pages=135–144|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/24968/1/0000395.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specification==

[[Image:Codd CA ConstructionArm.gif|right|frame|100px|The construction arm in Codd's CA can be moved into position using the commands listed in the text. Here the arm turns left, then right, then writes a cell before retracting along the same path.]]

Codd's CA has eight states determined by a [[von Neumann neighborhood]] with rotational symmetry. 

The table below shows the signal-trains needed to accomplish different tasks. Some of the signal trains need to be separated by two blanks (state 1) on the wire to avoid interference, so the 'extend' signal-train used in the image at the top appears here as '70116011'.

==Universal computer-constructor==

Codd designed a self-replicating computer in the cellular automaton, based on [[Wang B-machine|Wang's W-machine]]. However, the design was so colossal that it evaded implementation until 2009, when Tim Hutton constructed an explicit configuration.&lt;ref name=Hutton2010 /&gt; There were some minor errors in Codd's design, so Hutton's implementation differs slightly, in both the configuration and the ruleset.

'''Ethical egoism'''  is the [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] position that [[Moral agency|moral agent]]s ought to do what is in their own [[self-interest]]. It differs from [[psychological egoism]], which claims that [[people]] can only act in their self-interest. Ethical egoism also differs from [[rational egoism]], which holds that it is [[rationality|rational]] to act in one's self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Steven M. "Is egoism morally defensible?" ''Philosophia''. Springer Netherlands. Volume 18, Numbers 2–3 / July 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
Ethical egoism holds, therefore, that actions whose consequences will benefit the doer can be considered ethical in this sense.

Ethical egoism contrasts with ethical [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]], which holds that moral agents have an [[moral obligation|obligation]] to help others. Egoism and altruism both contrast with ethical [[utilitarianism]], which holds that a moral agent should treat one's [[Philosophy of self|self]] (also known as [[subject (philosophy)|the subject]]) with no higher regard than one has for others (as egoism does, by elevating self-interests and "the self" to a status not granted to others). But it also holds that one should not (as altruism does) sacrifice one's own interests to help others' interests, so long as one's own interests (i.e. one's own [[desire (philosophy)|desires]] or [[Quality of life|well-being]]) are substantially equivalent to the others' interests and well-being. Egoism, utilitarianism, and altruism are all forms of [[consequentialism]], but egoism and altruism contrast with utilitarianism, in that egoism and altruism are both [[Consequentialism#Agent-focused or agent-neutral|agent-focused]] forms of consequentialism (i.e. subject-focused or [[Subjectivity|subjective]]). However, utilitarianism is held to be agent-neutral (i.e. [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[Impartiality|impartial]]): it does not treat the subject's (i.e. the self's, i.e. the moral "agent's") own interests as being more or less important than the interests, desires, or well-being of others.

Ethical egoism does not, however, require moral agents to harm the interests and well-being of others when making moral deliberation; e.g. what is in an agent's self-interest may be incidentally detrimental, beneficial, or neutral in its effect on others. [[Individualism]] allows for others' interest and well-being to be disregarded or not, as long as what is chosen is efficacious in satisfying the self-interest of the agent. Nor does ethical egoism necessarily entail that, in pursuing self-interest, one ought always to do what one wants to do; e.g. in the long term, the fulfillment of short-term desires may prove detrimental to [[self (philosophy)|the self]]. Fleeting pleasure, then, takes a back seat to protracted [[eudaimonia]]. In the words of [[James Rachels]], "Ethical egoism ... endorses selfishness, but it doesn't endorse foolishness."&lt;ref name="Rachels 2008, p. 534"&gt;Rachels 2008, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical egoism is often used as the philosophical basis for support of [[right-libertarianism]] and [[individualist anarchism]].&lt;ref name=ridgely&gt;{{Cite web

==Forms==
Ethical egoism can be broadly divided into three categories: individual, personal, and universal. An ''individual ethical egoist'' would hold that all people should do whatever benefits "my" (''the individual'')'' ''self-interest; a ''personal ethical egoist'' would hold that he or she should act in ''his or her'' self-interest, but would make no claims about what anyone else ought to do; a ''universal ethical egoist'' would argue that everyone should act in ways that are in their self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Waller (2005), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waller (2005), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ethical egoism was introduced by the philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] in his book ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', written in 1874. Sidgwick compared egoism to the philosophy of [[utilitarianism]], writing that whereas utilitarianism sought to maximize overall pleasure, egoism focused only on maximizing individual pleasure.&lt;ref name="routledge"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy | chapter = Egoism and Altruism | last = Floridi | first = Luciano | last2 = Craig | first2 = Edward |publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn = 9780415187091|pages=246–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers before Sidgwick have also retroactively been identified as ethical egoists. One ancient example is the philosophy of [[Yang Zhu]] (4th century BC), [[Yangism]], who views ''wei wo'', or "everything for myself", as the only virtue necessary for self-cultivation.&lt;ref name="senghaas"&gt;{{Cite book| title = The clash within civilizations: coming to terms with cultural conflicts | year =2002 | last =Senghaas | first =Dieter |publisher = [[Psychology Press]] | isbn =  978-0-415-26228-6|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek philosophers like Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics were exponents of [[virtue ethics]], and "did not accept the formal principle that whatever the good is, we should seek only our own good, or prefer it to the good of others."&lt;ref name="routledge"/&gt; However, the beliefs of the [[Cyrenaics]] have been referred to as a "form of egoistic hedonism",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/cyren/ Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Cyrenaics]&lt;/ref&gt; and while some refer to Epicurus' hedonism as a form of [[virtue ethics]], others argue his ethics are more properly described as ethical egoism.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Evans | first = Matthew | title = Can Epicureans be friends? | journal = Ancient Philosophy | volume = 24 | pages = 407–24 | date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justifications==
Philosopher [[James Rachels]], in an essay that takes as its title the theory's name, outlines the three arguments most commonly touted in its favor:&lt;ref&gt;He notes, however, that "the theory is asserted more often than it is argued for. Many of its supporters apparently think its truth is self-evident, so that arguments are not needed." (Rachels 2008, p. 534.)&lt;/ref&gt;

*"The first argument," writes Rachels, "has several variations, each suggesting the same general point:&lt;ref&gt;That is, that regarding and pursuing the interests of others is a self-defeating policy. Rachels quotes Alexander Pope in support of this: "Thus God and nature formed the general frame/And bade self-love and social be the same."&lt;/ref&gt;
**"Each of us is intimately familiar with our own individual wants and needs. Moreover, each of us is uniquely placed to pursue those wants and needs effectively. At the same time, we know the desires and needs of others only imperfectly, and we are not well situated to pursue them. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that if we set out to be 'our brother's keeper,' we would often bungle the job and end up doing more mischief than good."&lt;ref name="Rachels 2008, p. 534"/&gt;
**To give charity to someone is to degrade him, implying as it does that he is reliant on such munificence and quite unable to look out for himself. "That," reckons Rachels, "is why the recipients of 'charity' are so often resentful rather than appreciative."&lt;ref&gt;Rachels 2008, p. 534, where it is pointed out that, in the strictest egoistic terms, this is an inconsequential argument. Ethical egoism does not bother itself with how others receive charity, irrespective of how degraded it makes them feel. The same reasoning applies to the previous two bullets, which use self-interest as a means to the end of beneficence, rather than for its own purposes, as the theory would dictate.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Altruism, ultimately, denies an individual's value and is therefore destructive both to society and its individual components, viewing life merely as a thing to be sacrificed. Philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] is quoted as writing that, "[i]f a man accepts the ethics of altruism, his first concern is not how to live his life but how to sacrifice it."&lt;ref&gt;Rachels 2008, p. 535, where this argument is attributed to [[Ayn Rand]], "a writer little heeded by professional philosophers but who nevertheless was enormously popular on college campuses in the 1960s and 1970s".&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, "[t]he basic principle of altruism is that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification for his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue or value." Rather, she writes, "[t]he purpose of morality is to teach you, not to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and live."&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, "Faith and Force: Destroyers of the Modern World," ''Philosophy: Who Needs It'', p. 74; ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', 1957, Random House, p. 1014; "Faith and Force," p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;
*All of our commonly accepted moral duties, from doing no harm unto others to speaking always the truth to keeping promises, are rooted in the one fundamental principle of self-interest.
*It has been observed, however, that the very act of eating (especially, when there are others starving in the world) is such an act of self-interested discrimination. Ethical egoists such as Rand who readily acknowledge the (conditional) value of others to an individual, and who readily endorse empathy for others, have argued the exact reverse from Rachels, that it is altruism which discriminates: "If the sensation of eating a cake is a value, then why is it an immoral indulgence in your stomach, but a moral goal for you to achieve in the stomach of others?"&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, ''Atlas Shrugged'', 1957, Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore altruism which is an arbitrary position, according to Rand.

==Criticism==
It has been argued that extreme ethical egoism is self-defeating. Faced with a situation of limited resources, egoists would consume as much of the resource as they could, making the overall situation worse for everybody. Egoists may respond that if the situation becomes worse for everybody, that would include the egoist, so it is not, in fact, in his or her rational self-interest to take things to such extremes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-252577/ethics "Ethics"] ''Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the (unregulated) [[tragedy of the commons]] and the (one off) [[prisoner's dilemma]] are cases in which, on the one hand, it is rational for an individual to seek to take as much as possible ''even though'' that makes things worse for everybody, and on the other hand, those cases are not self-refuting since that behaviour remains rational ''even though'' it is ultimately self-defeating, i.e. self-defeating does not imply self-refuting. A tragedy of the commons, however, assumes some degree of public land. That is, a commons forbidding homesteading requires regulation. Thus, an argument against the tragedy of the commons is fundamentally an argument for private property rights and the system that recognizes both property rights and rational self-interest—capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Block |first1=Walter |title=Environmentalism and Economic Freedom: The Case for Private Property Rights |journal=[[Journal of Business Ethics]] |volume=17 |issue=16 |pages=18871899 |date=1998 |issn=0167-4544 |jstor=25074025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, an increasing respect for individual rights uniquely allows for increasing wealth creation and increasing usable resources despite a fixed amount of raw materials (e.g. the West pre-1776 versus post-1776, East versus West Germany, Hong Kong versus mainland China, North versus South Korea, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.juliansimon.org/writings/Ultimate_Resource/ |title= The Ultimate Resource II: People, Materials, and Environment (1996) | author=Julian Simon |accessdate=2014-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear how to apply a private ownership model to many examples of "Commons", however. Examples include large fisheries, the atmosphere and the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/July-August%202008/ostrom-full.html " The Challenge of Common-Pool Resources"] ''Environment Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dummies.com/education/science/environmental-science/ten-real-life-examples-of-the-tragedy-of-the-commons/ "Ten Real-life Examples of the Tragedy of the Commons"] ''Environmental Science for Dummies''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable proponents==
The term ''ethical egoism'' has been applied retroactively to philosophers such as [[Bernard de Mandeville]] and to many other [[Dialectical materialism|materialist]]s of his generation, although none of them declared themselves to be egoists. Note that materialism does not necessarily imply egoism, as indicated by [[Karl Marx]], and the many other [[materialist]]s who espoused forms of [[collectivism]]. It has been argued that ethical egoism can lend itself to [[individualist anarchism]] such as that of [[Benjamin Tucker]], or the combined [[anarcho-communism]] and egoism of [[Emma Goldman]], both of whom were proponents of many egoist ideas put forward by [[Max Stirner]]. In this context, egoism is another way of describing the sense that the common good should be enjoyed by all. However, most notable anarchists in history have been less radical, retaining altruism and a sense of the importance of the individual that is appreciable but does not go as far as egoism. Recent trends to greater appreciation of egoism within [[anarchism]] tend to come from less classical directions such as [[post-left anarchy]] or [[Situationism]] (e.g. [[Raoul Vaneigem]]). Egoism has also been referenced by [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]], such as [[Murray Rothbard]].

Philosopher [[Max Stirner]], in his book ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', was the first philosopher to call himself an egoist, though his writing makes clear that he desired not a new idea of morality (ethical egoism), but rather a rejection of morality ([[amoralism]]), as a nonexistent and limiting "spook"; for this, Stirner has been described as the first [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]]. Other philosophers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[David Gauthier]], have argued that the conflicts which arise when people each pursue their own ends can be resolved for the best of each individual only if they all voluntarily forgo some of their aims—that is, one's self-interest is often best pursued by allowing others to pursue their self-interest as well so that liberty is equal among individuals. Sacrificing one's short-term self-interest to maximize one's long-term self-interest is one form of "[[Rational selfishness|rational self-interest]]" which is the idea behind most philosophers' advocacy of ethical egoism. Egoists have also argued that one's actual interests are not immediately obvious, and that the pursuit of self-interest involves more than merely the acquisition of some good, but the ''maximizing'' of one's chances of survival and/or happiness.

Philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] suggested that egoistic or "life-affirming" behavior stimulates jealousy or "[[ressentiment]]" in others, and that this is the psychological motive for the altruism in [[Christianity]]. Sociologist [[Helmut Schoeck]] similarly considered [[envy]] the motive of collective efforts by society to reduce the disproportionate gains of successful individuals through moral or legal constraints, with altruism being primary among these.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helmut Schoeck|Schoeck, Helmut]], ''Der Neid. Eine Theorie der Gesellschaft'' (''Envy. A Theory of Social Behaviour''), 1966, 1st English ed. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Nietzsche (in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'') and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] (in ''[[After Virtue]]'') have pointed out that the [[ancient Greeks]] did not associate [[morality]] with altruism in the way that post-Christian [[Western culture|Western civilization]] has done.
[[Aristotle]]'s view is that we have duties to ourselves as well as to other people (e.g. friends) and to the ''[[polis]]'' as a whole. The same is true for [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and [[Immanuel Kant]], who claim that there are duties to ourselves as Aristotle did, although it has been argued that, for Aristotle, the duty to one's self is primary.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Jack, "Rand and Aristotle," in Den Uyl and Rasmussen, ''[[The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand]]'', 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ayn Rand]] argued that there is a positive harmony of interests among free, rational humans, such that no moral agent can rationally coerce another person consistently with his own long-term self-interest. Rand argued that other people are an enormous value to an individual's well-being (through education, trade and affection), but also that this value could be fully realized only under conditions of political and economic freedom. According to Rand, voluntary trade alone can assure that human interaction is ''mutually'' beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]'' (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; Rand's student, [[Leonard Peikoff]] has argued that the identification of one's interests itself is impossible absent the use of principles, and that self-interest cannot be consistently pursued absent a consistent adherence to certain ethical principles.&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard, "Why Should One Act on Principle?," ''The Objectivist Forum'', 1988, originally delivered at the [[Ford Hall Forum]].&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Rand's position has also been defended by such writers as [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]], [[Tibor Machan]], [[Allan Gotthelf]], [[David Kelley]], [[Douglas Rasmussen]], [[Nathaniel Branden]], [[Harry Binswanger]], [[Andrew Bernstein]], and [[Craig Biddle]].

Philosopher [[David L. Norton]] identified himself an "ethical individualist", and, like Rand, saw a harmony between an individual's fidelity to his own self-actualization, or "personal destiny", and the achievement of society's well being.&lt;ref&gt;[[David L. Norton|Norton, David]], ''Personal Destinies: A Philosophy of Ethical Individualism'', 1976, [[Princeton University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is known as a critic of [[Judeo-Christian]] morality and religions in general. One of the arguments he raised against the truthfulness of these doctrines is that they are based upon the concept of [[free will]], which, in his opinion, does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;B. Leiter, ''Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Nietzsche on Morality'', Routledge 2002, p. 68-69: "He also ''shares'' with the Materialists a blanket repudiation of the idea of free will." [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbeGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SimAY6RRK9&amp;sig=t5B7vVeXlOWDMu6I5m3gTA_hZGk&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6SFsVbqHNoG0sgHZ5oDwBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 26, tr. [[H. L. Mencken]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schopenhauer==
In ''[[The Gay Science]]'', Nietzsche praises [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s "immortal doctrines of the intellectuality of intuition, the apriority of the law of causality, (...) and the non-freedom of the will,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/n/nietzsche/friedrich/n67j/book2.html The Gay Science]'', 99, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;" which have not been assimilated enough by the disciples. Following is, then, the short description of those views of the latter philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. B. Leiter, ''Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Nietzsche on Morality'', Routledge 2002, p. 59: "Schopenhauer's picture is, in fact, richer than this, and important for understanding Nietzsche." [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbeGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SimAY6RRK9&amp;sig=t5B7vVeXlOWDMu6I5m3gTA_hZGk&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6SFsVbqHNoG0sgHZ5oDwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The principle of causality===
In ''Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' Schopenhauer claimed to prove &amp;ndash; in accordance with [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and against [[David Hume|Hume]] &amp;ndash; that causality is present in the perceivable reality as its principle, i.e. it precedes and enables human perception (so called [[apriority]] of the principle of causality), and thus it is not just an observation of something likely, statistically frequent, which however does not happen "on principle" ([[empiricism]] of the principle of causality). More on this dispute in philosophy can be found in the article on [[Free will#Free will and views of causality|free will]].

===Physical freedom===
In his treatise ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer calls the fact that we can do whatever we will a physical freedom, i.e. lack of physically present obstacles, which is not identical with moral freedom.&lt;ref name="OFW"&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', 1839, c. 1 (explanation of terms), "What is meant by freedom?". [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/98022360.pdf First chapter online]&lt;/ref&gt; Physically "free" means: one acting according only to one's will; if attempts are made to use this term to the will itself, the question arises: "is will itself willed?," "do you will the will to become so-and-so?". It is therefore a specific aspect of the claim of freedom, in which it is stressed whether the course of consciousness follows indeed in a willed way. The problem of willing the will appears in ''Thus spake Zarathustra'', for instance in the chapter "Backworldsmen."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "The backworldsmen", tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necessity vs. contingency===
In ''On the Freedom of the Will'', Schopenhauer demonstrates the (well known in philosophy) distinction between necessity and contingency.&lt;ref name="OFW"/&gt; He calls "necessary" what follows from a given sufficient basis&lt;ref&gt;Such sufficient basis can then be transcribed as the presence of all the necessary conditions of the occurrence of an effect. As long as it is possible to point out some necessary conditions of an event or state, so long there also exists a sufficient basis, which in case of its occurrence will work with necessity; it is dictated by logic. ''Cf.'' there, c. 4 ("Precursors"), a quote from Hobbes. This does not preclude the inclusion of an accurate realization of a certain random variable in a sufficient basis.&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. that what is already certain – if one knows that the sufficient cause is present). On the other hand, one calls "contingent"&lt;ref&gt;''Zufällig'' is the German adjective combining all the meanings of chance, randomness, fortuity, and contingency; the same situation in several other European languages. Perhaps ''fortuitous'' or ''random'' to something could better suit the intuitive meaning, and such translation of this scholastic term is sometimes used. The term is sometimes used in a misleading way so that it denotes in general all "instances [products] of a rule" (which are indeed contingent to each other), and then lack of necessity is triumphantly announced (like in the case of St. Thomas Aquinas), whereas one in fact agrees that there are still causes (so another connection-by-necessity must exist); this is the so-called relative fortuity of events. For Schopenhauer it is the starting point for discussion about absolute fortuity and lack of causes.&lt;/ref&gt; or "incidental" (with regard to a sufficient basis) that what does not follow from the latter (so e.g. two unconnected events can be contingent to each other: like when a black cat crosses the street and one's job is lost on the same day). As ''moral'' freedom means lack of necessity, it would mean a lack of ''any'' basis: it "would have to be defined as ''absolutely contingent''",&lt;ref name="OFW"/&gt; i.e. an '''[[Indeterminism#Philosophy|absolute fortuity, or chance]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;The above-mentioned classification of phenomena in Schopenhauer's works is not really a methodology or a kind of optics, but simply a notice that either an event or a state is determined (by another, by anything) or it is not (by another, by anything; like in case of a choice when all its directing forces – will, values, all emotional aspects – are rejected or unworking). Thus philosophers even before Schopenhauer have already thought that everything is either necessary or fortuitous and as much as one does not apply, the other does; so for instance in Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason'', where the distinction is one of categories of reason.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question about the freedom of will is thus the question whether something depends on another thing (a state, an event), i.e. is in some way determined by it, or does not depend on anything (then we call it a chance). Or, in other words, whether something can be predicted: whether it is certain (given the presence or absence of the sufficient cause) or not. Cf. Luther's argument: for him everything is a necessity because the Creator knows it already.

==Nietzsche's analysis==

===Power of will===
In ''Beyond Good and Evil'' Nietzsche criticizes the concept of free will both negatively and positively.&lt;ref name="BGE"&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', 21, tr. H. Zimmern&lt;/ref&gt; He calls it a folly resulting from extravagant pride of man; and calls the idea a ''crass stupidity''. The latter probably relates to ordinary-man's visions about a god who (after the ellapse of eternal waiting) creates the world and then waits and observes (being, however, still "beyond time"): and then he is surprised and subdued by what one does.&lt;ref&gt;Why then it does not surprise man? Cf. the so-called [[Argument from free will|paradox of omniscience]], according to which there is a contradiction between visions of a live and free God and omniscience or even the possibility of omniscience.&lt;/ref&gt; (This vision is brought up by Nietzsche in ''The Antichrist''.)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 48, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, he argues that free will generally represents an error of ''causa sui'':&lt;ref&gt;That is, "X is the cause of X" &amp;ndash; whereas "cause" should in philosophy be usually something else than effect. The terms ''causa sui'' (cause of self, here considered a fallacy), ''causa prima'' (first cause), and absolute randomness have a common logical sense with respect to states and events in the universe, but occur in different philosophical contexts and with different aspects of meaning and associations.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The &lt;u&gt;desire&lt;/u&gt; for "freedom of will" in the superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom, involves nothing less than to be precisely this ''causa sui'', and, with more than Munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the slough of nothingness.&lt;ref name="BGE"/&gt;}}

Finally, he suggests that the only ''real'' thing about will is whether it is strong (i.e. hard to break) or weak:

{{Quotation|The "non-free will" is mythology; in real life it is only a question of ''strong'' and ''weak'' will.&lt;ref name="BGE"/&gt;}}

Nothing is (or can be) fully resistant to stimula, for that would mean it is immutable: whereas nothing in this world is or can be immutable.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html Twilight of the Idols]'', c. 3, sect. 2, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale.&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore continues here the Schopenhauer's issue of physical freedom: "whether you will, what you willed to will".&lt;ref&gt;The composition actually already known to Hegel, in ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'', 27, written in 1821. In Schopenhauer's essay an infinite regression arises upon considering this issue, when one assumes the fixed answer Yes to the question about freedom; so a logical fallacy occurs. This already can suggest that there is a problem with searching for cause of everything one does in consciousness.&lt;/ref&gt;

Will is generally considered a mental power. "Freedom" of will could then be interpreted as: power of will (cf. the appropriate passus from ''The Antichrist'', where Nietzsche generally opposes will-based psychology&lt;ref name="A14"&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist The Antichrist]'', 14, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;). Will has power over actions, over many things; therefore, things are ''determined'' by will. But is this power unlimited? Does will rule without itself being ruled? (And further: does a Christian want to sin?) &amp;ndash; Nietzsche disagrees. A godless man becomes pious out of "grace", he did not want it; and likewise a pious man becomes godless with no merit or guilt. Nietzsche suggests in many places that if a pious man loses faith, it is because of the power of his ''values'' over him, of the will for truthfulness...

==="Me", will, and chance===
[[Volition (psychology)|Will]] is something that determines human acts, thoughts etc.  It is will what makes man reluctant to toss a coin for something (cf. ''The Antichrist'' about Christians: "in point of fact, they simply do what they cannot help doing"&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist The Antichrist]'', 44, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;). The problem is, whether it is itself ruled? And here two terms which complicate the picture appear: the term "me" and "chance" (i.e. something independent from anything, beyond control).

The term "me" (as in the statements "it's up to me", "it is ''you'' who willed that") had already been recognized as empty in the preface of ''Beyond Good and Evil''&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', Preface, tr. H. Zimmern.&lt;/ref&gt; (or as connected with the ''superstition about the soul''). Later Nietzsche stated more clearly that it was a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] ("what will I do? what will my decision be?" &amp;ndash; "it's up to ''you''" &amp;ndash; that actually means: your decision depends on your decision, something happens in your mind and not somewhere else...). See e.g. ''On the Genealogy of Morals'':&lt;ref&gt;''[http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy1.htm On the Genealogy of Morals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008192122/http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy1.htm |date=2014-10-08 }}'', treatise I, 13, tr. W. Kaufmann.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|For, in just the same way as people separate lightning from its flash and take the latter as an ''action'', as the effect of a subject which is called lightning, so popular morality separates strength from the manifestations of strength, as if behind the strong person there were an indifferent substrate, which is ''free'' to express strength or not. But there is no such substrate; &lt;u&gt;there is no "being" behind the doing, acting, becoming&lt;/u&gt;. "The doer" is merely made up and added into the action &amp;ndash; the act is everything. People basically duplicate the action: &lt;u&gt;when they see a lightning flash, that is an action of an action: they set up the same event first as the cause and then yet again as its effect&lt;/u&gt;. (...) "We weak people are merely weak. It's good if we do nothing; ''we are not strong enough for that''" &amp;ndash; but this bitter state, this shrewdness of the lowest ranks, which even insects possess (when in great danger they stand as if they were dead in order not to do "too much"), has, thanks to that counterfeiting and self-deception of powerlessness, dressed itself in the splendour of a self-denying, still, patient virtue, &lt;u&gt;just as if the weakness of the weak man himself&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; that means his ''essence'', his actions, his entire single, inevitable, and irredeemable reality &amp;ndash; &lt;u&gt;is a voluntary achievement, something willed, chosen, an ''act'', ''something of merit''&lt;/u&gt;.}}

The same however can be applied to the ''moral'' weakness of a Christian (his lack of resistance), who would certainly prefer not to sin and would construct himself otherwise if he could. "And many a one can command himself, but still sorely lacketh self-obedience!"&lt;ref&gt;''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/n/nietzsche/friedrich/n67a/part1.html#chapter3 Thus spake Zarathustra]'', tr. T. Common, "Old and new tables", 4.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; Nietzsche criticizes the idea of "free choice", and even of "choice" in general (cf. the end of above quotation): man does not want to "choose", man wants to affirm himself ("[[will to power]]").&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Belfiore, ''The Triadic Structure of the Mind: Outlines of a Philosophical System'' (2nd edition), Univ. Press of America, 2014, p. 380: "My comment is that Nietzsche, as I point out elsewhere (...), conceived the will to power as the expression of the outward/selfish desire of the agent to affirm and impose on others his apirations, interests and preferences, regardless to any inward/moral thought and feeling." See also on p. 472: "Again with regard to the &amp;laquo;will to power&amp;raquo;, he held that &amp;laquo;A living thing seeks above all to ''discharge'' its strength &amp;ndash; life itself is ''will to power''; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent ''results''&amp;raquo;."&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem is the role of chance. Unless the change brought to man is too big, a chance is generally responded by will, ''wherever there is will''. He calls it "the redemption (of chance)". This topic dawns as early as in ''Human, All Too Human'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Human All-Too-Human#SECOND DIVISION - The History Of The Moral Sentiments.|Human, All Too Human'', 173, under the topic: ''Corriger la fortune'' (to correct a chance), tr. R.J. Hollingdale.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and it returns in many places of ''Zarathustra''. For instance in part 3 it is discussed as follows:

::I am Zarathustra the godless! I cook every chance in my pot. And only when it hath been quite cooked do I welcome it as my food.
::&lt;u&gt;And verily, many a chance came imperiously unto me: but still more imperiously did my Will speak unto it&lt;/u&gt; (...)&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "The Bedwarfing Virtue", 3, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in this part:

::The time is now past when accidents ''[Zufälle]'' could befall me; and what could not fall to my lot which would not already be mine own!"&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', "The Wanderer".&lt;/ref&gt;

To cut it short, if it was always that "''we'' choose a chance", then there would be determinism (for "we", "we ourselves" means: our will and its filtering and determining capabilities). And since it happens otherwise ("a chance chooses us"), then there is indeterminism. But the latter case means we have no will in a topic, i.e. it is at that time morally indifferent to us, ''adiaphora'', not opposed to anything (and therefore even more there is no guilt).

===Necessity in man. What is "unfree will"?===
Since free will is discussed, it must obviously be some restricted reality (if "freedom" meant "everything," there would be no need for a separate word). What follows? That there must be events ''external'' to one's freedom: therefore, besides "free will" there should also consequently be "unfree will." Although Nietzsche considers both terms entirely fictional, he gives some clues about the ''psychological'' reality behind them:

{{Quotation|When man experiences the conditions of power, the imputation is that he is not their cause, that he is ''not responsible'' for them &amp;mdash; they come without being willed, consequently we are not their author: &lt;u&gt;the will that is not free (i.e., the consciousness that we have been changed without having willed it)&lt;/u&gt; needs an ''external'' will.&lt;ref&gt;''The Will to Power'', Book II ("Critique of highest values hitherto"), I. Critique of religion, 1. Genesis of Religions, &amp;sect;135, where he demonstrates the notion of "unfree will" as crucial to the emergence of many religious explanations. Vintage Books edition, September, 1968, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Magi-iz7kIQC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=&amp;quot;136+(March-June+1888)&amp;quot;&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OcKHVB3dib&amp;sig=-9HqUzdC-rG-EJGaHY9P1NVGLwM&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6bUfVLCeEKT9ywP4_YKgAg&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22136%20(March-June%201888)%22&amp;f=false Online version here]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In short, an unexpected change. Now, going back to the mentioned definition, [[randomness|chance]] means: that what cannot be predicted. If randomness affects a man (unsubjugated, reaching even the surface of his consciousness), then "unfree will" occurs. Thus, whenever we call something free, we ''feel'' something free, in short: wherever we feel our power, it is deterministic, it is a necessity. And indeed Nietzsche says it with the mouth of Zarathustra:

::Out into distant futures, which no dream hath yet seen, into warmer souths than ever sculptor conceived, &amp;mdash; where gods in their dancing are ashamed of all clothes: (...)
::Where all time seemed to me a blessed mockery of moments, &lt;u&gt;where necessity was freedom itself, which played happily with the goad of freedom:&lt;/u&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "Old and new tables", 2, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same in ''Beyond Good and Evil'':

{{Quotation|Artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything "arbitrarily," and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom, of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping, reaches its climax &amp;mdash; in short, that necessity and "freedom of will" are then the same thing with them.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', 213, tr. H. Zimmern.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The universe indeterministic?===
Yet in another part of ''Zarathustra'' Nietzsche claims that when we look long-term enough and from the bird's-eye perspective of supreme powers big enough, a chance is unimportant, because it is subject to and step-by-step softened and arranged by natural laws and necessities which constitute the order of the world and evolution:

{{Quotation|If ever a breath hath come to me of the creative breath, &lt;u&gt;and of the heavenly necessity which compelleth even chances to dance star-dances&lt;/u&gt;: (...)&lt;ref name=TSZ3&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "The Seven Seals", 3, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To Nietzsche everything in this world is an expression of will to power.&lt;ref&gt;K. Gemes, J. Richardson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Nietzsche'', Oxford Univ. Press, 2013, p. 177-178 ("The Duality of Nietzsche's Theory of the Will to Power: The Psychological and Cosmological Aspects"). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yZmJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;f=false Read online here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', 36, tr. H. Zimmern.&lt;/ref&gt; To exist is to represent will to power, to ''cause influence'' (compare similar views of Protagoras' disciples in Plato's ''Theaetetus''). One can cause influence only on something that exists. Therefore, (through induction) an act changes everything from that moment onwards. If one thing was otherwise, everything would have to be otherwise (and generally also backwards).&lt;ref name="TI_humanact"&gt;This belief, perhaps not 100% deterministic, is explicitly expressed in ''Twilight of the Idols'', "Morality as Anti-Nature", 6, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale: "To say to him, &amp;laquo;Change yourself!&amp;raquo; is to demand that everything be changed, even retroactively."&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to [[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]]'s views, this general rule is not precluded even by absolute chances: they of course change the course of the world too, but still: if one thing was set otherwise, everything would have to be otherwise.&lt;ref name="TI_humanact"/&gt;

Several scholars have argued that Nietzsche was not a determinist in his views of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Solomon, ''The Journal of Nietzsche Studies'' 23 (2002), p. 64 ("Nietzsche on Freedom and Fatalism"). [https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v023/23.1solomon.html Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter|B. Leiter]], ''Nietzsche on morality'' (2nd edition), Routledge 2015, p. 66. [https://books.google.com/books?id=hBDEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;f=false Online text here]
&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Zarathustra'', absolute randomness (maybe not as the essence of reality, but as a part thereof) can be thought of, yes, perhaps it even exists:

{{Quotation|Verily, it is a blessing and not a blasphemy when I teach that "above all things there standeth the heaven of chance, the heaven of innocence, the heaven of hazard, the heaven of wantonness.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "Before sunrise", tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Issues of responsibility and morality===
Because ''causa sui'' is according to Nietzsche a nonsense, even to a chance could get a basis attributed (only "the whole" has no basis), and it would be "divine dice" (or "Divine Plan"):

::If ever I have played dice with the gods at the divine table of the earth, so that the earth quaked and ruptured, and snorted forth fire-streams: &amp;ndash;
::&amp;ndash; For a divine table is the earth, and trembling with new active dictums and dice-casts of the gods: (...)&lt;ref name=TSZ3/&gt;

To Nietzsche no one is responsible either for the necessities (laws and powers) he represents, or for chances he encounters (which conquer him unwillingly &amp;ndash; and which, as things totally independent from anything, only the "supreme being" could change); after all, no one is absolutely and completely resistant, there can always happen something which changes one deeply enough.

From ''The Dawn of Day'':

{{Quotation|To tranquillise the sceptic. &amp;ndash; "I don't know at all what I am doing. I don't know in the least what I ought to do!" You are right, but 
be sure of this: you are being done at every moment! Mankind has at all times mistaken the active for the passive: it is its eternal grammatical blunder.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/dawnofday029675mbp/dawnofday029675mbp_djvu.txt The Dawn of Day]'', 120, tr. J. M. Kennedy.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Twilight of the Idols'' Nietzsche discusses [[fatalism]] and responsibility in these words:

{{Quotation|What alone can our teaching be? &amp;ndash; That no one gives a man his qualities, neither God, nor society, nor his parents and ancestors, nor ''he himself'' (the latter absurd idea here put aside has been taught as "intelligible freedom" by Kant, perhaps also by Plato). &lt;u&gt;''No one'' is responsible for existing at all&lt;/u&gt;, for being formed so and so, for being placed under those circumstances and in this environment. His own destiny cannot be disentangled from the destiny of all else in past and future. He is ''not'' the result of a special purpose, a will, or an aim, the attempt is ''not'' here made to reach an "ideal of man," an "ideal of happiness," or an "ideal of morality;" &amp;ndash; &lt;u&gt;it is absurd to try to ''shunt off'' man's nature towards some goal&lt;/u&gt;. We have invented the notion of a "goal:" in reality a goal is ''lacking'' . . . We are necessary, we are part of destiny, we belong to the whole, we ''exist'' in the whole, &amp;ndash; &lt;u&gt;there is nothing which could judge, measure, compare, or condemn our being, for that would be to judge, measure, compare, and condemn the whole&lt;/u&gt; . . . ''But there is nothing outside the whole! &amp;ndash; This only is the grand emancipation'': that no one be made responsible any longer, that the mode of being be not traced back to a ''causa prima'', that the world be not regarded as a unity, either as sensorium or as "spirit;" &amp;ndash; it is only thereby that the ''innocence'' of becoming is again restored . . . The concept of "God" has hitherto been the greatest ''objection'' to existence . . . We deny God, we deny responsibility by denying God: it is only ''thereby'' that we save the world. &amp;ndash;&lt;ref name="TI_fw"&gt;''[http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Case_of_Wagner_v11_1000198930/165 Twilight of the Idols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214453/http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Case_of_Wagner_v11_1000198930/165 |date=2016-03-03 }}'', "The Four Great Errors", 8, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Free will as a psychological error===
Nietzsche's critique of free will has essentially two aspects: one is philosophical (fatalistic), and the other is psychological.&lt;ref name="NTotW"&gt;[[Brian Leiter|B. Leiter]], ''Nietzsche's Theory of the Will'', p. 1. [[Philosophers' Imprint]] v. 7, no. 7, September 2007. [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/nietzsche-s-theory-of-the-will.pdf?c=phimp;idno=3521354.0007.007 Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism lets Nietzsche theoretically prove the error of moral doctrines, which &amp;ndash; most generally speaking &amp;ndash; would require that a sinner changed his destiny (for instance by changing the laws of nature, influencing chances which lie completely beyond the extent of his influence), which is by definition impossible. But such theory would not be convincing enough if at the same time the impression of control was not removed, as well as the ever renewed attempts at associating it with the "freedom of will" and building a philosophy out of that. Thus a psychological critique is needed.

If one agrees that the "freedom of will" denotes the power of will which rules but is not itself ruled, then it would at bottom be enough to prove that it is not will what governs human behaviour in order to abolish the very term, to prove that "it is not there". And Nietzsche went on to this.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' (Leiter), p. 12 ("The Real Genesis of Action").&lt;/ref&gt; For Nietzsche the term "will" is psychologically strictly connected with the term "aim" (he often combines the two), maybe even they are identical to him.&lt;ref name="WTP"&gt;Cf. ''The Will to Power'', Book II ("Critique of highest values hitherto"), I. Critique of philosophy, 238: on "psychology which ... searched for will (i.e. aim) behind every act."&lt;/ref&gt; Aim could then be interpreted, according to a common definition, as planning and intellectual foreseeing&lt;ref&gt;The intellect in philosophy was by the way usually presented as working causally and, in principle, learning in course of life to associate the appropriate causes and effects. It was thus understood e.g. by Schopenhauer (cf. F. C. White, ''On Schopenhauer's Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'', c. 4: "Perception," p. 42: Brill Academic Pub, 1991; [https://books.google.com/books?id=95X3LSZ9O04C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z4t8t3huF0&amp;sig=_yZNYjtOD8g49uNcKKxGql5cn9w&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7gTVOfLEcvTPI_TgLgE&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false read online]). The more thus the phenomena of will and aim would have a deterministic foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; (of especially effects); according to Nietzsche first and foremost the anticipation of acts which in fact do not need to follow by its virtue from aiming (which is here foreseeing).

In ''Twilight of the Idols'' Nietzsche demonstrates the ''error of false causality'' just before the ''error of free will'':

{{Quotation|Of these "inward facts" that seem to demonstrate causality, the primary and most persuasive one is that of &lt;u&gt;the will as cause&lt;/u&gt;. The idea of consciousness ("spirit") or, later, that of the ego ''[I]'' (the "subject") as a cause are only afterbirths: first the causality of the will was firmly accepted as proved, as a fact, and these other concepts followed from it. But we have reservations about these concepts. &lt;u&gt;Today we no longer believe any of this is true&lt;/u&gt;. (...) The so-called motives: another error. &lt;u&gt;Merely a surface phenomenon of consciousness, something shadowing&lt;ref&gt;"Accompanying" in original.&lt;/ref&gt; the deed&lt;/u&gt; that is more likely to hide the causes of our actions than to reveal them. (...)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html Twilight of the Idols]'', "The Four Great Errors", 3, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and then, in the section directly regarding free will, he observes:

{{Quotation|Men were considered "free" only so that they might be considered guilty &amp;ndash; could be judged and punished: consequently, &lt;u&gt;every act had to be considered as willed, and the origin of every act had to be considered as lying within the consciousness&lt;/u&gt; (and thus the most fundamental psychological deception was made the principle of psychology itself).&lt;ref&gt;There, sect. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly in ''The Antichrist'': "the will no longer &amp;laquo;acts,&amp;raquo; or &amp;laquo;moves&amp;raquo;...", "the term no longer denotes any power".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 14, tr. H. L. Mencken. The latter is a mistranslation by Mencken (in original: ''kein Vermögen mehr verstanden werden darf'').&lt;/ref&gt; This non-deriving of acts straight way out of aims, which are just foreseeing (the accompanying self-consciousness of that what is to come), but searching for their sources elsewhere (for example in reflexes, habits, urges) is to Nietzsche even one of major differences between medieval (Thomist) and modern psychology.&lt;ref name="WTP"/&gt;

==Nietzsche's conclusions==

===About man and freedom===
In ''The Antichrist'' Nietzsche argues that man should be considered no otherwise than as a machine.&lt;ref name="A14"/&gt; Even if some generic chaos (randomness) is added to the picture, it does not affect this. A chance is innocent.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 25, tr. H. L. Mencken "Chance robbed of its innocence; unhappiness polluted with the idea of “sin”; well-being represented  as a danger, as a “temptation”; a physiological disorder produced by the canker worm of conscience....".&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche points out the weakness of human as well as of God. Man wills the good, "God" wills the good, and yet evil happens.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/n/nietzsche/friedrich/n67j/book5.html The Gay Science]'', 346, tr. T. Common. "We have become saturated with the conviction (and have grown cold and hard in it) that things are not at all divinely ordered in this world, nor even according to human standards do they go on rationally, mercifully, or justly: we know the fact that the world in which we live is ungodly, immoral, and &amp;laquo;inhuman&amp;raquo;, (...)".&lt;/ref&gt; So where is this "freedom" (i.e. power) of will? And where is this good God?&lt;ref&gt;In ''Ecce Homo'', "Why I am so wise", 3, tr. Duncan Large he repeated after Stendhal: "God's only excuse is that he doesn't exist." Due to the lack of free will the [[theodicee]] (defence of divine goodness) based on indeterminism becomes void.&lt;/ref&gt;

===About good and evil===
These two human valuations refer to things essentially mixed with each other and interdependent. Good causes the evil, and evil causes the good.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. "[http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/works-pub/bge/bgefhm.htm The Aftersong]" in ''Beyond Good and Evil'' or "[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt The Seven Seals]", 4 in ''Zarathustra''.&lt;/ref&gt; The dichotomy between a good God and an evil satan is a "dualistic fiction."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 17, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Twilight of the Idols'' (see the quote above) and later in ''The Antichrist''&lt;ref name="A2638"&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 26 &amp;amp; 38 about the moral order of the world.&lt;/ref&gt; all concepts which explain life as a test or raise an (externally reasonable) moral "task," "purpose" or the "will of God" are considered false. They are a part of the "error of free will"&lt;ref name="TI_fw"/&gt; consisting in incomprehension of [[fatalism|fatalism of life]], i.e. the fact that it is shaped by higher forces.

===About organized religion===
Religion is a form of controlling people:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 38. "We know, our conscience now knows &amp;ndash; just what the real value of all those sinister inventions of priest and church has been and what ends they have served, with their debasement of humanity to a state of self-pollution, the very sight of which excites loathing, &amp;ndash; the concepts &amp;laquo;the other world,&amp;raquo; &amp;laquo;the last judgment,&amp;raquo; &amp;laquo;the immortality of the soul,&amp;raquo; the &amp;laquo;soul&amp;raquo; itself: they are all merely so many instruments of torture, systems of cruelty, whereby the priest becomes master and remains master..."&lt;/ref&gt; one man-machine wants to achieve power over another. Even the term "freedom," very often used by theologians, in its positive sense actually means "power."&lt;ref name="OFW"/&gt; Religion is by no means more "fulfilling the will of God" than anything else. As God is primary and almighty, his will is by definition always fulfilled (it is impossible that he wills something and it is not fulfilled).

A priest, a moralist does in fact nothing for man's "salvation," but just rules, and even when doing so he acts in a way that would (apart from that) be considered immoral.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html Twilight of the Idols]'', "The &amp;laquo;Improvers&amp;raquo; of Mankind", tr. W. Kaufmann and R.J. Hollingdale.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche goes on to analysing the [[Bible]] philologically and to guesses about the person of [[Jesus]]. He claims that it was not the aim of the latter to have anybody serve him, for God rules everything anyway; to the contrary, in Nietzsche's opinion Jesus fought with churchedness and the notion of sin rooted in the Old Testament. And thus in ''The Antichrist'' Christianity was portrayed as the corruption of the original doctrine taught by Jesus about equal rights of all to be children of God, the doctrine of no guilt and of no gulf between God and man.

The very "freedom of will" was invented by the priests in order to master the process of human thinking &amp;ndash; and nothing more.&lt;ref name="TI_fw"/&gt; And in order to master it, they had first to denaturize it.&lt;ref name="A2638"/&gt;

===About death of God and nihilism===
The downfall of Christian values is not an effect &amp;ndash; as it has been presented hitherto &amp;ndash; of human free will. The supreme values (especially formerly common in European culture) overthrow each other themselves&lt;ref name="gmfall"&gt;''[http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy3.htm On the Genealogy of Details] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010153350/http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy3.htm |date=2014-10-10 }}'', treatise III, 27, tr. W. Kaufmann.&lt;/ref&gt; due to inner contradictions&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Nietzsche often quotes, as children of Christianity, honest research (as willing the truth), as well as democratism (as derived from the belief in equality of souls before God, that is: the moral law, and unbelief in a "higher man", so essentially from pacifistic and equalistic tendencies), freedom of press (or speech in general) and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; and non-matching the nature.

{{Quotation|All great things destroy themselves by an act of self-cancellation. That's what the law of life wills, that law of the necessary "self-overcoming" in the essence of life &amp;ndash; eventually the call always goes out to the lawmaker himself, "''patere legem, quam ipse tulisti''" [submit to the law which you yourself have established]. That’s the way Christianity was destroyed as dogma by its own morality; that’s the way Christendom as morality must now also be destroyed. We stand on the threshold of this event.&lt;ref name="gmfall"/&gt;}}

{{Emotion}}

'''Guilt''' is a [[cognitive]] or an [[emotion]]al experience that occurs when a person [[belief|believes]] or [[understanding|realizes]]—accurately or not—that they have compromised their own standards of conduct or have violated a universal [[Morality|moral]] standard and bear significant [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for that violation.&lt;ref&gt;
Compare: {{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/gale-psychology-encyclopedia/guilt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502063427/http://www.enotes.com/gale-psychology-encyclopedia/guilt |archivedate=2 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }} "In psychology, what is "guilt," and what are the stages of guilt development?". eNotes.com. 2006. 31 December 2007: 'Let's begin with a working definition of guilt. Guilt is “an emotional state produced by thoughts that we have not lived up to our ideal self and could have done otherwise.”' Retrieved 2017-12-03.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Guilt is closely related to the concept of [[remorse]].

==Psychology==
Guilt is an important factor in perpetuating [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Leslie J. Shapiro, LICSW |url=https://www.aacp.com/Abstract.asp?AID=9322&amp;issue=February%202011&amp;page=C&amp;UID= |title=Pathological guilt: A persistent yet overlooked treatment factor in obsessive-compulsive disorder — |publisher=Aacp.com |accessdate=27 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201040951/https://www.aacp.com/Abstract.asp?AID=9322&amp;issue=February%202011&amp;page=C&amp;UID= |archivedate=1 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt and its associated causes, merits, and demerits are common themes in [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]]. Both in specialized and in ordinary language, guilt is an affective state in which one experiences conflict at having done something that one believes one should not have done (or conversely, having not done something one believes one should have done). It gives rise to a feeling which does not go away easily, driven by '[[conscience]]'. [[Sigmund Freud]] described this as the result of a struggle between the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] and the [[superego]]&amp;nbsp;– parental imprinting. Freud rejected the role of [[God]] as punisher in times of illness or rewarder in time of wellness. While removing one source of guilt from patients, he described another. This was the unconscious force within the individual that contributed to illness, Freud in fact coming to consider "the obstacle of an unconscious sense of guilt...as the most powerful of all obstacles to recovery."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) pp. 390–1&lt;/ref&gt; For his later explicator, [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], guilt was the inevitable companion of the signifying subject who acknowledged normality in the form of [[the Symbolic]] order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Belsey]], ''Shakespeare in Theory and Practice'' (2008) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]] claims that "many people suffer all their lives from this oppressive feeling of guilt, the sense of not having lived up to their parents' expectations....no argument can overcome these guilt feelings, for they have their beginnings in life's earliest period, and from that they derive their intensity."&lt;ref&gt;Alice Miller, ''The Drama of Being a Child'' (1995) pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; This may be linked to what Les Parrott has called "the disease of false guilt....At the root of false guilt is the idea that what you ''feel'' must be true."&lt;ref&gt;Parrott, pp. 158–9&lt;/ref&gt; If you ''feel'' guilty, you must ''be'' guilty!

The philosopher [[Martin Buber]] underlined the difference between the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] notion of guilt, based on internal conflicts, and ''existential guilt'', based on actual harm done to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buber, M. |title=Guilt and guilt feelings |journal=Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=114–29 |date=May 1957 |pmid=13441838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt is often associated with [[anxiety]]. In [[mania]], according to [[Otto Fenichel]], the patient succeeds in applying to guilt "the defense mechanism of denial by overcompensation...re-enacts being a person without guilt feelings."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) pp. 409–10&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychological research, guilt can be measured by using questionnaires, such as the [[Discrete emotion theory|Differential Emotions Scale]] (Izard's DES), or the [[Dutch Guilt Measurement Instrument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Van Laarhoven, H et al. | title=Comparison of attitudes of guilt and forgiveness in cancer patients without evidence of disease and advanced cancer patients in a palliative care setting |journal=Cancer Nursing |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=483-492 |date=November–December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defenses===
Defenses against feeling guilt can become an overriding aspect of one's personality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]] ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;  The methods that can be used to avoid guilt are multiple.  They include:
#[[Psychological repression|Repression]], usually used by the [[superego]] and ego against instinctive impulses, but on occasion employed against the superego/conscience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11)p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;  If the defence fails, then (in a return of the repressed) one may begin to feel guilty years later for actions lightly committed at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin 1976) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Psychological projection|Projection]] is another defensive tool with wide applications. It may take the form of [[blaming the victim]]: The victim of someone else's accident or bad luck may be offered criticism, the theory being that the victim may be at fault for having attracted the other person's hostility.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pursuit of Health'', June Bingham &amp; Norman Tamarkin, M.D., Walker Press&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, not the guilt, but the condemning agency itself, may be projected onto other people, in the hope that they will look upon one's deeds more favorably than one's own conscience  (a process that verges on [[Ideas of reference and delusions of reference|ideas of reference]]).&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 165 and p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;
#Sharing a feeling of guilt, and thereby being less alone with it, is a motive force in both art and joke-telling; while it is also possible to "borrow" a sense of guilt from someone who is seen as in the wrong, and thereby assuage one's own.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 165-6 and p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;
#Self-harm may be used as an alternative to compensating the object of one's transgression – perhaps in the form of not allowing oneself to enjoy opportunities open to one, or benefits due, as a result of uncompensated guilt feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelissen | first1 = R.

=== Behavioral responses ===
Feelings of guilt can prompt subsequent virtuous behavior. People who feel guilty may be more likely to exercise restraint,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guilty pleasures and grim necessities: Affective attitudes in dilemmas of self-control.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/80/2/206/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-10-13|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; avoid self-indulgence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The effects of nonconsciously priming emotion concepts on behavior.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/93/6/927/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-10-13|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exhibit less prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Dynamic Model of Guilt Implications for Motivation and Self-Regulation in the Context of Prejudice|url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/6/524|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2007-06-01|issn = 0956-7976|pmid = 17576266|pages = 524–530|volume = 18|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01933.x|language = en|first = David M.|last = Amodio|first2 = Patricia G.|last2 = Devine|first3 = Eddie|last3 = Harmon-Jones|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161205085614/http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/6/524|archivedate = 5 December 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt appears to prompt reparatory behaviors to alleviate the negative emotions that it engenders. People appear to engage in targeted and specific reparatory behaviors toward the persons they wronged or offended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Guilty Feelings, Targeted Actions|url = http://psp.sagepub.com/content/38/5/607|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date = 2012-05-01|issn = 0146-1672|pmid = 22337764|pages = 607–618|volume = 38|issue = 5|doi = 10.1177/0146167211435796|language = en|first = Cynthia E.|last = Cryder|first2 = Stephen|last2 = Springer|first3 = Carey K.|last3 = Morewedge|pmc=4886498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of guilt in psychopaths===
Individuals high in [[psychopathy]] lack any true sense of guilt or [[remorse]] for harm they may have caused others. Instead, they [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalize]] their behavior, [[blame]] someone else, or [[Denial|deny]] it outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Birket-Smith, Morten |author2=Millon, Theodore |author3=Simonsen, Erik |author4=Davis, Roger E. |chapter=11. Psychopathy and the Five-Factor Model of Personality, Widiger and Lynam |title=Psychopathy: Antisocial, Criminal, and Violent Behavior |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2002 |pages=173–7 |isbn=1-57230-864-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;!--Check Edition--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A person with psychopathy has a tendency to be harmful to his or herself and to others. They have little ability to plan ahead for the future. An individual with psychopathy will never find themselves at fault because they will do whatever it takes to benefit themselves without reservation. A person that does not feel guilt or remorse would have no reason to find themselves at fault for something that they did with the intention of hurting another person. To a person high in psychopathy, their actions can always be rationalized to be the fault of another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neumann |first=Craig S. |author2=Kosson, David S. |author3=Forth, Adelle E. |author4=Hare, Robert D. |title=Factor structure of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL:YV) in adolescent females|journal=Psychological Assessment|year=2013|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.18.2.142 |volume=18 |pages=142–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen by psychologists as part of a lack of moral reasoning (in comparison with the majority of humans), an inability to evaluate situations in a moral framework, and an inability to develop emotional bonds with other people due to a lack of [[empathy]].

===Causes===

====Evolutionary theories====
Some evolutionary psychologists theorize that guilt and [[shame]] helped maintain beneficial relationships, such as [[reciprocal altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pallanti, S., Quercioli, L. |title=Shame and psychopathology |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=28–43 |date=August 2000 |pmid=18192938}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person feels guilty when he harms another, or even fails to reciprocate kindness, he is more likely not to harm others or become too selfish. In this way, he reduces the chances of retaliation by members of his tribe, and thereby increases his survival prospects, and those of the tribe or group. As with any other emotion, guilt can be [[Psychological manipulation|manipulated]] to control or influence others. As highly social animals living in large, relatively stable groups, humans need ways to deal with conflicts and events in which they inadvertently or purposefully harm others. If someone causes harm to another, and then feels guilt and demonstrates regret and sorrow, the person harmed is likely to forgive. Thus, guilt makes it possible to forgive, and helps hold the social group together.

====Social psychology theories====
When we see another person suffering, it can also cause us pain. This constitutes our powerful system of empathy, which leads to our thinking that we should do something to relieve the suffering of others. If we cannot help another, or fail in our efforts, we experience feelings of guilt. From the perspective of group selection, groups that are made up of a high percentage of co-operators outdo groups with a low percentage of co-operators in between-group competition. People who are more prone to high levels of empathy-based guilt may be likely to suffer from anxiety and depression; however, they are also more likely to cooperate and behave altruistically. This suggests that guilt-proneness may not always be beneficial at the level of the individual, or within-group competition, but highly beneficial in between-group competition.{{Citation needed|reason=cf. Dearing, et al. in Addictive Behaviors Vol 30.7 for conflicting research.|date=December 2008}}

====Other theories====
Another common notion is that guilt is assigned by social processes, such as a [[jury trial]] (i. e., that it is a strictly legal concept). Thus, the ruling of a jury that [[O. J. Simpson]] or [[Julius Rosenberg]] was "guilty" or "not innocent" is taken as an actual judgment by the whole society that they must act as if they were so. By corollary, the ruling that such a person is "not guilty" may not be so taken, due to the asymmetry in the assumption that one is [[Presumption of innocence|assumed innocent until proven guilty]], and prefers to take the [[risk]] of freeing a guilty party over convicting innocents. Still others—often, but not always, theists of one type or another—believe that the origin of guilt comes from violating universal principles of right and wrong. In most instances, people who believe this also acknowledge that even though there is proper guilt from doing 'wrong' instead of doing 'right', people endure all sorts of guilty feelings which do not stem from violating universal moral principles.

==Collective guilt==

{{main|Collective responsibility}}
Collective guilt (or group guilt) is the unpleasant and often emotional reaction that results among a group of individuals when it is perceived that the group illegitimately harmed members of another group. It is often the result of “sharing a social identity with others whose actions represent a threat to the positivity of that identity.” For an individual to experience collective guilt, he must identify himself as a part of the in-group. “This produces a perceptual shift from thinking of oneself in terms of ‘I’ and ‘me’ to ‘us’ or ‘we’.”&lt;ref name="Collective"&gt;{{cite book |last=Branscombe |first=Nyla, R. |author2=Bertjan Doosje |year=2004
|title=Collective Guilt: International Perspectives |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-52083-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural views==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
Traditional [[Culture of Japan|Japanese society]], [[Korean society]] and [[Chinese culture]]&lt;ref&gt;Bill Brugger, ''China, Liberation and Transformation'' (1981) pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes said to be "[[shame]]-based" rather than "guilt-based", in that the social consequences of "getting caught" are seen as more important than the individual feelings or experiences of the agent (see the work of [[Ruth Benedict]]). The same has been said of [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek society]], a culture where, in [[Bruno Snell]]'s words, if "honour is destroyed the moral existence of the loser collapses."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. I. Finley, ''The World of Odysseus'' (1967) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

This may lead to more of a focus on [[etiquette]] than on [[ethics]] as understood in Western civilization, leading some{{who|date=April 2012}} in Western civilizations to question why the word ''[[ethos]]'' was adapted from [[Ancient Greek]] with such vast differences in cultural norms. [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] inherit most notions of guilt from [[Judaism]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}, [[Ancient Persia|Persia]]n, and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ideas, mostly as interpreted through [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], who adapted [[Plato]]'s ideas to Christianity. The [[Latin]] word for guilt is ''culpa'', a word sometimes seen in law literature, for instance in ''mea culpa'' meaning "my fault (guilt)".

===Etymology===
Guilt, from [[Old English|O.E.]] ''gylt'' "crime, sin, fault, fine, debt", derived from O.E. ''gieldan'' "to pay for, debt". The mistaken use for "sense of guilt" is first recorded in 1690. "Guilt by association" is first recorded in 1941. "Guilty" is from O.E. ''gyltig'', from ''gylt''.

===In literature===
Guilt is a main theme in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', Tennessee Williams' ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'', [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]" and "[[The Black Cat (short story)|The Black Cat]]", and many other works of literature. In Sartre's ''[[The Flies]]'', the Furies (in the form of flies) represent the morbid, strangling forces of neurotic guilt which bind us to authoritarian and totalitarian power.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fagles trans., ''The Oresteia'' (Penguin 1981) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt is a major theme in many works by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and is an almost universal concern of novelists who explore inner [[life]] and [[secret]]s.

===In the Christian Bible===
Guilt in the Christian [[Bible]] is not merely an emotional state but is a legal state of deserving punishment. The [[Hebrew Bible]] does not have a unique word for guilt, but uses a single word to signify: "sin, the guilt of it, the punishment due unto it, and a sacrifice for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Owen, J. |chapter=Chapter 8|title=The Doctrine of Justification by Faith |publisher=Johnstone and Hunter |location=London |year=1850 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek [[New Testament]] uses a word for guilt that means "standing exposed to judgment for sin" (e. g., [[Romans 3]]:19). In what Christians call the "[[Old Testament]]", Christians believe the Bible teaches that, through sacrifice, one's sins can be forgiven (Judaism categorically rejects this idea, holding that forgiveness of sin is exclusively through repentance, and the role of sacrifices was for atonement of sins committed by accident or ignorance [http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/11-08-02.html]). The New Testament says that this forgiveness is given as written in 1 Corinthians 15:3–4: "3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, for that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures." Some believe that the Old and New Testaments have differing opinions on the expiation of guilt because the Old Testaments were subject to the Age of Law and the New Testaments replace the Age of Law with the now current Age of Grace. However, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament salvation was granted based on God's grace and forgiveness (Gen 6:8; 19:19; Exo 33:12–17; 34:6–7). Animal sacrifices were only a symbol of the future sacrifice of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] (Heb 10:1–4; 9–12). The whole world is guilty before God for abandoning him and his ways (Rom 3:19). In Jesus Christ, God took upon himself the sins of the world and died on the cross to pay our debt (Rom 6:23). Those who repent and accept the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for their sins, will be redeemed by God and thus not guilty before him. They will be granted eternal life which will take effect when Jesus comes the second time (1 Thess 4:13–18). In contrast to surrounding nations which addressed their guilt with human sacrifice, the Israeli authors of the Bible called that an abomination (1 Kings 11:7, Jer 32:35). The Bible agrees with pagan cultures that guilt creates a cost that someone must pay (Heb 9:22). (This assumption was expressed in the previous section, "Defences": "Guilty people punish themselves if they have no opportunity to compensate the transgression that caused them to feel guilty. It was found that self-punishment did not occur if people had an opportunity to compensate the victim of their transgression.") But unlike pagan deities who demanded it be paid by humans, God, according to the Bible, loved us enough to pay it Himself, as a good father would, while calling us His "children" and calling Himself our "father" (Mat 5:45).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30218">'''Homochirality''' is a uniformity of [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]], or handedness. Objects are ''chiral'' when they cannot be superposed on their mirror images. For example, the left and right hands of a human are approximately mirror images of each other but are not their own mirror images, so they are ''chiral''. In [[biology]], 19 of the 20 natural [[amino acid]]s are homochiral, being &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-chiral (left-handed), while [[sugar]]s are &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-chiral (right-handed).&lt;ref name="Lehninger"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nelson, Lehninger et al |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry |date=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homochirality'' can also refer to ''enantiomerically pure'' substances in which all the constituents are the same [[enantiomer]] (a right-handed or left-handed version of an atom or molecule), but some sources discourage this use of the term.

It is unclear whether homochirality has a purpose, however, it appears to be a form of information storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=James D.|title=A new definition of life|journal=Chirality|date=March 2009|volume=21|issue=3|pages=354–358|doi=10.1002/chir.20590|pmid=18571800}}&lt;/ref&gt; One suggestion is that it reduces [[entropy]] barriers in the formation of large organized molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Julian|first1=Ryan R.|last2=Myung|first2=Sunnie|last3=Clemmer|first3=David E.|title=Do Homochiral Aggregates Have an Entropic Advantage?|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=January 2005|volume=109|issue=1|pages=440–444|doi=10.1021/jp046478x|pmid=16851034}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been experimentally verified that amino acids form large aggregates in larger abundance from [[enantiopure]] substrates than from [[racemic]] ones.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

It is not clear whether homochirality emerged before or after life, and many mechanisms for its origin have been proposed.&lt;ref name=jafarpour2017 /&gt; Some of these models propose three distinct steps: ''mirror-symmetry breaking'' creates a minute enantiomeric imbalance, ''chiral amplification'' builds on this imbalance, and ''chiral transmission'' is the transfer of chirality from one set of molecules to another.

==In biology==

Amino acids are the building blocks of [[peptide]]s and [[enzyme]]s while sugar-peptide chains are the backbone of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reusch|first1=William|title=Peptides &amp; Proteins|url=https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/protein2.htm|website=Natural Products|publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lam|first1=Eric|chapter=Nucleic acids and proteins|editor-last1=Dey|editor-first1=P.M.|editor-last2=Harborne|editor-first2=J.B.|title=Plant Biochemistry.|date=1997|publisher=Elsevier|location=Burlington|isbn=9780080525723|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biological organisms, amino acids appear almost exclusively in the left-handed form (&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids) and sugars in the right-handed form (R-sugars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zubay |first1=Geoffrey |title=Origins of Life: On Earth and in the Cosmos |date=2000 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780080497617 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=August 2018}} Since the enzymes catalyze reactions, they enforce homochirality on a great variety of other chemicals, including [[hormone]]s, toxins, fragrances and food flavors.&lt;ref name=Seckbach&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seckbach|first1=edited by Joseph|title=Genesis - in the beginning : precursors of life, chemical models and early biological evolution|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9789400729407}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|493&amp;ndash;494}} [[Glycine]] is achiral, as are some other non-[[proteinogenic]] amino acids are either achiral (such as [[dimethylglycine]]) or of the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; enantiomeric form.

Biological organisms easily discriminate between molecules with different chiralities. This can affect physiological reactions such as smell and taste. [[Carvone]], a [[terpenoid]] found in [[essential oil]]s, smells like mint in its L-form and [[caraway]] in its R-form.&lt;ref name=Seckbach/&gt;{{rp|494}}{{verify source|date=August 2018}} [[Limonene]] tastes like lemons when right-handed and oranges when left-handed.&lt;ref name=Hazen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hazen|first1=Robert M.|author-link=Robert Hazen|title=Genesis : the scientific quest for life's origins|date=2007|publisher=Joseph Henry|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780309103107}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}}

Homochirality also affects the response to drugs. [[Thalidomide]], in its left-handed form, cures [[morning sickness]]; in its right-handed form, it causes birth defects.&lt;ref name=Hazen/&gt;{{rp|168}} Unfortunately, even if a pure left-handed version is administered, some of it can convert to the right-handed form in the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Silas|title=Chiral Toxicology: It's the Same Thing...

Depending on the manufacturing process, enantiopure forms can be more expensive to produce than stereochemical mixtures.&lt;ref name=Hazen/&gt;{{rp|168}}

Chiral preferences can also be found at a macroscopic level. Snail shells can be right-turning or left-turning helices, but one  form or the other is strongly preferred in a given species. In the edible snail ''[[Helix pomatia]]'', only one out of 20,000 is left-helical.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meierhenrich|first1=Uwe|title=Amino acids and the asymmetry of life caught in the act of formation|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540768869}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61&amp;ndash;62}} The coiling of plants can have a preferred chirality and even the chewing motion of cows has a 10% excess in one direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Andrew M.|title=Astrochemistry From Astronomy to Astrobiology.|date=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester|isbn=9780470091388|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
===Symmetry breaking===
Known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the [[electroweak interaction]]; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] light, [[Quartz|quartz crystal]]s, or the Earth's rotation; and statistical fluctuations during racemic synthesis.&lt;ref name="Plasson2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plasson |first1=Raphaël |last2=Kondepudi |first2=Dilip K. |last3=Bersini |first3=Hugues |last4=Commeyras |first4=Auguste |last5=Asakura |first5=Kouichi |display-authors=3 |date=August 2007 |title=Emergence of homochirality in far-from-equilibrium systems: Mechanisms and role in prebiotic chemistry |journal=[[Chirality (journal)|Chirality]] |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=589–600 |doi=10.1002/chir.20440 |issn=0899-0042 |pmid=17559107}} "Special Issue: Proceedings from the Eighteenth International Symposium on Chirality (ISCD-18), Busan, Korea, 2006"&lt;/ref&gt; Once established, chirality would be selected for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Clark (author) |date=July–August 1999 |title=Polarized Starlight and the Handedness of Life |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=87 |issue=4 |page=336 |bibcode=1999AmSci..87..336C |doi=10.1511/1999.4.336 |issn=0003-0996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small [[enantiomeric excess]] can be amplified into a large one by [[Autocatalysis#Asymmetric autocatalysis|asymmetric autocatalysis]], such as in the [[Soai reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shibata |first1=Takanori |last2=Morioka |first2=Hiroshi |last3=Hayase |first3=Tadakatsu |last4=Choji |first4=Kaori |last5=Soai |first5=Kenso |display-authors=3 |date=17 January 1996 |title=Highly Enantioselective Catalytic Asymmetric Automultiplication of Chiral Pyrimidyl Alcohol |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=118 |issue=2 |pages=471–472 |doi=10.1021/ja953066g |issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; In asymmetric autocatalysis, the catalyst is a chiral molecule, which means that a chiral molecule is catalysing its own production. An initial enantiomeric excess, such as can be produced by polarized light, then allows the more abundant enantiomer to outcompete the other.&lt;ref name="Soai2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soai |first1=Kenso |last2=Sato |first2=Itaru |last3=Shibata |first3=Takanori |year=2001 |title=Asymmetric autocatalysis and the origin of chiral homogeneity in organic compounds |journal=The Chemical Record |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=321–332 |doi=10.1002/tcr.1017 |issn=1528-0691 |pmid=11893072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One supposition is that the discovery of an enantiomeric imbalance in molecules in the [[Murchison meteorite]] supports an extraterrestrial origin of homochirality: there is evidence for the existence of [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized light]] originating from [[Mie scattering]] on aligned interstellar dust particles which may trigger the formation of an [[enantiomeric excess]] within chiral material in space.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich/&gt;{{rp|123&amp;ndash;124}} Interstellar and near-stellar magnetic fields can align dust particles in this fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Helman |first=Daniel S |date=6 July 2018 |title=Galactic Distribution of Chirality Sources of Organic Molecules |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=151 |pages=595–602 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.07.008 |issn=0094-5765|bibcode=2018AcAau.151..595H |arxiv=1612.06720 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another speculation (the Vester-Ulbricht hypothesis) suggests that fundamental chirality of physical processes such as that of the beta decay (see [[Parity (physics)|Parity violation]]) leads to slightly different half-lives of biologically relevant molecules. Homochirality may also result from [[spontaneous absolute asymmetric synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guava.physics.uiuc.edu/~nigel/courses/569/Essays_Fall2006/files/Rajan.pdf|title=How did protein amino acids get left-handed while sugars got right-handed?|first=Aruna|last=Rajan|publisher=Term Paper for Physics 569*|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soai_interview&gt;{{cite journal | journal= Highlights in Chemical Science |year= 2008 |issue= 5 |url= http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2008/05/Kenso_Soai_interview.asp |title= Interview: In the beginning... |accessdate=June 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible that homochirality is simply a result of the natural autoamplification process of life—that either the formation of life as preferring one chirality or the other was a chance rare event which happened to occur with the chiralities we observe, or that all chiralities of life emerged rapidly but due to catastrophic events and strong competition, the other unobserved chiral preferences were wiped out by the preponderance and metabolic, enantiomeric enrichment from the 'winning' chirality choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ermann |first1=L |title=Homochirality: the key to unlocking the origin of life? |journal=Applied Theoretical Biology |date=2013 |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=21–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of chirality consensus as a natural autoamplification process has been associated with the [[2nd law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cause of chirality consensus | author= Jaakkola, S., Sharma, V. and Annila, A.| journal = Curr.

===Amplification===
====Theory====
[[File:Frank's model phase portrait.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Phase portrait of Frank's model: starting from almost everywhere in &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; plane (except &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; = &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; line), the system approaches to one of the homochiral states]]
In 1953, [[Frederick Charles Frank|Charles Frank]] proposed a model to demonstrate that homochirality is a consequence of [[autocatalysis]].&lt;ref name="frank1953"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=F.C. |year=1953 |title=On spontaneous asymmetric synthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=11 |pages=459–463 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(53)90082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his model the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; enantiomers of a chiral molecule are autocatalytically produced from an achiral molecule A

:A + &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; → 2&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;,{{pad}}A + &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; → 2&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;

while suppressing each other through a reaction that he called ''mutual antagonism''

:&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; → ∅.
In this model the racemic state is unstable in the sense that the slightest enantiomeric excess will be amplified to a completely homochiral state. This can be shown by computing the reaction rates from the [[law of mass action]]:
:&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d[\ce L]}{dt}  &amp;= k_a [\ce L] - k_d \ce{[L] [D]}\\
\frac{d[\ce D]}{dt}  &amp;= k_a [\ce D] - k_d \ce{[L] [D]},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k_a&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for the autocatalytic reactions, &lt;math&gt;k_d&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for mutual antagonism reaction, and the concentration of A is kept constant for simplicity. By defining the enantiomeric excess &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math chem&gt;\Phi = \frac{[\ce D] - [\ce L]}{[\ce D] + [\ce L]},&lt;/math&gt;
we can compute the rate of change of enatiomeric excess using [[chain rule]] from the rate of change of the concentrations of enantiomeres &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;.
:&lt;math chem&gt;
\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = \left(\frac{2k_d \ce{[L] [D]}}{[\ce D] + [\ce L]}\right)\Phi.
&lt;/math&gt;
Linear stability analysis of this equation shows that the racemic state &lt;math&gt;\Phi = 0&lt;/math&gt; is unstable. Starting from [[almost everywhere]] in the concentration space, the system evolves to a homochiral state.

It is generally understood that autocatalysis alone does not yield to homochirality, and the presence of the mutually antagonistic relationship between the two enantiomers is necessary for the instability of the racemic mixture. However, recent studies show that homochirality could be achieved from autocatalysis in the absence of the mutually antagonistic relationship, but the underlying mechanism for symmetry-breaking is different.&lt;ref name="jafarpour2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2017 |title=Noise-induced symmetry breaking far from equilibrium and the emergence of biological homochirality |journal=Physical Review E |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=032407 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.95.032407|pmid=28415353 |bibcode=2017PhRvE..95c2407J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jafarpour2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2015 |title=Noise-induced mechanism for biological homochirality of early life self-replicators |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=115 |issue=15 |pages=158101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.158101|pmid=26550754 |arxiv=1507.00044 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115o8101J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Experiments====
There are several laboratory experiments that demonstrate how a small amount of one enantiomer at the start of a reaction can lead to a large excess of a single enantiomer as the product. For example, the Soai reaction is [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic]]. If the reaction is started with some of one of the product enantiomers already present, the product acts as an [[Enantioselective synthesis|enantioselective]] catalyst for production of more of that same enantiomer.&lt;ref name=shibata&gt;{{cite journal|title=Highly Enantioselective Catalytic Asymmetric Automultiplication of Chiral Pyrimidyl Alcohol|author1=Takanori Shibata |author2=Hiroshi Morioka |author3=Tadakatsu Hayase |author4=Kaori Choji |author5=Kenso Soai | journal = [[J.

Soc.]] | year=1996| volume= 118 | issue=2| pages=471–472 | doi=10.1021/ja953066g}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial presence of just 0.2 [[Equivalent (chemistry)|equivalent]] one enantiomer can lead to up to 93% [[enantiomeric excess]] of the product.

In this system, a small enantiomeric excess of catalyst leads to a large enantiomeric excess of product.

This finding may have consequences for the development of the [[Mars Organic Detector]] scheduled for launch in 2013 which aims to recover trace amounts of amino acids from the Mars surface exactly by a sublimation technique.

A high asymmetric amplification of the [[enantiomeric excess]] of sugars are also present in the [[amino acid]] catalyzed asymmetric formation of [[carbohydrates]]&lt;ref name=Engqvist&gt;{{cite journal| title=Plausible origins of homochirality in the amino acid catalyzed neogenesis of carbohydrates|author1=Armando Córdova |author2=Magnus Engqvist |author3=Ismail Ibrahem |author4=Jesús Casas |author5=Henrik Sundén | journal=[[Chem.

One classic study involves an experiment that takes place in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=kondepudi&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Sodium Chlorate Crystallization| author= Kondepudi, D. K., Kaufman, R. J. &amp; Singh, N.| journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 250 | pages = 975–976|year=1990|doi=10.1126/science.250.4983.975|pmid=17746924|issue=4983|bibcode = 1990Sci...250..975K }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[sodium chlorate]] is allowed to [[crystallization|crystallize]] from water and the collected crystals examined in a [[polarimeter]], each crystal turns out to be chiral and either the [[Levorotation|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;]] form or the [[Dextrorotation|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;]] form. In an ordinary experiment the amount of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; crystals collected equals the amount of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; crystals (corrected for statistical effects). However, when the sodium chlorate solution is stirred during the crystallization process the crystals are either exclusively &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; or exclusively &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;. In 32 consecutive crystallization experiments 14 experiments deliver &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-crystals and 18 others &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-crystals. The explanation for this symmetry breaking is unclear but is related to [[autocatalysis]] taking place in the [[nucleation]] process.

In a related experiment, a crystal suspension of a racemic [[amino acid]] derivative continuously stirred, results in a 100% crystal phase of one of the enantiomers because the enantiomeric pair is able to equilibrate in solution  (compare with [[dynamic kinetic resolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noorduin|first1=Wim L.|last2=Izumi|first2=Toshiko|last3=Millemaggi|first3=Alessia|last4=Leeman|first4=Michel|last5=Meekes|first5=Hugo|last6=Van Enckevort|first6=Willem J.

===Transmission===
Many strategies in [[asymmetric synthesis]] are built on chiral transmission. Especially important is the so-called [[organocatalysis]] of organic reactions by proline for example in [[Mannich reaction]]s.

==Optical resolution in racemic amino acids==
There exists no theory elucidating correlations among &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. If one takes, for example, [[alanine]], which has a small [[methyl]] group, and [[phenylalanine]], which has a larger [[benzyl]] group, a simple question is in what aspect, &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-alanine resembles &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine more than &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine, and what kind of mechanism causes the selection of all &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. Because it might be possible that alanine was &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and phenylalanine was &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;.

It was reported&lt;ref name=kojo&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Kojo |author2=H. Uchino |author3=M. Yoshimura |author4=K. Tanaka |title = Racemic D,L-asparagine causes enantiomeric excess of other coexisting racemic D,L-amino acids during recrystallization: a hypothesis accounting for the origin of L-amino acids in the biosphere.| journal = [[Chem. Comm.]] | pages= 2146–2147 | year= 2004|doi = 10.1039/b409941a|pmid=15467844|issue=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 that excess racemic [[asparagine|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-asparagine]] (Asn), which spontaneously forms crystals of either isomer during recrystallization, induces asymmetric resolution of a co-existing racemic amino acid such as [[arginine]] (Arg), [[aspartic acid]] (Asp), [[glutamine]] (Gln), [[histidine]] (His), [[leucine]] (Leu), [[methionine]] (Met), [[phenylalanine]] (Phe), [[serine]] (Ser), [[valine]] (Val), [[tyrosine]] (Tyr), and [[tryptophan]] (Trp). The [[enantiomeric excess]] {{math|ee {{=}} 100 &amp;times;(&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;)/(&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;+&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;)}} of these amino acids was correlated almost linearly with that of the inducer, i.e., Asn. When recrystallizations from a mixture of 12 &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids (Ala, Asp, Arg, Glu, Gln, His, Leu, Met, Ser, Val, Phe, and Tyr) and excess &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-Asn were made, all amino acids with the same configuration with Asn were preferentially co-crystallized.&lt;ref name=kojo/&gt; It was incidental whether the enrichment took place in &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;- or &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-Asn, however, once the selection was made, the co-existing amino acid with the same configuration at the α-carbon was preferentially involved because of thermodynamic stability in the crystal formation. The maximal ee was reported to be 100%. Based on these results, it is proposed that a mixture of racemic amino acids causes spontaneous and effective optical resolution, even if asymmetric synthesis of a single amino acid does not occur without an aid of an optically active molecule.

This is the first study elucidating reasonably the formation of chirality from racemic amino acids with experimental evidences.

==History of term==
This term was introduced by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] in 1904, the year that he published his Baltimore Lecture of 1884. Kelvin used the term homochirality as a relationship between two molecules, i.e. two molecule are homochiral if they have the same chirality.&lt;ref name=Engqvist/&gt;&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=David G.|title=Stereochemistry|date=2001|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-84755-194-8|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, however, homochiral has been used in the same sense as [[enantiomer]]ically pure. This is permitted in some journals (but not encouraged),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anslyn|first1=Eric V.|last2=Dougherty|first2=Dennis A.|title=Modern physical organic chemistry|date=2006|publisher=University Science Books|location=Sausalito, Calif.|isbn=9781891389313}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|342}}&lt;ref&gt;However, the message can be confusing. In {{cite journal|last1=Moss|first1=G. P.|title=Basic terminology of stereochemistry (IUPAC Recommendations 1996)|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|date=1 January 1996|volume=68|issue=12|pages=2193–2222|doi=10.1351/pac199668122193|url=https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/pac.1996.68.issue-12/pac199668122193/pac199668122193.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2018}}, the entry for ''Enantiomerically Pure/Enantiopure'' says "Use of homochiral as a synonym is strongly discouraged"; but the entry for ''Homochiral'' says "See ''enantiomerically pure/enantiopure''."&lt;/ref&gt; its meaning changing into the preference of a process or system for a single [[optical isomer]] in a pair of isomers in these journals.

The '''human condition''' is "the characteristics, key events, and situations which compose the essentials of [[human]] existence, such as birth, growth, emotionality, aspiration, conflict, and mortality".&lt;ref&gt;"[[wikt:human condition|human condition]]" entry at [[Wiktionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very broad topic which has been and continues to be pondered and analyzed from many perspectives, including those of [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[art]], [[literature]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], and [[biology]].

As a [[terminology|literary term]], "the human condition" is typically used in the context of ambiguous subjects such as the [[meaning of life]] or [[morality|moral concerns]].&lt;ref name="lit"&gt;[http://learn.lexiconic.net/humancondition.htm The human condition in literature]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some perspectives==

Each [[major religious groups|major religion]] has definitive beliefs regarding the human condition. For example, [[Buddhism]] [[Four Noble Truths|teaches]] that life is a perpetual cycle of [[dukkha|suffering]], death, and rebirth from which humans can be liberated via the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. Meanwhile, [[Christianity]] teaches that humans are born in a [[original sin|sinful condition]] and are [[Christian views on hell|doomed]] in the [[afterlife]] unless they receive [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] through [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].

Philosophers have provided many perspectives. An influential ancient view was that of the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' in which [[Plato]] explored the question "what is justice?" and postulated that it is not primarily a matter among individuals but of [[society]] as a whole, prompting him to devise a [[utopia]]. Two thousand years later [[René Descartes]] declared "[[Cogito ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]" because he believed the human mind, particularly its faculty of [[reason]], to be the primary determiner of [[truth]]; for this he is often credited as the father of modern philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&amp;pg=PA511 ''History of Western Philosophy''] pp.511, 516–7&lt;/ref&gt; One such modern school, [[existentialism]], attempts to reconcile an individual's sense of disorientation and confusion in a universe believed to be [[absurdism|absurd]].

Many works of literature provide perspective on the human condition.&lt;ref name="lit"/&gt; One famous example is [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] monologue "[[All the world's a stage]]" that pensively summarizes seven phases of human life.

Psychology has many theories, such as [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] and the notion of [[identity crisis]]. It also has various methods, e.g. the [[logotherapy]] developed by [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor [[Viktor Frankl]] to discover and affirm human meaning. Another method, [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], has become a widespread treatment for [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Driessen Ellen |author2=Hollon Steven D | year = 2010 | title = Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Mood Disorders: Efficacy, Moderators and Mediators | url = | journal = Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 537–55 | doi=10.1016/j.psc.2010.04.005 | pmid=20599132 | pmc=2933381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since 1859, when [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', the biological [[scientific theory|theory]] of [[evolution]] has been significant. The theory posits that the human [[species]] is related to all others, living and extinct, and that [[natural selection]] is the primary survival factor. This has provided a basis for new beliefs, e.g. [[social Darwinism]], and for new [[technology]], e.g. [[antibiotics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gladki A, Kaczanowski S, Szczesny P, Zielenkiewicz P |title=The evolutionary rate of antibacterial drug targets |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=14 |pages=36 |date=February 2013 |pmid=23374913 |url= |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-14-36 |pmc=3598507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the term==

Notable uses of the term "the human condition" include  [[André Malraux]]'s novel ''[[Man's Fate]]'', [[René Magritte]]'s painting ''[[The Human Condition (painting)|La Condition Humaine]]'', [[Hannah Arendt]]'s [[The Human Condition (book)|political philosophy]], and [[Masaki Kobayashi]]'s [[The Human Condition (film series)|film trilogy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5392">The '''human spirit''' is a component of human [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[art]], and [[knowledge]] - the spiritual or mental part of humanity. While the term can be used with the same meaning as "human soul",  human spirit is sometimes used to refer to the impersonal, universal or higher component of human nature in contrast to [[soul]] or '''''psyche''''' which can refer to the ego or lower element. The human spirit includes our intellect, emotions, fears, passions, and creativity.

In the models of [[Daniel A. Helminiak]] and [[Bernard Lonergan]], human spirit is considered to be the mental functions of [[awareness]], [[insight]], [[understanding]], [[judgement]] and other reasoning powers.  It is distinguished from the separate component of [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] which comprises the entities of [[emotion]], [[image]]s, [[memory]] and [[Personality type|personality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DL9hwUBJm18C |title=The human core of spirituality: mind as psyche and spirit |author=Daniel A. Helminiak |isbn=978-0-7914-2950-1 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Teske views human spirit as a [[social construct]] representing the qualities of purpose and [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] which transcend the individual human.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=6i5ynN9qX30C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA189 |title=The human person in science and theology |chapter=The Social Construction of the Human Spirit |author=John Teske |isbn=978-0-567-08692-1 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction between the human spirit and soul==
According to  historian [[Oswald Spengler]], a distinction between Spirit and Soul has been made by the West and earlier civilizations which influenced its development.&lt;ref name = "spengler"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Spengler
|first=Oswald
|title=The Decline of the west(An abridged edition)
|chapter= vol2, chpt: 3 &amp; 8
|year=1922
|isbn=1-4000-9700-2
|publisher= Vintage Books, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The human spirit can be seen as the heavenly component of  human's non material makeup -  the part that is impersonal or universal.  Whereas souls are the personal element unique to each individual.  As Spengler writes in ''[[The Decline of the West]]'':

{{cquote| ... more important than all this is the opposition of Spirit and Soul (Hebrew: ''ruach'' and ''nephesh'', Persian: ''ahu'' and ''urvan'', Mandasan: ''monuhmed'' and ''gyan'', Greek: ''pneuma'' and ''psyche'') which first comes out in the basic feeling of the prophetic religions, then pervades the whole of Apocalyptic, and finally forms and guides the world-contemplations of the awakened Culture - as seen with Philo, Paul and Plotinus, Gnostics and Mandeans, Augustine and the Avesta, Islam and the Kabbalah. ''Ruach'' means originally "wind" and ''nephesh'' "breath."  The ''nephesh'' is always in one way or another related to the bodily and earthly, to the below, the evil, the darkness. Its effort is the "upward." The ''ruach'' belongs to the divine, to the above, to the light. Its effects in man when it descends are the heroism of a Samson, the holy wrath of an Elijah, the enlightenment of the judge (e.g. Solomon passing judgment) and all kinds of divination and ecstasy. It is poured out. As in Isaiah xi, x, the Messiah becomes the incarnation of the ''ruach''.&lt;ref name = "spengler"/&gt;}}

In Christianity, the [[Bible]] identifies humanity's three basic elements: spirit, soul and body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thes%205:23&amp;version=NIV 1 Thes 5:23]&lt;/ref&gt;  Christians emphasise  that the human spirit is the 'real person', the very core of a person's being, the essential seat of their existence. When a person accepts Jesus Christ as their Saviour, it is their human spirit that is transformed as they become 'new creatures' in Jesus Christ. The soul which is the seat of the will, mind and emotions does not get converted but needs to be renewed on a daily basis through the recommended Christian disciplines such as prayer and reading the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%206:17&amp;version=NIV 1 Cor 6:17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%206:17&amp;version=NIV 2 Cor 5:17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%206:17&amp;version=NIV Rom 12:2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In Islam, Muslims are viewed as having their own spirits, but one that in a sense is one with God's spirit. For [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler]], the perception of unity this idea led to was important for the emergence of the "consensus" that maintained harmony in Islamic culture, especially during the [[Golden Age of Islam]].&lt;ref name = "spengler"/&gt;

'''Jedediah Aaker''' is a musician, performer, theatrical producer, and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]-area personality. A fixture on cable series ''[[Portlandia (TV series)|Portlandia]]'', he has appeared in more episodes than anyone besides the series' two leads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=15 Things You Probably Didn’t Know About Portlandia |url=https://www.ifc.com/2014/12/15-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-portlandia |date=December 2014 |website=''IFC'' |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PDX-native is also a multiple-award-winning, ''Whisker Wars''-celebrated competitive bearder who co-founded the Portland Beardsmen.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jamie |first1=Hale |title=Portland beardsman Jedediah Aaker prepares for the World Beard and Moustache Championships |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/portlands_resident_beardsmen_j.html |date=23 October 2014 |website=''The Oregonian'' |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has worn a Christmas sweater on the cover of ''[[The Portland Mercury]]'' and appeared as a shirtless model on the front page of ''[[Willamette Week]]''{{'}}s 2018 &lt;q&gt;Beer&lt;/q&gt; issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/willametteweek/docs/44.18_-_willamette_week__february_2|title=44 18 willamette week, february 28, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked as bartender for a failing club featured on the fourth season of ''[[Bar Rescue]]'' and as host of Barfly Bus Tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Panic Room on Bar Rescue: &lt;q&gt;They were setting us up to fail.&lt;/q&gt; |url=https://www.wweek.com/arts/2015/07/28/panic-room-on-bar-rescue-they-were-setting-us-up-to-fail/ |date=28 July 2015 |website=Willamette Week |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.barflybus.com|title=BarFly Bus Tours of Portland Oregon|website=BarFly Bus Tours of Portland Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paramountnetwork.com/episodes/n395kv/bar-rescue-ants-with-wings-bro-season-4-ep-25|title=Bar Rescue - Ants With Wings, Bro! - Paramount Network|website=Paramount Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Mail'' referred to him as a &lt;q&gt;Portland character&lt;/q&gt; and &lt;q&gt;professional party host&lt;/q&gt;, and alternative newspaper ''Willamette Week'' dubbed him a &lt;q&gt;beard-about-town&lt;/q&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Ruth |title=Headout: Puddin' Slam Ladies rassle in white goop: &lt;q&gt;It's empowering.&lt;/q&gt; |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-18956-headout-puddin-slam.html |date=20 March 2012 |website=''Willamette Week'' |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2018 feature article titled &lt;q&gt;Twilight of the Hipsters&lt;/q&gt;, the French edition of [[Rolling Stone]] introduced Aaker as an &lt;q&gt;actor, concert booker, chauffeur for rock stars, and distributor of the Lucky Egg vending machines that he installs in bars.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Saferis |first1=Camille |title=Le Crepuscule des Hipsters |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/377581449/2018-04-01-Rolling-Stone-Hors-Serie |date=April 2018 |website=''Rolling Stone'' |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Portlandia''==
''Portlandia'' first entered the global consciousness after satirical music video &lt;q&gt;Dream of the ‘90s&lt;/q&gt; premiered online in December 2010 and thrust [[Saturday Night Live]] star [[Fred Armisen]] between a motley assemblage of circus folk, exotic dancers, and idiosyncratically-styled local luminaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wappler |first1=Margaret |title='Portlandia': Where the dream of the '90s lives on... |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/01/portlandia-where-the-dream-of-the-90s-lives-on-1.html |date=6 January 2011 |website="Los Angeles Times" |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standing directly to the right of Armisen throughout the video while wearing only star-spangled swim briefs, black leather, and a sizable beard, Aaker stood out as the swiftly-trending clip sparked interest worldwide in the forthcoming sketch comedy series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Aaron |title=Portlanders Bid Mixed Goodbyes To 'Portlandia' |url=https://www.opb.org/artsandlife/article/portlandia-final-season-portland-oregon-reaction/ |date=24 January 2018 |website="OPB" |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, Aaker soon became widely known as, in the words of ''Willamette Week'', &lt;q&gt;that guy in underwear and a leather jacket in the ‘Dream of the ‘90s’ clip.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Willamette Geek: The Week in Geek |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-28088-willamette-geek-the-week-in-geek.html |date=16 January 2012 |website=''Willamette Week'' |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to serving as a [[Extra (acting)|background actor]] on several episodes, Aaker has played a scavenger hunt umpire, a member of Spyke’s wedding party, and a guest at [[List of Portlandia characters|Nina]]'s birthday party.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Locker |first1=Melissa |title=The Citizens of Portlandia: Jedediah Aaker |url=https://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia/blog/2014/01/citizens-of-portlandia-jedediah-aaker |website="IFC" |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranking the &lt;q&gt;Best and Worst&lt;/q&gt; of the series’ third season, ''[[Portland Monthly]]'' critic John Chandler determined the &lt;q&gt;hirsute man-about-town&lt;/q&gt; tied with a veteran theater actress for &lt;q&gt;Best Performance By A Local&lt;/q&gt;. Although &lt;q&gt;Aaker plays himself (presumably)&lt;/q&gt; in episodes four and five, Chandler wrote, &lt;q&gt;the man’s beard has star quality.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chandler |first1=John |title=Portlandia Season 3: The Best and Worst So Far |url=https://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2013/1/31/portlandia-season-3 |date=31 January 2013 |website="Portland Monthly" |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By season four, Aaker had appeared in almost two dozen of the 37 episodes then filmed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Additionally, he served as [[Kumail Nanjiani]]'s assistant on [[webisode]]s of IFC's travelogue series ''Kumail Tours Portland''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia/blog/2013/01/portlandia-kumail-visits-a-tiny-house-in-portlandia|title=Kumail Nanjiani visits Portlandia’s tiniest house|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the series finished its eighth and final season in the spring of 2018, its network [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]] estimated that the collective number of Aaker's various performances ranked below only co-founders [[Armisen]] and [[Carrie Brownstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hutchinson |first1=Sean |title=15 Things You Probably Didn’t Know About Portlandia |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/60769/15-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-portlandia |date=29 December 2014 |website="Mental Floss" |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Portraitlandia"===
In 2013, during a month-long residency at Portland’s Newspace Center for Photography, acclaimed [[San Francisco]] photographer Kirk Crippens sought out 45 PDX locals for a series of portraits eventually titled "Portraitlandia". Over the next year, according to ''Portland Monthly'', the &lt;q&gt;series went viral, drawing millions of eyes to the site of its photographer.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Aaron |title=Portraitlandia Asks Us: What Do We Look Like (NSFW) |url=https://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2014/1/17/portraitlandia-january-2014 |date=17 January 2014 |website=Portland Monthly |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images from the Portraitlandia series would be exhibited at London's [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in conjunction with the [[Taylor Wessing#Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize|Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize]] and toured the United States as part of the Photolucida exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rosenberg |first1=David |title=Up-Close and Quirky Photos With the Glorious Residents of Portland |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2013/11/14/kirk_crippens_portraitlandia_examines_the_quirky_residents_of_portland_photos.html |date=14 November 2013 |website=Slate |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Crippens told [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] that he’d &lt;q&gt;expected his work to stand in sharp contrast to the fictions&lt;/q&gt; of ''Portlandia'', the artist found &lt;q&gt;significant overlap&lt;/q&gt; – particularly so when the first episode he saw after beginning the project happened to showcase Aaker and another two planned subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brook |first1=Pete |title=Portraitlandia Confirms and Refutes Everything You Think About Portland |url=https://www.wired.com/2013/07/portraitlandia/ |date=10 July 2013 |website=Wired |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaker, &lt;q&gt;a man about town who owns his own lion suit,&lt;/q&gt; was among Crittens’ favorite subjects.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; For their shoot, Crittens said Aakers made available the roof of the nightclub where he tended bar and then asked the photographer &lt;q&gt;if I wanted him to curl up like a kitty in the ivy growing over the top of the roof. Yes, yes I did.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Gregory Eddi |title=Interview with Kirk Crippens, the Artist Behind ‘Portraitlandia’ |url=https://petapixel.com/2013/10/29/interview-kirk-crippens-photographer-behind-portraitlandia/ |date=29 October 2013 |website="PetaPixel" |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Aaker has been involved with several NW rock bands. He spent years playing bass for the Fabulous Miss Wendy, a performer who has toured with [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and was lauded as the &lt;q&gt;sexiest rock star ever&lt;/q&gt; by [[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cavuto |first1=Robert |title=The Fabulous Miss Wendy – No One Can Stop Me! |url=http://guitarinternational.com/2012/09/17/wendy/ |date=17 September 2017 |website=Guitar International |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He’s a founding member and bassist of The Gnash, whose music he has compared to &lt;q&gt;a primer-gray broken down Camaro.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The group recently put out a split single on the [[Voodoo Doughnut Recordings]] label entitled &lt;q&gt;She Took My Doughnut (And Left Me the Hole)&lt;/q&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.voodoodoughnutrecordings.com/artists/the-gnash/scuzz-rock-split/|title=Scuzz Rock Split • Voodoo Doughnut Recordings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He’s currently a member of the re-united Lucky Thirteens with former Weaklings vocalist Bradly Battin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2255777-The-Lucky-Thirteens|title=The Lucky Thirteens|website=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Battins and Aaker previously played together in short-lived 00s group DARLINS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/darlins|title=♫ A Last Time For Everything - Darlins. Listen @cdbaby|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One venue owner explained the Lucky Thirteens’ sound as &lt;q&gt;fun, poppy-punk like you’d hear coming out of the jukebox ... back in 2000.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Labor Temple Bar Resurrects Portland Punk Scene |url=http://www.coastweekend.com/cw/music/20180530/labor-temple-bar-resurrects-portland-punk-scene |date=30 May 2018 |website=Coast Weekend |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years throughout the 2000s, Aaker served as frontman of glam metal group Diamond Tuck &amp; The Privates – &lt;q&gt;an eight-piece band carefully culled from the lifers of the Portland rock scene.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vegas |first1=Viva Las |title=Stripper Sluts Hit The Road With Portland's Two Hottest Rock Bands: Diamond Tuck &amp; The Privates and Starantula |url=http://www.xmag.com/archives/11-12-jun04/feature2.html |date=June 2004 |website="Exotic Magazine" |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Willamette Week'' referred to their appearance on a (local punk mainstay) Club 21 compilation as &lt;q&gt;epic … buttrock.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Soule |first1=Sam |title=VARIOUS ARTISTS Club 21, Fuck Yeah!

==Theater==
In 2009, Aaker and Diamond Tuck guitarist &lt;q&gt;Private&lt;/q&gt; Mike Albano led the live band during performances of writer/director/producer Jeffery &lt;q&gt;Wonderful&lt;/q&gt; Wilson’s rock opera ''Chariots of Rubber'' during performances at the [[Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.portlandmercury.com/events/1489094/chariots-of-rubber|title=Chariots of Rubber|website=Portland Mercury}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review from the [[Portland State University]] [[Daily Vanguard|Vanguard]], described the original score as &lt;q&gt;1980s metal with a dash of [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|Rocky Horror Picture Show]].&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kinney |first1=Anita |title=The Passion of the Metal Areola Snatchers |url=http://psuvanguard.com/the-passion-of-the-metal-areola-snatchers/ |date=29 October 2009 |website=PSU Vanguard |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Aaker and Wilson again joined forces as, respectively, producer and director of ''Hot Gun''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Williams |first1=Lee |title=Original Performances on Unique Stages Reinvent Portland Theater |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/performance/index.ssf/2010/07/original_performances_on_uniqu.html |date=1 July 2010 |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;q&gt;rock ’n’ roll re-imagining of the iconic blockbuster [[Top Gun]]&lt;/q&gt; was performed live on stage at PDX nightclub [[Dante's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hallet |first1=Allison |title=Top Gun: The Musical |url=https://www.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2010/04/09/top-gun-the-musical |date=9 April 2010 |website="The Portland Mercury" |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review from ''Portland Monthly'', their critic admired the multimedia production’s deft manipulation of the original film – inserting previously-shot scenes of the stage actors into aerial battles – but found the comedy’s &lt;q&gt;laughs were loudest with the in-crowd. The novelty of seeing friends dressed funny, and/or comically incorporated into video footage, was the bulk of the fun.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Anne |title=Between Theater and Bar |url=https://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2010/5/31/63110theater-bar-cp |website=Portland Monthly |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Willamette Week'', however, raved ''Hot Gun''’s &lt;q&gt;summer stock-'n'-roll aesthetic, artfully unchoreographed and shruggably brilliant, resembles an old movie naval pageant (coconut bras on bearded men, absent camp or shame) blessed with the underutilized talents peculiar to Portland ...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Horton |first1=Jay |title=Hot Gun (Wonderdiamond Productions) The Iceman Cometh |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-12079-i-hot-gun-i-wonderdiamond-productions.html |date=8 June 2010 |website="Willamette Week" |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, Aaker brought John Walterich’s online-dating satire ''Brie'' to the stage of the Tonic Lounge for a brief run. ''Willamette Week'' critic Jonathan Frochtzwajg described the production as &lt;/q&gt;a largely amateur, very tattooed cast ... scored live by rotating punk-rock acts.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Frochtzwajg |first1=Jonathan |title=Brie |url=https://issuu.com/willametteweek/docs/38.05_-_willamette_week__december_7 |date=7 December 2011 |website=Willamette Week |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
Aaker acted in the 2017 film ''Neil Stryker and the Tyrant of Time'' alongside TV icons [[Walter Koenig]] ([[Pavel Chekov|Ensign Pavel Chekov]])and [[David Ogden Stiers]] ([[List of M*A*S*H characters#Charles Winchester|Major Charles Emerson Winchester]]). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4394034/|title=Neil Stryker and the Tyrant of Time|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he was a central figure in the 2017 documentary ''Thank You for Supporting the Arts'', which also features [[Gus Van Sant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt7391464/|title=Thank You for Supporting the Arts|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doc explores the physical and emotional trauma suffered by author and exotic dancer Liv &lt;q&gt;Viva Las Vegas&lt;/q&gt; Osthus following her fight against breast cancer and subsequent mastectomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Perry |first1=Douglas |title=Documentary about iconic Portland stripper Viva Las Vegas screens for local audiences |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2018/04/documentary_about_iconic_portl.html |date=30 April 2017 |website="The Oregonian" |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osthus and Aaker were in a relationship for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Osthus |first1=Liv |title=A Reality Show for Couples Therapy?

==Hosting==
As a judge for the 2011 West Coast Beard and Mustache Championships, Aaker appeared in a 2011 episode of the ''Whisker Wars'' cable reality series. &lt;q&gt;You're not judging on what's the biggest or the longest but ... the grandest,&lt;/q&gt; he told the ''Oregonian''. &lt;q&gt;It just has the magic glow ...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He’s also regularly called upon to help select the winners of various events around the Portland area such as the Bacon Cup, the Iron Bartender competition, the horror short GuignolFest, and Portland’s inaugural Pudding Wrestling Massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pdxpipeline.com/events/july-16-bacon-cup-ash-st-saloon-bacon-wrestling-strippers-music-recipes/|title=July 16: Bacon Cup @ Ash St Saloon - Bacon Wrestling, Strippers, Music, Recipes|date=15 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yelp.com/events/portland-iron-bartender-2010|title=Iron Bartender 2010, Portland, OR|website=Yelp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://portlandtribune.com/pt/11-features/121371-bits--and--pieces|title=Bits &amp; Pieces|first=Jason|last=Vondersmith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-18956-headout-puddin-slam.html|title=Headout: Puddin' Slam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] article that takes its title (&lt;q&gt;Every Vagina Is A Snowflake&lt;/q&gt;) from a quote given by Aaker, the magazine noted that the &lt;q&gt;returning judge&lt;/q&gt; brought his own props overseeing the beauty pageant for exotic dancers' nether regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shepard |first1=Susan Elizabeth |title=Every Vagina Is a Snowflake: A Dispatch from Portland's Vagina Beauty Pageant |url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/qvddxv/every-vagina-is-a-snowflake-a-dispatch-from-portlands-vagina-beauty-pageant |date=5 August 2015 |website=Vice |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bearding==
Aaker has been cultivating his beard for more than ten years.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; He’s become a notable figure in competitive bearding events, winning several freestyle awards, and can be seen in the first season of IFC series ''Whisker Wars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rob |first1=Owen |title=IFC's 'Whisker Wars' Focuses on Competitive Beard Growing?

At the 2014 [[World Beard and Moustache Championships]] held inside Portland’s [[Keller Auditorium]], which hosted 300 contestants from ten countries, Aaker emerged as a fan favorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hale |first1=Jamie |title=Hairy Controversy Surrounds World Beard and Moustache Championships, Coming to Portland This Weekend |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/hairy_controversy_surrounds_wo.html |date=23 October 2014 |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oregonian'' reported that he "somehow got extra time, walking onstage in short shorts and a white fur coat, his red beard shaped into a flying V guitar, gyrating his belly to the roar of the crowd. He walked away with sixth place, but he stole the audience's heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hale |first1=Jamie |title=World Beard and Moustache Championships Draws Huge Crowd to Portland, Spirals Into Chaos Onstage |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/world_beard_and_moustache_cham_1.html |date=25 October 2014 |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Aaker helped found the Portland Beardsmen – a band of facial-hair enthusiasts who compete for prizes awarded on the merits of beard size, grooming, style, creativity, and other characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandbeardsmen.com|title=Home|website=The Portland Beardsmen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nonprofit group raises funds for transportation to far-flung tournaments, and they also organize charitable efforts such as beard-wielded car washes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Staff |first1=FOX 12 |title=Portland Beardsmen Surprise Moms with Flower Deliveries |url=http://www.kptv.com/story/31819718/portland-beardsmen-surprise-moms-with-flower-deliveries |date=25 October 2014 |website=KPTV |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their annual Beards N Roses drive each Mother’s Day, hirsute members don brightly-colored tights and tutus for delivering bouquets to Portland-area moms. Aaker helped originate the program six years ago to benefit the [[Uprise Books Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hale |first1=Jamie |title=Portland Beardsmen Don Tutus, Deliver Mother's Day Flowers Around the City |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/05/portland_beardsmen_don_tutus_d.html |date=9 May 2015 |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portland Beardsmen===
On the evening of August 28, 2012, Aaker was among 13 bearded men detained at gunpoint by officers from the [[Portland Police Bureau|Portland police]] on the [[Burnside Bridge]] during what ''the Oregonian'' termed "a military-themed photo shoot for breast cancer awareness." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bailey Jr. |first1=Everton |title=Rifle, body armor on Burnside Bridge lead to arrests during 'Beards for Breasts' photo shoot |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/08/rifle_body_armor_on_burnside_b.html |date=30 August 2012 |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an unnamed observer’s [[9-1-1|911]] call alerted authorities about suspicious characters wearing camouflaged body armor, both sides of the bridge were closed for nearly an hour as the police investigated the situation. Two men were taken into custody for disorderly conduct and carrying an (unloaded) AR-15 assault rifle through a public space.

According to [[KPTV]] News, the group was organized by Aaker to aid a national fundraising campaign entitled &lt;q&gt;Beards for Breast Cancer&lt;/q&gt; that was assembling a calender featuring pictures of bearding groups from around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Webstaff |first1=FOX 12 |title=Burnside Bridge scare suspects: 'We are the good guys' |url=http://www.kptv.com/story/19423445/burnside-bridge-scare-suspects-we-are-the-good-guys?clienttype=printable |date=30 August 2012 |website="KPTV" |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Portland contingent was designated to appear alongside July, Aaker thought the resulting photo should feel especially patriotic, which led several of the beardsmen to don militaristic garb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Staff |first1=KING |title=Bearded men on bridge cause alarm, but it's all for charity |url=https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/bearded-men-on-bridge-cause-alarm-but-its-all-for-charity/330729166 |date=30 August 2012 |website="KING-TV" |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[KATU]] News reported that Aaker himself had on an [[NSYNC]] T-shirt.) "We are the good guys," Aaker told the station, "just a bunch of dudes walking across the bridge wearing camo getting rad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kalkstein |first1=Meghan |title='Just a bunch of dudes walking across the bridge wearing camo' |url=https://kval.com/news/offbeat/just-a-bunch-of-dudes-walking-across-the-bridge-wearing-camo-11-21-2015 |date=28 August 2012 |website="KVAL" |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Khyrunnisa A.jpg|alt=Khyrunnisa A; Creator &amp; author of the Butterfingers' series.|thumb|'''Nationality:''' Indian
'''Genre:''' Children's Book, Realistic Fiction
]]'''Khyrunnisa A.''' is a prize-winning Indian author of children’s fiction, speaker, academic and a columnist, who created the iconic popular comic book character 'Butterfingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://penguin.co.in/author/a-khyrunnisa/|title=Khyrunnisa A - Penguin India|work=Penguin India|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character first appeared in a leading children’s magazine called ''[[Tinkle]]''. Thirteen-year-old Amar Kishen, aka Butterfingers, now features in the eponymous Butterfingers series of novels and short story collections published by [[Puffin Books|Puffin]], the children’s imprint of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Books]] India, currently Penguin Random House India.

Khyrunnisa’s first three children’s novels ''Howzzat Butterfingers!'' (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/All-about-Butterfingers/article16191991.ece|title=All about Butterfingers|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Goal, Butterfingers! (2012)'' and ''Clean Bowled, Butterfingers!'' ''(2015)'', were followed by two collections of short stories, ''The Misadventures of Butterfingers (2016'') and ''Run, It's Butterfingers Again!'' (2017). All the Butterfingers books were launched by [[Shashi Tharoor|Shashi Tharoor, Member of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/thumbs-up-for-indian-writing/article18476520.ece|title=Thumbs up for Indian writing|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book of her prize-winning stories, ''Lost in Ooty and Other Adventure Stories'', was brought out by Unisun Publications in 2010. Some of her stories for children and for adults have appeared in anthologies published by Puffin, Children’s Book Trust, Talking Cub and Unisun Publications. She writes stories regularly for the children’s magazine, ''Dimdima'', a Bhavan’s publication.

‘Butterfingers,’ Khyrunnisa’s entry for the Annual All India Tinkle Short story competition for adult writers of children’s fiction in 1996, won her the second prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/packing-a-punch/article7976594.ece|title=Packing a punch|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to win the first prize at the competition for the next seven consecutive years – from 1997-2003. In 2007, she won the prestigious Unisun Children’s Fiction Award. She also has five Children’s Book Trust prizes to her credit.

== Personal life ==
Khyrunnisa’s parents, A.R. Bijli and Ayesha Bijli, settled down in Trivandrum as her father, a post master, believed that Trivandrum was the best place to provide his eight children, seven of whom were girls, with good education.

She continues to reside in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, with her husband P. Vijaya Kumar, a former professor of  English and the grandson of Mahakavi Kumaran Asan, who was one of the triumvirate poets of Kerala,a philosopher, a social reformer and a disciple of Sree Narayana Guru.They have one son, Amar Vijaykumar, an engineer, who is married to Arpitha Sridhara. The two are currently working in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yentha.com/news/view/4/LITERATURE-Author-Profile-Khyrunnisa-A|title=LITERATURE: Author Profile - Khyrunnisa A - Trivandrum News {{!}} Yentha.com|last=yentha.com|website=www.yentha.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/go-butter-go/article18387112.ece|title=Go, Butter, go!|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Butterfingers ==
The Butterfinger series revolves around the hilarious escapades of thirteen-year-old Amar Kishen, a class VIII student of the fictitious Green Park Higher Secondary School. Amar’s slip-grip methods and his clumsy antics earned him the nickname Butterfingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/interview-with-khyrunnisa-a-on-clean-bowled-butterfingers/article7350130.ece|title=For the kid within|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterfingers, named after Khyrunnisa’s son, Amar, first appeared in 2006 in [[Tinkle]], a popular fortnightly Indian children's magazine, as a regular comic-strip character. The illustrations were by Abhijeet Kini, the Mumbai based illustrator and graphic artist.

The popular Butterfingers series, published by Puffin, began with the novel, ''Howzzat Butterfingers!'' , In 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/All-about-Butterfingers/article16191991.ece|title=All about Butterfingers|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This humorous cricket-based book was followed in 2012 by ''Goal, Butterfingers!''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/packing-a-punch/article7976594.ece|title=Packing a punch|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' a rollicking football-based adventure novel which also includes a socially relevant environmental theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yentha.com/news/view/4/LITERATURE-Author-Profile-Khyrunnisa-A|title=LITERATURE: Author Profile - Khyrunnisa A - Trivandrum News {{!}} Yentha.com|last=yentha.com|website=www.yentha.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third in the series, ''‘Clean Bowled, Butterfingers!'' was published in 2015 and is another cricket-based novel with a hilariously farcical plot in which Amar and his friends invent a variation of cricket called ‘Crack It’ when the school’s cricket gear gets stolen. This game, played without cricket bats and balls, has its own absurd rules and generates immense fun.

''The Misadventures of Butterfingers'', the fourth book in the series, came out in 2016 and is a collection of short stories. It was followed by another collection of delightful short stories'', Run! It’s Butterfingers Again!''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/go-butter-go/article18387112.ece|title=Go, Butter, go!|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/thumbs-up-for-indian-writing/article18476520.ece|title=Thumbs up for Indian writing|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2017.

The books have received praise from different quarters. The late [[Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi|Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi]], former Indian cricket captain and legend, wrote of ''Howzzat Butterfingers!'': ‘What great fun! It brings back memories of my prep school days.’ The ace cricketer [[V. V. S. Laxman|V.V.S. Laxman]] described ''Clean Bowled Butterfingers'' as an ‘exuberant mix of school, cricket and fun.’ [[Shashi Tharoor]], writer, MP and diplomat, complimented Khyrunnisa ‘not just for creating Butterfingers, but for enriching Indian writing with world-class children’s literature.’

The term '''laterality''' refers to the preference most [[humans]] show for one side of their [[Human body|body]] over the other. Examples include [[Handedness|left-handedness/right-handedness]] and left/right-[[footedness]]; it may also refer to the primary use of the left or right hemisphere in the brain. It may also apply to animals or plants. The majority of tests have been conducted on humans, specifically to determine the effects on language.

== Human ==

The majority of humans are [[right-handed]]. Many are also right-sided in general (that is, they prefer to use their right [[human eye|eye]], right [[foot]] and right [[ear]] if forced to make a choice between the two). The reasons for this are not fully understood, but it is thought that because the left [[cerebral hemisphere]] of the [[brain]] controls the right side of the body, the right side is generally stronger; it is suggested that the left cerebral hemisphere is dominant over the right in most humans because in 90-92% of all humans, the left hemisphere is the [[language]] hemisphere.

Human [[culture]]s are predominantly right-handed, and so the right-sided trend may be socially as well as biologically enforced. This is quite apparent from a quick survey of [[language]]s. The [[English language|English]] word "left" comes from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] word ''lyft'' which means "weak" or "useless". Similarly, the [[French language|French]] word for left, ''gauche'', is also used to mean "awkward" or "tactless", and ''sinistra'', the [[Latin]] word from which the English word "sinister" was derived, means "left". Similarly, in many cultures the word for "right" also means "correct". The English word "right" comes from the Anglo-Saxon word ''riht'' which also means "straight" or "correct."

This linguistic and social bias is not restricted to European cultures: for example, [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters are designed for right-handers to write, and no significant left-handed culture has ever been found in the world.

When a person is forced to use the hand opposite of the hand that they would naturally use, this is known as ''forced laterality'', or more specifically ''forced dextrality''.  A study done by the Department of Neurology at Keele University, North Staffordshire Royal Infirmary suggests that forced dextrality may be part of the reason that the percentage of left-handed people decreases with the higher age groups, both because the effects of pressures toward right-handedness are cumulative over time (hence increasing with age for any given person subjected to them) and because the prevalence of such pressure is decreasing, such that fewer members of younger generations face any such pressure to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = S. J. | last2 = Ellis | first2 = P. J. | last3 = Marshall | first3 = E. | last4 = Joses | first4 = S. | year = 1998 | title = Is forced dextrality an explanation for the fall in the prevalence of sinistrality with age? A study in northern England | url = | journal = Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | volume = 52 | issue = 1| pages = 41–44 | doi=10.1136/jech.52.1.41| pmid = 9604040 | pmc = 1756611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ambidexterity]] is when a person has approximately equal skill with both [[hand]]s and/or both sides of the body. True ambidexterity is very rare. Although a small number of people can write competently with both hands and use both sides of their body well, even these people usually show preference for one side of their body over the other. However, this preference is not necessarily consistent for all activities. Some people may for example use their right hand for [[writing]], and their [[left-handed|left hand]] for playing [[List of sports#Racket sports|racket sports]] and [[eating]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oldfield | first1 = R.C. | year = 1971 | title = The assessment and analysis of handedness: The Edinburgh inventory | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 97–113 | doi=10.1016/0028-3932(71)90067-4 | pmid=5146491}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''see also:'' [[cross-dominance]]).

Also, it is not uncommon that people preferring to use the right hand prefer to use the left leg, e.g. when using a shovel, kicking a ball, or operating control pedals. In many cases, this may be because they are disposed for left-handedness but have been trained for right-handedness. In the sport of [[cricket]], some players may find that they are more comfortable bowling with their left or right hand, but batting with the other hand.

Approximate statistics are below:&lt;ref&gt;C. Porac and S. Coren. ''Lateral preferences and human behavior''. New York: Springer-Verlag, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Favoring right hand: 88.2%
*Favoring right foot: 81.0%
*Favoring right eye: 71.1%
*Favoring right ear: 59.1%
*Same hand and foot: 84%
*Same ear and eye: 61.8%

Laterality of motor and sensory control has been the subject of a recent intense study and review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mimickingman.com Mimicking Man.com.] I. Derakhshan, MD, Neurologist.&lt;/ref&gt; It turns out that the hemisphere of speech is the hemisphere of action in general and that the command hemisphere is located either in the right or the left hemisphere (never in both). Around eighty percent of people are left hemispheric for speech and the remainder are right hemispheric: ninety percent of right-handers are left hemispheric for speech, but only fifty percent of left-handers are right hemispheric for speech (the remainder are left hemispheric). The reaction time of the neurally dominant side of the body (the side opposite to the major hemisphere or the command center, as just defined) is shorter than that of the opposite side by an interval equal to the interhemispheric transfer time. Thus, one in five persons has a handedness that is the opposite for which they are wired (per laterality of command center or brainedness, as determined by reaction time study mentioned above).

===Different expressions===
* Board [[footedness]]: The stance in a board sport is not necessarily the same as the normal footedness of the person. In skateboarding and other board sports a goofy footed stance is one with the right foot leading.  A stance with the left foot forward is called regular or normal.
* Jump and spin: Direction of rotation in [[figure skating jumps]] and spins is not necessarily the same as the footedness or the handedness of each person. A skater can jump and spin counter-clockwise (the most common direction), yet be left-footed and left-handed.
* [[Ocular dominance]]:  The eye preferred when binocular vision is not possible, as through a keyhole or monocular microscope.

=== Speech ===

Cerebral dominance or specialization has been studied in relation to a variety of human functions. With speech in particular, many studies have been used as evidence that it is generally localized in the [[Cerebral hemisphere|left hemisphere]]. Research comparing the effects of lesions in the two hemispheres, [[split-brain]] patients, and perceptual asymmetries have aided in the knowledge of speech lateralization.  In one particular study, the left hemisphere’s sensitivity to differences in rapidly changing sound cues was noted (Annett, 1991).  This has real world implication, since very fine acoustic discriminations are needed to comprehend and produce speech signals.  In an electrical stimulation demonstration performed by Ojemann and Mateer (1979), the exposed [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] was mapped revealing the same cortical sites were activated in phoneme discrimination and mouth movement sequences (Annett, 1991).

As suggested by Kimura (1975, 1982), left hemisphere speech lateralization might be based upon a preference for movement sequences as demonstrated by [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) studies.  Since ASL requires intricate hand movements for language communication, it was proposed that skilled hand motions and speech require sequences of action over time. In deaf patients suffering from a left hemispheric [[stroke]] and damage, noticeable losses in their abilities to sign were noted.  These cases were compared to studies of normal speakers with dysphasias located at lesioned areas similar to the deaf patients.  In the same study, deaf patients with right hemispheric lesions did not display any significant loss of signing nor any decreased capacity for motor sequencing (Annett, 1991).

One theory, known as the acoustic laterality theory, the physical properties of certain speech sounds are what determine laterality to the left hemisphere.  Stop consonants, for example t, p, or k, leave a defined silent period at the end of words that can easily be distinguished.  This theory postulates that changing sounds such as these are preferentially processed by the left hemisphere.  As a result of the right ear being responsible for transmission to sounds to the left hemisphere, it is capable of perceiving these sounds with rapid changes.  This right ear advantage in hearing and speech laterality was evidenced in [[Dichotic listening test|dichotic listening studies]]. [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic imaging]] results from this study showed greater left hemisphere activation when actual words were presented as opposed to pseudo-words (Shtyrov, Pihko, and Pulvermuller, 2005).  Two important aspects of speech recognition are phonetic cues, such as format patterning, and prosody cues, such as intonation, accent, and emotional state of the speaker (Imaizumi, Koichi, Kiritani, Hosoi &amp; Tonoike, 1998).

In a study done with both [[Monolingualism|monolinguals]] and [[Multilingualism|bilinguals]], which took into account language experience, second language proficiency, and onset of bilingualism among other variables, researchers were able to demonstrate left hemispheric dominance.  In addition, bilinguals that began speaking a second language early in life demonstrated bilateral hemispheric involvement.  The findings of this study were able to predict differing patterns of cerebral language lateralization in adulthood (Hull &amp; Vaid, 2006).

== In other animals ==
It has been shown that cerebral lateralization is a widespread phenomenon in the [[animal|animal kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Lesley J., Andrew, Richard J. (2002) Comparative Vertebrate Lateralization, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;. Functional and structural differences between left and right brain hemispheres can be found in many other vertebrates and also in invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Manns"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Manns, M.  |author2=Ströckens, F.|year=2014|title=Functional and structural comparison of visual lateralization in birds–similar but still different|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=5|pages=206|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00206|pmid=24723898|pmc=3971188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that negative, withdrawal-associated emotions are processed predominantly by the right hemisphere, whereas the left hemisphere is largely responsible for processing positive, approach-related emotions.  This has been called the "laterality-[[Valence (psychology)|valence]] hypothesis".&lt;ref name="Barnard2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barnard, S., Matthews, L., Messori, S., Podaliri-Vulpiani, M. and Ferri, N.|year=2015|title=Laterality as an indicator of emotional stress in ewes and lambs during a separation test|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=19|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1007/s10071-015-0928-3|pmid=26433604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One sub-set of laterality in animals is limb dominance. Preferential limb use for specific tasks has been shown in species including chimpanzees, mice, bats, wallabies, parrots, chickens and toads.&lt;ref name="Manns" /&gt;

Another form of laterality is hemispheric dominance for processing conspecific vocalizations, reported for chimpanzees, sea lions, dogs, zebra finches and Bengalese finches.&lt;ref name="Manns" /&gt;

=== In mammals ===
[[Domestic horse]]s (''Equus ferus caballus'') exhibit laterality in at least two areas of neural organization, i.e. sensory and motor. In [[thoroughbred]]s, the strength of motor laterality increases with age.  Horses under 4 years old have a preference to initially use the right nostril during olfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Motor and sensory laterality in thoroughbred horses|author1=McGreevy, P.  |author2=Rogers, L.|year= 2005|journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science|doi = 10.1016/j.applanim.2004.11.012|issue = 4|volume = 92|pages = 337–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with olfaction, French horses have an eye laterality when looking at novel objects. There is a correlation between their score on an emotional index and eye preference; horses with higher emotionality are more likely to look with their left eye. The less emotive [[French saddlebred]]s glance at novel objects using the right eye, however, this tendency is absent in the [[Trotter (horse)|trotters]], although the emotive index is the same for both breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Laterality of horses associated with emotionality in novel situations|author=Larose, C., Richard-Yris, M.-A., Hausberger, M. and Rogers, L.J.|year=2006|journal = Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition|doi = 10.1080/13576500600624221|pmid = 16754236|issue = 4|pages = 355–367|volume = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racehorse]]s exhibit laterality in stride patterns as well. They use their preferred stride pattern at all times whether racing or not, unless they are forced to change it while turning, injured, or fatigued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Laterality in stride pattern preference in racehorses|author1=Williams, D.E.  |author2=Norris, B.J|year=2007|journal = Animal Behaviour|doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.01.014|pmid = |access-date = |issue = 4|pages = 941–950|volume = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[domestic dogs]] (''Canis familiaris''), there is a correlation between motor laterality and noise sensitivity  - a lack of paw preference is associated with noise-related fearfulness. (Branson and Rogers, 2006){{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Fearfulness is an undesirable trait in guide dogs, therefore, testing for laterality can be a useful predictor of a successful guide dog. Knowing a guide dog's laterality can also be useful for training because the dog may be better at walking to the left or the right of their blind owner.&lt;ref name="Tomkins"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Tomkins, L.M., Thomson, P.C. and McGreevy, P.D.|year=2010|title = First-stepping Test as a measure of motor laterality in dogs (Canis familiaris) | url = | journal = Journal of Veterinary Behavior: Clinical Applications and Research | volume = 5 | issue = 5| pages = 247–255 | doi = 10.1016/j.jveb.2010.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Domestic cat]]s (''Felis silvestris catus'') show an individual handedness when reaching for static food.  In one study, 46% preferred to use the right paw, 44% the left, and 10% were ambi-lateral; 60% used one paw 100% of the time.  There was no difference between male and female cats in the proportions of left and right paw preferences. In moving-target reaching tests, cats have a left-sided behavioural asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Behavioural Processes|volume=39|issue=3|year=1997|pages=241–247|title=Paw preferences in cats (Felis silvestris catus) living in a household environment|doi=10.1016/S0376-6357(96)00758-9|author1=Pike, A.V.L.  |author2=Maitland, D.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study indicates that laterality in this species is strongly related to temperament. Furthermore, individuals with stronger paw preferences are rated as more confident, affectionate, active, and friendly.&lt;ref name="McDowell2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author=McDowell, L.J., Wells, D.L., Hepper, P.G. and Dempster, M.|year=2016|title=Lateral bias and temperament in the domestic cat (Felis Silvestris)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chimpanzee]]s show right-handedness in certain conditions.  This is expressed at the population level for females, but not males.  The complexity of the task has a dominant effect on handedness in chimps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Llorente, M., Riba, D., Palou, L., Carrasco, L., Mosquera, M., Colell, M. and Feliu, O.|year=2011|title=Population‐level right‐handedness for a coordinated bimanual task in naturalistic housed chimpanzees: replication and extension in 114 animals from Zambia and Spain|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=73|issue=3|pages=281–290|doi=10.1002/ajp.20895|pmid=20954250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cattle]] use [[Lateralization of brain function|visual/brain lateralisation]] in their visual scanning of novel and familiar stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Phillips, C.J.C., Oevermans, H., Syrett, K.L., Jespersen, A.Y. and Pearce, G.P. |year=2015 |title=Lateralization of behavior in dairy cows in response to conspecifics and novel persons |journal=Journal of Dairy Science |volume=98 |issue=4 |pages=2389–2400 |doi=10.3168/jds.2014-8648|pmid=25648820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Domestic cattle prefer to view novel stimuli with the left eye, (similar to horses, Australian magpies, chicks, toads and fish) but use the right eye for viewing familiar stimuli.&lt;ref name="Robins"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Robins, A.  |author2=Phillips, C. |year=2010 |title=Lateralised visual processing in domestic cattle herds responding to novel and familiar stimuli |journal=Laterality |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=514–534 |doi=10.1080/13576500903049324|pmid=19629847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Schreibers' long-fingered bat]] is lateralized at the population level and shows a left-hand bias for climbing or grasping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zucca |first1=P. |last2=Palladini |first2=A. |last3=Baciadonna |first3=L. |last4=Scaravelli |first4=D. |year=2010 |title=Handedness in the echolocating Schreiber's long-fingered bat (''Miniopterus schreibersii'') |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=693–695 |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2010.04.006|pmid=20399840 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of [[mastodon]] indicate laterality through the fossil remains having differing tusk lengths.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

====In marsupials====
[[Marsupials]] are fundamentally different from other mammals in that they lack a [[corpus callosum]].&lt;ref name="Nowak1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nowak |first=Ronald M. |title=Walker's Mammals of the World |date=1999 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-5789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, wild [[kangaroo]]s and other [[Macropodidae|macropod]] [[marsupial]]s have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks.  Left-handedness is particularly apparent in the [[red kangaroo]] (''Macropus rufus'') and the [[eastern gray kangaroo]] (''Macropus giganteus'').  The [[red-necked wallaby]] (''Macropus rufogriseus'') preferentially uses the left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength.  There is less evidence for handedness in [[arboreal]] species.&lt;ref name="Sci-News"&gt;{{cite web |title=All kangaroos are lefties, scientists say |publisher=Sci-News.com |url=http://www.sci-news.com/biology/science-kangaroos-lefties-02929.html |date=June 18, 2015 |accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds===
[[Parrot]]s tend to favor one foot when grasping objects (for example fruit when feeding). Some studies indicate that most parrots are left footed.&lt;ref&gt;Zeigler, H. Phillip &amp; Hans-Joachim Bischof, eds. ''Vision, Brain, and Behavior in Birds.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian magpie]] (''Gymnorhina tibicen'') uses both left-eye and right-eye laterality when performing anti-predator responses, which include [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|mobbing]].  Prior to withdrawing from a potential predator, Australian magpies view the animal with the left eye (85%), but prior to approaching, the right eye is used (72%). The left eye is used prior to jumping (73%) and prior to circling (65%) the predator, as well as during circling (58%) and for high alert inspection of the predator (72%). The researchers commented that "mobbing and perhaps circling are agonistic responses controlled by the LE[left eye]/right hemisphere, as also seen in other species. Alert inspection involves detailed examination of the predator and likely high levels of fear, known to be right hemisphere function."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Koboroff, A., Kaplan, G. and Rogers, L.J.|year=2008|title=Hemispheric specialization in Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) shown as eye preferences during response to a predator|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|volume=76|issue=3|pages=304–306|doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2008.02.015|pmid=18498946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yellow-legged gull]] (''Larus michahellis'') chicks show laterality when reverting from a supine to prone posture, and also in pecking at a dummy parental bill to beg for food. Lateralization occurs at both the population and individual level in the reverting response and at the individual level in begging. Females have a leftward preference in the righting response, indicating this is sex dependent. Laterality in the begging response in chicks varies according to laying order and matches variation in egg [[androgen]]s concentration.

===In fish===
Laterality determines the organisation of rainbowfish (''Melanotaenia'' spp.) schools.  These fish demonstrate an individual eye preference when examining their reflection in a mirror.  Fish which show a right-eye preference in the mirror test prefer to be on the left side of the school. Conversely, fish that show a left-eye preference in the mirror test or were non-lateralised, prefer to be slightly to the right side of the school. The behaviour depends on the species and sex of the school.&lt;ref name="Bibost"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bibost, A-L.  |author2=Brown, C.|year=2013|title=Laterality enhances schooling position in rainbowfish, Melaotaenia spp|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=11|pages=e80907|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0080907|pmid=24260506|pmc=3829960|bibcode=2013PLoSO...880907B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In amphibians===
Three species of toads, the [[common toad]] (''Bufo bufo''), [[Bufo viridis|green toad]] (''Bufo viridis'') and the [[cane toad]] (''Bufo marinus'') show stronger escape and defensive responses when a model predator was placed on the toad's left side compared to their right side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lippolis, G., Bisazza, A., Rogers, L.

===In invertebrates===
The [[Mediterranean fruit fly]] (''Ceratitis capitata'') exhibits left-biased population-level lateralisation of aggressive displays (boxing with forelegs and wing strikes) with no sex-differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Benelli, G., Donati, E., Romano, D., Stefanini, C., Messing, R.

One possible reason for this is that its environment is partly maze-like and consistently turning in one direction is a good way to search and exit mazes without getting lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hunt ER, etal | year=2014 |title=Ants show a leftward turning bias when exploring unknown nest sites|journal=[[Biology Letters]] |volume=10 |issue=12 |pmid=25540159 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2014.0945 |pmc=4298197 |page=20140945}}&lt;/ref&gt; This turning bias is correlated with slight asymmetries in the ants' compound eyes (differential ommatidia count).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hunt ER, etal | year=2018 |title=Asymmetric ommatidia count and behavioural lateralization in the ant ''Temnothorax albipennis''|journal=[[Scientific Reports]] |volume=8 |issue=5825 | pages=5825 |doi=10.1038/s41598-018-23652-4| pmid=29643429 | pmc=5895843 | bibcode=2018NatSR...8.5825H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''''Man after Man: An Anthropology of the Future''''' is a 1990 [[speculative evolution]] book written by Scottish geologist [[Dougal Dixon]] and illustrated by Philip Hood. The book also features a foreword by [[Brian Aldiss]]. ''Man After Man'' explores a hypothetical future path of [[human evolution]] set from 200 years in the future to 5 million years in the future, with several future human species [[Evolution|evolving]] through [[genetic engineering]] and natural means through the course of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Man After Man|last=Dixon|first=Dougal|publisher=Blandford Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0713720716|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Man after Man'' is Dixon's third work on speculative evolution, following ''[[After Man]]'' (1981), which explored the animals of a hypothetical world 50 million years in the future where humanity had gone extinct, and ''[[The New Dinosaurs]]'' (1988), which explored the animals of a world where the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event]] never occurred. Unlike the previous two books, which were written much like [[Field guide|field guides]] and explored factual natural processes through fictional examples and worlds, the focus of ''Man after Man'' lies much on the individual perspectives of future human individuals of various species, mainly focused on how they perceive the changing climate, which they are specifically engineered to be adapted to, around themselves.

==Plot summary==
200 years hence (the year 2190 A.D.) [[climate change]] has changed the face of the planet. With rising sea levels swallowing coastal cities and the environmental impact of overpopulation becoming apparent in a lack of resources, [[Societal collapse|civilization is slowly collapsing]], with a few selected humans escaping [[Earth]] to [[Space colonization|colonize space]]. To effectively construct great starships, governments have engineered new human species to aid in gathering resources underwater - the aquamorph (''Homo aquaticus''), with [[Gill|gills]] instead of lungs - and species to aid in construction in the [[vacuum]] of space - the vacuumorph (''Homo caelestis''). 

300 years hence, the [[anatomically modern humans]] that stayed behind on Earth have split into The Hitek (''Homo sapiens machinadiumentum''), almost totally dependent on [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] technology, [[Human enhancement|augmenting]] and keeping their bodies alive way past their natural lifespans, and their handlers (still ''Homo sapiens sapiens''). Though the older genetically engineered species in space and underwater have become extinct as a result of fulfilling their purpose and being sterile, a new species of fertile underwater human, the Aquatics (''Piscanthropus submarinus'') are created as a final project by the genetic engineering facilities before they are shut down.

500 years hence, the Hitek pursue to construct genetically altered humans to sustainably occupy niches in the ecologically recovering world. These new species include the [[Plain|plains]]-dweller (''Homo campis fabricatus'') designed to live on open grasslands with the adaptations of a large herbivorous mammal, the [[forest]]-dweller (''Homo silvis fabricatus'') created to live in [[rainforests]], the [[tundra]]-dweller (''Homo glacis fabricatus'') adapted to a [[polar climate]] and the [[Temperate Woodland|temperate woodland]]-dweller (''Homo virgultis fabricatus''), superficially similar to the ancient [[Australopithecine|australopithecines]]. Genetic material used to make these species is derived from the Andlas, anatomically modern humans who mostly live as farmers and fishermen (the word "Andlas" being speech corruption of "Handlers"). 

1000 years hence, some Hitek choose to abandon their "mechanical cradles" in favor of artificially created organs and "biological cradles", becoming a new species known as the Tics (''Homo sapiens accessiomembrum''). Both the Hitek and the Tics artificially manufacture food products to sustain themselves, relying on [[Solar energy|solar]] and [[marine energy]] harvesting to fuel their processing facilities. A [[magnetic reversal]] results in the failure of the navigation, communication and energy harvesting technologies that the Hitek and Tics rely on, causing their extinction. The magnetic reversal also impacts the farming, animal husbandry and hunting of the Andlas, leading to their (and by extension ''Homo sapiens'' as a whole) extinction. The disaster leaves the genetically engineered animal-like species as the sole living human descendants.

As a result of the extinction of ''Homo sapiens'', these humans can no longer be genetically tweaked and altered in labs and instead they begin to evolve through [[natural selection]] and other natural evolutionary processes, resulting in many new and diverse forms over the course of several millions of years. These new species range from the memory people (''Homo mensproavadorum'') that through their genes can [[Genetic memory (psychology)|recall memories of previous generations]], [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] humans (symbionts) consisting of a symbiont carrier (''Baiulus moderatorum'') providing movement and protection against the cold and a hunter symbiont (''Moderator baiuli''), colonial and [[Beehive|hive]]-building humans with a single reproductive parent (socials, ''Alvearanthropus desertus''), [[Parasitism|parasitic]] humans (''Nananthropus parasitus'') attaching themselves with sharp teeth and claws to the flesh of their [[Host (biology)|hosts]] (''Penarius pinguis''), [[goblin]]-like fishing humans (fish-eaters, ''Piscator longidigitus''), [[ant]]-eating humans (ant-men, ''Formifossor angustus'') and saber-toothed predatory humans (spiketooths, ''Acudens ferox''). 

After five million years of uninterrupted evolution, the spacefaring descendants of those humans that escaped into space return to the planet. No longer recognizing the planet as their home world and bearing little resemblance to their original ancestors after five millions of years of genetic engineering, the spacefarers dramatically [[Xenoforming|xenoform]] Earth and cover it in vast domed alien cities. The spacefarers wear pressurized suits and use [[Cyborg|cyborg-technology]] to fuse the bodies of the few human species they find useful on the planet with air tanks and respiration systems. Genetic engineering is used to modify the human descendants on Earth into giant building humans ("engineered pack-animals") and tiny humans working intricate machinery to aid in city construction and maintenance. Genetically modified species are also created for other purposes, such as [[antelope]]-like humans that serve as mounts and grotesque massive humans whose flesh is processed and consumed as food. As with the civilization of modern man and the Hitek before, this new era of civilization eventually falls apart, the spacefarers leaving Earth in ruins after consuming all the resources the planet had to offer. All terrestrial life on the planet perishes as the atmosphere is almost emptied of oxygen, leaving most of the human descendants extinct. Only a [[deep sea]] descendant of the aquatics, ''Piscanthropus profundus'', survives the [[extinction event]] and continues to evolve, expressing curiosity in what lies above the water.

== Development ==
Dixon's previous [[speculative evolution]] book projects, ''[[After Man]]'' (1981) and ''[[The New Dinosaurs]]'' (1988), used fictional examples to examplify real-life factual natural processes. ''After Man'' focused on the processes within evolution and projected them into a hypothetical future scenario set 50 million years after the extinction of mankind, where various hypothetical future animal species were used to explain the concepts within evolution. ''The New Dinosaurs'', meanwhile, had a focus on the science of [[zoogeography]], using fictional species in a world where the [[Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event]] never happened to explain the process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite interview|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/of-after-man-the-new-dinosaurs-and-greenworld-an-interview-with-dougal-dixon/|title=Of After Man, The New Dinosaurs and Greenworld: an interview with Dougal Dixon|last=Naish|first=Darren|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, ''Man After Man'' was intended to be a project where fictional examples would be used to explain factual processes, like the previous books. The original idea involved mankind avoiding catastrophes such as [[overpopulation]] and [[Mass Starvation|mass starvation]] by inventing [[time travel]] and moving 50 million years into the future to re-establish civilization. This original ''Man After Man'' would have been set in the same world as ''After Man'' and would have focused on man-made catastrophes destroying the ecosystem established in the previous book. Dixon was reluctant to be involved in the final version of the project, which instead focused on changing climate conditions through the eyes of future human species engineered to adapt to them,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview|url=http://www.ough.gr/index.php?mod=articles&amp;op=view&amp;id=562&amp;lang=en|title=An interview with Dougal Dixon - OUGH.gr|website=OUGH.gr|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has in subsequent interviews referred to it as a "disaster of a project".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The original ''Man After Man'' concept, mankind destroying an established ecosystem, was later used by Dixon for another project where mankind colonized an alien planet with a complex and unique ecosystem. This project, published as the book ''Greenworld'' in 2010 (though so far only released in [[Japan]]) follows human colonization of the planet Greenworld over the course of a thousand years, showing how mankind affects its ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1747">'''Megagametogenesis''' is the development of a [[megaspore]] into an embryo sac, which is the [[gametophyte]] - though a highly reduced one - stage in the life cycle of vascular plants. 

==Eudicots==

In [[eudicot]] plants, the entire process happens inside the [[ovule]] of a plant. The details of the process vary by species, but the process described here is common. This process starts with a single [[diploid]] megasporocyte in the nucleus. This megasporocyte undergoes [[meiotic]] cell division to form four cells that are [[haploid]]. Three cells die and one that is most distant from the micropyle develops into the megaspore. This megaspore becomes larger and the nucleus of it undergoes [[mitosis]] three times until there are eight nuclei. These eight nuclei are then arranged into two groups of four. These groups both send a nucleus to the center of the cell which then becomes the polar nuclei. The three cells left at the end of the cell near the micropylar become the egg apparatus with an egg cell in the center and two synergids. A cell wall forms around the other set of nuclei and forms the antipodals. The cells in the center develop into the central cell. This entire structure with its eight nuclei is called the embryo sac.

==Homochirality==
Many of the essential molecules for life on Earth can exist in two mirror-image forms, referred to as "left-handed" and "right-handed", but living organisms do not use both. [[Protein]]s are exclusively composed of left-handed [[amino acids]]; [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] contain only right-handed [[sugar]]s. This phenomenon is known as [[homochirality]].&lt;ref name=Plaxco&gt;{{cite book |last1=Plaxco |first1= Kevin W. |last2=Michael |first2=Michael |title= Astrobiology: A Brief Introduction |date=2011 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn= 978-1-4214-0194-2 |pages=140-141}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether homochirality emerged before or after life, whether the building blocks of life must have this particular chirality, or indeed whether life needs to be homochiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sedbrook |first1= Danielle |title=Must the Molecules of Life Always be Left-Handed or Right-Handed? |url= https://www.smithsonianmag.com/space/must-all-molecules-life-be-left-handed-or-right-handed-180959956/ |accessdate=8 May 2018 |work= Smithsonian.com |date=28 July 2016 |language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protein chains built from amino acids of mixed chirality tend not to fold or function as catalysts, but mirror-image proteins have been constructed that work the same but on substrates of opposite handedness.&lt;ref name=Plaxco/&gt;

==The concept==
It is thought that such mirror organisms can be highly incompatible with existing microbes (viruses, bacteria, protozoa, etc.). Hypothetically, it is possible to recreate an entire ecosystem from the bottom up, in chiral form. In this way, the creation of an Earth ecosystem without microbial diseases might be possible. In some distant future, mirror life could be employed to create robust, effective and disease-free ecosystems for use on other planets.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{Cite journal |url= https://www.wired.com/2010/11/ff_mirrorlife/ |last=Bohannon |first=John |title=Mirror-image cells could transform science - or kill us all |issue=12 |journal=Wired |volume=18 |date=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in [[synthetic biology]], like [[synthetic virology|synthesizing viruses]] since 2002, [[Mycoplasma laboratorium |partially synthetic bacteria]] in 2010, or [[synthetic ribosome]]s in 2013, may lead to the possibility of fully synthesizing a living cell from small molecules, where we could use mirror-image versions ([[enantiomer]]s) of life's building-block molecules, in place of the standard ones. Some proteins have been synthesized in mirror-image versions, including [[polymerase]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=nat1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1= Zimou |last2=Xu |first2=Weiliang |last3=Liu |first3=Lei |last4=Zhu |first4=Ting F. |title= A synthetic molecular system capable of mirror-image genetic replication and transcription |journal=Nature Chemistry |volume= 8 |issue=7 |year=2016 |pages=698–704 |issn=1755-4330 |doi= 10.1038/nchem.2517 |pmid= 27325097 |bibcode= 2016NatCh...8..698W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reconstructing regular lifeforms in mirror-image form, using the mirror-image (chiral) reflection of their cellular components, could be achieved by substituting left-handed amino acids with right-handed ones, in order to create mirror reflections of all regular proteins. Analogously, we could get reflected sugars, DNA, etc., on which reflected enzymes would work perfectly. Finally we would get a normally functioning mirror reflection of a natural organism - a chiral counterpart organism - with which natural viruses and bacteria couldn't interact. Electromagnetic force (chemistry) is unchanged under such molecular reflection transformation ([[parity (physics)|P-symmetry]]). There is a small alteration of weak interactions under reflection, which can produce very small corrections, but these corrections are many orders of magnitude lower than thermal noise - almost certainly too tiny to alter any biochemistry.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} However, there are also theories that weak interactions can have a greater effect on longer nucleic acids or protein chains, resulting in much less efficient conversion of mirror ribozymes or enzymes than normal ribozymes or enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pitkänen |first1=M. |title=Could the replication of mirror DNA teach something about chiral … |url=http://tgdtheory.fi/public_html/articles/mirrordna.pdf |website=Topological Geometrodynamics |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiral animals would need to feed on reflected food, produced by reflected plants. The great advantage, though, is that such chiral organisms should enjoy a disease-free life, completely immune to all viruses and microbes (which virologists are now beginning to understand underlie a huge number of diseases).

Viruses would be completely incompatible with the reflected cellular structures; and bacteria, protozoa, and fungi could not function because they would not be able to find normal sugars inside reflected organisms. The reverse sugars circulating in the chiral organism's body would be indigestible as far as normal bacteria are concerned, so any bacterium entering a chiral organism would simply starve to death. The chiral environment is hostile for normal viruses, protozoa, bacteria, etc.

Mirror life presents potential dangers. For example, a chiral-mirror version of [[cyanobacteria]], which only needs achiral nutrients and light for [[photosynthesis]], could take over Earth's ecosystem due to lack of natural enemies, disturbing the bottom of the food chain by producing mirror versions of the required sugars. Some bacteria can digest [[L-Glucose|L-glucose]]; exceptions like this would give some rare lifeforms an unanticipated advantage.

==Direct applications==
Direct application of mirror-chiral organisms can be mass production of [[enantiomer]]s (mirror-image) of molecules produced by normal life.

*[[Enantiopure drug]]s - some pharmaceuticals have known different activity depending on enantiomeric form,
*[[Aptamer]]s ([[L-Ribonucleic acid aptamer|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-ribonucleic acid aptamers]]): "That makes mirror-image biochemistry a potentially lucrative business. One company that hopes so is [[Noxxon Pharma]] in Berlin. It uses laborious chemical synthesis to make mirror-image forms of short strands of DNA or RNA called aptamers, which bind to therapeutic targets such as proteins in the body to block their activity. The firm has several mirror-aptamer candidates in human trials for diseases including cancer; the idea is that their efficacy might be improved because they aren't degraded by the body's enzymes. A process to replicate mirror-image DNA could offer a much easier route to making the aptamers, says Sven Klussmann, Noxxon Pharma's chief scientific officer."&lt;ref name=polym&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Peplow |first1=Mark |title=Mirror-image enzyme copies looking-glass DNA |journal=Nature |date=16 May 2016 |volume=533 |issue=7603 |pages=303–304 |doi= 10.1038/nature.2016.19918 |pmid=27193657 |bibcode= 2016Natur.533..303P}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[L-Glucose]], enantiomer of standard [[glucose]], for which tests showed that it tastes likes standard sugar, but not being metabolized the same way. However, it was never marketed due to excessive manufacturing costs.&lt;ref name=diab&gt;[https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2004/ch_4.html ''A natural way to stay sweet''], NASA&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research allows cheap production with high yields, however the authors state that it is not usable as a sweetener due to laxative effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Martinez |first1=RF |title= Short and sweet: (D)-glucose to (L)-glucose and (L)-glucuronic acid |journal= Angewandte Communications|date= 5 December 2013 |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages= 1160-2 |doi= 10.1002/anie.201309073 |id= Epub 2013 Dec 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

The creation of one chiral human is the basis of 1950 Arthur C. Clarke's story "[[Technical Error]]", from The Collected Stories. In this story, a physical accident transforms a person into his mirror image, speculatively explained by travel through a fourth physical dimension.

An alien machine that reverses chirality, and a blood-symbiote that functions properly only when in one chirality, were central to Roger Zelazny's 1976 novel [[Doorways in the Sand]].

In the 2017 [[Daniel Suarez (author)|Daniel Suarez]] novel "Change Agent", an antagonist, Otto, nicknamed the "Mirror Man", is revealed to be a genetically-engineered enantiomeric human. He views other humans with disdain and causes them to feel an inexplicable repulsion by his very presence.

A '''near-death experience''' ('''NDE''') is a [[personal experience]] associated with death or impending [[death]]. When positive, such experiences may encompass a variety of sensations including detachment from the body, feelings of levitation, total serenity, security, warmth, the experience of absolute dissolution, and the presence of a light. When negative, such experiences may include sensations of torment and torture. &lt;ref name=Sleutjes2014rev&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25357254 | doi=10.1097/NMD.0000000000000205 | volume=202 | issue=11 | title=Almost 40 years investigating near-death experiences: an overview of mainstream scientific journals | year=2014 | journal=J.

Different models have been described to explain NDEs.&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt; [[Neuroscience]] research suggests that an NDE is a [[wikt:subjective#Adjective|subjective]] phenomenon resulting from "disturbed bodily multisensory integration" that occurs during life-threatening events.&lt;ref name=blanke2009&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Neurology of Consciousness|last=Blanke|first=Olaf|publisher=London: Academic Publishers, 2009|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-374168-4|location=London|pages=303–324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 013.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Ascent of the Blessed]]'' by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] is associated by some NDE researchers with aspects of the NDE.&lt;ref name="Lommel2010"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pim van Lommel |title=Consciousness Beyond Life: The science of the near-death experience |publisher=HarperOne |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-06-177725-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Evelyn Elsaesser Valarino |title=On the Other Side of Life: Exploring the phenomenon of the near-death experience |year=1997 |publisher=Perseus Publishing |isbn=978-0-7382-0625-7 |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The equivalent [[french language|French]] term ''expérience de mort imminente'' (experience of imminent death) was proposed by the French [[psychologist]] and [[epistemology|epistemologist]] [[Victor Egger]] as a result of discussions in the 1890s among [[philosopher]]s and psychologists concerning [[Climbing|climbers']] stories of the panoramic life review during falls.&lt;ref&gt;Egger, Victor (1896). "Le moi des mourants", ''Revue Philosophique'', XLI : 26–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Neurological Disorders in Famous Artists, Part 3 |author=J. Bogousslavsky, M. G. Hennerici, H Bazner, C. Bassetti (Eds.) |publisher=Karger Publishers |year=2010 |page=189 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTmyjVWIrTYC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189#v=onepage|isbn=9783805593304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1892 a series of subjective observations by workers falling from scaffolds, war soldiers who suffered injuries, climbers who had fallen from heights or other individuals who had come close to death (near drownings, accidents) was reported by [[Albert Heim]]. This was also the first time the phenomenon was described as clinical syndrome.&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt; In 1968 [[Celia Green]] published an analysis of 400 first-hand accounts of [[out-of-body experiences]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., ''Out-of-the-body Experiences'', London: Hamish Hamilton, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; This represented the first attempt to provide a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of such experiences, viewed simply as anomalous perceptual experiences, or [[hallucinations]]. In 1969, Swiss-American [[psychiatrist]] and pioneer in near-death studies [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross|Elisabeth Kubler-Ross]] published her groundbreaking book ''[[On Death and Dying|On Death and Dying: What the dying have to teach doctors, nurses, clergy, and their own families.]]'' These experiences were also popularized by the work of [[psychiatrist]] [[Raymond Moody]], who in 1975 coined the term "near-death experience" (NDE) as an umbrella term for the different elements (out of body experiences, the "panoramic life review," the Light, the tunnel, or the border). &lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt; The term "near-death experience" had already been used by [[John C. Lilly]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Schlieter, Jens (2018). What is it like to be Dead? Near-death Experiences, Christianity, and the Occult. New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 205-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Common elements===
[[Research]]ers have identified the common elements that define near-death experiences.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop&gt;Mauro, James. "Bright lights, big mystery", ''Psychology Today'', July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Greyson]] argues that the general features of the experience include impressions of being outside one's physical body, visions of deceased relatives and religious figures, and transcendence of egotic and spatiotemporal boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Greyson, Bruce (2003) "Near-Death Experiences in a Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic Population". Psychiatric Services, December, Vol. 54 No. 12. The American Psychiatric Association&lt;/ref&gt; Many common elements have been reported, although the person's interpretation of these events often corresponds with the [[Culture|cultural]], [[philosophy|philosophical]], or [[religion|religious]] beliefs of the person experiencing it. For example, in the US, where 46% of the population believes in [[guardian angel]]s, they will often be identified as angels or deceased loved ones (or will be unidentified), while Hindus will often identify them as messengers of the god of death.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennard, Mary J 1998"&gt;Kennard, Mary J. "A Visit from an Angel." The American Journal of Nursing 98.3 (1998): 48–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Common traits that have been reported by NDErs are as follows:
* A sense/awareness of being dead.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;
* A sense of [[peace]], [[well-being]] and painlessness. Positive [[emotion]]s. A sense of removal from the world.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;
* An [[out-of-body experience]]. A perception of one's body from an outside position, sometimes observing medical professionals performing resuscitation efforts.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 4003364 | volume=139 | issue=6 | title=Near-death experiences in a pediatric population.

* A "tunnel experience" or entering a darkness. A sense of moving up, or through, a passageway or staircase.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985"/&gt;
* A rapid movement toward and/or sudden immersion in a powerful light (or "Being of Light") which communicates with the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iands.org/ndes/nde-stories/iands-nde-accounts/1067-three-beings-of-light.html|title=Three Beings of Light|last=Lovins|first=LaDonna|website=iands.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An intense feeling of [[unconditional love]] and [[acceptance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/06/29/people-who-had-near-death-experiences-consistently-report-one-thing-gods-love/|title=Opinion {{!}} Stories of God's love common among those who almost die, says doctor who studies them|last=Long|first=Dr Jeffrey|date=2016-06-29|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encountering "Beings of Light", "Beings dressed in white", or similar. Also, the possibility of being reunited with deceased loved ones.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985"/&gt;
* Receiving a [[life review]], commonly referred to as "seeing one's life flash before one's eyes".&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;
* Approaching a border or a decision by oneself or others to return to one's body, often accompanied by a reluctance to return.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985"/&gt;
* Suddenly finding oneself back inside one's body.&lt;ref name= "Moody1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moody|first=Raymond|title=Life After Life|year=1975|isbn=978-0-89176-037-5|publisher=Mockingbird Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Connection to the cultural beliefs held by the individual, which seem to dictate some of the phenomena experienced in the NDE and particularly the later interpretation thereof.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Holden|editor1-first=Janice Miner|editor2-last=Greyson|editor2-first=Bruce|editor3-last=James|editor3-first=Debbie|title=The handbook of near-death experiences thirty years of investigation|date=2009|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-35865-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2017}}

===Stages===
[[Kenneth Ring]] (1980) subdivided the NDE on a five-stage [[continuum (theory)|continuum]]. The subdivisions were:&lt;ref&gt;Ring, K. (1980). Life at death: A scientific investigation of the near-death experience. New York: Coward, McCann, &amp; Geoghegan., p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;
# Peace
# Body separation
# Entering darkness
# Seeing the light
# Entering the light

Charlotte Martial, a neuropsychologist from the [[University of Liège|University of Liège and University Hospital of Liège]] who led a team that investigated 154 NDE cases, concluded that there is not a fixed sequence of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/near-death-experiences-what-happens-when-you-die-643032|title=What happens when you die? Scientists attempt to find out how similar near-death experiences really are|date=2017-07-27|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical circumstances===
Kenneth Ring argues that attempted suicides do not lead more often to unpleasant NDEs than unintended near-death situations.&lt;ref&gt;Ring, Kenneth. ''Heading toward Omega. In search of the Meaning of Near-Death Experience'', 1984, p. 45. "Subsequent research on suicide-related NDEs by Stephen Franklin and myself [Ring] and by Bruce Greyson has also confirmed my earlier tentative findings the NDEs following suicide attempts, however induced, conform to the classic prototype."&lt;/ref&gt;

===After-effects===
NDEs are associated with changes in personality and outlook on life.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt; Ring has identified a consistent set of value and belief changes associated with people who have had a near-death experience. Among these changes, he found a greater appreciation for life, higher self-esteem, greater compassion for others, less concern for acquiring material wealth, a heightened sense of purpose and self-understanding, desire to learn, elevated spirituality, greater ecological sensitivity and planetary concern, and a feeling of being more intuitive.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt; However, not all after-effects are beneficial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 7754094 | volume=18 | issue=3 | title=The meaning of survival: the early aftermath of a near-death experience | date=June 1995 | journal=Res Nurs Health | pages=239–47 | last1 = Orne | first1 = RM | doi=10.1002/nur.4770180307}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Greyson describes circumstances where changes in attitudes and behavior can lead to psychosocial and psychospiritual problems.&lt;ref name=Greyson1997&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9171810 | volume=185 | issue=5 | title=The near-death experience as a focus of clinical attention | date=May 1997 | journal=J.

== Historical reports, incidence and prevalence ==

NDEs have been recorded since ancient times.&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Handbook_of_Near_Death_Experiences.html?id=9MdUPgAACAAJ|title=The Handbook of Near-Death Experiences: Thirty Years of Investigation|date=Jun 22, 2009|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-35864-7|editor-last=Holden|editor-first=Janice Miner|pages=1–16|chapter=The Field of Near-Death Studies: Past, Present and Future|editor2-last=Greyson|editor2-first=Bruce|editor3-last=James|editor3-first=Debbie|chapterurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known medical report of near-death experiences was written by Pierre-Jean du Monchaux, an 18th century French military doctor who described such a case in his book "Anecdotes de Médecine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/46993-oldest-medical-report-of-near-death-experience.html|title=Oldest Medical Report of Near-Death Experience Discovered|date=July 24, 2014|first=Bahar|last=Gholipour|work=Live Science|accessdate=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century a few studies moved beyond individual cases - one privately done by the Mormons and one in Switzerland. Up to 2005, 95% of world cultures are known to have made some mention of NDEs.&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt;

A number of more contemporary sources report incidences of near death experiences of:

==Research==
===Near-death studies===
{{Main|Near-death studies}}
[[Bruce Greyson]] ([[psychiatrist]]), [[Kenneth Ring]] ([[psychologist]]), and [[Michael Sabom]] ([[cardiologist]]), helped to launch the field of [[near-death studies]] and introduced the study of near-death experiences to the academic setting. From 1975 to 2005, some 2,500 self-reported individuals in the US had been reviewed in retrospective studies of the phenomena&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt; with an additional 600 outside the US in the West,&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt; and 70 in Asia.&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt; Additionally, prospective studies had identified 270 individuals. Prospective studies review groups of individuals (e.g., selected emergency room patients) and then find who had an NDE during the study's time; such studies cost more to perform.&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt; In all, close to 3,500 individual cases between 1975 and 2005 had been reviewed in one or another study. All these studies were carried out by some 55 researchers or teams of researchers.&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt;

[[Melvin L. Morse|Melvin Morse]], head of the Institute for the Scientific Study of Consciousness, and colleagues&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morse M, Castillo P, Venecia D, Milstein J, Tyler DC. (1986) "Childhood near-death experiences". ''American Journal of Diseases of Children'', Nov;140(11):1110–4.&lt;/ref&gt; have investigated near-death experiences in a pediatric population.

=== Clinical research in cardiac arrest patients ===
==== Parnia 2001 study ====
In 2001, [[Sam Parnia]] and colleagues published the results of a year-long study of cardiac arrest survivors that was conducted at Southampton General Hospital. 63 survivors were interviewed. They had been resuscitated after being [[clinical death|clinically dead]] with no pulse, no respiration, and fixed dilated pupils. Parnia and colleagues investigated [[out-of-body experience]] claims by placing figures on suspended boards facing the ceiling, not visible from the floor.  Four had experiences that, according to the study criteria, were NDEs but none of them experienced the [[out-of-body experience]]. Thus, they were not able to identify the figures.&lt;ref name=Parnia2001primary&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parnia|first=S.|last2=Waller|first2=D.

Psychologist [[Chris French]] wrote regarding the study "unfortunately, and somewhat atypically, none of the survivors in this sample experienced an OBE".&lt;ref name=French2005rev/&gt;

==== Van Lommel's study ====
[[File:Pim van Lommel-1.jpg|250x250px|thumb|[[Pim van Lommel]]]]
In 2001 [[Pim van Lommel]], a cardiologist from the Netherlands, and his team conducted a study on NDEs including 344 cardiac arrest patients who had been successfully resuscitated in 10 Dutch hospitals. Patients not reporting NDEs were used as controls for patients who did, and psychological (e.g. fear before cardiac arrest), demographic (e.g. age, sex), medical (e.g. more than one [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR)) and pharmacological data were compared between the 2 groups. The work also included a longitudinal study where the 2 groups (those who had had an NDE and those who had not had one) were compared at 2 and 8 years, for life changes. One patient had a conventional out of body experience. He reported being able to watch and recall events during the time of his cardiac arrest. His claims were confirmed by hospital personnel. "This did not appear consistent with hallucinatory or illusory experiences, as the recollections were compatible with real and verifiable rather than imagined events".&lt;ref name=Parnia2014rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lommel2001primary&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Lommel|first1=P|last2=van Wees| first2=R|last3=Meyers|first3=V|last4=Elfferich|first4=I|title=Near-death experience in survivors of cardiac arrest: a prospective study in the Netherlands| journal=Lancet |date=15 December 2001 |volume=358 |issue=9298 |pages=2039–45|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)07100-8|pmid=11755611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Awareness during Resuscitation (AWARE) study ====
While at University of Southampton, Parnia was the principal investigator of the AWARE Study, which was launched in 2008.&lt;sup&gt;[[Sam Parnia#cite note-TIME magazine 2008-13|[13]]]&lt;/sup&gt; This study which concluded in 2012 included 33 investigators across 15 medical centers in the UK, Austria and the US and tested consciousness, memories and awareness during cardiac arrest. The accuracy of claims of visual and auditory awareness was examined using specific tests.&lt;ref name=Parnia2015primary&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parnia|first=Sam|last2=Spearpoint|first2=Ken|last3=de Vos|first3=Gabriele |last4=Fenwick |first4=Peter |last5=Goldberg |first5=Diana|last6=Yang|first6=Jie|last7=Zhu|first7=Jiawen|last8=Baker|first8=Katie|last9=Killingback|first9=Hayley|date=2014-12-01 |title=AWARE-AWAreness during REsuscitation-a prospective study |journal=Resuscitation|volume=85|issue=12|pages=1799–1805 |doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2014.09.004 |pmid=25301715}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such test consisted in installing shelves, bearing a variety of images and facing the ceiling, hence not visible by hospital staff, in rooms where cardiac-arrest patients were more likely to occur. The results of the study were published in October 2014; both the launch and the study results were widely discussed in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/04/the-science-of-near-death-experiences/386231/ |title=The science of near-death experiences: Empirically investigating brushes with the afterlife|last=Lichfield|first=Gideon|date=April 2015|website=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic|access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201409/seeing-the-light|title=Seeing the light |last=Weintraub |first=Pamela |date=September 2014 |website=Psychology Today|publisher=Psychology Today|access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review article analyzing the results reports that, out of 2060 cardiac arrest events, 101 of 140 cardiac arrest survivors could complete the questionnaires. Of these 101 patients 9% could be classified as near death experiences. 2 more patients (2% of those completing the questionnaires) described "seeing and hearing actual events related to the period of cardiac arrest". These two patients' cardiac arrests did not occur in areas equipped with ceiling shelves hence no images could be used to objectively test for visual awareness claims. One of the two patients was too sick and the accuracy of her recount could not be verified. For the second patient instead, it was possible to verify the accuracy of the experience and to show that awareness occurred paradoxically some minutes after the heart stopped, at a time when "the brain ordinarily stops functioning and cortical activity becomes isoelectric." The experience was not compatible with an illusion, imaginary event or hallucination since visual (other than of ceiling shelves' images) and auditory awareness could be corroborated.&lt;ref name=Parnia2014rev/&gt;

==== AWARE II ====
{{as of|2016|May}}, a posting at the UK Clinical Trials Gateway website described plans for [[Out-of-body experience#AWARE Study II|AWARE II]], a two-year multicenter observational study of 900-1500 patients experiencing cardiac arrest, which said that subject recruitment had started on 1 August 2014 and that the scheduled end date was 31 May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;UK Clinical Trials Gateway. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160509201054/https://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/trials/trial-details/trial-details?trialId=31651 Primary Trial ID Number 17129], entitled "AWARE II (AWAreness during REsuscitation) A Multi-Centre Observational Study of the Relationship between the Quality of Brain Resuscitation and Consciousness, Neurological, Functional and Cognitive Outcomes following Cardiac Arrest" Last updated May 3, 2016.

== Explanatory models ==
In a review article, psychologist [[Chris French]]&lt;ref name="French2005rev"/&gt; has grouped approaches to explain NDEs in three broad groups which "are not distinct and independent, but instead show considerable overlap": spiritual theories (also called transcendental), psychological theories, and physiological theories that provide a physical explanation for NDEs.

=== Spiritual or transcendental theories ===
French summarizes this model by saying : "the most popular interpretation is that the NDE is exactly what it appears to be to the person having the experience".&lt;ref name="French2005rev"/&gt; The NDE would then represent evidence of the supposedly immaterial existence of a soul or mind, which would leave the body upon death. An NDE would then provide information about an immaterial world where the soul would journey upon ending its physical existence on earth.&lt;ref name="French2005rev"/&gt;

According to Greyson&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt; some NDE phenomena cannot be easily explained with our current knowledge of human physiology and psychology. For instance, at a time when they were unconscious patients could accurately describe events as well as report being able to view their bodies "from an out-of-body spatial perspective". In two different studies of patients who had survived a cardiac arrest, those who had reported leaving their bodies could describe accurately their resuscitation procedures or unexpected events, whereas others "described incorrect equipment and procedures".&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt; Sam Parnia also refers to two cardiac arrest studies and one deep hypothermic circulatory arrest study where patients reported visual and/or auditory awareness occurring when their brain function had ceased. These reports "were corroborated with actual and real events".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parnia|first=Sam|date=February 2017|title=Understanding the cognitive experience of death and the near-death experience|url=https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/article-abstract/110/2/67/2681812?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=QJM: An International Journal of Medicine|volume=110(2)|pages=67–69|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parnia2014rev" /&gt;

Five prospective studies have been carried out, to test the accuracy of out of body perceptions by placing "unusual targets in locations likely to be seen by persons having NDEs, such as in an upper corner of a room in the emergency department, the coronary care unit, or the intensive care unit of a hospital." Twelve patients reported leaving their bodies, but unfortunately none could describe the hidden visual targets. Although this is a small sample, the failure of purported out-of-body experiencers to describe the hidden targets raises questions about the accuracy of the anecdotal reports described above.&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt;

Psychologist [[James Alcock]] has described the afterlife claims of NDE researchers as [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. Alcock has written the spiritual or transcendental interpretation "is based on belief in search of data rather than observation in search of explanation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazier|first1=Kendrick|title=Paranormal Borderlands of Science|date=1981|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Buffalo, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-87975-148-7|pages=153–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris French has noted that "the survivalist approach does not appear to generate clear and testable hypotheses. Because of the vagueness and imprecision of the survivalist account, it can be made to explain any possible set of findings and is therefore unfalsifiable and unscientific."&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris French|French, Chris]].

=== Psychological explanations ===
French summarises the main psychological explanations which include: the depersonalization, the expectancy and the dissociation models.&lt;ref name="French2005rev"/&gt;

==== Depersonalization model ====
A depersonalization model was proposed in the 1970s by professor of psychiatry Russell Noyes and clinical psychologist Roy Kletti, which suggested that the NDE is a form of [[depersonalization]] experienced under emotional conditions such as life-threatening danger, potentially inescapable danger, and that the NDE can best be understood as an hallucination.&lt;ref name=French2005rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Noyes |first1 = R |year = 1972 |title = The experience of dying |url = |journal = Psychiatry |volume = 35 |issue = 2|pages = 174–184 |doi=10.1080/00332747.1972.11023710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Noyes |first1 = R. |last2 = Kletti |first2 = R. |year = 1976 |title = Depersonalisation in the face of life-threatening danger: an interpretation |url = |journal = Omega |volume = 7 |issue = 2|pages = 103–114 |doi=10.2190/7qet-2vau-ycdt-tj9r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Noyes |first1 = R. |last2 = Kletti |first2 = R. |year = 1977 |title = Depersonalisation in the face of life-threatening danger |url = |journal = Compr. Psychiat |volume = 18 |issue = |pages = 375–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noyes, R. and Slymen, D. (1978–1979) ''The subjective response to life-threatening danger''. ''Omega'' 9: 313–321.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, those who face their impending death become detached from the surroundings and their own bodies, no longer feel emotions, and experience time distortions.&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt;

This model suffers from a number of limitations to explain NDEs for subjects who do not experience a sensation of being out of their bodies; unlike NDEs, experiences are dreamlike, unpleasant and characterized by "anxiety, panic and emptiness".&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt; Also, during NDEs subjects remain very lucid of their identities, their sense of identify is not changed unlike those experiencing depersonalization.&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt;

==== Expectancy model ====
Another psychological theory is called the expectancy model. It has been suggested that although these experiences could appear very real, they had actually been constructed in the mind, either consciously or subconsciously, in response to the stress of an encounter with death (or perceived encounter with death), and did not correspond to a real event. In a way, they are similar to wish-fulfillment: because someone thought they were about to die, they experienced certain things in accordance with what they expected or wanted to occur. Imagining a heavenly place was in effect a way for them to soothe themselves through the stress of knowing that they were close to death.&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt; Subjects use their own personal and cultural expectations to imagine a scenario that would protect them against an imminent threat to their lives.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

Subjects' accounts often differed from their own "religious and personal expectations regarding death" which contradicts the hypothesis they may have imagined a scenario based on their cultural and personal background.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

Although the term NDE was first coined in 1975 and the experience first described then, recent descriptions of NDEs do not differ from those reported earlier than 1975. The only exception is the more frequent description of a tunnel.  Hence, the fact that information about these experiences could be more easily obtained after 1975, did not influence people's reports of the experiences.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

Another flaw of this model can be found in children's accounts of NDEs. These are similar to adults', and this despite children being less affected by religious or cultural influences about death.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

==== Dissociation model ====
The dissociation model proposes that NDE is a form of withdrawal to protect an individual from a stressful event. Under extreme circumstances some people may detach from certain unwanted feelings in order to avoid experiencing their emotional impact and suffering associated with them. The person also detaches from one's immediate surroundings.&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt;

==== Birth model ====
The birth model suggests that near death experiences could be a form of reliving the trauma of birth. Since a baby travels from the darkness of the womb to light and is greeted by the love and warmth of the nursing and medical staff, and so, it was proposed, the dying brain could be recreating the passage through a tunnel to light, warmth and affection.&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt;

Reports of leaving the body through a tunnel are equally frequent among subjects who were born by cesarean section and natural birth. Also, newborns do not possess "the visual acuity, spatial stability of their visual images, mental alertness, and cortical coding capacity to register memories of the birth experience".&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

=== Physiological explanations (organic theories) ===
A wide range of physiological theories of the NDE have been put forward including those based upon [[cerebral hypoxia]], anoxia, and [[hypercapnia]]; endorphins and other neurotransmitters; and abnormal activity in the [[temporal lobe]]s.&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt;

Neurobiological factors in the experience have been investigated by researchers in the field of medical science and psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;Mayank and Mukesh, 2004; Jansen, 1995; Thomas, 2004; Fenwick and Fenwick 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Among the researchers and commentators who tend to emphasize a naturalistic and neurological base for the experience are the [[Great Britain|British]] [[psychologist]] [[Susan Blackmore]] (1993), with her "dying brain hypothesis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bassham |first1=Gregory|title=Critical Thinking: A Student's Untroduction|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-07-287959-9 |page=485 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====  Neuroanatomical models ====
Neuroscientists Olaf Blanke and Sebastian Dieguez (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Leaving Body And Life Behind:[http://lnco.epfl.ch/files/content/sites/lnco/files/shared/publications/lnco/2009_Dieguez_NC(chap)_leaving%20body%20and%20life%20behind-out%20of%20body%20and%20near%20death%20experience.pdf lnco.epfl.ch]&lt;/ref&gt; from the ''[[Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]]'', [[Switzerland]], propose a brain based model with two types of NDEs : 
* "type 1 NDEs are due to bilateral frontal and occipital, but predominantly right hemispheric brain damage affecting the right temporal parietal junction and characterized by out of body experiences, altered sense of time, sensations of flying, lightness vection and flying" &lt;ref name="blanke2009" /&gt;
* "type 2 NDEs are also due to bilateral frontal and occipital, but predominantly left hemispheric brain damage affecting the left temporal parietal junction and characterized by feeling of a presence, meeting and communication with spirits, seeing of glowing bodies, as well as voices, sounds, and music without vection" &lt;ref name="blanke2009" /&gt;
They suggest that damage to the bilateral [[Occipital lobe|occipital cortex]] may lead to visual features of NDEs such as seeing a tunnel or lights, and "damage to unilateral or bilateral temporal lobe structures such as the [[hippocampus]] and amygdala" may lead to emotional experiences, memory flashbacks or a life review. They concluded that future neuroscientific studies are likely to reveal the neuroanatomical basis of the NDE which will lead to the demystification of the subject without needing paranormal explanations.&lt;ref name="blanke2009" /&gt;

[[File:Temporal lobe animation.gif|thumb|160px|left|Animation of the human left temporal lobe]]

French has written that the "temporal lobe is almost certain to be involved in NDEs, given that both damage to and direct cortical stimulation of this area are known to produce a number of experiences corresponding to those of the NDE, including OBEs, hallucinations, and memory flashbacks".&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt;

Vanhaudenhuyse ''et al''. 2009 reported that recent studies employing [[deep brain stimulation]] and [[neuroimaging]] have demonstrated that out-of-body experiences result from a deficient [[multisensory integration]] at the [[temporoparietal junction]] and that ongoing studies aim to further identify the functional neuroanatomy of near-death experiences by means of standardized EEG recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intensive Care Medicine |date=2009|publisher=Springer New York | isbn=978-0-387-92277-5 |location=[S.l.] |pages=961–968 |last1=Vincent |first1=Jean-Louis|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-92276-6_85|chapter=Towards a Neuro-scientific Explanation of Near-death Experiences?|citeseerx=10.1.1.368.4580}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to Greyson&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt; multiple neuroanatomical models have been proposed where NDEs have been hypothesized to originate from different anatomical areas of the brain, namely: the limbic system, the hippocampus, the left temporal lobe, Reissen's fiber in the central canal of the spinal cord, the prefrontal cortex, the right temporal lobe.

Blanke et al.&lt;ref name="blanke2009" /&gt; admit that their model remains speculative to the lack of data. Likewise Greyson&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt; writes that although some or any of the neuroanatomical models proposed may serve to explain NDEs and pathways through which they are expressed, they remain speculative at this stage since they have not been tested in empirical studies.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

==== Neurochemical models ====
Some theories hypothesize that drugs used during resuscitation induced NDEs, for example, [[ketamine]] or as resulting from endogeneous chemicals that transmit signals between brain cells, [[neurotransmitter]]s:&lt;ref name=French2005rev/&gt;
* In the early eighties, Daniel Carr wrote that NDE has characteristics are suggestive of a [[limbic lobe]] syndrome and that the NDE can be explained by the release of [[endorphins]] and [[enkephalin]]s in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carr | first1 = Daniel | year = 1981 | title = Endorphins at the Approach of Death | url = |journal = Lancet | volume = 317 | issue = 8216| page = 390 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(81)91714-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carr |first1 = Daniel | year = 1982 | title = Pathophysiology of Stress-Induced Limbic Lobe Dysfunction: A Hypothesis Relevant to Near-Death Experiences | url = | journal = Anabiosis: The Journal of Near-Death Studies | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 75–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endorphins are endogenous molecules "released in times of stress and lead to a reduction in pain perception and a pleasant, even blissful, emotional state." &lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt; 
* Judson and Wiltshaw (1983) noted how the administration of endorphin-blocking agents such as [[naloxone]] had been occasionally reported to produce "hellish" NDEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Wiltshaw|first2=E.|year=1983|title=A near-death experience|url=|journal=Lancet|issue=8349|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(83)90582-2 |pages=561–562|last1=Judson|first1=I. R|volume=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be coherent with endorphins' role in causing a "positive emotional tone of most NDEs".&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt; 
* Morse ''et al''. 1989 proposed a model arguing that [[serotonin]] played a more important role than endorphins in generating NDEs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morse | first1 = M. L | last2 = Venecia | first2 = D | last3 = Milstein | first3 = J. | year = 1989 | title = Near-death experiences: A neurophysiological explanatory model | url = | journal = Journal of Near-Death Studies | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 45–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "at least with respect to mystical hallucinations and OBEs".&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt;

According to Parnia, neurochemical models are not backed by data. This is true for "NMDA receptor activation, serotonin, and endorphin release" models.&lt;ref name="Parnia2014rev" /&gt; Parnia writes that no data has been collected via thorough and careful experimentation to back "a possible causal relationship or even an association" between neurochemical agents and NDE experiences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Multi-factorial models ====
The first formal neurobiological model for NDE, included endorphins, neurotransmitters of the [[limbic system]], the temporal lobe and other parts of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Gómez-Jeria|first2=Juan S.|year=1989|title=A Neurobiological Model for Near-Death Experiences|url=http://200.89.70.78:8080/jspui/handle/2250/14775|journal=Journal of Near-Death Studies|volume=7|issue=4|pages=205–222|doi=10.1007/bf01074007|last1=Saavedra-Aguilar|first1=J.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensions and variations of their model came from other scientists such as Louis Appleby (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1989|title=Near·death experience: Analogous to other stress induced psychological phenomena|url=|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=298|issue=|pages=976–977|last1=Appleby|first1=L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors suggest that all components of near-death experiences can be explained in their entirety via psychological or neurophysiological mechanisms, although the authors admit that these hypotheses have to be tested by science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mobbs|first=Dean|last2=Watt|first2=Caroline|date=October 2011|title=There is nothing paranormal about near-death experiences: how neuroscience can explain seeing bright lights, meeting the dead, or being convinced you are one of them|url=|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=15|issue=10|pages=447–449|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2011.07.010|pmid=21852181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====  Low oxygen levels (and G-LOC) model  ====
Low oxygen levels in the blood (hypoxia or anoxia) have been hypothesized to induce hallucinations and hence possibly explain NDEs.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name=French2005rev/&gt; This is because low oxygen levels characterize life-threatening situations and also by the apparent similarities between NDEs and G-force induced loss of consciousness ([[G-LOC]]) episodes.

These episodes are observed with fighter pilots experiencing very rapid and intense acceleration that result in lack of sufficient blood supply to the brain. Whinnery&lt;ref name="Whinnery"&gt;Whinnery, J. E. (1997). ''Psychophysiologic correlates of unconsciousness and near-death experiences''. J. Near Death Stud 15: 231–258.&lt;/ref&gt; studied almost 1000 cases and noted how the experiences often involved "tunnel vision and bright lights, floating sensations, automatic movement, autoscopy, OBEs, not wanting to be disturbed, paralysis, vivid dreamlets of beautiful places, pleasurable sensations, psychological alterations of euphoria and dissociation, inclusion of friends and family, inclusion of prior memories and thoughts, the experience being very memorable (when it can be remembered), confabulation, and a strong urge to understand the experience."&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whinnery" /&gt;

However, hypoxia-induced acceleration's primary characteristics are "rythmic jerking of the limbs, compromised memory of events just prior to the onset of unconsciousness, tingling of extremities ..." that are not observed during NDEs.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt; Also G-LOC episodes do not feature life reviews, mystical experiences and "long-lasting transformational aftereffects", although this may be due to the fact that subjects have no expectation of dying.&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt;

Also, hypoxic hallucinations are characterized by "distress and agitation" and this is very different from near death experiences which subjects report as being pleasant.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

==== Altered blood gas levels models ====
Some investigators have studied whether [[wikt:hypercarbia|hypercarbia]] or higher than normal carbon dioxide levels, could explain the occurrence of NDEs. However, studies are difficult to interpret since NDEs have been observed both with increased levels as well as decreased levels of carbon dioxide, and finally some other studies have observed NDEs when levels had not changed, and there is little data.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

==== Other models ====
French said that at least some reports of NDEs might be based upon [[False memory syndrome|false memories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = French | first1 = Chris | authorlink = Chris French | year = 2001 | title = Dying to Know the Truth: Visions of a Dying Brain, or False Memories? | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 358 | issue = 9298| pages = 2010–2011 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(01)07133-1| pmid = 11755600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Engmann (2008) near-death experiences of people who are [[clinical death|clinically dead]] are psychopathological symptoms caused by a severe malfunction of the brain resulting from the cessation of cerebral blood circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Engmann, Birk. (2008). ''Near-death Experiences: A review on the thesis of pathoclisis, neurotransmitter abnormalities, and psychological aspects''. MMW-Fortschr.Med.Nr.51-52/2008(150.Jg.) pp.42–43. {{PMID|19156957}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important question is whether it is possible to "translate" the bloomy experiences of the reanimated survivors into psychopathologically basic phenomena, e.g., acoasms (nonverbal auditory hallucinations), central narrowing of the visual field, [[autoscopy|autoscopia]], [[visual hallucinations]], activation of limbic and memory structures according to Moody's stages. The symptoms suppose a primary affliction of the [[occipital lobe|occipital]] and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] cortices under clinical death. This basis could be congruent with the thesis of [[pathoclisis]]—the inclination of special parts of the brain to be the first to be damaged in case of disease, lack of oxygen, or malnutrition—established eighty years ago by [[Cécile Vogt-Mugnier|Cécile]] and [[Oskar Vogt]].&lt;ref&gt;Vogt C, Vogt O. (1922). ''Erkrankungen der Großhirnrinde im Lichte der Topistik, Pathoklise und Pathoarchitektonik''. Journal für Psychologie und Neurologie; Bd. 28. Joh.- Ambr.- Barth- Verlag. Leipzig. (German).&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of neurology [[Terence Hines]] (2003) claimed that near-death experiences are hallucinations caused by [[Cerebral hypoxia|cerebral anoxia]], drugs, or brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hines|first1=Terence|title=Pseudoscience and the Paranormal|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, N.Y.|isbn=978-1-57392-979-0|pages=101–104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-cultural aspects==
Gregory Shushan published an analysis of the afterlife beliefs of five ancient civilisations (Old and Middle Kingdom Egypt, Sumerian and Old Babylonian Mesopotamia, Vedic India, pre-Buddhist China, and pre-Columbian Mesoamerica) and compared them with historical and contemporary reports of near-death experiences, and [[shamanism|shaman]]ic afterlife "journeys". Shushan found similarities across time, place, and culture that he found could not be explained by coincidence; he also found elements that were specific to cultures; Shushan concludes that some form of mutual influence between experiences of an afterlife and culture probably influence one another and that this inheritance in turn influences individual NDEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shushan|first1=Gregory|title=Conceptions of the Afterlife in Early Civilizations: Universalism, Constructivism, and Near-Death Experience|date=2009|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-0-8264-4073-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, it has been argued that near-death experiences and many of their elements (vision of God, judgment, the tunnel, or the life review) are closely related to religious and spiritual traditions of the West. It was mainly Christian visionaries, Spiritualists, Occultists, and Theosophists of the 19th and 20th century that reported them (Schlieter 2018).

According to Parnia, near death experiences' interpretations are influenced by religious, social, cultural backgrounds. However, the core elements appear to transcend borders and can be considered universal. In fact, some of these core elements have even been reported by children &lt;3 years old (this occurred over many months, whilst playing and communicated using children's language). In other words, at an age where they should not have been influenced by culture or tradition.&lt;ref name="Parnia2014rev" /&gt;

Also, according to Greyson,&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt; the central features of NDEs are universal and have not been influenced by time. These have been observed throughout history and in different cultures. This notwithstanding, cultural influences have probably played a role in some NDEs' reported descriptions.

The '''Open Tree of Life''' is an online [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] – a collaborative effort, funded by the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hinchliff CE, Smith SA, Allman JF, Burleigh JG, Chaudhary R, Coghill LM, Crandall KA, Deng J, Drew BT, Gazis R, Gude K, Hibbett DS, Katz LA, Laughinghouse HD, McTavish EJ, Midford PE, Owen CL, Ree RH, Rees JA, Soltis DE, Williams T, Cranston KA | display-authors = 6 | title = Synthesis of phylogeny and taxonomy into a comprehensive tree of life | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 112 | issue = 41 | pages = 12764–9 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26385966 | pmc = 4611642 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1423041112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Assembling, Visualizing, and Analyzing the Tree of Life | publisher = National Science Foundation (NSF) |url = https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503629 |access-date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first draft, including 2.3 million species, was released in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2015/09/first-comprehensive-tree-life-shows-how-related-you-are-millions-species | title  =First comprehensive tree of life shows how related you are to millions of species | first = Elizabeth | last = Pennisi | name-list-format = vanc | date = 21 September 2015 | work = Science Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Interactive graph allows the user to zoom in to taxonomic classifications, phylogenetic trees, and information about a node.

== Approach ==

The project uses a [[supertree]] approach to generate a single phylogenetic tree (served at tree.opentreeoflife.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/|title=opentree|first=Open Tree of Life developers|last=&lt;mtholder@gmail.com&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from a comprehensive [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and a curated set of published phylogenetic estimates.

The taxonomy is a combination of several large classifications produced by other projects; it is created using a software tool called "smasher"
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rees JA, Cranston K | title = Automated assembly of a reference taxonomy for phylogenetic data synthesis | journal = Biodiversity Data Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = e12581 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28765728 | pmc = 5515096 | doi = 10.3897/BDJ.5.e12581 | url = https://bdj.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=12581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting taxonomy is called an Open Tree Taxonomy (OTT) and can be browsed on-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/taxonomy/browse | title = tree.opentreeoflife.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The project was started in June 2012 with a three-year [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] award to researchers at ten universities. In 2015, a two-year supplemental award was made to researchers at three institutions.

[[File:Wheeled animal - East Mexico cultures - Ethnological Museum, Berlin - DSC00852.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.3|A toy animal with wheels, from [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] [[Mexico]]{{r|Gambino}}|alt=A toy animal with wheels]]
[[Terrestrial locomotion#Rolling|Several organisms]] are capable of [[rolling]] locomotion; however, true [[wheel]]s and [[propeller]]s—despite their utility in human [[vehicle]]s—do not appear to play a significant role in the [[animal locomotion|movement of living things]] (with the exception of certain [[flagellum|flagella]], which function like [[corkscrew]]s). Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in [[speculative fiction]].

Given the ubiquity of the wheel in human technology, and the existence of biological analogues of many other technologies (such as [[wing]]s and [[lens (optics)|lenses]]), the lack of wheels in the natural world would seem to demand explanation—and the phenomenon is broadly explained by two main factors. First, there are several [[developmental biology|developmental]] and [[evolution]]ary obstacles to the advent of a wheel by [[natural selection]], addressing the question "Why can't life evolve wheels?" Secondly, wheels are often at a competitive disadvantage when compared with other means of propulsion (such as [[walking]], [[running]], or [[Terrestrial_locomotion#Limbless_locomotion|slithering]]) in natural environments, addressing the question "If wheels ''could'' evolve, why might they be rare nonetheless?" This environment-specific disadvantage also explains why at least one historical civilization abandoned the wheel as a mode of transport.&lt;!--Cited in section [[#Rolling resistance]]; per [[WP:LEADCITE]], statements in the lead don't require citation here if cited elsewhere in the article--&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Known instances of rotation in biology==
There exist two distinct modes of [[wikt:locomotion|locomotion]] using [[rotation]]: first, simple [[rolling]]; and second, the use of [[wheel]]s or [[propeller]]s, which spin on an [[axle]] or [[shaft (mechanical engineering)|shaft]], relative to a fixed body. While many creatures employ the former mode, the latter is restricted to microscopic, [[Unicellular organism|single-celled]] organisms.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|396}}

===Rolling===
[[File:Steppenschuppentier1a.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=A curled-up pangolin|The pangolin ''[[Manis temminckii]]'' in a defensive posture, in which it can roll]]
{{see also|Category:Rolling animals}}
Some organisms use [[Terrestrial locomotion#Rolling|rolling]] as a means of locomotion. These examples do not constitute the use of a wheel, as the organism rotates as a whole, rather than employing separate parts which rotate independently.{{r|Krus}}{{r|merriam-webster}}

Several species of elongate organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including [[Patania ruralis|certain caterpillars]] (which do so to [[Anti-predator adaptation|escape danger]]),{{r|Krus}}{{r|Scholtz}} [[Cicindela dorsalis|tiger beetle]] larvae, [[myriapoda|myriapods]], [[mantis shrimp]], [[Armadillidiidae]], and [[Mount Lyell salamander]]s.{{r|Full93}} Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily to protect their bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in [[pangolin]]s, [[wheel spider]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, [[armadillo]]s, [[Armadillo girdled lizard]]s, [[isopoda|isopods]], and [[fossil]]ized [[trilobite]]s.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|armstrong}} Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|armstrong}} These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.{{r|Scholtz}}

[[Tumbleweed]]s, which are the above-ground portions of certain plants, separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to [[Seed dispersal|distribute their seeds]]. These plants are found especially in open [[plain]] environments.{{r|Ganong}} The most well-known of these include ''[[Kali tragus]]'' (also known as ''Salsola tragus''), or prickly Russian thistle,&lt;ref&gt;{{PLANTS|id=SATR12|taxon=Salsola tragus|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and gained a reputation as a [[noxious weed]].&lt;ref name="Main"/&gt; Fungi of the genus ''[[Bovista]]'' are known to use the same strategy to disperse their [[spore]]s.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

[[Rotifers]] are a phylum of microscopic but multi-celled animals, typically found in freshwater environments.&lt;ref name="Howey"/&gt; Although the [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''rotifer'' means 'wheel-bearer', these organisms do not have any rotating structures, but rather a ring of rhythmically beating [[cilia]] used for feeding and propulsion.{{r|pechenik}}

[[Keratinocyte]]s, a type of skin cell, migrate with a rolling motion during the process of [[wound healing]].{{r|Myers}}{{r|Anderson}} These cells serve to form a barrier against [[pathogen]]s and moisture loss through wounded tissue.&lt;ref name="ABN"/&gt;

[[Dung beetle]]s form spherical balls of animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, generally by walking backwards and pushing the ball with their rear legs. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in [[ancient Egypt]]ian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face many of the same mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.{{r|Scholtz}}

}}
Among animals, there exists a single known example of an apparently freely-rotating structure, though it is used for [[digestion]] rather than propulsion: the [[style (zoology)|crystalline style]] of certain [[bivalvia|bivalves]] and [[gastropoda|gastropods]].{{r|owen}}{{rp|89}} The style consists of a transparent [[glycoprotein]] rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of [[mucus]]. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases [[digestive enzyme]]s.{{r|owen}} Estimates of the speed of rotation of the style ''in vivo'' vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.{{r|kristensen}}

====Molecular====
There are two known examples of molecular-scale rotating structures used by living cells.{{r|Oster}} [[ATP synthase]] is an enzyme used in the process of energy storage and transfer.{{r|Feniouk}} It bears some similarity to the [[flagellum|flagellar motors]] discussed below.{{r|Crofts}} ATP synthase is thought to have arisen by [[mosaic evolution|modular evolution]], in which two subunits with their own functions have become associated and gained a new functionality.{{r|Falk}}

[[File:Physical model of a bacterial flagellum.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Model of the base of a bacterial flagellum, a true biological example of a freely rotating structure|alt=Physical model of the base of a bacterial flagellum]]
The only known example of a biological "wheel"—a system capable of providing continuous propulsive [[torque]] about a fixed body—is the  [[flagellum]], a corkscrew-like tail used by single-celled [[prokaryote]]s for propulsion.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|396}} The [[bacterial flagellum]] is the best known example.{{r|Diamond}}{{r|gebremichael}} About half of all known bacteria have at least one flagellum, indicating that rotation may in fact be the most common form of locomotion in living systems, though its use is restricted to the microscopic environment.{{r|goldsworthy}}

At the base of the bacterial flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a [[motor protein]] acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by [[proton motive force]], i.e. by the flow of [[proton]]s ([[hydrogen]] [[ion]]s) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a [[concentration gradient]] set up by the cell's [[metabolism]]. (In species of the genus ''[[Vibrio]]'', there are two kinds of flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a [[sodium]] [[ion transporter|ion pump]] rather than a [[proton pump]].{{r|Atsumi}}) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60&amp;nbsp;cell lengths per second.{{r|Franklin}} The rotary motor at the base of the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase.{{r|Oster}} ''[[Spiral_bacteria#Spirillum|Spirillum]]'' bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.{{r|Chwang}}

[[Archaea]], a group of prokaryotes separate from bacteria, also feature flagella – known as [[archaellum |archaella]] – driven by rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and [[homology (biology)|evolutionarily distinct]] from bacterial flagella: whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial [[Type three secretion system|Type III secretion system]], archaella appear to have evolved from [[Pilus#Type IV pili |type IV pili]].{{r|ng}}

Some [[eukaryotic]] cells, such as the protist ''[[Euglena]]'', also have flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend in such a way that the tip of the flagellum whips in a circle.{{r|Moran}}{{rp|1105}} The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a [[cilium]] or [[undulipodium]], is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.{{r|mitchell}}
{{clear}}

==Biological barriers to wheeled organisms==

The absence of wheels in nature is frequently attributed to constraints imposed by biology: [[natural selection]] constrains the [[evolution]]ary paths available to species,{{r|Dawkins}} and the processes by which [[multicellular organism]]s grow and develop may not permit the construction of a functioning wheel.{{r|gould81}}

===Evolutionary constraints===
[[File:fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Sketch of a fitness landscape|Illustration of a [[fitness landscape]], indicating genetic flow of populations toward local [[wikt:optimum|optima]]. Potentially beneficial changes requiring descent into a fitness "valley" are foreclosed by natural selection.]]

The processes of evolution, as they are presently understood, can help explain why wheeled locomotion has not evolved in multicellular organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism.{{r|Dawkins}}

According to [[neo-Darwinism]], adaptations are produced incrementally through natural selection, so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations only if they do not decrease the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of individuals.{{r|Dawkins}} Although [[Neutral mutation|neutral changes]] (ones which provide no benefit) can spread through [[genetic drift]],{{r|kimura}} and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances,{{r|otto}}{{rp|728–729}} large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness. [[Richard Dawkins]] describes the matter: "The wheel may be one of those cases where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view, yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [on] the other side of a deep valley, cutting unbridgeably across the massif of [[Mount Improbable]]."{{r|Dawkins}} In such a [[fitness landscape]], wheels might sit on a highly favorable "peak", but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the [[gene pool]] to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components, commenting that "wheels work well, but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy".{{r|gould81}}{{rp|48}}

Natural selection therefore explains why wheels are an unlikely solution to the problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the [[evolution of flagella]], individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells.{{r|matzke03}}{{r|matzke06}}{{r|pallen}} This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called ''[[exaptation]]''.{{r|gould82}}

Molecular biologist [[Robin Holliday]] has written that the absence of biological wheels argues against [[creationism|creationist]] or [[intelligent design]] accounts of the diversity of life, because an intelligent creator—free of the limitations imposed by evolution—would be expected to deploy wheels wherever they would be of use.{{r|Holliday}}

===Developmental and anatomical constraints===
{{Wikibooks|Biomechanics}}
Using human [[manufacturing]] processes, wheeled systems of varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, and issues of power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of [[developmental biology|embryonic development]] are suited to—or even capable of—producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.{{refn|group=Note|Although evolutionary and developmental constraints may preclude the possibility of a wheel as ''part'' of an organism, they do not preclude the use of foreign objects as "wheels", either instinctively (as in the case of the dung beetles discussed above), or through intelligently directed [[tool use by animals|tool use]] (as in human technology).}}{{r|Diamond}}{{r|Dawkins}}{{r|gould81}}{{r|Fish}}

The greatest anatomical impediment to wheeled multicellular organisms is the [[biointerface|interface]] between the static and rotating components of the wheel. In either a passive or driven case, the wheel (and possibly [[axle]]) must be able to rotate freely relative to the rest of the machine or organism.{{refn|group=Note|Wheels can be considered to fall into two types: passive and driven. A passive wheel simply rolls freely over a surface, reducing [[friction]] when compared with dragging. A driven wheel is powered, and transmits energy to the surface in order to generate forward motion.{{r|Bräunl}}}} Unlike animal [[joint]]s, which have a limited [[range of motion]], a wheel must be able to rotate through an arbitrary angle without ever needing to be "unwound". As such, a wheel cannot be permanently attached to the axle or shaft about which it rotates (or, if the axle and wheel are fixed together, the axle cannot be affixed to the rest of the machine or organism).{{r|gould81}}{{rp|44}} There are several functional problems created by this requirement.

====Power transmission to driven wheels====
[[File:Biceps (PSF).jpg|alt=Drawing of human arm muscles|Skeletal muscle, attached at each end to bone|thumb]]
In the case of a driven wheel, a [[torque]] must be applied to generate the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including [[Electric motor|electric]], [[Internal combustion engine|piston-driven]], [[Turbine|turbine-driven]], [[Pneumatic motor|pneumatic]], and [[Hydraulic motor|hydraulic]]. (Torque may also be provided by [[human power]], as in the case of a [[bicycle]].) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of [[skeletal muscle]]s, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|406}} Because these muscles are [[connective tissue|attached]] to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.{{r|Fish}}

====Friction====
Reducing friction is vital for minimizing [[wear]] on mechanical components and preventing overheating.{{r|Seireg}}{{rp|1}} As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases.{{r|Seireg}}{{rp|2–3}} Various types of [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] and/or [[lubricant]] may be used to reduce friction at the interface between two components.{{r|Jones}} In biological joints such as the human [[knee]], friction is reduced by means of [[cartilage]] with a very low [[Coefficient of friction|friction coefficient]], as well as lubricating [[synovial fluid]], which has very low [[viscosity]].{{r|Callaghan}} Gerhard Scholtz of [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] asserts that a similar [[secretion|secreted]] lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.{{r|Scholtz}}

====Nutrient and waste transfer====
Another potential problem that arises at the interface between wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues that make up a wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with [[oxygen]] and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal [[circulatory system]], composed of blood vessels, would not be able to provide transportation across the interface.{{r|Dawkins}}{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|405}} In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to [[diffusion|diffuse]] across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available [[partial pressure]] and [[surface area]], in accordance with [[Fick's law of diffusion]].{{r|gould81}}{{rp|48}} For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient.{{r|Diamond}} Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as [[keratin]], of which [[hair]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] are composed.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}}

==Disadvantages of wheels==
Wheels incur mechanical and other disadvantages in certain environments and situations that would represent a decreased fitness when compared with [[Limb (anatomy)|limbed]] locomotion.{{r|Dawkins}} These disadvantages suggest that, even barring the biological constraints discussed above, the absence of wheels in multicellular life may not be the "missed opportunity" of biology that it first seems.{{r|Scholtz}} In fact, given the mechanical disadvantages and restricted usefulness of wheels when compared with limbs, the central question can be reversed: not "Why does nature not produce wheels?", but rather, "Why do human vehicles not make more use of limbs?"{{r|Diamond}} The use of wheels rather than limbs in most [[engineering|engineered]] vehicles can likely be attributed to the complexity of [[design]] required to construct and [[control system|control]] limbs, rather than to a consistent functional advantage of wheels over limbs.{{r|Full02}}{{r|Donat}}

===Efficiency===

====Rolling resistance====
[[File:Rolling Resistance.PNG|right|thumb|alt=Diagram of the forces acting on a wheel|A hard wheel rolling on—and deforming—a soft surface, resulting in the [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]] ''N'', which has a component that opposes the motion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(''W'' is the weight of the wheel plus the portion of the vehicle being supported; ''F'' is a propulsive force; ''N'' is the [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]] from the surface; ''r'' is the radius of wheel.)]]

Although stiff wheels are more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]] than other means of locomotion when traveling over hard, level [[terrain]] (such as [[Road surface|paved roads]]), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as [[soil]], because they are vulnerable to [[rolling resistance]]. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|401}} Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater.{{r|Diamond}} While wheels must deform the surface along their [[rut (roads)|entire path]], limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.{{r|Todd}}

Rolling resistance is also the reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels.{{r|Diamond}} During the time of the [[Roman Empire]], wheeled [[chariot]]s were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to [[dromedary|camel]]s to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book ''[[Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes]]'', Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by [[ox]]en.{{r|lienhard}}

====Efficiency of aquatic locomotion====
When moving through a fluid, rotating systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low [[Reynolds number]]s (i.e. viscosity-dominated flows) such as those experienced by bacterial flagella, whereas [[oscillation|oscillating]] systems have the advantage at higher ([[inertia]]-dominated) Reynolds numbers.{{r|Radharkrishnan}}{{rp|5451}} Whereas ship propellers typically have [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiencies]] around 60% and aircraft propellers up to around 80% (achieving 88% in the human-powered ''[[Gossamer Condor]]''), much higher efficiencies, in the range of 96%–98%, can be achieved with an oscillating flexible [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foil]] like a fish tail or bird wing.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|398}}{{r|Diamond}}

===Traction===
Wheels are prone to [[Slip (vehicle dynamics)|slipping]]—an inability to generate [[Traction (engineering)|traction]]—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead to a loss of control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels can be seen in the realm of human technology: in an example of [[biologically inspired engineering]], [[Walker (machine)#Real walking vehicles|legged vehicles]] find use in the [[logging]] industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate.{{r|space.com}} [[Continuous track|Tracked]] vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground{{r|Wong}}{{rp|354}}—but they tend to have larger [[turning radius|turning radii]] than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.{{r|Wong}}{{rp|419}}
{{clear}}

===Obstacle navigation===
[[File:Mountain Goat on Mount Huron in Colorado Image 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Mountain goats on rocky terrain|A [[mountain goat]] navigating a rocky landscape. Mountain goats illustrate the versatility of legs in challenging terrain.]]
Work by engineer [[Mieczysław G. Bekker]] implies that the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]]; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to locomotion in natural terrains [[scale invariance|at all size scales]].{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|400–401}} The primary means of obstacle navigation are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.{{r|Diamond}}

====Going around====
Anatomist Michael LaBarbera of the [[University of Chicago]] illustrates the poor maneuverability of wheels by comparing the turning radii of walking and [[wheelchair]]-using humans.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|402}} As [[Jared Diamond]] points out, most biological examples of rolling are found in wide open, hard packed terrain, including the use of rolling by [[dung beetle]]s and [[tumbleweed]]s.{{r|Diamond}}{{r|Nof}}{{r|Bala}}

====Going over====
Wheels are poor at dealing with vertical obstacles, especially obstacles on the same scale as the wheel itself, and may be unable to climb vertical obstacles taller than about 40% of the wheel height.{{r|Nof}}{{rp|148}} Because of this limitation, wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|400}}

In addition, without [[wikt:articulation|articulation]], a wheeled vehicle can become stuck on top of an obstacle, with the obstacle between the wheels, preventing them from contacting the ground.{{r|Bala}} Limbs, in contrast, are useful for climbing and are equipped to deal with uneven terrain.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|402–403}}

With unarticulated wheels, climbing obstacles will cause the body of a vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the [[wheelbase]] or axle track, the vehicle becomes statically unstable, and will tend to tip over.{{r|nap}} At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning.{{r|johnson}} Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.

===Versatility===
Limbs used by animals for locomotion over terrain are frequently also used for other purposes, such as [[prehensility|grasping]], [[fine motor skill|manipulating]], [[arboreal locomotion|climbing]], [[brachiation|branch-swinging]], [[aquatic locomotion#Secondary evolution of swimming|swimming]], [[fossorial|digging]], [[jumping]], [[throwing]], [[kick]]ing, and [[personal grooming|grooming]]. With a lack of articulation, wheels would not be as useful as limbs in these roles.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|399}}

==In fiction and legend==
[[File:Ill_dict_infernal_p0139-123_buer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=Illustration of the demon Buer|The demon [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], from the 1863 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'']]
{{main|Rolling and wheeled creatures in fiction and legend}}
Legends and speculative fiction reveal a longstanding human fascination with rolling and wheeled creatures. Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe,{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} Japan,{{r|Pruett}} [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Mexico,{{r|Gambino}} the United States, and Australia.{{r|Full93}}

===Rolling creatures===
The [[hoop snake]], a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey.{{r|Full93}} Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the ''[[Tsuchinoko]]''.{{r|Pruett}} [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], a [[demon]] mentioned in the 16th-century [[grimoire]] ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', was described and illustrated in [[Jacques Collin de Plancy|Collin de Plancy]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' as having radially-arranged arms on which it rolled.{{r|de_Plancy_1825}}{{r|de_Plancy_1863}}

The Dutch graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] illustrated a rolling creature of his own invention in [[Curl-up|a 1951 lithograph]].{{r|Escher}} Rolling creatures are also featured in works written by comic author [[Carl Barks]],{{r|Andrae}} science fiction writers [[Fredric Brown]],{{r|Brown}} [[George R. R. Martin]],{{r|martin}} and [[Joan Slonczewski]],{{r|Switzer}}{{r|Slonczewski}} and in the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']] video game series, which first appeared in 1991.{{r|Sega}}{{r|Thomas}}

===Wheeled creatures===
Toy animals with wheels dating from the Pre-Columbian era were uncovered by archaeologists in [[Veracruz]], Mexico, in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior to the arrival of Europeans.{{r|Gambino}}

{{wikisource|Ozma of Oz}}
Several twentieth-century writers explored possibilities of wheeled creatures. [[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1907 children's novel ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers.{{r|Baum}} Their wheels are composed of [[keratin]], which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}} Despite moving quickly on firm open terrain, the Wheelers cannot cross sand, and are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs.{{r|Baum}}

In the latter half of the twentieth century, wheeled or wheel-using creatures featured in works by fantasy and science fiction writers including [[Clifford D. Simak]],{{r|Simak}} [[Piers Anthony]],{{r|anthony}} [[David Brin]],{{r|Brin95}} [[K. A. Applegate]],{{r|Applegate}} [[Philip Pullman]],{{r|Pullman}} and writing partners [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]].{{r|Stewart}} Some of these works address the developmental and [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] constraints on wheeled creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from [[arthritis|arthritic]] axles,{{r|Brin95}}{{rp|109}} and Pullman's [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]] are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they [[coevolution|coevolved]].{{r|Pullman}}

"'''Selling out'''" is a common idiomatic pejorative expression for the compromising of a person's integrity, morality, [[wikt:authentic|authenticity]], or principles in exchange for personal gain, such as money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=sellout|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sellout|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=21 February 2012|date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of music or art, selling out is associated with attempts to tailor material to a [[mainstream]] or commercial audience. For example, a musician who alters his material to encompass a wider audience, and in turn generates greater revenue, may be labeled by fans who pre-date the change as a "sellout." A sellout also refers to someone who gives up, or disregards, hence the term 'sells' – someone or something – for some other thing or person. The term could also be used as 'sold out' depending on the context.

==In politics==
In political movements a "sellout" is a person or group claiming to adhere to one ideology, only to follow these claims up with actions contradicting them, such as a revolutionary group claiming to fight for a particular cause, but failing to continue this upon obtaining power.

An example of political "selling out" is a political party who has formed a coalition with another party it had historically opposed, such as the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]' leader [[Nick Clegg]]'s coalition with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] in the United Kingdom, during which he reneged on his pledge to oppose any increase in student tuition fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clegg sold out to get power, say voters|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/clegg-sold-out-to-get-power-say-voters-2083293.html|newspaper=Independent|first=Matt|last=Chorley|date=19 September 2010|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/09/lib-dem-clegg-poll-principles|title=Clegg "sold out" for power|first=Sophie|last=Elmhirst|publisher=New Statesman|date=19 September 2010|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music and entertainment==

===Music===
&lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY UNSOURCED CONTENT! NOT LIKING AN ARTISTS LATEST SONG IS SUBJECTIVE, NOT INDICATIVE OF SELLING OUT! --&gt;
There are two distinct forms of "selling out" in terms of music. First, there is the use of the term "sell out" to refer to those who sign for major labels or to those who licence their music to companies for use in advertising&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/30/rocknroll-sellout|title=The great rock'n'roll sellout|first=Dorian|last=Lynskey|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 June 2011|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that contradicts their apparent values. Secondly, the expression can refer to those who sacrifice their musical integrity through a change in their musical sound, sometimes due to pressure from [[Music industry|major labels]]&lt;ref name=InDefense&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyulocal.com/entertainment/2012/03/20/in-defense-of-sell-out-musicians/|title=In Defense of "Sell Out" Musicians|first=Lizzie|last=Azran|publisher=NYU Local|date=20 March 2012|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in order to gain profit by making their music more appealing to a [[mainstream]] audience.

====Record labels and advertising====

Since the time of [[big band]] radio shows there has been an established relationship between musicians and commercialisation. There had been some signs of resistance to this model as early as the 1960s, when gospel group [[The Blind Boys of Alabama]] refused to sign record deals to record secular music.&lt;ref&gt;http://ktep.org/post/clarence-fountain-leader-and-founding-member-blind-boys-alabama-dies-88&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the [[punk subculture]] in the 1970s that the notion that musicians should be completely independent of commercial influences began to increase in popularity.&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cnet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13526_3-20002543-27.html|title=Can bands sell out anymore?|first=Matt|last=Rosoff|publisher=Cnet|date=14 April 2010|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partly manifested itself in the reluctance of bands to sign for major labels, as this would include taking part in activities that were seen as crass and overly commercial.&lt;ref name=Science&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7901003.stm|title=The science of selling out|first=Stephen|last=Dowling|publisher=BBC|date=20 February 2009|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This continued into the 1980s, when bands were scorned by [[fanzines]] for signing with major labels as the mainstream success this would bring was symptomatic of the general decay in culture.&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut /&gt; However, after a number of bands maintained the quality of their records after signing for a major label, by the end of the 1980s the focus on "selling out" shifted to advertising.&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut /&gt;

The attitude held by those who disliked the idea of "selling out" towards advertising was negative; comedian [[Bill Hicks]] claimed that any band who licensed their music for advertising was "off the artistic roll call forever",&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut /&gt;&lt;ref name=Science /&gt; and [[Neil Young]] mocked the fact that songs became associated with brands on his 1988 album ''[[This Note's for You]]''.&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut /&gt; However, although it was possible for fans to feel a sense of betrayal due to the relationship they developed with the song and artist, when artists did allow their music to be used for commercials others considered the advertised product to be more appealing.&lt;ref name=Science /&gt; As CD sales fell and record companies became unwilling or unable to afford the push new bands needed to become established, sponsorship of bands by major companies began to be seen as more acceptable, with even minor record labels devoting time and money towards marketing deals with well-known brands.&lt;ref name=Cnet /&gt;

By the 2010s the use of licensing of artists in commercials had become an accepted part of the music industry, and even those who would previously have been considered part of the 1970s resistance to "selling out" have been used in advertising products, such as former [[Sex Pistols]] frontman [[John Lydon]] advertising Country Life [[butter]] and [[Iggy Pop]] endorsing car insurance.&lt;ref name= Science /&gt; Consequently, it has been suggested&lt;ref name=Cnet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Risk&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monitormix/2009/11/risk_management_can_an_artist.html|title=Risk Management: Can An Artist Sell Out When There Are No Boundaries?|first=Carrie|last=Brownstein|publisher=NPR Music|date=11 November 2009|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the acceptance of music in advertising is generational, as younger listeners are comfortable with the relationship to the point of indifference&lt;ref name=Science /&gt;&lt;ref name=Risk /&gt; whilst those who have seen the industry evolve still reject it.&lt;ref name=Cnet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Science /&gt;

====Musical integrity====
[[File:Metallica 46.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Metallica playing live at Illinois in 2004.]]
Another definition of "selling out" refers to putting aside musical quality or original intentions in favor of commercial success,&lt;ref name=Anti&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antimusic.com/lowdown/05/integrity.shtml|title=The Art of Selling Out: Compromising the Music|first=Trent|last=McMartin|publisher=antimusic|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a distinction is made for those who achieve success without changing their original sound.&lt;ref name=InDefense /&gt; The difference between the two is often subjective.&lt;ref name=Anti /&gt; Whilst artists may change their musical direction for commercial reasons, such as pressure from major labels who require songs to appeal to mass markets,&lt;ref name=InDefense /&gt; a change in sound may also be part of a natural progression of creative maturity.&lt;ref name=Science /&gt;

An example of artists being accused of "selling out" is the band [[Metallica]], whose [[Metallica (album)|1991 eponymous album]] has been considered the turning point in the band's musical direction;&lt;ref name=Review&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/8b8c|title=Metallica (The Black Album) Review|first=Sid|last=Smith|publisher=BBC|date=18 April 2007|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the band members were called the "poster boys for musical un-integrity" after the band attempted to sue fans who were downloading their music through [[Napster]].&lt;ref name=Lulu &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/10/metallicas-lulu-problem-why-dont-they-just-sell-out-again/247295/|title=Metallica's 'Lulu' Problem: Why Don't They Just Sell Out Again?|first=Daniel|last=Snyder|publisher=The Atlantic|date=25 October 2011|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album, known as ''The Black Album'', saw critics&lt;ref name=Review /&gt; and [[Bob Rock]],&lt;ref name=Rock&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/metallicas-black-album-track-by-track-485030#!1|title=Metallica's Black Album track-by-track|first=Joe|last=Bosso|publisher=MusicRadar|date=1 August 2011|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the album’s [[Record producer|producer]], acknowledged that there was a move away from the band's previous sound. Rock claimed that the change stemmed from the band’s desire to "make the leap to the big, big leagues",&lt;ref name=Rock /&gt; whilst some fans blamed Rock himself, going as far to eventually create an internet petition demanding the band cut their ties with him.&lt;ref name=Review /&gt; However, other fans did not consider the change in sound to be significant enough to be considered "selling out,"&lt;ref name=Anti /&gt; and others accepted the change as part of a natural evolution of the band’s style.&lt;ref name=Geeks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2011/08/13/metallica-20th-anniversary-of-the-black-album/|title=Metallica: 20th Anniversary Of The ‘Black Album’|publisher=Geeks of Doom|date=13 August 2011|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately ''The Black Album'' became the band’s most commercially successful release,&lt;ref name=Anti /&gt; going [[Music recording sales certification|16x platinum]].&lt;ref name=Lulu /&gt; The differing reaction by fans to the album demonstrates the difficulty in labelling an artist as a "sellout" objectively.

"[[Poseur]]" is a pejorative term, often used in the [[Punk subculture|punk]], [[Heavy metal subculture|heavy metal]], [[hip hop]], and [[goth subculture|goth]] [[subculture]]s, to describe a person who copies the dress, speech, and/or mannerisms of a group or subculture, generally for attaining acceptability within the group or for popularity among various other groups, yet who is deemed not to share or understand the values or philosophy of the subculture.
 
While this perceived [[wikt:inauthentic|inauthenticity]] is viewed with scorn and contempt by members of the subculture, the definition of the term and to whom it should be applied is subjective. While the term is most associated with the 1970s- and 1980s-era punk and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] subculture, English use of the term originates in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=poseur Definition of poseur] at Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; A hardcore punk band that signed a lucrative contract with a major label would probably be labelled as poseurs.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Film and television===
In film and television "selling out" refers to compromising the content of produced media, primarily for financial reasons; for example, introducing [[product placement]].

Product placement, or embedded marketing, is the placement of brands or products in media in order to advertise,&lt;ref name=Chron&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/concept-embedded-marketing-product-placement-20278.html|title=Concept of Embedded Marketing &amp; Product Placement|first=Neil|last=Kokemuller|publisher=Chron|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been in television from almost the very beginning, but has increased with introduction of devices such as [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]s which allow viewers, and therefore consumers, to fast-forward through adverts.&lt;ref name=tvg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/product-placement-tv-1042607.aspx|title=Product Placement: Is TV Selling Out?|first=Michael|last=Schneider|publisher=TVguide.com|date=31 January 2012|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the idea that product placement is a form of selling out is [[Eurocentrism|Anglocentric]],&lt;ref name=Pisfor&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/p-is-for-product-placement-as-tv-shows-sell-out-to-advertisers-2213863.html|title=P is for product placement as TV shows sell out to advertisers|first=Ian|last=Burrell|publisher=The Independent|date=14 February 2011|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as American television shows such as ''[[American Idol]]'' and ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|Celebrity Apprentice]]'' recorded over 500 examples of brand integration in 2011 according to [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]].&lt;ref name=tvg /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pisfor /&gt;

===Comedy===
[[File:Jesus is coming.. Look Busy (George Carlin).jpg|thumb|right|200px|George Carlin has been accused of being a sellout for appearing in commercials for MCI, a company he had previously criticized.]]
[[Stand-up comedians]] occasionally face accusations of "selling out." Comedians who start out in comedy clubs might often use foul language and [[blue humor]] in their routines. A comic who alters his or her routine by "sugar-coating" his language and using less-offensive material to obtain mainstream success may be accused of "selling out."

[[George Carlin]] was accused of being a "sellout" for appearing in television commercials for [[MCI Inc.|MCI]]'s [[10-10-220]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettingit.com/article/394|title=Gettingit.com: The Happy Pessimist|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530071427/http://www.gettingit.com/article/394|archivedate=30 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shadowculture.com/adman/admn1129.html|title=The adMan - A Knee-Jerk to the Groin of American Advertising|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teevee.org/archive/1999/01/18/index.html|title=1-800-SELL-OUT|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704090058/http://www.teevee.org/archive/1999/01/18/index.html|archivedate=4 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlin had previously spoken of his dislike for MCI's commercials in his 1996 album ''[[Back in Town (George Carlin album)|Back in Town]]''. In his 1999 album ''[[You Are All Diseased]]'', which contains rants against advertising and business, Carlin admits the dichotomy but makes no attempt to explain himself, stating, "You're just gonna have to figure that shit out on your own." In interviews, Carlin revealed he appeared in the advertisements to help pay off a large tax debt to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22917&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bankrate.com/csites/news/investing/20010316a.asp|title=Carlin's got his act together, on stage and off|publisher=[[Bankrate.com]]|author=Getlen, Larry|date=2001-03-16|accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian/actress [[Janeane Garofalo]] has described herself as a "sellout" based on her participation with the TV show ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' playing [[Janis Gold]]. Garofalo initially turned down the role because of the way the show depicted torture scenes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/24/24-its-a-chloejanis-rivalryor-26069.aspx|title=24: It's A Chloe-Janis Rivalry--Or Not, As It Seems|date=February 2, 2009|publisher=Buddy TV|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; however changed her mind later on, saying in an interview, “Being unemployed and being flattered that someone wanted to work with me outweighed my stance [on torture].”&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/arts/television/16twen.html?_r=1|title=Deep Inside the Grim ‘24,’ Two Comics’ Inside Joke|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=February 15, 2009|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garofalo admitted to "selling out" for losing weight in order to gain more acting work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Janeane Garofalo on Botox, Spanx, and the Troubles of Finding Work As a 45-Year-Old Former Slacker Icon&amp;#124;|work=Vulture|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|author=Yuan, Jada|date=2010-02-19|accessdate=2012-11-23|url=http://www.vulture.com/2010/02/janeane_garofalo_on_botox_span.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the term==
An artist may also be accused of "selling out" after changes in artistic direction.  This conclusion is often due to the perception that the reason for the artist changing artistic style or direction was simply potential material gain. This ignores other causes of artistic [[Personal development|development]], which may lead an artist in new directions from those that attracted their original fans.  Artists' improvements in musical skill or change in taste may also account for the change.

Other times, artists (including those with politically oriented messages) resent the term on the grounds that the perceived desire for material gain is simply a result of the band seeking to expand its message. To such artists, ''not'' going mainstream or signing to a bigger label to avoid "selling out" prevents them from addressing a wider audience, regardless of whether or not there is any real artistic change, and arbitrarily hampers the artists' course of mainstream success. Such an accusation, then, assumes that mainstream success must be against the artists' original intentions. For example, when questioned about signing to a major label, [[Rage Against the Machine]] answered "We're not interested in preaching to just the converted. It's great to play abandoned squats run by anarchists, but it's also great to be able to reach people with a revolutionary message, people from [[Granada Hills, Los Angeles|Granada Hills]] to [[Stuttgart]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratm.de/faq/ragefaq.html#1_9|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526032423/http://www.ratm.de/faq/ragefaq.html#1_9|title=Rage Against The Machine Online : F.A.Q.|author=RinO|archivedate=26 May 2006|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when confronted with the accusation of "selling out" in 2001, [[Mike Dirnt]] of [[Green Day]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If there's a formula to selling out, I think every band in the world would be doing it," he said. "The fact that you write good songs and you sell too many of them, if everybody in the world knew how to do that they'd do it. It's not something we chose to do...The fact was we got to a point that we were so big that tons of people were showing up at punk-rock clubs, and some clubs were even getting shut down because too many were showing up. We had to make a decision: either break up or remove ourselves from that element. And I'll be damned if I was going to flip fucking burgers. I do what I do best. Selling out is compromising your musical intention and I don't even know how to do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/archives/2001/jul/20/512106831.html?%22green+day%22 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930031510/http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/archives/2001/jul/20/512106831.html?%22green+day%22 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Semelparity''' and '''iteroparity''' are two classes of possible reproductive strategies available to living organisms.  A species is considered semelparous if it is characterized by a single reproductive episode before death, and iteroparous if it is characterized by multiple reproductive cycles over the course of its lifetime.  Some [[Botany|botanists]] use the parallel terms [[monocarpy]] and [[polycarpy]]. (See also [[plietesials]].)

In truly semelparous species, death after reproduction is part of an overall strategy that includes putting all available resources into maximizing reproduction, at the expense of future life (see "[[#Trade-offs|Trade-offs]]", below). In any iteroparous population there will be some individuals who die between their first and second reproductive episodes, but unless this is part of a syndrome of programmed death after reproduction, this would not be called semelparity.

This distinction is also related to the difference between [[annual plant|annual]] and [[perennial plant|perennial]] plants.  An annual is a plant that completes its life cycle in a single season, and is usually semelparous. Perennials live for more than one season and are usually (but not always) iteroparous.&lt;ref&gt;Gotelli, Nicholas J. (2008). ''A Primer of Ecology.'' Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer Associates, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-87893-318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semelparity and iteroparity are not, strictly speaking, alternative strategies, but extremes along a continuum of possible modes of reproduction. Many organisms considered to be semelparous can, under certain conditions, separate their single bout of reproduction into two or more episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Facultative Second Oviposition as an Adaptation to Egg Loss in a Semelparous Crab Spider|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0310.2005.01126.x/abstract|journal = Ethology|date = 2005-12-01|issn = 1439-0310|pages = 1126–1138|volume = 111|issue = 12|doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.2005.01126.x|first = Kyoko|last = Futami|first2 = Shin-ichi|last2 = Akimoto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Changing reproductive effort within a semelparous reproductive episode|url = http://www.amjbot.org/content/101/8/1323|journal = American Journal of Botany|date = 2014-08-01|issn = 0002-9122|pmid = 25156981|pages = 1323–1331|volume = 101|issue = 8|doi = 10.3732/ajb.1400283|first = P.

==Overview==

===Semelparity===

[[File:Oncorhynchus nerka 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Oncorhynchus|Pacific salmon]] is an example of a semelparous organism]]The word semelparity was coined by evolutionary biologist Lamont Cole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cole|first=Lamont C.|title=The Population Consequences of Life History Phenomena|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=June 1954|volume=29|issue=2|pages=103–137|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2817654?uid=3739920&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102442342007|accessdate=June 22, 2013|doi=10.1086/400074}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comes from the Latin ''semel'' 'once, a single time' and ''pario'' 'to beget'. This differs from&amp;nbsp;iteroparity&amp;nbsp;in that iteroparous species are able to have multiple reproductive cycles and therefore can mate more than once in their lifetime. Semelparity is also known as "big bang" reproduction, since the single reproductive event of semelparous organisms is usually large as well as fatal.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Ricklefs and Gary Leon Miller (1999). ''Ecology.'' Macmillan {{ISBN|0-7167-2829-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A classic example of a semelparous organism is Pacific salmon (''[[Oncorhynchus]]'' spp.), which lives for many years in the ocean before swimming to the freshwater stream of its birth, spawning, and dying. Other semelparous animals include many insects, including some species of butterflies, cicadas, and [[mayfly|mayflies]], many [[arachnids]], and some molluscs such as some species of [[squid]] and [[octopus]].

Semelparity also occurs in [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]] and [[capelin]], but is very rare in vertebrates other than bony fish. In [[amphibian]]s, it is known only among some ''[[Hyla]]'' frogs including the [[Hyla|gladiator frog]];&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, Matle; ''Sexual Selection''; p. 242. {{ISBN|0691000573}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reptiles only a few lizards such as [[Labord's chameleon]] of southwestern [[Madagascar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=2449350 | pmid=18591659 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0802468105 | volume=105 | title=A unique life history among tetrapods: an annual chameleon living mostly as an egg | year=2008 | journal=Proc.

This form of lifestyle is consistent with&amp;nbsp;[[R/K selection theory|r-selected]]&amp;nbsp;strategies as many offspring are produced and there is low parental input, as one or both parents die after mating. All of the male’s energy is diverting into mating and the immune system is repressed. High levels of&amp;nbsp;[[corticosteroid]]s&amp;nbsp;are sustained over long periods of time. This triggers immune and inflammatory system failure and&amp;nbsp;[[Gastrointestinal bleeding|gastrointestinal hemorrhage]], which eventually leads to death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oakwood|first=Meri|last2=Bradley|first2=Adrian J.|last3=Cockburn|first3=Andrew|date=2001-02-22|title=Semelparity in a large marsupial|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/268/1465/407|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=268|issue=1465|pages=407–411|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1369|issn=0962-8452|pmid=11270438|pmc=1088621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iteroparity===

[[File:Sow with piglet.jpg|thumb| An iteroparous organism is one that can undergo many reproductive events throughout its lifetime. The [[pig]] is an example of an iteroparous organism]]The term iteroparity comes from the Latin ''itero'', to repeat, and ''pario'', to beget.  An example of an iteroparous organism is a human—though people may choose to have only one child (or even none), humans are biologically capable of having offspring many times over the course of their lives.

Iteroparous vertebrates include all birds, most reptiles, virtually all mammals, and most fish. Among invertebrates, most mollusca and many insects (for example, mosquitoes and cockroaches) are iteroparous.  Most perennial plants are iteroparous.

==Models==

===Trade-offs===
It is a biological precept that within its lifetime an organism has a limited amount of energy/resources available to it, and must always partition it among various functions such as collecting food and finding a mate.  Of relevance here is the trade-off between [[fecundity]], growth, and survivorship in its [[life history theory|life history]] strategy. These trade-offs come into play in the evolution of iteroparity and semelparity.  It has been repeatedly demonstrated that semelparous species produce more offspring in their single fatal reproductive episode than do closely related iteroparous species in any one of theirs.  However, the opportunity to reproduce more than once in a lifetime, and possibly with greater care for the development of offspring produced, can offset this strictly numerical benefit.

===Models based on non-linear trade-offs===

[[File:reproductive effort iteroparous.svg|thumb|right|Iteroparous reproductive effort]]
One class of models that tries to explain the differential evolution of semelparity and iteroparity examines the shape of the trade-off between offspring produced and offspring forgone.  In [[economic]] terms, offspring produced is equivalent to a [[cost-benefit analysis|benefit]] function, while offspring forgone is comparable to a [[cost]] function.  The reproductive effort of an organism—the proportion of energy that it puts into reproducing, as opposed to growth or survivorship—occurs at the point where the distance between offspring produced and offspring forgone is the greatest.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Moorcroft, "Life History Strategies" (lecture, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 9 February 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  The accompanying graph shows the offspring-produced and offspring-forgone curves for an iteroparous organism:  
[[File:reproductive effort semelparous.jpg|thumb|right|Semelparous reproductive effort]]

In the first graph, the [[marginal cost]] of offspring produced is decreasing (each additional offspring is less "expensive" than the average of all previous offspring) and the marginal cost of offspring forgone is increasing.  In this situation, the organism only devotes a portion of its resources to reproduction, and uses the rest of its resources on growth and survivorship so that it can reproduce again in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Roff, Derek A. (1992). ''The Evolution of Life Histories''. Springer {{ISBN|0-412-02391-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is also possible (second graph) for the marginal cost of offspring produced to ''increase'', and for the marginal cost of offspring forgone to decrease.  When this is the case, it is favorable for the organism to reproduce a single time. The organism devotes all of its resources to that one episode of reproduction, so it then dies. This mathematical/graphical model has found only limited quantitative support from nature.

===Bet-hedging models===
A second set of models examines the possibility that iteroparity is a [[Bet-hedging (biology)|hedge]] against unpredictable juvenile survivorship (avoiding putting all one's eggs in one basket).  Again, mathematical models have not found empirical support from real-world systems.  In fact, many semelparous species live in habitats characterized by high (not low) environmental unpredictability, such as deserts and early successional habitats.

===Cole's paradox and demographic models===

The models that have the strongest support from living systems are demographic. In Lamont Cole's classic 1954 paper, he came to the conclusion that: {{Quote|For an annual species, the absolute gain in intrinsic population growth which could be achieved by changing to the perennial reproductive habit would be exactly equivalent to adding one individual to the average litter size.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont C. Cole. "The Population Consequences of Life History Phenomena." ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'' 29, no. 2 (June 1954): 103-137&lt;/ref&gt;}}
For example, imagine two species—an iteroparous species that has annual litters averaging three offspring each, and a semelparous species that has one litter of four, and then dies.  These two species have the same rate of population growth, which suggests that even a tiny fecundity advantage of one additional offspring would favor the evolution of semelparity. This is known as Cole's paradox.

In his analysis, Cole assumed that there was no mortality of individuals of the iteroparous species, even seedlings. Twenty years later, Charnov and Schaffer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charnov | first1 = E.L. | last2 = Schaffer | first2 = W.M. | year = 1973 | title = Life history consequences of natural selection: Cole's result revisited | url = http://repository.unm.edu/bitstream/1928/1696/2/AN1973.pdf| journal = American Naturalist | volume = 107 | issue = | pages = 791–793 | doi=10.1086/282877}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that reasonable differences in adult and juvenile mortality yield much more reasonable costs of semelparity, essentially solving Cole's paradox.  An even more general demographic model was produced by Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = T.P. | year = 1981 | title = A general model of comparative fecundity for semelparous and iteroparous life histories | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 118 | issue = | pages = 27–36 | doi=10.1086/283798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These demographic models have been more successful than the other models when tested with real-world systems. It has been shown that semelparous species have higher expected adult mortality, making it more economical to put all reproductive effort into the first (and therefore final) reproductive episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = T.P. | year = 1990 | title = The evolution of semelparity in Mount Kenya lobelias | url = | journal = Evolutionary Ecology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 157–171 | doi=10.1007/bf02270913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lesica | first1 = P. | last2 = Young | first2 = T.P. | year = 2005 | title = Demographic model explains life history evolution in Arabis fecunda | url = | journal = Functional Ecology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 471–477 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2005.00972.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Small Dasyuridae =====

[[File:Phascogale calura close.jpg|thumb|''Phascogale calura'']]
Semelparous species of [[Dasyuridae]] are typically small and carnivorous, with the exception of the northern quoll (''[[Northern quoll|Dasyurus hallucatus]]''), which is large. Species with this reproductive strategy include members of the genus&amp;nbsp;''[[Antechinus]],&amp;nbsp;[[Brush-tailed phascogale|Phascogale tapoatafa]]''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''[[Red-tailed phascogale|Phascogale culura]]''. The males of all three groups exhibit similar characteristics that classify them as semelparous. First, all of the males of each species disappear immediately after the mating season. Also, males that are captured and isolated from others live for 2 to 3 years.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woolley|first=Patricia|date=1966-01-01|title=Reproduction in Antechinus spp. and other Dasyurid marsupials|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282331976_Reproduction_in_Antechinus_spp_and_other_Dasyurid_marsupials|journal=Symposia of the Zoological Society of London|volume=15|pages=281–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; If these captured males are allowed to mate, they die immediately after the mating season, like those in the wild. Their behavior also changes drastically before and after the mating season. Before mating, males are extremely aggressive and will fight with other males if placed close together. Males that are captured before they are allowed to mate remain aggressive through the winter months. After the mating season, if allowed to mate, males become extremely lethargic and never regain their aggressiveness even if they survive to the next mating season.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other changes that occur post-mating include fur degradation and testicular degeneration. During adolescence, male fur is thick and becomes dull and thin after mating, but regains its original condition if the individual manages to survive past the mating season. The fur on the scrotum completely falls off and does not grow back, even if the male survives months after the first mating season. As the marsupial ages, its testicles grow until they reach a peak size and weight at the beginning of the mating season. After the individual mates, the weight and size of the testes and scrotum decrease. They remain small and do not produce&amp;nbsp;[[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]]&amp;nbsp;later in life, if maintained in a laboratory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The 1966 Woolley study on&amp;nbsp;''Antechinus spp.''&amp;nbsp;noticed that males were only able to be maintained past mating in the laboratory and no senile males were found in the wild, suggesting that all males die shortly after mating.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===== Corticosteroid concentration and increased male mortality =====

[[File:Antechinus stuartii.jpg|thumb|''Antechinus stuartii'']]
Studies on&amp;nbsp;''[[Brown antechinus|Antechinus stuartii]]''&amp;nbsp;reveal that male mortality is highly correlated to stress and&amp;nbsp;[[Adrenocortical hormone|andrenocortica]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l activity. The study measured the&amp;nbsp;[[corticosteroid]]&amp;nbsp;concentration in males in the wild, males injected with cortisol, males injected with saline, and females in the wild. While both males and females exhibit high levels of corticosteroid concentration in the wild, this proves fatal only to males due to females having a higher maximum high affinity corticosteroid binding capacity (MCBC).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=A.J.|last2=McDonald|first2=I.R.|last3=Lee|first3=A.K.|title=Stress and mortality in a small marsupial (Antechinus stuartii, Macleay)|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0016-6480(80)90122-7|journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=188–200|doi=10.1016/0016-6480(80)90122-7|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, free corticosteroid in the&amp;nbsp;[[Blood plasma|plasma]]&amp;nbsp;of male&amp;nbsp;''A. stuartii''&amp;nbsp;rises sharply, while it remains constant in females. High levels of free corticosteroid, resulting from mating in wild males and injected cortisol in laboratory males, resulted in&amp;nbsp;[[Peptic ulcer disease|stomach ulcers]],&amp;nbsp;[[Gastrointestinal bleeding|gastrointestinal hemorrhaging]], and&amp;nbsp;[[liver abscess]]es, all of which increased mortality. These side effects were not found in the males that were injected with saline,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; strengthening the hypothesis that high free corticosteroids results in higher morality in male&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurids''. A similar study on&amp;nbsp;''Phascogale calura''&amp;nbsp;showed that similar&amp;nbsp;[[endocrine system]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;changes happen in&amp;nbsp;''P. calura''&amp;nbsp;as&amp;nbsp;''A. stuartii''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=A. J.|date=July 1987|title=Stress and mortality in the red-tailed phascogale, Phascogale calura (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae)|journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology|volume=67|issue=1|pages=85–100|issn=0016-6480|pmid=3623073|doi=10.1016/0016-6480(87)90208-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports stress-induced mortality as a characteristic of small&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurid''&amp;nbsp;semelparity.

===== Large Dasyuridae =====

[[File:Dasyurus hallucatus -Queensland-8.jpg|thumb|''Dasyurus hallucatus'']]
''[[Northern quoll|Dasyurus hallucatus]]'', or the northern quoll, is a large&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurid''&amp;nbsp;and exhibits increased male mortality after the mating season. Unlike smaller&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurids'', male die-off in&amp;nbsp;''D. hallucatus''&amp;nbsp;is not due to endocrine system changes and there was no&amp;nbsp;[[Spermatogenesis|spermatogenic failure]]&amp;nbsp;after the mating season ended.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If male&amp;nbsp;''D. hallucatus''&amp;nbsp;survive past their first mating season, they may be able to engage in a second mating season. While the individuals in a 2001 study mostly died from vehicles or predation, researchers found evidence of physiological degradation in males, similar to the physiological degradation in small&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurids.''&amp;nbsp;This includes fur loss, parasite infestations, and weight loss. As the mating period went on, males became increasingly&amp;nbsp;[[Anemia|anemic]], but the anemia was not due to&amp;nbsp;[[ulcer]]ation&amp;nbsp;or gastrointestinal bleeding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lack of elevated cortisol levels during mating periods in&amp;nbsp;''D. hallucatus''&amp;nbsp;means that there is no current universal explanation for the mechanism behind increased male mortality in&amp;nbsp;''Dasyuridae.''&amp;nbsp;Post-reproductive [[senescence]]&amp;nbsp;has also been proposed as an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Cockburn, A. "Living slow and dying young: senescence in marsupials."&amp;nbsp;''Marsupial Biology: Recent Research, New Perspectives.

The [[Marmosa|mouse opossum]] exhibits a semelparous reproductive strategy in males and females. Males disappear from their&amp;nbsp;[[Endemism|endemic area]]&amp;nbsp;after the reproductive season (February–May). Males found months later (June–August) are of lighter body weight and the molar teeth are less worn down, suggesting these males belong to a different generation. There is a drop off in the female population, but during the months of July and August, evidence of a gap between generations like the male gap. There is also lower body weight and less molar wear observed in females found after August. This is further supported by the evidence that females that reproduce are not observed the following year.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lucia, Maria. "Annual age structure and reproductive patterns in Marmosa incana (Lund, 1841)(Didelphidae, Marsupialia)." (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; This species has been compared to a similarly related species&amp;nbsp;''[[Robinson's mouse opossum|Marmosa robinsoni]]''&amp;nbsp;and like&amp;nbsp;''M. incana''&amp;nbsp;in order to answer what would happen if a female that has reproduced were to survive to the next mating season.&amp;nbsp;''M. robinsoni''&amp;nbsp;has a&amp;nbsp;[[Estrous cycle|monoestrus]]&amp;nbsp;reproductive cycle, like&amp;nbsp;''M. incana'', and females are no longer fertile after 17 months so it is unlikely that females that survive past the drop off in female populations would be able to reproduce a second time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Other mouse opossums

''[[Brazilian gracile opossum|Gracilinanus microtarsus]]'', or the Brazilian gracile opossum, is considered to be partially semelparous because male mortality increases significantly after the mating season, but some males survive to mate again in the next reproductive cycle. The males also exhibit similar physiological degradation demonstrated in&amp;nbsp;''Antechinus''and other semelparous&amp;nbsp;[[marsupial]]s&amp;nbsp;such as fur loss and increase of infection from parasites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martins|first=Eduardo G.|last2=Bonato|first2=Vinícius|last3=da-Silva|first3=Cibele Q.|last4=Reis|first4=Dos|last5=F|first5=Sérgio|date=2006-10-17|title=Partial Semelparity in the Neotropical Didelphid Marsupial Gracilinanus microtarsus|url=https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/87/5/915/900694|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=87|issue=5|pages=915–920|doi=10.1644/05-mamm-a-403r1.1|issn=0022-2372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pacific salmon ====
Highly elevated cortisol levels mediate the post-spawning death of semelparous ''[[Oncorhynchus]]'' Pacific salmon by causing tissue degeneration, suppressing the immune system, and impairing various homeostatic mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-629060-8.50017-5|title=SALMONIDS AND ANNUAL FISHES: DEATH AFTER SEX|last=Dickhoff|first=Walton W.|pages=253–266|language=en|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-629060-8.50017-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After swimming for such a long distance, salmon expend all of their energy on reproduction. One of the key factors in salmon rapid [[senescence]] is that these fish do not feed during reproduction so body weight is extremely reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morbey|first=Yolanda E.|last2=Brassil|first2=Chad E.|last3=Hendry|first3=Andrew P.|title=Rapid Senescence in Pacific Salmon|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/full/10.1086/491720|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=166|issue=5|pages=556–568|doi=10.1086/491720|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to physiological degradation, pacific salmon become more lethargic as mating goes on, which makes some individuals more susceptible to predation because they have less energy to avoid predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gende|first=Scott M.|last2=Quinn|first2=Thomas P.|last3=Hilborn|first3=Ray|last4=Hendry|first4=Andrew P.|last5=Dickerson|first5=Bobette|date=2004-03-01|title=Brown bears selectively kill salmon with higher energy content but only in habitats that facilitate choice|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12762.x/abstract|journal=Oikos|language=en|volume=104|issue=3|pages=518–528|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12762.x|issn=1600-0706}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also increases mortality rates of adults post-mating.

=== Semelparity in insects ===
[[File:Gypsy Moth (35955436354).jpg|thumb|Gypsy Moth]]
Traditionally,&amp;nbsp;semelparity was usually defined within the time frame of a year. Critics of this criterion note that this scale is inappropriate in discussing patterns of insect reproduction because many insects breed more than once within one annual period, but generation times of less than one year. Under the traditional definition, insects are considered semelparous as a consequence of time scale rather than the distribution of reproductive effort over their adult life span.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fritz|first=Robert S.|last2=Stamp|first2=Nancy E.|last3=Halverson|first3=Timothy G.|date=1982|title=Iteroparity and Semelparity in Insects|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=120|issue=2|pages=264–268|doi=10.1086/283987|jstor=2461222}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to resolve this inconsistency, Fritz ''et. al'' define semelparous insects as "Insects that lay a single [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch of eggs]] in their lifetime and deposit them at one place are clearly semelparous or big bang reproducers. Their entire reproductive effort is committed at one time and they die shortly after [[Oviparity|oviposition]]".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Semelparous insects are found in [[Lepidoptera]], [[Mayfly|Ephemeroptera]], [[Earwig|Dermaptera]], [[Plecoptera]], [[Strepsiptera]], [[Caddisfly|Trichoptera]], and [[Homoptera]].

==== Examples in Lepidoptera ====
Females of certain families of Lepidoptera, like the [[Lymantria dispar|Gypsy Moth]] of ''[[Bagworm moth|Psychidae]],'' have reduced mobility or [[Aptery|apterous]] so the insects' dispersal is in the larval stage, as opposed to in the adult stage. In iteroparous insects, major dispersal occurs in the adult stage. All semelparous Lepidopterans share similar characteristics: Larva only feed in restricted periods of the year because of the nutritional state of their host plants (as a result, they are [[univoltine]]), initial food supply is predictably abundant, and larval host plants are abundant and adjacent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Death most commonly occurs by starvation. In the case of the gypsy moth, adults do not possess an active digestive system and cannot feed, but can drink moisture. Mating occurs fairly rapidly after adults emerge from their [[pupa]]l form and, without a way to digest food, the adult moths die after about a week.&lt;ref&gt;The Gypsy Moth: Research Toward Integrated Pest Management, United States Department of Agriculture, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary advantages to semelparity ==

=== Current evolutionary advantages hypothesis ===
[[File:Agile Antechinus (Antechinus agilis) showing offspring inside.jpg|thumb|''Antechinus agilis'' showing offspring inside pouch]]
The evolution for semelparity in both sexes has occurred many times in plants, invertebrates, and fish. It is rare in mammals because mammals have obligate maternal care due to&amp;nbsp;[[internal fertilization]]&amp;nbsp;and incubation of offspring and nursing young after birth, which requires high maternal survival rate after fertilization and offspring&amp;nbsp;[[weaning]]. Also, female mammals have relatively low reproductive rate compared to invertebrates or fish because they invest a lot of energy in maternal care. However, male reproductive rate is much less constrained in mammals because only females bear young. Males that die after one mating season can still produce a large number of offspring if he invests all of his energy in intense matings with many females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Diana O.|last2=Dickman|first2=Christopher R.|last3=Jones|first3=Menna E.|last4=Blomberg|first4=Simon P.|date=2013-10-29|title=Sperm competition drives the evolution of suicidal reproduction in mammals|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/44/17910|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=110|issue=44|pages=17910–17914|doi=10.1073/pnas.1310691110|issn=0027-8424|pmid=24101455|pmc=3816400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evolution in mammals ====
Scientists have hypothesized that natural selection has allowed semelparity to evolved in&amp;nbsp;''Dasyuridae''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''Didelphidae''&amp;nbsp;because of certain ecological constraints. Female mammals ancestral to this these groups may have shortened their mating period to coincide with peak prey abundance. Because this window is so small, the females of these species exhibit a reproduction pattern where the&amp;nbsp;[[Estrous cycle|estrous]]&amp;nbsp;of all females occurs simultaneously. Selection would then favor aggressive males due to increased competition between males for access to females. Since the mating period is so short, it is more beneficial for males to expend all their energy on mating, even more so if they are unlikely to survive to the next mating season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braithwaite|first=Richard W.|last2=Lee|first2=Anthony K.|date=1979|title=A Mammalian Example of Semelparity|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=113|issue=1|pages=151–155|doi=10.1086/283372|jstor=2459950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evolution in fish ====
[[File:Dead salmon in spawning season.jpg|thumb|Dead salmon after spawning]]
Reproduction is costly for [[Fish migration|anadromous]] [[Salmonidae|salmonids]] because their life history requires transition from saltwater to freshwater streams and long migrations, which can be physiologically taxing. The transition between cold oceanic water to warm freshwater and steep elevation changes in Northern Paciﬁc rivers could explain the evolution of semelparity because it would be extremely difficult to return to the ocean. A noticeable difference between semelparous fish and iteroparous salmonids is that egg size varies between the two types of reproductive strategies. Studies show that egg size is also affected by migration and body size. Egg number, however shows little variation between semelparous and iteroparous populations or between resident and anadromous populations for females of the same body size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=HUL Access/2.0|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/ele.12607/abstract|doi=10.1111/ele.12607}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current hypothesis behind this reason is that iteroparous species reduce the size of their eggs in order to improve the mother's chances survival, since she invests less energy in gamete formation. Semelparous species do not expect to live past one mating season, so females invest a lot more energy in gamete formation resulting in large eggs. Anadromous salmonids may also have evolved semelparity to boost the nutrition density of the [[Spawn (biology)|spawning grounds]]. The most productive Pacific salmon spawning grounds contain the most carcasses of spawned adults. The dead bodies of the adult salmon decompose and provide nitrogen and phosphorus for [[algae]] to grow in the nutrient-poor water. [[Zooplankton]] then feed on the algae, and newly-hatched salmon feed on the zooplankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-0677-4_7|title=Freshwaters of Alaska|last=Kline|first=Thomas C.|last2=Goering|first2=John J.|last3=Piorkowski|first3=Robert J.|date=1997|publisher=Springer, New York, NY|isbn=9781461268666|series=Ecological Studies|pages=179–204|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0677-4_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earwig guarding eggs.jpg|thumb|Earwig guarding eggs]]
An interesting trait has evolved in semelparous insects, especially in those that have evolved from [[Parasitism|parasitic]] ancestors, like in all subsocial and [[Eusocial insect|eusocial]] [[Aculeata|aculeate]] [[Hymenoptera]]. This is because larvae are morphologically specialized for development within a host's innards and thus are entirely helpless outside of that environment. Females would need to invest a lot of energy in protecting their eggs and hatched offspring. They do this through such behaviors as egg guarding. Mothers that actively defend offspring, for example, risk injury or death by doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TALLAMY|first=DOUGLAS W.|last2=BROWN|first2=WILLIAM P.|title=Semelparity and the evolution of maternal care in insects|url=https://doi.org/10.1006/anbe.1998.1008|journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=57|issue=3|pages=727–730|doi=10.1006/anbe.1998.1008|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not beneficial in an iteroparous species because the female risks dying and not reaching her full reproductive potential by not being able to reproduce in all reproductive periods in her lifetime. Since semelparous insects only live for one reproductive cycle, they can afford to expend energy on maternal care because those offspring are her only offspring. An iteroparous insect does not need to expend energy on the eggs of one mating period because it is likely that she will mate again. There is ongoing research in maternal care in semelparous insects from lineages not descended from parasites to further understand this relationship between semelparity and maternal care.

'''Social alienation''' is "a condition in social relationships reflected by a low degree of [[social interaction|integration]] or [[Value (ethics)|common values]] and a high degree of distance or [[social isolation|isolation]] between individuals, or between an individual and a group of people in a community or work environment".&lt;ref name="robertankony.net"&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officers' Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement", ''Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management'', vol. 22, no. 2 (1999): 120–32. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/impact-perceived]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[sociology|sociological]] concept developed by several classical and contemporary theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Esp., [[Emile Durkheim]], 1951, 1984; [[Erich Fromm]], 1941, 1955; [[Karl Marx]], 1846, 1867; [[Georg Simmel]], 1950, 1971; Melvin Seeman, 1959; Kalekin-Fishman, 1998, and Robert Ankony, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has many discipline-specific uses, and can refer both to a personal psychological state (subjectively) and to a type of social relationship (objectively).

==History==
The term ''alienation'' has been used over the ages with varied and sometimes contradictory meanings. In ancient history it could mean a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] sense of achieving a higher state of [[contemplation]], [[Ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstasy]] or union—becoming alienated from a limited existence in the world, in a positive sense. Examples of this usage have been traced to [[neoplatonic]] philosophers such as [[Plotinus]] (in the Greek ''alloiosis''). There have also long been religious concepts of being separated or cut off from God and the faithful, alienated in a negative sense. The [[New Testament]] mentions the term ''apallotrioomai'' in Greek—"being alienated from". Ideas of estrangement from a [[Golden Age]], or due to a [[fall of man]], or approximate equivalents in differing [[cultures]] or [[religions]], have also been described as concepts of alienation. A double positive and negative sense of alienation is broadly shown in the spiritual beliefs referred to as [[Gnosticism]].

Alienation has also had a particular [[legal]]-[[political]] meaning since at least [[Ancient Roman]] times, where to [[Alienation (property law)|alienate]] property (''alienato'') is to transfer [[ownership]] of it to someone else. The term alienation itself comes from the [[Latin]] ''alienus'' which meant 'of another place or person', which in turn came from ''alius'', meaning "other" or "another". An alienus in ancient Roman times could refer to someone else's slave. Another usage of the term in Ancient Greco-Roman times was by [[physicians]] referring to disturbed, difficult or abnormal states of mind, generally attributed to imbalanced [[physiology]]. In Latin ''alienatio mentis'' (mental alienation), this usage has been dated to [[Asclepiades of Bithynia|Asclepiades]].&lt;ref&gt;E Regis (1895) [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL14035276M/A_practical_manual_of_mental_medicine A practical manual of mental medicine] 2nd ed., thoroughly rev. and largely rewritten. by E. Régis; with a preface by [[Benjamin Ball (physician)|M. Benjamin Ball]]; authorized translation by H.M. Bannister; with introduction by the author. Published 1895 by Blakiston in Philadelphia. Originally bound and printed by 'the insane' of [[Utica Psychiatric Center|Utica asylum]]&lt;/ref&gt; Once translations of such works had resurfaced in the West in the 17th century, physicians again began using the term, which is typically attributed to [[Felix Platter]].

In [[medieval]] times, a relationship between alienation and [[social order]] has been described, mediated in part by [[mysticism]] and [[monasticism]]. The [[Crusades]] and [[witch-hunts]] have been described as forms of mass alienation.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhart B. Ladner (1967), "Homo Viator: Mediaeval Ideas on Alienation and Order," Speculum, Vol. 42, No. 2, pp. 233–259 (stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/pss/2854675)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 17th century &lt;!--Linked from 'Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel'--&gt;===
In the 17th century, [[Hugo Grotius]] put forward the concept that everyone has '[[Sovereignty|sovereign]] authority' over themselves but that they could alienate that natural right to the common good, an early [[social contract]] theory. In the 18th century, [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Hutcheson]] introduced a distinction between [[Natural and legal rights|alienable and unalienable rights]] in the legal sense of the term. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] published influential works on the same theme, and is also seen as having popularized a more psychological-social concept relating to alienation from a [[state of nature]] due to the expansion of [[civil society]] or the [[nation state]].

In the same century a law of [[alienation of affection]] was introduced for men to seek compensation from other men accused of taking away 'their' woman.

In the history of literature, the [[German Romantics]] appear to be the first group of writers and poets in whose work the concept of alienation is regularly found.&lt;ref&gt;Rado Pribic (2008) [http://dspace.lafayette.edu/handle/10385/660 Alienation, Irony, and German Romanticism], Lafayette College, Easton, PA&lt;/ref&gt; Around the start of the 19th century, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] popularized a Christian ([[Lutheran]]) and [[Idealist]] philosophy of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (1998): [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/alienation/v-1 "Alienation".]&lt;/ref&gt; He used German terms in partially different senses, referring to a psychological state and an objective process, and in general posited that the [[self]] was an historical and social creation, which becomes alienated from itself via a perceived [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] world, but can become de-alienated again when that world is seen as just another aspect of the self-consciousness, which may be achieved by self-sacrifice to the common good.

Around the same time, [[Philippe Pinel|Pinel]] was popularizing a new understanding of mental alienation, particularly through his 'medical-philosophical treatise'. He argued that people could be disturbed (alienated) by emotional states and social conditions, without necessarily having lost (become alienated from) their reason, as had generally been assumed. Hegel praised Pinel for his '[[moral treatment]]' approach, and developed related theories.&lt;ref&gt;Dora B. Weiner [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft638nb3db&amp;chunk.id=d0e13621&amp;toc.id=d0e13621&amp;brand=ucpress Nine: Mind and Body in the Clinic] in Rousseau, G.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gs5PRR9-8BcC Madness and Civilization], 1964/2001, p. 209. Also known (unabridged) as [https://books.google.com/books?id=B5Pyfip2P1gC History of Madness] 1961/2006, p. 372. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two camps formed following Hegel, the [[Young Hegelians|'young' or 'left' Hegelians]] who developed his philosophy to support innovations in politics or religion, and the [[Right Hegelians|'old' or 'right' Hegelians]] who took his philosophy in a politically and religiously conservative direction. The former camp has had a more lasting influence and, among them, [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]] differed from Hegel in arguing that worship of God is itself a form of alienation, because it projects human qualities on to an external idea, rather than realising them as part of the self.

===Marx===
{{Main|Marx's theory of alienation}}
Marx was initially in the Young Hegelian camp and, like Feuerbach, rejected the spiritual basis, and adapted Hegel's [[dialectic]] model to a theory of [[historical materialism|(historical) materialism]]. [[Marx's theory of alienation]] is articulated most clearly in the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'' and ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1846). The [[Young Marx|'young' Marx]] wrote more often and directly of alienation than the 'mature' Marx, which some regard as an ideological break while others maintain that the concept remained central. There is generally held to be a transition from a philosophical-[[anthropological]] ([[Marxist humanism]]) concept (e.g. internal alienation from the self) to a [[structural]]-historical interpretation (e.g. external alienation by appropriation of labor), accompanied by a change in terminology from alienation to [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] to [[commodity fetishism]] and [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]].&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Vandenberghe [https://books.google.com/books?id=cEpXcGXP274C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Philosophical History of German Sociology] Chapter One: Karl Marx: critique of the triple inversion of subject and objects: alienation, exploitation, and commodity fetishism. 2009, translated from the French&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's concepts of alienation have been classed into four types by [[Kostas Axelos]]: economic and social alienation, political alienation, human alienation, and ideological alienation.&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the concept's most prominent use, it refers to the ''economic and social alienation'' aspect in which workers are disconnected from what they produce and why they produce. Marx believed that alienation is a systematic result of [[capitalism]]. Essentially, there is an "exploitation of men by men" where the division of labor creates an economic hierarchy (Axelos, 1976: 58). His theory of alienation was based upon his observation that in emerging [[industry|industrial]] production under capitalism, workers inevitably lose control of their lives and selves by not having any control of their work. Workers never become autonomous, self-realized human beings in any significant sense, except in the way the bourgeoisie wants the worker to be realized. His theory relies on Feuerbach's ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841), which argues that the idea of God has alienated the characteristics of the [[human being]]. [[Max Stirner|Stirner]] would take the analysis further in ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (1844), declaring that even 'humanity' is an alienating ideal for the individual, to which Marx and Engels responded in ''The German Ideology'' (1845). Alienation in capitalist societies occurs because in [[labour (economics)|work]] each contributes to the common wealth but they can only express this fundamentally social aspect of individuality through a production system that is not publicly social but privately owned, for which each individual functions as an instrument, not as a social being. Kostas Axelos summarizes that for Marx, in capitalism "work renders man an alien to himself and to his own products." "The malaise of this alienation from the self means that the worker does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy....The worker only feels himself outside his work, and in his work he feels outside himself....Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, it is avoided like the plague.".&lt;ref&gt;Marx-Engels, in Zeitin, 1968:87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Purdue, William D., ''Sociological Theory: Explanation, Paradigm, and Ideology'', Mayfield Publishing Co., Palo Alto, CA, 1986:325&lt;/ref&gt; Marx also wrote, in a curtailed manner, that capitalist owners also experience alienation, through benefiting from the economic machine by endlessly competing, exploiting others and maintaining mass alienation in society.&lt;ref&gt;Bertell Ollman (1976) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8Ac4AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Alienation: Marx's Conception of Man in Capitalist Society] Chapter 23: The Capitalist's Alienation. Cambridge U.P., 1971; 2nd ed., 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of ''Political Alienation'' refers to the idea that "politics is the form that organizes the productive forces of the economy" in a way that is alienating because it "distorts the logic of economic development".&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 87)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Human Alienation'', individuals become estranged to themselves in the quest to stay alive, where "they lose their true existence in the struggle for subsistence" (Axelos, 1976: 111). Marx focuses on two aspects of human nature which he calls "historical conditions." The first aspect refers to the necessity of food, clothes, shelter, and more. Secondly, Marx believes that after satisfying these basic needs people have the tendency to develop more "needs" or desires that they will work towards satisfying, hence, humans become stuck in a cycle of never ending wants which makes them strangers to each other.&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 113)&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to ''ideological alienation'', Axelos proposes that Marx believes that all religions divert people away from "their true happiness" and instead turn them towards "illusory happiness".&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 161-162)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a commonly noted problem of translation in grappling with ideas of alienation derived from German-language philosophical texts: the word ''alienation'', and similar words such as ''estrangement'', are often used interchangeably to translate two distinct German words, ''[[:de:Entfremdung|Entfremdung]]'' and ''[[:de:Entäußerung|Entäußerung]]''. The former means specifically interpersonal estrangement, while the latter can have a broader and more active meaning that might refer also to externalization, relinquishment, or sale (alienation) of property. In general, and contrary to his predecessors, Marx may have used the terms interchangeably, though he also wrote "''Entfremdung''...constitutes the real interest of this ''Entäußerung''."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Arthur (1986), ''The Dialectics of Labor'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1986), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 1800s to 1900s===
Many sociologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were concerned about alienating effects of modernization. German sociologists [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] wrote critical works on [[individualism|individualization]] and [[urbanization]]. Simmel's ''[[The Philosophy of Money]]'' describes how relationships become more and more mediated by money. Tönnies' ''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]]'' (''Community and Society'') is about the loss of primary relationships such as [[family|familial]] bonds in favour of [[Objective (goal)|goal]]-oriented, secondary [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. This idea of alienation can be observed in some other contexts, although the term may not be as frequently used. In the context of an individual's relationships within society, alienation can mean the unresponsiveness of society as a whole to the individuality of each member of the society. When collective decisions are made, it is usually impossible for the unique needs of each person to be taken into account.

The American sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] conducted a major study of alienation in modern society with ''[[White Collar: The American Middle Classes|White Collar]]'' in 1951, describing how modern consumption-capitalism has shaped a society where you have to sell your personality in addition to your work. Melvin Seeman was part of a surge in alienation research during the mid-20th century when he published his paper, "On the Meaning of Alienation", in 1959 (Senekal, 2010b: 7–8).  Seeman used the insights of Marx, Emile Durkheim and others to construct what is often considered a model to recognize the five prominent features of alienation: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation and self-estrangement (Seeman, 1959).&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officer's Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement," ''Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management,'' vol. 22, no.2 (1999): 120-32. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/impact-perceived]&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeman later added a sixth element (cultural estrangement), although this element does not feature prominently in later discussions of his work.

In a broader [[philosophy|philosophical]] context, especially in [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], alienation describes the inadequacy of the human [[being]] (or the [[mind]]) in relation to the world. The human mind (as the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] who perceives) sees the world as an object of perception, and is distanced from the world, rather than living within it. This line of thought is generally traced to the works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in the 19th century, who, from a Christian viewpoint, saw alienation as separation from God, and also examined the [[emotion]]s and [[feeling]]s of individuals when faced with life choices. Many [[20th-century philosophy|20th-century philosophers]] (both theistic and atheistic) and theologians were influenced by [[Kierkegaard]]'s notions of angst, despair and the importance of the individual. [[Martin Heidegger]]'s concepts of anxiety (angst) and mortality drew from Kierkegaard; he is indebted to the way Kierkegaard lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence and the importance of passionately affirming one's being-in-the-world. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] described the "thing-in-itself" which is infinite and overflowing, and claimed that any attempt to describe or understand the thing-in-itself is "reflective consciousness". Since there is no way for the reflective consciousness to subsume the pre-reflective, Sartre argued that all reflection is fated to a form of anxiety (i.e. the [[human condition]]). As well, Sartre argued that when a person tries to gain knowledge of the "Other"  (meaning beings or objects that are not the self), their [[self-consciousness]] has a "masochistic desire" to be limited. This is expressed metaphorically in the line from the play ''[[No Exit]]'', "Hell is other people".

In the theory of [[psychoanalysis]] developed around the start of the 20th century, [[Sigmund Freud]] did not explicitly address the concept of alienation, but other analysts subsequently have. It is a theory of divisions and conflicts between the conscious and [[unconscious mind]], between different parts of a hypothetical [[psychic apparatus]], and between the self and [[civilization]]. It postulates [[defense mechanisms]], including [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]], in both normal and disturbed functioning. The concept of [[Psychological repression|repression]] has been described as having functionally equivalent effects as the idea of [[false consciousness]] associated with Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Felix Geyer]] (2001) [http://www.unizar.es/sociocybernetics/chen/felix/pfge15.pdf Alienation, Sociology of] in International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences, Paul Baltes and Neil Smelser, Eds., London: Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt;

A form of [[Western Marxism]] developed during the century, which included influential analyses of false consciousness by [[György Lukács]]. Critics of [[bureaucracy]] and the [[Protestant Ethic]] also drew on the works of [[Max Weber]].

Figures associated with [[critical theory]], in particular with the [[Frankfurt School]], such as [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Erich Fromm]], also developed theories of alienation, drawing on [[neo-Marxist]] ideas as well as other influences including [[neo-Freudian]] and sociological theories. One approach applies Marxist theories of [[commodification]] to the cultural, educational and [[Political party|party-political]] spheres. Links are drawn between socioeconomic structures, psychological states of alienation, and personal human relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael D. Pangilinan (2009) [http://www.kritike.org/journal/issue_6/pangilinan_december2009.pdf Against Alienation: The Emancipative Potential of Critical Pedagogy in Fromm] Kritike, Vol3, No2&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s the revolutionary group [[Situationist International]] came to some prominence, staging 'situations' intended to highlight an alternative way of life to [[advanced capitalism]], the latter conceptualized as a diffuse '[[Spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]]', a fake reality masking a degradation of human life. [[The Theory of Communicative Action]] associated with [[Jürgen Habermas]] emphasizes the essential role of [[language]] in [[public sphere|public life]], suggesting that alienation stems from the distortion of reasoned moral debate by the strategic dominance of [[Market (economics)|market]] forces and [[State (polity)|state]] power.

This critical program can be contrasted with traditions that attempt to extract problems of alienation from the broader socioeconomic context, or which at least accept the broader context on its own terms, and which often attribute problems to individual abnormality or failures to adjust.&lt;ref&gt;Dahms, H. "Does Alienation have a Future? Recapturing the Core of Critical Theory." In [https://books.google.com/books?id=nIZctokjRlQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0 Trauma, Promise, and the Millennium: The Evolution of Alienation]. ed. L. Langman and D.K. Fishman. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the boom in alienation research that characterized the 1950s and 1960s, interest in alienation research subsided (Geyer, 1996: xii), although in sociology it was maintained by the Research Committee on Alienation of the [[International Sociological Association]] (ISA).  In the 1990s, there was again an upsurge of interest in alienation prompted by the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], [[globalization]], the information explosion, increasing awareness of ethnic conflicts, and [[post-modernism]] (see Geyer, 1996). Geyer believes the growing complexity of the contemporary world and post-modernism prompted a reinterpretation of alienation that suits the contemporary living environment. In late 20th and early 21st century sociology, it has been particularly the works of Felix Geyer, Lauren Langman and Devorah Kalekin-Fishman that address the issue of alienation in the contemporary western world.

==Powerlessness==
Alienation in the sense of a lack of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] has been technically defined by Seeman as "the expectancy or probability held by the individual that his own behaviour cannot determine the occurrence of the outcomes, or reinforcements, he seeks." Seeman argues that this is "the notion of alienation as it originated in the Marxian view of the worker's condition in capitalist society: the worker is alienated to the extent that the [[prerogative]] and means of decision are expropriated by the ruling entrepreneurs".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 784)&lt;/ref&gt;  More succinctly, Kalekin-Fishman (1996: 97) says, "A person suffers from alienation in the form of 'powerlessness' when she is conscious of the gap between what she would like to do and what she feels capable of doing".

In discussing powerlessness, Seeman also incorporated the insights of the psychologist [[Julian Rotter]]. Rotter distinguishes between internal control and external [[locus of control]], which means "differences (among persons or situations) in the degree to which success or failure is attributable to external factors (e.g. luck, chance, or powerful others), as against success or failure that is seen as the outcome of one's personal skills or characteristics".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1966: 355)&lt;/ref&gt; Powerlessness, therefore, is the perception that the individual does not have the means to achieve his goals.

More recently, Geyer&lt;ref&gt;Geyer (1996: xxiii)&lt;/ref&gt; remarks that "a new type of powerlessness has emerged, where the core problem is no longer being unfree but rather being unable to select from among an [[overchoice]] of alternatives for action, whose consequences one often cannot even fathom". Geyer adapts [[cybernetics]] to alienation theory, and writes (1996: xxiv) that powerlessness is the result of delayed [[feedback]]: "The more complex one's environment, the later one is confronted with the latent, and often unintended, consequences of one's actions.  Consequently, in view of this causality-obscuring time lag, both the 'rewards' and 'punishments' for one's actions increasingly tend to be viewed as random, often with [[apathy]] and alienation as a result".

==Meaninglessness==
A sense of [[meaning (existential)|meaning]] has been defined by Seeman as "the individual's sense of understanding events in which he is engaged".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 786)&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeman (1959: 786) writes that meaninglessness "is characterized by a low expectancy that satisfactory predictions about the future outcomes of behaviour can be made." Whereas powerlessness refers to the sensed ability to control outcomes, this refers to the sensed ability to predict outcomes.  In this respect, meaninglessness is closely tied to [[powerlessness]]; Seeman (Ibid.) argues, "the view that one lives in an intelligible world might be a prerequisite to expectancies for control; and the unintelligibility of complex affairs is presumably conducive to the development of high expectancies for external control (that is, high powerlessness)".

Geyer (1996: xxiii) believes meaninglessness should be reinterpreted for postmodern times: "With the accelerating throughput of information [...] meaningless is not a matter anymore of whether one can assign meaning to incoming information, but of whether one can develop adequate new scanning mechanisms to gather the goal-relevant information one needs, as well as more efficient selection procedures to prevent being overburdened by the information one does not need, but is bombarded with on a regular basis."  "[[Information overload]]" or the so-called "data tsunami" are well-known information problems confronting contemporary man, and Geyer thus argues that meaninglessness is turned on its head.

==Normlessness==
Normlessness (or what [[Durkheim]] referred to as [[anomie]]) "denotes the situation in which the social norms regulating individual conduct have broken down or are no longer effective as rules for behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 787)&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect refers to the inability to identify with the dominant values of society or rather, with what are perceived to be the dominant values of society. Seeman (1959: 788) adds that this aspect can manifest in a particularly negative manner, "The anomic situation [...] may be defined as one in which there is a high expectancy that socially unapproved behaviours are required to achieve given goals".  This negative manifestation is dealt with in detail by Catherine Ross and John Mirowski in a series of publications on mistrust, powerlessness, normlessness and crime.

Neal &amp; Collas (2000: 122) write, "Normlessness derives partly from conditions of complexity and conflict in which individuals become unclear about the composition and enforcement of social norms.  Sudden and abrupt changes occur in life conditions, and the norms that usually operate may no longer seem adequate as guidelines for conduct".  This is a particular issue after the fall of the Soviet Union, mass migrations from developing to developed countries, and the general sense of disillusionment that characterized the 1990s (Senekal, 2011). Traditional values that had already been questioned (especially during the 1960s) were met with further scepticism in the 1990s, resulting in a situation where individuals rely more often on their own judgement than on institutions of authority: "The individual not only has become more independent of the churches, but from other social institutions as well.  The individual can make more personal choices in far more life situations than before" (Halman, 1998: 100). These choices are not necessarily "negative": Halman's study found that Europeans remain relatively conservative morally, even though the authority of the Church and other institutions has eroded.

==Relationships==
One concept used in regard to specific relationships is that of [[parental alienation]], where a child is distanced from and expresses a general dislike for one of their parents (who may have [[divorced]] or [[legal separation|separated]]).  The term is not applied where there is [[child abuse]]. The parental alienation might be due to specific influences from either parent or could result from the [[social dynamics]] of the family as a whole. It can also be understood in terms of [[attachment theory|attachment]], the social and emotional process of bonding between child and caregiver. [[Adoptees]] can feel alienated from both adoptive parents and birth parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjlifton.com/journey.htm Journey of the Adopted Self: A Quest for Wholeness]&lt;/ref&gt;

Familial estrangement between parents and adult children "is attributed to a number of biological, psychological, social, and structural factors affecting the family, including attachment disorders, incompatible values and beliefs, unfulfilled expectations, critical life events and transitions, parental alienation, and ineffective communication patterns." The degree of alienation has been positively correlated with decreased emotional functioning in the parent who feels a loss of identity and stigma.&lt;ref&gt;Agllias, Kylie. (Sep 2013). Family Estrangement. Encyclopedia of Social Work. Subject: Couples and Families, Aging and Older Adults, Children and Adolescents.DOI: 10.1093/acrefore/9780199975839.013.919&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, A. S. (2003).

[[Attachment in adults|Attachment relationships in adults]] can also involve feelings of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamft.org/imis15/Content/Consumer_Updates/Adult_Attachment_Relationships.aspx AAMFT Consumer Update]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, emotional alienation is said to be a common way of life for many, whether it is experienced as overwhelming, or is not admitted to in the midst of a [[rat race|socioeconomic race]], or contributes to seemingly unrelated problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rokach|first=Ami|title=Loneliness then and now: Reflections on social and emotional alienation in everyday life|journal=Current Psychology|year=2004|volume=23|issue=1|pages=24–40|doi=10.1007/s12144-004-1006-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social isolation==
Social isolation refers to "The feeling of being segregated from one's community".&lt;ref name="Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97"&gt;(Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97)&lt;/ref&gt; Neal and Collas (2000: 114) emphasize the centrality of social isolation in the modern world: "While social isolation is typically experienced as a form of personal stress, its sources are deeply embedded in the social organization of the modern world.  With increased isolation and atomization, much of our daily interactions are with those who are strangers to us and with whom we lack any ongoing social relationships."

Since the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the [[Cold War]], migrants from [[Eastern Europe]] and the developing countries have flocked to developed countries in search of a better living standard. This has led to entire communities becoming uprooted: no longer fully part of their homelands, but neither integrated into their adopted communities. [[Diaspora]] literature depicts the plights of these migrants, such as [[Hafid Bouazza]] in Paravion. Senekal (2010b: 41) argues, "Low-income communities or religious minorities may feel separated from mainstream society, leading to backlashes such as the civil unrest that occurred in French cities in October 2005.  The fact that the riots subsequently spread to Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Switzerland, illustrates that not only did these communities feel segregated from mainstream society, but also that they found a community in their isolation; they regarded themselves as kindred spirits".

==Among returning war veterans==
{{POV-section|date=March 2017}}
Because of intense group solidarity and unique daily hardships brought by combat, many veterans feel alienated from citizens, family, and friends when they return. They often feel they have little in common with civilian peers; issues that concern friends and family seem trivial after combat.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, William M., "Trauma of Iraq war haunting thousands returning home," ''USA Today'', February 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; There is a clarity of focus and purpose that comes with war that few in civilian life will ever know. Afghanistan veteran Brendon O'Byrne says, "We were really close. Physically and emotionally close. It's kind of terrifying being in such an emotionally safe environment and then suddenly be expelled into an alienated, fractured society."&lt;ref name="Warfighter's paradox 26"&gt;Junger, Sebastian, "Warfighter's paradox", ''Army Times'', Washington, D.C., June 10, 2014, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges of re-entering a civilian life where few people have experienced combat may contribute to the sense of loneliness.&lt;ref name="Warfighter's paradox 27"&gt;Junger, Sebastian, "Warfighter's paradox", ''Army Times'', Washington, D.C., June 10, 2014, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; As filmmaker and war correspondent Sebastian Junger says, "They didn't want to go back because it was traumatic, but because it was a place where they understood what they were supposed to do. They understood who they were. They had a sense of purpose. They were necessary. All these things that young people strive for are answered in combat."&lt;ref&gt;"Interview", ''Military History'', Weider History Group, Inc. Leesburg, VA, November 2012. pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Veterans often see their wartime experience as the most selfless and meaningful period of their lives.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Some veterans have expressed the sentiment that "even in the quiet moments, war is brighter, louder, brasher, more fun, more tragic, more wasteful. More. More of everything."&lt;ref&gt;Mokenhaupt, Brian, [http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a26372/esq0307essay/ "I Miss Iraq. I Miss My Gun. I Miss My War,"] ''Esquire,'' June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of the Vietnam veteran was distinctly different from that of veterans of other American wars.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Once he completed his tour of duty, he usually severed all bonds with his unit and comrades. It was extremely rare for a veteran to write to his buddies who were still in combat, and (in strong contrast to the endless reunions of World War II veterans) for more than a decade it was even rarer for more than two or more of them to get together after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 275-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Korean War veterans had no memorial and precious few parades, but they fought an invading army and they left behind them the free, healthy, thriving, and grateful nation of South Korea. No one spat on them or called them murderers or baby killers when they returned. Only the veterans of Vietnam have endured a concerted, organized, psychological attack by its own people. Never in American history, perhaps never in all of Western civilization, has an army suffered such an agony from its own people.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, Psychologist, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 290.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnam War was a long, contentious conflict (1955–75) which in the mid to late 1960s started to lose political and domestic support, most notably in academia and film that often portrayed soldiers of this conflict as ignoble adding to their social alienation. That the Vietnam War was ultimately lost on April 30, 1975, furthered the sense of meaninglessness and malaise.&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C, "Perspectives," ''Vietnam'' magazine, August 2002: 58–61. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/perspectives]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that as the perception of community alienation increases, an individual's sense of confidence or mastery in decision making will decrease, and so too their motivation to socially engage.&lt;ref name="robertankony.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ankony, Robert C., "Community Alienation and Its Impact on Police," ''Police Chief'', October 1999: 150-53. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/the-impact-of-community-alienation-on-police-officers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political alienation==
One manifestation of the above dimensions of alienation can be a feeling of estrangement from, and a lack of engagement in, the [[political system]]. Such [[political alienation]] could result from not identifying with any particular political party or message, and could result in [[revolution]], [[reform]]ing behavior, or [[abstention]] from the political process, possibly due to [[voter apathy]].&lt;ref&gt;David C. Schwartz [https://books.google.com/books?id=7wOVheiteOkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Political Alienation and Political Behavior] Transaction Publishers, 30 Apr 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar concept is [[policy alienation]], where workers experience a state of psychological disconnection from a [[policy]] programme being implemented.

==Self-estrangement==
Self-estrangement is an elusive concept in sociology, as recognized by Seeman (1959), although he included it as an aspect in his model of alienation. Some, with Marx, consider [[self-estrangement]] to be the end result and thus the heart of social alienation. Self-estrangement can be defined as "the psychological state of denying one's own interests – of seeking out [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|extrinsically satisfying, rather than intrinsically satisfying]], activities...".&lt;ref name="Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97"/&gt; It could be characterized as a feeling of having become a stranger to oneself, or to some parts of oneself, or alternatively as a problem of [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], or [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].

Seeman (1959) recognized the problems inherent in defining the "self", while post-modernism in particular has questioned the very possibility of pin-pointing what precisely "self" constitutes. Gergen (1996: 125) argues that: "the traditional view of self versus society is deeply problematic and should be replaced by a conception of the self as always already immersed in relatedness.  On this account, the individual's lament of 'not belonging' is partially a by-product of traditional [[discourse]]s themselves". If the self is relationally constituted, does it make sense to speak of "self-estrangement" rather than "social isolation"? Costas and Fleming (2009: 354) suggest that although the concept of self-estrangement "has not weathered postmodern criticisms of [[essentialism]] and [[economic determinism]] well", the concept still has value if a [[Lacanian]] reading of the self is adopted. This can be seen as part of a wider debate on the [[concept of self]] between [[humanism]] and [[antihumanism]], [[structuralism]] and [[post-structuralism]], or [[nature]] and [[nurture]].

==Mental disturbance==
Until early in the 20th century, psychological problems were referred to in psychiatry as states of mental alienation, implying that a person had become separated from themselves, their reason or the world. From the 1960s alienation was again considered in regard to clinical states of disturbance, typically using a broad concept of a 'schizoid' ('splitting') process taken from [[psychoanalytic]] theory. The splitting was said to occur within regular child development and in everyday life, as well as in more extreme or dysfunctional form in conditions such as [[schizoid personality]] and [[schizophrenia]]. Varied concepts of alienation and self-estrangement were used to link internal schizoid states with observable symptoms and with external socioeconomic divisions, without necessarily explaining or evidencing underlying causation. [[R. D. Laing]] was particularly influential in arguing that [[dysfunctional family|dysfunctional families]] and socioeconomic oppression caused states of alienation and [[ontological security|ontological insecurity]] in people, which could be considered adaptations but which were diagnosed as disorders by mainstream psychiatry and society.(Laing,[1967] 1959).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Frank (1975) [http://www.positivedisintegration.com/Johnson1975.pdf Psychological Alienation: Isolation and Self-Estrangement] Psychoanalytic Review 62:3 Pg 369. Reprinted from Alienation: Concept, Term, and Meanings, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The specific theories associated with Laing and others at that time are not widely accepted, but work from other theoretical perspectives sometimes addresses the same theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lysaker|first=P.

In a related vein, for [[Ian Parker (psychologist)|Ian Parker]], psychology ''normalizes'' conditions of social alienation. While it could help groups of individuals emancipate themselves, it serves the role of reproducing existing conditions.(Parker, 2007). This view can be seen as part of a broader tradition sometimes referred to as [[critical psychology]] or [[liberation psychology]], which emphasizes that an individual is enmeshed within a social-political framework, and so therefore are psychological problems. Similarly, some psychoanalysts suggest that while psychoanalysis emphasizes environmental causes and reactions, it also attributes the problems of individuals to internal conflicts stemming from early psychosocial development, effectively divorcing them from the wider ongoing context.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Layton, Nancy Caro Hollander, Susan Gutwill (Eds) (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-DnX73bkC0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Psychoanalysis, class and politics: encounters in the clinical setting] Introduction; Pg 47&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavoj Zizek]] (drawing on [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Jacques Lacan|Jacques Lacan's]] psychoanalysis) argues that in today's capitalist society, the individual is estranged from their self through the repressive injunction to "enjoy!" Such an injunction does not allow room for the recognition of alienation and, indeed, could itself be seen as an expression of alienation.(Zizek, 1994).

[[Frantz Fanon]], an early writer on [[postcolonialism]], studied the conditions of objectification and violent oppression (lack of autonomy) believed to have led to [[mental disorders]] among the [[colonized]] in the Third World (in particular Africans) (Fanon, ([2004] 1961).

A process of '[[malignant]] alienation' has been observed in regard to some psychiatric patients, especially in forensic units and for individuals labeled 'difficult' or who aren't liked by at least some staff, which involves a breakdown of the therapeutic relationship between staff and patients, and which may end in the [[suicide]] of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Whittle Chapter 7: Malignant Alienation.

==Disability==
Differences between persons with [[disability|disabilities]] and individuals in relative abilities, or perceived abilities, can be a cause of alienation. One study, "Social Alienation and Peer Identification: A Study of the Social Construction of Deafness",&lt;ref&gt;Foster, S. (1989), [http://sfaa.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,5,10;journal,90,279;linkingpublicationresults,1:113218,1 Social Alienation and Peer Identification: A Study of the Social Construction of Deafness], ''Human Organization'', Volume 48, Number 3, pp. 226–235&lt;/ref&gt; found that among deaf adults one theme emerged consistently across all categories of life experience: [[social rejection]] by, and alienation from, the larger hearing community. Only when the respondents described interactions with deaf people did the theme of isolation give way to comments about participation and meaningful interaction. This appeared to be related to specific needs, for example for real conversation, for information, the opportunity to develop close friendships and a sense of family. It was suggested that the social meaning of deafness is established by interaction between deaf and hearing people, sometimes resulting in [[marginalization]] of the deaf, which is sometimes challenged. It has also led to the creation of alternatives and the deaf community is described as one such alternative.

Physicians and nurses often deal with people who are temporarily or permanently alienated from communities, which could be a result or a cause of medical conditions and suffering, and it has been suggested that therefore attention should be paid to learning from experiences of the special pain that alienation can bring.&lt;ref&gt;Janice L. Willms [http://www.annals.org/content/126/11/923.extract Lingua Medica: Alienation and Imagination: The Literature of Exclusion] Annals of Internal Medicine June 1, 1997 vol. 126 no. 11 923-926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Younger|first=JB|title=The alienation of the sufferer.|journal=Advances in Nursing Science|date=June 1995|volume=17|issue=4|pages=53–72|pmid=7625781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
Alienation is most often represented in [[literature]] as the psychological isolation of an individual from society or community. In a volume of Bloom's Literary Themes, [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' is described as the 'supreme literary portrait' of alienation, while noting that some may argue for [[Achilles]] in the ''[[Iliad]]''. In addition, ''[[Bartleby, the Scrivener]]'' is introduced as a perfect example because so many senses of alienation are present. Other literary works described as dealing with the theme of alienation are: ''[[The Bell Jar]]'', ''[[Black Boy]]'', ''[[Brave New World]]'', ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', ''[[The Chosen (Potok novel)|The Chosen]]'', ''[[Dubliners]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', ''[[Invisible Man]]'', ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'', ''[[Notes from Underground]]'', ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', ''[[The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', ''[[The Trial]]'', ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'', ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', ''[[The Waste Land]]'', and ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Blake Hobby, Harold Bloom (Ed) [https://books.google.com/books?id=zQLTOk18LwMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Bloom's Literary Themes: Alienation] Infobase Publishing, 1 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary British works noted for their perspective on alienation include ''[[The Child in Time]]'', ''[[London Fields (novel)|London Fields]]'', ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'', and ''[[Regeneration (novel)|Regeneration]]'' (Senekal, 2008 &amp; 2010b: 102–123).

Sociologist [[Harry Dahms]] has analysed [[The Matrix Trilogy]] of films in the context of theories of alienation in modern society. He suggests that the central theme of ''[[The Matrix]]'' is the "all-pervasive yet increasingly invisible prevalence of alienation in the world today, and difficulties that accompany attempts to overcome it".&lt;ref&gt;Harry F. Dahms [http://web.utk.edu/~hdahms/Emergence.pdf THE MATRIX Trilogy as Critical Theory of Alienation: Communicating a Message of Radical Transformation.] Transdisciplinary Journal of Emergence. 3 (1) 2005: 108–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

See also Langman's study of ''punk, porn, and resistance'' (2008) and Senekal's (2011) study of [[Afrikaans]] [[extreme metal]].

British [[progressive rock]] band [[Pink Floyd]]'s concept album ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979) and British [[alternative rock]] band [[Radiohead]]'s album ''[[OK Computer]]'' (1997), both deal with the subject of alienation in their lyrics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17263">'''Sperm sorting''' is a means of choosing what type of [[sperm cell]] is to [[Fertilisation|fertilize]] the [[egg cell]]. Several conventional techniques of  [[density gradient centrifugation|centrifugation]] or [[swim-up]]. Newly applied methods such as flow cytometry expand the possibilities of sperm sorting and new techniques of sperm sorting are being developed.

It can be used to sort out sperm that are most healthy, as well as for determination of more specific traits, such as [[sex selection]] in which spermatozoa are separated into [[X chromosome|X-]] (female) and [[Y chromosome|Y-]] (male) chromosome bearing populations based on their difference in DNA content. The resultant 'sex-sorted' spermatozoa are then able to be used in conjunction with other assisted reproductive technologies such as [[artificial insemination]] or [[in-vitro fertilization]] (IVF) to produce offspring of the desired sex - in farming animals but also in human medical practice.

== Methods ==

=== Conventional techniques ===
Several methods have been used to sort sperm before the advent of flow cytometry. [[Density gradient centrifugation]] (in a continuous or discontinuous gradient) can concentrate semen samples with low concentration of sperm, using the density of sperm as a measure of their quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ribeiro|first=Sofia C.|last2=Sartorius|first2=Gideon|last3=Pletscher|first3=Flurina|last4=Geyter|first4=Maria de|last5=Zhang|first5=Hong|last6=Geyter|first6=Christian de|title=Isolation of spermatozoa with low levels of fragmented DNA with the use of flow cytometry and sorting|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028213006407|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=3|pages=686–694.e4|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.05.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, so-called [[swim-up]] techniques apply a centrifugation step and then sperm is allowed to swim up into a medium, thus enriching a subpopulation of motile sperm. However, use of sperm centrifugation is detrimental to the sperm viability and elicits production of reactive oxygen species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rappa|first=Kari L.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Harold F.|last3=Hakkarainen|first3=Gloria C.|last4=Anchan|first4=Raymond M.|last5=Mutter|first5=George L.|last6=Asghar|first6=Waseem|date=2016-09-01|title=Sperm processing for advanced reproductive technologies: Where are we today?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975016300076|journal=Biotechnology Advances|volume=34|issue=5|pages=578–587|doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2016.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional techniques are routinely used in assisted reproductive technology.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paasch|first=Uwe|last2=Grunewald|first2=Sonja|last3=Glander|first3=Hans-Juergen|date=2007-01-01|title=Sperm selection in assisted reproductive techniques|journal=Society of Reproduction and Fertility Supplement|volume=65|pages=515–525|issn=1747-3403|pmid=17644989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flow cytometry ===
[[Flow cytometry]] is another method used to sort sperm and adaptations of this technique opens new opportunities in sperm sorting. However, because flow cytometry-based sperm sorting often uses fluorescent dyes that often stain DNA, the safety of this technique in human reproductive medicine is a matter of scientific discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caroppo|first=Ettore|title=Sperm sorting for selection of healthy sperm: is it safe and useful?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028213007000|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=3|pages=695–696|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.006|pmid=23809504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ribeiro|first=Sofia|last2=Sartorius|first2=Gideon|last3=Geyter|first3=Christian de|title=Sorting of spermatozoa with flow cytometry|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028213007395|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=3|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.039|page=e15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, flow cytometry is the only currently used technique able to determine the sex of future progeny by measuring DNA content of individual sperm cells. It evaluates if they contain the larger [[X chromosome]] (giving rise to a female offspring) or smaller [[Y chromosome]] (leading to male progeny). It then allows separation of X and Y sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=L. A.|last2=Welch|first2=G. R.|last3=Rens|first3=W.|date=1999-01-01|title=The Beltsville sperm sexing technology: high-speed sperm sorting gives improved sperm output for in vitro fertilization and AI|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=77 Suppl 2|pages=213–220|issn=0021-8812|pmid=15526798|doi=10.2527/1999.77suppl_2213x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called ''[[Beltsfield Sperm Sexing Technology]]'' was developed by USDA in conjunction with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, relying on the DNA difference between the X- and Y- chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;Garner DL, Seidel GE. History of commercializing sexed semen for cattle. Theriogenology 2008;69: 886-895.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to flow cytometric sorting, semen is labeled with a fluorescent dye called [[Hoechst 33342]] which binds to the DNA of each spermatozoon. As the X chromosome is larger (i.e. has more DNA) than the Y chromosome, the "female" (X-chromosome bearing) spermatozoa will absorb a greater amount of dye than its male (Y-chromosome bearing) counterpart.  As a consequence, when exposed to UV light during flow cytometry, X spermatozoa fluoresce brighter than Y- spermatozoa.  As the spermatozoa pass through the flow cytometer in single file, each spermatozoon is encased by a single droplet of fluid and assigned an electric charge corresponding to its chromosome status (e.g. X-positive charge, Y-negative charge).  The stream of X- and Y- droplets is then separated by means of electrostatic deflection and collected into separate collection tubes for subsequent processing.&lt;ref&gt;Seidel GE, Jr., Garner DL. Current status of sexing mammalian spermatozoa. Reproduction 2002;124: 733-743.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cytometric technique used in sperm sorting is [[magnetic-activated cell sorting]] (MACS) which is routinely applied in assisted reproduction hospitals to sort out sperm with fragmented DNA. This is achieved using [[Antibody|antibodies]] to surface markers of programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) such as [[annexin V]], coupled with magnetic beads. Following the binding of these antibodies, spermatozoa which undergo apoptosis are sorted by applying [[magnetic field]] to the sperm suspension.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gil|first=Monica|last2=Sar-Shalom|first2=Valerie|last3=Sivira|first3=Yolisid Melendez|last4=Carreras|first4=Ramon|last5=Checa|first5=Miguel Angel|date=2013-03-07|title=Sperm selection using magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) in assisted reproduction: a systematic review and meta-analysis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-013-9962-8|journal=Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics|language=en|volume=30|issue=4|pages=479–485|doi=10.1007/s10815-013-9962-8|issn=1058-0468|pmc=3644127}}&lt;/ref&gt; MACS obviates the need for fluorescent DNA binding molecules.

=== Other techniques ===
[[DNA damage]] in sperm cells may be detected by using [[Raman spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/21982/page1/ Ranking sperm cells could improve the odds of in vitro fertilization.] By Courtney Humphries. TechnologyReview. Wednesday, January 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is not specific enough to detect individual traits, however.&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; The sperm cells having least DNA damage may subsequently be injected into the egg cell by [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI).&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; Many other methods for sperm sorting have been proposed or are currently tested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Sperm undergoes a process of [[natural selection]] when millions of sperm enter vagina but only few reach the egg cell and then only one is usually allowed to [[Fertilisation|fertilize]] it. The sperm is selected not only by its highest [[Sperm motility|motility]] but also by other factors such as [[DNA integrity]], production of [[reactive oxygen species]] and [[Cell viability|viability]]. This selection is largely circumvented in case of [[in-vitro fertilization]] which leads to higher incidence of [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]] associated with [[Assisted reproductive technology|assisted reproductive techniques]]. Egg cells are often fertilized by sperm which would have low chance of fertilizing it in natural conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sperm sorting could thus be used to decrease risks associated with assisted reproduction. Additionally, there is ongoing debate about using sperm sorting for choosing the child's sex.

=== For general health ===
Conventional methods of sperm sorting have been widely used to assess quality of sperm before subsequent [[artificial insemination]] or [[in-vitro fertilization]]. It has been verified that sperm sorted using these techniques is of superior quality than unsorted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aitken|first=R. John|last2=Clarkson|first2=Jane S.|date=1988-11-12|title=Significance of Reactive Oxygen Species and Antioxidants in Defining the Efficacy of Sperm Preparation Techniques|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1939-4640.1988.tb01067.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Andrology|language=en|volume=9|issue=6|pages=367–376|doi=10.1002/j.1939-4640.1988.tb01067.x|issn=1939-4640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Geyter|first=C.|last2=Bals-Pratsch|first2=M.|last3=Doeren|first3=M.|last4=Yeung|first4=C.

New flow-cytometry based techniques such as [[YO-PRO]] staining can discriminate [[Apoptosis|apoptotic]] and dead spermatozoa from the viable ones.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, [[annexin V]] staining followed by [[Magnetic-activated cell sorting|MACS]] can significantly improve pregnancy rates in couples with previous assisted reproduction failure.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== For sex selection ===

==== In farming ====
Sperm sorting by flow cytometry is an established technique in veterinary practice, and in the dairy industry most female cows are artificially inseminated with sorted semen to increase the number of female [[Calf|calves]] (using sperm sorting is less common in other species of farm animals, however artificial insemination is common).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rath|first=D.|last2=Barcikowski|first2=S.|last3=de Graaf|first3=S.|last4=Garrels|first4=W.|last5=Grossfeld|first5=R.|last6=Klein|first6=S.|last7=Knabe|first7=W.|last8=Knorr|first8=C.|last9=Kues|first9=W.|date=2013-01-01|title=Sex selection of sperm in farm animals: status report and developmental prospects|journal=Reproduction (Cambridge, England)|volume=145|issue=1|pages=R15–30|doi=10.1530/REP-12-0151|issn=1741-7899|pmid=23148085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial insemination of farm animals with sorted sperm is recognized by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) as a promising way of increasing efficiency of agriculture needed to produce enough food for the growing human population. Utilizing artificial insemination with sorted sperm is seen as a way to create an optimal ratio of male and female calves to increase dairy [[milk production]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== In humans ====
{{Further information|Sex selection#Ethical concerns}}Choosing the sex of children might help prevent [[Sex-linked inheritance|sex-associated heritable diseases]] such as [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy|Duchene muscular dystrophy]] or [[haemophilia]] in families with a history of these diseases. On the other hand, sperm sorting in humans raises the ethical concerns implicit to the idea of [[sex selection]]. If applied large-scale, it has a potential to elicit a [[Human sex ratio|sex-ratio imbalance]]. It could also have implications on gender equality if parents consistently choose to have a boy as their first-born (first-borns were shown to be more likely to succeed in life).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalfoglou|first=A.L.|last2=Kammersell|first2=M.|last3=Philpott|first3=S.|last4=Dahl|first4=E.|title=Ethical arguments for and against sperm sorting for non-medical sex selection: a review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S147264831200692X|journal=Reproductive BioMedicine Online|volume=26|issue=3|pages=231–239|doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2012.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early to mid-1980s, [[Glenn Spaulding]] was the first to sort viable whole human and animal spermatozoa using a flow cytometer, and utilized the sorted motile rabbit sperm for artificial insemination. Subsequently, the first patent application disclosing the method to sort "two viable subpopulations enriched for x- or y- sperm" was filed in April 1987 as US Application Serial Number 35,986 and later became part of US Patent 5,021,244; and the patent included the discovery of [[haploid]] expression (sex-associated membrane proteins, or SAM proteins) and the development of monoclonal antibodies to those proteins.&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 5,021,244, column 9, Sorting Sperm; http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5021244.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5021244&amp;RS=PN/5021244&lt;/ref&gt; Additional applications and methods were added, including antibodies, from 1987 through 1997.&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 5,021,244; 5,346,990; 5,369,012; 5,439,362; 5,496,722; 5,648,468; 5,660,997; PCT/US1989/002069&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the patent filing, both [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories]] and the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] were only sorting fixed sperm nuclei,&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Johnson, J. P. Flook, M. V. Look, D. Pinkel, Flow sorting of X and Y chromosome-bearing spermatozoa into two populations. Gamete Research Volume 16, Issue1, pages 1-9, January 1987; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrd.1120160102/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; after the Application Serial Number 35,986 patent filing a new technique was utilized by the USDA where "sperm were briefly sonicated to remove tails".&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Johnson, J. P. Flook and M. V. Look, Flow cytometry of X and Y chromosome-bearing sperm for DNA using an improved preparation method and staining with Hoechst 33342.

There is no country in the world which explicitly permits sex selection for non-medical purposes. There were 31 countries in 2009 which allowed sex selection in case of sex-linked disease risk or other medical purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geneticsandsociety.org/downloads/200904_sex_selection_memo.pdf|title=Countries with laws or policies on sex selection|last=Darnovsky|first=Marcy|date=2009|website=|publisher=geneticsandsociety.org|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, for humans, the application of sperm sorting in sex selection is tightly regulated by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]. After the establishment of the MicroSort technique, it was offered to parents as a part of a [[clinical trial]]. The procedure was made available to a limited number of participants each month, in addition to fulfilling certain criteria, such as having a disease with [[sex linkage]] or having at least one child (for family balancing).&lt;ref name="institute"&gt;[http://www.microsort.net/ Genetics &amp; IVF Institute: MicroSort Clinical Trial]&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently MicroSort laboratories and collaborating physicians in several countries (some for general purposes, some only offering service in case of genetic disease risks associated with one sex).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsort.com/?page_id=319|title=About Us {{!}} MicroSort International|last=ThemeFuse|website=www.microsort.com|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While highly accurate, sperm sorting by flow cytometry will not produce two completely separate populations. That is to say, there will always be some "male" sperm among the "female" sperm and vice versa. The exact percentage purity of each population is dependent on the species being sorted and the 'gates' which the operator places around the total population visible to the machine. In general, the larger the DNA difference between the X and Y chromosome of a species, the easier it is to produce a highly pure population. In sheep and cattle, purities for each sex will usually remain above 90% depending on 'gating', while for humans these may be reduced to 90% and 70% for "female" and "male" spermatozoa, respectively.&lt;ref name="institute" /&gt;

'''Sugarscape''' is a model for [[Artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] [[Agent-based model|agent-based]] [[social simulation]] following some or all rules presented by [[Joshua M. Epstein]] &amp; [[Robert Axtell]] in their book ''Growing Artificial Societies''.&lt;ref name="GAS"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Fundaments of Sugarscape models can be traced back to the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] where economist [[Thomas Schelling]] presented his paper titled ''[[Thomas Schelling#Models of segregation|Models of Segregation]]''.&lt;ref name="Sourceforge1"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://sugarscape.sourceforge.net/ |title=Sugarscape - Growing Agent-based Artificial Societies |publisher=[[Sourceforge]] |accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in 1969, Schelling and the rest of the [[social environment]] modelling fraternity had their options limited by a lack of adequate computing power and an applicable programming mechanism to fully develop the potential of their model.

[[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]'s agent-based simulation "[[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]" was enhanced and applied to Schelling's original idea by [[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] in their book ''Growing Artificial Societies''. To demonstrate their findings on the field of agent-based simulation, a model was created and distributed with their book on CD-ROM. The concept of this model has come to be known as "the Sugarscape model".&lt;ref name="GAS" /&gt; Since then, the name "Sugarscape" has been used for agent-based models using rules similar to those defined by Epstein &amp; Axtell.

==Principles==
All Sugarscape models include the [[Intelligent agent|agents]] (inhabitants), the environment (a two-dimensional grid) and the rules governing the interaction of the agents with each other and the environment.

The original model presented by J. Epstein &amp; R. Axtell (considered as the [[Social simulation#History and development|first large scale agent model]]) is based on a 51x51 cell grid, where every cell can contain different amounts of sugar (or spice). In every step agents look around, find the closest cell filled with sugar, move and metabolize. They can leave pollution, die, reproduce, inherit sources, transfer information, trade or borrow sugar, generate immunity or transmit diseases - depending on the specific scenario and variables defined at the set-up of the model.

Sugar in simulation could be seen as a metaphor for resources in an artificial world through which the examiner can study the effects of social dynamics such as evolution, marital status and inheritance on populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Exact simulation of the original rules provided by J. Epstein &amp; R. Axtell in their book can be problematic&lt;ref name="tricky"&gt;{{cite web

|title=Replicating Sugarscape — University of Leicester
|accessdate=18 January 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not always possible to recreate the same results as those presented in ''Growing Artificial Societies''.

==Model implementations==
The Sugarscape model has had several implementations, some of which are available as [[Open-source software|open source]] software.

===Ascape===
An original implementation was developed in [[Ascape]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] software suitable for [[agent-based social simulation]]. The Sugarscape model remains part of the built-in library of models distributed with Ascape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ascape.sourceforge.net/manual/Section1.html
|title=The Ascape Model Developer’s Manual
|publisher=[[Sourceforge]]
|accessdate=9 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NetLogo===
[[NetLogo]] has been used to build Sugarscape models. Three Sugarscape scenarios are included in the NetLogo Models Library: "Immediate Growback", "Constant Growback" and "Wealth Distribution". Besides these three scenarios lies Iain Weaver's Sugarscape NetLogo model, which is part of the User Community Models Library. "It builds on Owen Densmore's NetLogo community model to encompass all rules discussed in ''Growing Artificial Societies'' with the exception of the combat rule (although trivial to include, it adds little value to the model)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/Sugarscape
|title=NetLogo User Community Models: Sugarscape
|accessdate=9 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is equipped with rich documentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/research/the-sugarscape
|title=The Sugarscape 
|publisher=[[University of Leicester]]
|accessdate=19 January 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; including instructions for successful replication of the original Sugarscape rules.&lt;ref name="tricky"/&gt;

===SugarScape on steroids===

Due to the emergent nature of [[agent-based model]]s (ABMs), it is critical that the population sizes in the simulations match the population sizes of the dynamic systems being modelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|last2=Bankes

|pages=7197–7198
|doi=10.1073/pnas.072079499 |pmc=128584
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the performance of contemporary agent simulation frameworks has been inadequate to handle such large population sizes and parallel computing frameworks designed to run on [[computing cluster]]s has been limited by available bandwidth. As computing power increases with [[Moore's law]], the size and complexity of simulation frameworks can be expected to increase. The team of R. M. D’Souza, M. Lysenko and K Rahmani from [[Michigan Technological University]] used a Sugarscape model to demonstrate the power of [[Graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) in ABM simulations with over 50 updates per second with agent populations exceeding 2 millions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Tierra''' is a [[computer simulation]] developed by [[ecologist]] [[Thomas S. Ray]] in the early 1990s in which [[computer program]]s compete for time (central processing unit ([[Central processing unit|CPU]]) time) and space (access to [[main memory]]). In this context, the computer programs in Tierra are considered to be [[evolvability|evolvable]] and can [[mutation|mutate]], [[self-replication|self-replicate]] and [[Genetic recombination|recombine]]. Tierra's virtual machine is written in [[C (programming language)|C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ray|first=Thomas|title=What this Program is|url=http://life.ou.edu/pubs/doc/index.html#What|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It operates on a custom instruction set designed to facilitate code changes and reordering, including features such as jump to template&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ray|first=Thomas|title=Available instructions|url=http://life.ou.edu/pubs/doc/index.html#Idt|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as opposed to the relative or absolute jumps common to most instruction sets).

== Simulations ==
The basic Tierra model has been used to experimentally explore ''[[in silico]]'' the basic processes of [[evolution]]ary and [[ecology|ecological]] dynamics. Processes such as the dynamics of [[punctuated equilibrium]], [[Host (biology)|host]]-[[parasite]] [[co-evolution]] and density-dependent [[natural selection]] are amenable to investigation within the Tierra framework. A notable difference between Tierra and more conventional models of [[evolutionary computation]], such as [[genetic algorithm]]s, is that there is no explicit, or [[exogenous]] [[fitness (biology)|fitness function]] built into the model. Often in such models there is the notion of a function being "optimized"; in the case of Tierra, the fitness function is endogenous: there is simply survival and death.

According to Thomas S. Ray and others, this may allow for more "open-ended" evolution, in which the dynamics of the feedback between evolutionary and ecological processes can itself change over time (see [[evolvability]]), although this claim has not been realized – like other digital evolution systems, it eventually reaches a point where novelty ceases to be created, and the system at large begins either looping or ceases to 'evolve'. The issue of how true [[open-ended evolution]] can be implemented in an artificial system is still an open question in the field of [[artificial life]].&lt;ref&gt;Bedau M.A., McCaskill J.S. et al., "Open problems in artificial life", ''Artificial Life'', 2000 Fall '''6'''(4):363-76&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Bedau]] and [[Norman Packard]] developed a statistical method of classifying evolutionary systems and in 1997, Bedau ''et al.'' applied these statistics to Evita, an [[Artificial life]] model similar to Tierra and [[Avida]], but with limited organism interaction and no parasitism, and concluded that Tierra-like systems do not exhibit the open-ended evolutionary signatures of naturally evolving systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bedau, M.A., Snyder, E., Brown, C.T. and Packard, N.H. 1997, "A Comparison of Evolutionary Activity in Artificial Evolving Systems and in the Biosphere", in ''Fourth European Conference on Artificial Life'', Husbands and Harvey (eds), MIT press, p125&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russell K. Standish]] has measured the informational complexity of Tierran 'organisms', and has similarly not observed complexity growth in Tierran evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Standish, R.K. 2003 "Open-ended artificial evolution", ''International Journal of Computational Intelligence and Applications 3(2)'', 167-175&lt;/ref&gt;

Tierra is an abstract model, but any quantitative model is still subject to the same validation and verification techniques applied to more traditional [[mathematical model]]s, and as such, has no special status. The creation of more detailed models in which more realistic dynamics of biological systems and organisms are incorporated is now an active research field (see [[systems biology]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13440">[[File:Mustela frenata.jpg|thumb|right|The software's name takes itself from dialogue in ''Hamlet'':&lt;br&gt;''Hamlet:'' Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?&lt;br&gt;''Polonius:'' By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.&lt;br&gt;''Hamlet:'' Methinks it is like a [[weasel]].]]

The '''weasel program''' or '''Dawkins' weasel''' is a [[thought experiment]] and a variety of [[computer simulation]]s illustrating it.  Their aim is to demonstrate that the process that drives [[evolution]]ary systems—random [[Mutation|variation]] combined with non-random cumulative [[Selection (biology)|selection]]—is different from pure [[chance (philosophy)|chance]].

The thought experiment was formulated by [[Richard Dawkins]], and the first simulation written by him; various other implementations of the program have been written by others.

== Overview ==
In chapter 3 of his book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', Dawkins gave the following introduction to the program, referencing the well-known [[infinite monkey theorem]]:

{{quote|I don't know who it was first pointed out that, given enough time, a [[monkey]] bashing away at [[Randomness|random]] on a [[typewriter]] could produce all the works of [[Shakespeare]]. The operative phrase is, of course, given enough time. Let us limit the task facing our monkey somewhat. Suppose that he has to produce, not the complete works of Shakespeare but just the short sentence 'Methinks it is like a [[weasel]]', and we shall make it relatively easy by giving him a typewriter with a restricted keyboard, one with just the 26 (capital) letters, and a space bar. How long will he take to write this one little sentence?}}

The scenario is staged to produce a string of [[gibberish]] letters, assuming that the selection of each letter in a sequence of 28 characters will be random. The number of possible combinations in this random sequence is 27&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;, or about 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;, so the [[probability]] that the monkey will produce a given sequence is extremely low. Any particular sequence of 28 characters could be selected as a "target" phrase, all equally as improbable as Dawkins's chosen target, "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL".

A [[computer program]] could be written to carry out the actions of Dawkins's [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] monkey, continuously generating combinations of 26 letters and spaces at high speed. Even at the rate of millions of combinations per second, it is unlikely, even given the entire [[Age of the universe|lifetime of the universe]] to run, that the program would ever produce the phrase "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL".&lt;ref&gt;For a string of 28 characters, with 27 possible characters (A-Z plus space), any randomly generated string has the probability one in 27^28 of being correct; that is approximately one in 10^40. If a program generating 10 million strings per second had been running since the start of the universe (around 14 billion years, or 10^17 seconds), it would have only generated around 10^24 strings by now.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins intends this example to illustrate a common misunderstanding of [[evolution]]ary change, i.e. that [[DNA]] sequences or [[organic compound]]s such as [[proteins]] are the result of atoms randomly combining to form more complex structures. In these types of computations, any sequence of [[amino acids]] in a protein will be extraordinarily improbable (this is known as [[Hoyle's fallacy]]). Rather, evolution proceeds by [[hill climbing]], as in [[adaptive landscape]]s.

Dawkins then goes on to show that a process of ''cumulative'' selection can take far fewer steps to reach any given target. In Dawkins's words:

{{quote|We again use our computer monkey, but with a crucial difference in its program. It again begins by choosing a random sequence of 28 letters, just as before ... it duplicates it repeatedly, but with a certain chance of random [[error]] &amp;ndash; 'mutation' &amp;ndash; in the copying. The computer examines the [[mutant]] nonsense phrases, the 'progeny' of the original phrase, and chooses the one which,'' however slightly, ''most resembles the target phrase, METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL.}}

By repeating the procedure, a randomly generated sequence of 28 letters and spaces will be gradually changed each [[generation]]. The sequences progress through each generation:

:Generation&amp;nbsp;01:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;WDLTMNLT&amp;nbsp;DTJBKWIRZREZLMQCO&amp;nbsp;P&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Note: the 4th character of line 1 is missing in Dawkins' text; however line 2 suggests it was probably a T&lt;/ref&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;02:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;WDLTMNLT&amp;nbsp;DTJBSWIRZREZLMQCO&amp;nbsp;P&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;10:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;MDLDMNLS&amp;nbsp;ITJISWHRZREZ&amp;nbsp;MECS&amp;nbsp;P&lt;/tt&gt;

Dawkins continues:

{{quote|The exact time taken by the computer to reach the target doesn't matter. If you want to know, it completed the whole exercise for me, the first time, while I was out to lunch. It took about half an hour. (Computer enthusiasts may think this unduly slow. The reason is that the program was written in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], a sort of computer baby-talk. When I rewrote it in [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], it took 11 seconds.) Computers are a bit faster at this kind of thing than monkeys, but the difference really isn't significant. What matters is the difference between the time taken by'' cumulative ''selection, and the time which the same computer, working flat out at the same rate, would take to reach the target phrase if it were forced to use the other procedure of'' single-step selection: ''about a million million million million million years. This is more than a million million million times as long as the universe has so far existed.}}

==Implications for biology==
The program aims to demonstrate that the preservation of small changes in an evolving string of characters (or [[gene]]s) can produce meaningful combinations in a relatively short time as long as there is some mechanism to select cumulative changes, whether it is a person identifying which traits are desirable (in the case of artificial selection) or a criterion of survival ("fitness") imposed by the environment (in the case of natural selection). Reproducing systems tend to preserve traits across generations, because the offspring inherit a copy of the parent's traits. It is the differences between offspring, the variations in copying, which become the basis for selection, allowing phrases closer to the target to survive, and the remaining variants to "die."

Dawkins discusses the issue of the mechanism of selection with respect to his "biomorphs" program:

{{quote|The human eye has an active role to play in the story. It is the selecting agent. It surveys the litter of progeny and chooses one for breeding. ...Our model, in other words, is strictly a model of artificial selection, not natural selection. The criterion for 'success' is not the direct criterion of survival, as it is in true natural selection. In true natural selection, if a body has what it takes to survive, its genes automatically survive because they are inside it. So the genes that survive tend to be, automatically, those genes that confer on bodies the qualities that assist them to survive.}}

Regarding the example's applicability to biological evolution, he is careful to point out that it has its limitations:

{{quote|Although the monkey/Shakespeare model is useful for explaining the distinction between single-step selection and cumulative selection, it is misleading in important ways. One of these is that, in each generation of selective 'breeding', the mutant 'progeny' phrases were judged according to the criterion of resemblance to a'' distant ideal ''target, the phrase METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL. Life isn't like that. Evolution has no long-term goal. There is no long-distance target, no final perfection to serve as a criterion for selection, although human vanity cherishes the absurd notion that our species is the final goal of evolution. In real life, the criterion for selection is always short-term, either simple survival or, more generally, reproductive success.}}

Only the "fittest" string of each generation is shown. Note that, in generation 8, the 25th character, which had been correct (&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;), becomes incorrect (&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;). The program does not "lock" correct characters, rather it measures at each iteration the closeness of the complete string to the 'target' phrase.]]

==More complex models==
In ''The Blind Watchmaker,'' Dawkins goes on to provide a graphical model of [[gene selection]] involving  entities he calls biomorphs. These are [[Plane (mathematics)|two-dimensional]] sets of [[Line (mathematics)#Line segment|line segments]] which bear relationships to each other, drawn under the control of "genes" that determine the appearance of the biomorph. By selecting entities from sequential generations of biomorphs, an experimenter can guide the evolution of the figures toward given shapes, such as "airplane" or "octopus" biomorphs.

As a simulation, the biomorphs are not much closer to the actual genetic behavior of biological organisms. Like the Weasel program, their development is shaped by an external factor, in this case the decisions of the experimenter who chooses which of many possible shapes will go forward into the following generation. They do however serve to illustrate the concept of "genetic space," where each possible gene is treated as a [[dimension]], and the actual genomes of living organisms make up a tiny fraction of all possible gene combinations, most of which will not produce a viable organism. As Dawkins puts it, "however many ways there may be of being alive, it is certain that there are vastly more ways of being dead". 

In ''Climbing Mount Improbable'', Dawkins responded to the limitations of the Weasel program by describing programs, written by other parties, that modeled the evolution of the [[spider web]].  He suggested that these programs were more realistic models of the evolutionary process, since they had no predetermined goal other than coming up with a web that caught more flies through a "trial and error" process.  Spiderwebs were seen as good topics for evolutionary modeling because they were simple examples of biosystems that were easily visualized; the modeling programs successfully generated a range of spider webs similar to those found in nature.

== Example algorithm ==
{{or section|date=August 2016}}
Although Dawkins did not provide the source code for his program, a "Weasel" style algorithm could run as follows.

# Start with a random string of 28 characters.
# Make 100 copies of the string (''reproduce'').
# For each character in each of the 100 copies, with a probability of 5%, replace (''mutate'') the character with a new random character.
#  Compare each new string with the target string "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL", and give each a score (the number of letters in the string that are correct and in the correct position).
# If any of the new strings has a perfect score (28), halt. Otherwise, take the highest scoring string, and go to step 2.

For these purposes, a "character" is any uppercase letter, or a space. The number of copies per generation, and the chance of mutation per letter are not specified in Dawkins's book; 100 copies and a 5% mutation rate are examples. Correct letters are not "locked". Each correct letter may become incorrect in subsequent generations. The terms of the program and the existence of the target phrase do however mean that such 'negative mutations' will quickly be 'corrected'.
