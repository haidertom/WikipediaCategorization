      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8759">An '''account manager''' is a person who works for a company and is responsible for the management of [[sales]] and [[Customer relationship management|relationships]] with particular [[customer]]s. An account manager maintains the company's existing relationships with a client or group of clients, so that they will continue using the company for business. The account manager does not manage the daily running of the account itself. They manage the relationship with the [[Customer|client]] of the account(s) they are assigned to. Generally, a client will remain with one account manager throughout the duration of hiring the company. Account managers serve as the interface between the [[customer service]] and the [[sales]] team in a company.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt; They are assigned a company's existing client accounts. The purpose of being assigned particular clients is to create long term relationships with the portfolio of assigned clients. The account manager serves to understand the customer's demands, plan how to meet these demands, and generate sales for the company as a result.&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Handbook_of_Model_Job_Descriptions.html?id=z6R_uExfMGAC

'''Key accounts''' provide the most business because they contain a small number of clients which contribute a large portion of the company's sales. According to research, sales from a company's key accounts have increased from 23% in 1975 to 60% currently.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://members.chiefexecutive.com/display_article.asp?id=37111 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130815025753/http://members.chiefexecutive.com/display_article.asp?id=37111 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-08-15 |title=The Evolution of Key Account Management |author=Phill J. |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
The responsibilities of an account manager can vary depending on the industry they work in, size of the company and nature of the business. Each [[customer account]] can vary in demands and an account manager may work with [[brand manager]]s for one account and a media department for another. Account managers usually report directly to the account director or agency director of the activity and status of accounts and transactions. An account manager may also manage a single account or a variety of accounts depending on the requirement of the company. Although the responsibility can vary between companies and between accounts, there are a shared set of common responsibilities which are as follows:

# Generate sales for a portfolio of accounts and reach the company's [[sales target]]&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt;
# Identify new sales opportunities within existing accounts to retain a client-account manager relationship by [[up-selling]] and [[cross-selling]]&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt;
# Manage and solve conflicts with clients&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; The Account Manager is expected to have specific information regarding daily operations of the Company and keep the Client updated.
# Interact and coordinate with the sales team and other staff members in other departments working on the same account&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt;
# Establish budgets with the client and company&lt;ref name="sam"&gt;{{citation |url=http://salesmanagement.org/web/uploads/docs/0a8e2f77635dbfc5e2c2663404582988.pdf|title=Strategic Account Manager|author =The Sales Management Association.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Meet time deadlines for accounts&lt;ref name="sam"&gt;{{citation |url=http://salesmanagement.org/web/uploads/docs/0a8e2f77635dbfc5e2c2663404582988.pdf|title=Strategic Account Manager|author =The Sales Management Association.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are situations in which an account manager, for example in advertising firms, is responsible for more than one account and therefore looks after multiple clients. When account locations do not overlap the account manager can be placed at the divisional, district, or territory level. When a sales team has a senior sales manager, the account manager coordinates sales accounts from other departments or specialties.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYKyKAxpUvwC&amp;pg=PA102 |title=Sales management: a global perspective |author1=Earl D. Honeycutt |author2=John B. Ford |author3=Antonis C. Simintiras |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this scenario, the sales team will work under the direct supervision of influencers and deciders instead of with a [[buyer]].&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt;

* '''Global account managers:''' Manage company accounts worldwide. This typically occurs in large companies with international accounts.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt;
* '''National account managers:''' Manage numerous accounts nationwide. This typically occurs in medium to large companies when a company has multiple locations across the country.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt;

Global account managers and national account managers may work together in a hierarchical or matrix structure. The trend is to move responsibility for the major key accounts to the global level.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt;

==Key account manager==
Key account manager is assigned to a company headquarters to oversee the account team assigned to a particular account.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt; Key account management includes sales but also includes planning and managing the full relationship between a business and its most important customers. An account manager who works in this role will engage in a variety of tasks including [[project management]], coordination, [[strategic planning]], [[relationship management]], negotiation, leadership and innovative development of opportunities,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YutAr0bk2OUC&amp;pg=PA294 |title=Key Account Plans |author1=Lynette Ryals |author2=Malcolm McDonald |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and keeping record of transaction of sale and purchase goods. The tasks may include working with [[product design]] and application, [[logistics]], sales support, and [[marketing]].

==Key account management models==
The basic assumption for a key account management model is the correct classification of the key accounts. A basic model often used in the period of 1950-1970 was the classification model of Webster. This model has been adapted by Milman and Wilson into a two-dimensional model and was paramount in the period of 1970-1990. Bensaou has tested this model empirically by his research of [[carmaker]]s in the [[Automotive industry in the United States|United States]] and [[Automotive industry in Japan|Japan]] and made revisions. De Blick synthesized the adaptations into the 4S-model, a key account classification model.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor=Sloan Management Review volume 4 issue 4|title=Portfolios of buyer-seller relationships|author =M.Bensaou, |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, key account management spread to most B2B ([[business-to-business]]) models.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Global_Account_Management.html?id=QEwXt2F3GssC&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Global Account Management |author =Peter C.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work environment==
Account managers can work for small or large companies either corporate, financial, retail, or government for instance.&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; Any company with a specific clients they conduct business with, can employ an account manager. Typical employers can be: 
#Direct marketing consultancies and agencies
#Marketing departments 
#Major commercial organizations

Account managers usually work in an office setting and can work more than 40 hours weekly. Travel is usually included in the job description. National or global account managers will very likely experience extra travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://davidmaister.com/articles/key-account-management/
 |title=Key Account Management |author =David.M|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifications==
Although personality and an [[business acumen|aptitude for sales]] is key, a degree in business, marketing, or related field is typically required and depending on the nature of the account, a background in marketing or [[media studies]] may be preferred.&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; Due to each company having different requirements, it is important to obtain information from each potential company of employment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8155">'''Binding Corporate Rules''' or "BCRs" were developed by the [[European Union]] [[Article 29 Working Party]] to allow multinational [[corporation]]s, international organizations, and groups of companies to make intra-organizational transfers of personal data across borders in compliance with EU [[Data Protection Directive|Data Protection Law]]. The BCRs were developed as an alternative to the U.S. Department of Commerce EU [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles|Safe Harbor]] (which was for US organizations only, but has been declared invalid and replaced by the [https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S Privacy Shield Frameworks]) and the [https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en EU Model Contract Clauses].

BCRs are required to be approved by the [[national data protection authority|data protection authority]] in each EU Member State (such as the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] in the United Kingdom, [http://WWW.cnil.fr CNIL] in France, [http://www.agpd.es/portalwebAGPD/index-ides-idphp.php AEPD]  in Spain, etc.) in which the organization will rely on the BCRs. The EU has developed a mutual recognition process under which BCRs approved by one member state's data protection authority (known as the "lead" authority) and two other "co-lead" authorities, may be approved by the other relevant member states who may make comments and ask for amendments. Other members states, not part of mutual recognition process, will be also involved by the lead authority and will apply their own independent review process within a limited time-frame. The overall process for BCR acceptance takes usually between 6 and 9 months. This time frame does not include the required Data Protection setup, which should be already implemented within the company in order to comply with the current directive and its local implementation.

BCRs typically form stringent, intra-corporate global privacy policies, set of practices, processes and guidelines that satisfy EU standards and may be available as an alternative means of authorizing transfers of personal data (e.g., customer databases, HR information, etc.) outside of Europe.

BCRs should be seen as a framework for having different elements (internal legal agreement, policies, training, audit, etc.) providing compliance with EU data protection regulations and effective privacy and data protection.

It has to be noticed that, while originally designed for providing legal ground to international transfers, BCRs became de facto a corporation demonstration of its capacity to comply "at large" with personal data processing requirements. A corporation having BCRs applies this framework independently of international transfers and should be seen as part of the "Corporate Governance" or "Data Governance"

The Article 29 Working Party issued several guidance documents on BCR content, acceptance criteria and submission process.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/workinggroup/index_en.htm, ''see'' in particular documents WP 133, WP 153, WP 154, WP 155 at http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/workinggroup/wpdocs/2008_en.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

BCRs by themselves do not "authorize" all transfers automatically for all EU member states. Most of member states still require a formal "transfer notification" which is normally granted if the BCRs have been accepted by the relevant country.

The following companies have obtained authorizations for BCRs:&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, List of companies for which the EU BCR cooperation procedure is closed,http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=613841&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Board of Investment''' (BOI) is the national investment promotion agency of the Government of Mauritius with the mandate to promote and facilitate investment in the country. It is the first point of contact for investors exploring business opportunities in Mauritius and the region. BOI also assists investors in the growth, nurturing and diversification of their business.

With a view to facilitating the implementation of investment projects and, more importantly, to continuously improve the investment and business climate, BOI works in close collaboration with Government bodies, institutions and private sector companies.  [[Mauritius]] capitalized on the sale of strategic coastal land to foreigners through the Property Development Scheme programmes of the Board of Investment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccs.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CCS_Research-Report_Chinese_Presence_South-Africa_Mauritius_Honita_Cowaloosur_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

BOI has an important role of policy advocacy to continuously improve the competitiveness of Mauritius.

The Board of Investment accompanies investors looking at opportunities in Africa.

The Board of Investment (BOI) has been awarded the prestigious [http://www.investmauritius.com/media/185234/BOI_Certificate_ISO-9001.pdf ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management Certification] on 3 December 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8112">'''Body shopping''' is the practice of [[consultancy]] firms recruiting workers (generally in [[information technology]] sector) in order to contract their services out on tactical short to mid-term basis. IT services companies that practice body shopping assert that they provide real services (such as software development) rather than the "sham" of merely farming out professionals to overseas companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=39&amp;ndash;40|title=Virtual Migration|author=[[A. Aneesh|Aneesh Aneesh]]|chapter=Body Shopping|publisher=Duke University Press|date=2006|isbn=9780822336693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and origin ==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
Body shopping in IT originated during the mid-1990s when there was a huge demand for people with [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]], [[COBOL]] and related technology skills to prevent systems being affected by the [[Y2K]] bug.

Most specialist Y2K consulting companies operating in the US, Europe, the Middle East, Japan and Australia outsourced their technical manpower requirements to companies operating in India. 

During the period of 1996-97, such companies operating with India base responded to the heavy demand by recruiting and training local graduates in India specifically for [[Y2K]]. Their consultants either worked onshore or offshore at high utilization rates generating huge [[profit margin]]s and cash reserves. The high-profit margin during this period resulted in fast growth and sufficient assets to invest and expand operations to other IT related business segments post-Y2K.

=== Modern era ===
In the modern era of IT off-shoring, outsourcing, and cloud computing, it is widely accepted that IT service companies' strategy (especially for those operating with a huge technical manpower base in India) still continue to focus on similar lines. The companies that do body shopping are renowned for training and developing technical skills for a wide range of client base that is of current demand.
Researchers point out that many Indian companies focus heavily on developing a large pool of human resources with technical skills creating a [[marketplace]] to 'buy' technical skills on an hourly or daily basis.

This led to significant market developments in two areas in the early 2000s:

# Fierce competition amongst IT service companies from India competing on a global level to win 'time and material and labor tenders' from multinational giants for their IT needs. Such a strategy, though heavily linked to procurement needs of the end-customer, enables IT companies operating from offshore (in particular India) to forecast demand for technical and managerial competencies based on IT-skills-market trends in order to position themselves competitively.&lt;ref name=body&gt;Brenda S. Yeoh and Katie Willis, editors, 'State/Nation/Transnation: Perspectives on Transnationalism in the Asia-Pacific', Routledge, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-415-30279-1}}, pp. 166-167.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Technology and consulting companies operating mainly in western markets during the 1990s (e.g. [[Accenture]], [[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard]]) were forced to open offices in southeast Asia and move their manpower base there to compete with traditional manpower providers operated from India (e.g. [[Infosys]], [[Wipro]], [[Tata Consultancy Services]]) on large global-level IT bids.

According to a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services report to Congress, for fiscal year 2012, 59 percent of H-1B visas went to computer-related occupations. The same report also cited that 64 percent of the H-1B visa petitions granted were given to workers originating from India.&lt;ref name="Indentured Servitude"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stock |last2=Putnam |last3=Pham |last4=Carroll |first1=Stephen |first2=Julie |first3=Scott |first4=Jeremy|title=Silicon Valley's "Body Shop" Secret: Highly Educated Foreign Workers Treated Like Indentured Servants|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/Silicon-Valleys-Body-Shop-Secret-280567322.html|website=NBC Bay Area|publisher=The Investigate Unit|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Report&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Vallance|first1=Brian|title=Characteristics of H1B Specialty Occupation Workers|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1347381-2b-h1b-fy-12-characteristics.html|website=Document Cloud|publisher=US Citizenship and Immigration Services|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revenue model ==
Body shopping companies mainly recruit off-shore and provide training to their employees using their off-shore facilities.

Employment costs (both short-term and permanent) are generally offset by the highly profitable billing ratio, especially for on-site assignments abroad. Most companies boast a utilization rate of 80%, which also takes into account the potentially long 'bench period', where an employee is not billable or when their skills are not in demand.

== Indian body shopping networks ==
In India, traditional body shopping has evolved in its due course post-[[Y2K]] era to create strong networking and collaboration between competing Indian body shops working abroad. All body shops claim to have the ability to place Indian workers in almost any country using the resources and services of other Indian body shops operating in the target country.&lt;ref name=Biao1&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Brenda S. Yeoh |editor2=Katie Willis |title=State/Nation/Transnation: Perspectives on Transnationalism in the Asia-Pacific|publisher=Routledge|date=2004|isbn=978-0-415-30279-1|pages=166&amp;ndash;167|author=Xiang Biao|chapter=Indian information technology professionals' world system: the nation and the transnation in individuals' migration strategies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one documented case study deemed as a typical example, a body shop in Hyderabad was able to win a 360 man-month deal with a U.S. company that urgently needed 40 IT workers with a very "specific" skill on a 9-month project. Although the Indian body shop company could easily find lower paid workers in India for the job, the [[H-1B visa]] process would take too long to bring them into the United States to work. Thus, the Indian firm forwarded a request to its associates' network to locate 40 Indian temporary workers in the United States. A search was undertaken by the network for available Indian H-1B workers, resulting in a list of recently laid-off Indian H-1B workers in the US. Sponsorship for the laid-off Indian H-1B workers was reassigned to a body shop and a portion of the newly employed worker's salary was given as commission to the peer body shop that helped to locate the laid off H-1B workers in their associated peer network of Indian body shops. This process of quickly recruiting available H-1B holders is what is referred to as "body shopping".&lt;ref name=Biao1/&gt;

== Offshoring and nearshoring ==

A similar "[[offshoring]]" practice started appearing more and more in the 2010 timeframe and which was a practice known as "[[nearshoring]]".  Nearshoring was the practice of hiring mostly IT professionals from Mexico.  The outward appearance being the advantage of "nearshoring" personnel being within a 2 hour or less time difference to continental U.S. companies opting to use these nearshoring services.

Retrieved 2012-11-29. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses this definition as part of its ongoing [http://www.themasb.org/common-language-project/ Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212100753/http://www.themasb.org/common-language-project/ |date=2013-02-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

The purpose of the BDI metric is to quantify the relative performance of a brand within specified customer groups. The index helps marketers identify strong and weak segments (usually demographic or geographic) for individual brands.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

The BDI is especially useful in conjunction with the [[category development index (marketing)|category development index]] (CDI). It can be used in deciding the allocations in the media to which a specific brand is advertised. It can also be used to determine how much advertising, or promotion effort is, or should be put in that specific market.

==Construction==
'''BDI''': An index of how well a brand performs within a given market group, relative to its performance in the market as a whole.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

::BDI (I) = 	
::[Brand sales to group (#) Ã· Households in group (#)] Ã· 
::[Total brand sales (#) Ã· Total households (#)]
::
::''Note: Although defined here with respect to households, these indexes could also be calculated for customers, accounts, businesses, or other entities.'' &lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

For example, one might hypothesize that sales per capita of [[Ben &amp; Jerry's]] brand ice cream would be greater in the brand's home state, Vermont, than in the rest of the country. By calculating Ben &amp; Jerry's BDIs for Vermont and for the rest of the country, marketers could test this hypothesis quantitatively.

Govoni also defined the BDI as the index of brand sales to category sales,&lt;ref&gt;Govoni, Norman A. ''[http://promoprof.babson.edu/Glossary/b/GlossaryB.htm  Dictionary of Marketing Communications]'', Sage Publications, Inc, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; though this ratio is more commonly referred to as market share.

'''Business Intelligence Markup Language''' (Biml) is a domain-specific [[XML]] dialect for defining [[business intelligence]] (BI) assets.  Biml authored BI assets can currently be used by the [[BIDS Helper]] add-on for [[Microsoft SQL Server]] [[Business Intelligence Development Studio]] (BIDS) and the [[Varigence]] Mist (now called BimlStudio) [[integrated development environment]]; both tools translate Biml metadata into [[SQL Server Integration Services]] (SSIS) and [[Microsoft Analysis Services|SQL Server Analysis Services]] (SSAS) assets for the [[Microsoft SQL Server]] platform. However, emitters can be created to compile Biml for any desired BI platform.

While Bimlâs declarative design is sufficient to author BI assets, BimlScript extends the language by enabling authors to embed [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] or [[VB.NET]] code within Biml, similar to how [[ASP.NET]] includes .NET code within static [[HTML]] markup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chenn|first=Ronen|title=BIDS helper new features ( April 2011 )|url=http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/bilive/archive/2011/05/16/bids-helper-new-features-april-2011.aspx|accessdate=October 1, 2012|newspaper=Business Intelligence,Technology, Thoughts, Thinking|date=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BimlScript is used to merge changes into existing Biml assets, automatically generate Biml code, and apply changes across multiple Biml files during compilation.

==History==

===Biml===

Biml is an XML dialect that specifies all aspects of a BI solution, including relational models, data transformation packages, multi-dimensional models, and tabular models.

Unlike other BI solutions, Biml has a "write once, target any platform" philosophy. This enables Biml users to switch their target platform without needing to change their code. Currently, Biml targets SQL Server versions 2005, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012 and 2014, emitting SSIS packages and SSAS cubes.

Because Biml is XML, it can leverage the vast ecosystem of tools for XML based languages. This also makes it human readable/writeable, so it is easier to edit by hand than the SSIS/SSAS files it generates.

In late 2009, Biml was extended with BimlScript. BimlScript allows C# or VB.NET code nuggets to be embedded directly within Biml. BimlScript's goal is to automate repetitive work in reusable scripts. Additionally, it's been used to automate package generation and build reusable patterns for BI tasks. BimlScript is also used to take metadata from various sources (relational database structure, relational data, flat files, annotations, etc...) and automatically generate Biml code from it.

===Mist===
[[Mist (IDE)|Mist]] is an IDE for authoring Biml code and building BI assets. Mist leverages visual design capabilities and [[debugging]] features to simultaneously edit entire business intelligence models, including relational tables, SSIS packages, and [[OLAP cube|cubes]].&lt;ref name="Leonard2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Andy|title=SQL Server 2012 Integration Services Design Patterns|year=2012|publisher=APress|isbn=978-1430237716|pages=456|author2=Masson, Matt |author3=Mitchell, Tim |author4=Moss, Jessica |author5= Ufford, Michelle |chapter=Chapter 17: Business Intelligence Markup Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Mist also incorporates modern programming IDE features, including text editors with syntax highlighting, Intelliprompt and quick-info displays, source control integration, and multi-monitor support.

===BIDS Helper===
As Bimlâs popularity has grown, key portions of the Biml engine, including dynamic package generation, have been contributed to the [http://bidshelper.codeplex.com BIDS Helper] open source project hosted on CodePlex.&lt;ref name="Tok2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tok|first=Wee-Hyong|title=Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Integration Services|year=2012|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn= 978-0735665859|author2=Parida, Rakesh |author3=Masson, Matt |author4=Ding, Xiaoning |author5= Sivashanmugam, Kaarthik  |page=511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Welch|first=John|title=Biml Package Generator|url=http://bidshelper.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Biml%20Package%20Generator|work=BIDS Helper|accessdate=September 30, 2011|date=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BimlScript community===
[http://www.bimlscript.com BimlScript.com] is a community website for developing and sharing Biml solutions to BI problems, and contributing Biml content to share with others. Along with tutorials, walkthroughs, and videos, the site provides an online Biml editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to BimlScript.com|url=http://bimlscript.com/Blog|work=BimlScript.com|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Code generation==
Biml files are compiled to produce BI assets for a chosen platform. Currently, itâs possible to generate assets for Microsoftâs SSIS, SSAS, and SQL Server platforms, for the 2005, 2008 (R2), 2012 and 2014 releases. Other platforms may be targeted in the future.

==Syntax==
{{See also|XML#Key_terminology|l1=XML Terminology}}
Biml has a syntax thatâs common to all XML languages. Tags begin and end with &lt; and &gt;, respectively. Furthermore, tags can have attributes and nested elements.

===Biml===

====Declaration====
Biml documents begin with a common declaration
&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt;
&lt;Biml xmlns="http://schemas.varigence.com/biml.xsd"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====Root types====
Biml has a well-defined set of root types, indicating the various kinds of BI assets that can be created

* Connections
* Databases
* Schemas
* Tables
* Dimensions
* Facts
* Packages
* File Formats
* Script Projects
* Cubes
* Principals

====Example====
This is an example of the AdventureWorks DimCurrency table, authored in Biml

&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt;
&lt;Biml xmlns="http://schemas.varigence.com/biml.xsd"&gt;
  &lt;Dimensions&gt;
    &lt;Dimension Name="DimCurrency" SchemaName="Target.dbo" AttributeAllMemberName="All Source Currencies" DimensionType="Currency" FriendlyName="Currency"&gt;
      &lt;Columns&gt;
        &lt;Column Name="CurrencyKey" /&gt;
        &lt;Column Name="CurrencyAlternateKey" DataType="StringFixedLength" Length="3" /&gt;
        &lt;Column Name="CurrencyName" DataType="String" Length="50" /&gt;
      &lt;/Columns&gt;
      &lt;Keys&gt;
        &lt;Identity Name="IK_DimCurrency"&gt;
          &lt;Columns&gt;
            &lt;Column ColumnName="CurrencyKey" /&gt;
          &lt;/Columns&gt;
        &lt;/Identity&gt;
        &lt;UniqueKey Name="AK_DimCurrency_CurrencyAlternateKey"&gt;
          &lt;Columns&gt;
            &lt;Column ColumnName="CurrencyAlternateKey" /&gt;
          &lt;/Columns&gt;
        &lt;/UniqueKey&gt;
      &lt;/Keys&gt;
      &lt;Indexes&gt;&lt;/Indexes&gt;
      &lt;Attributes&gt;
        &lt;Attribute Name="Source Currency" EstimatedCount="101" OrderBy="Name" AttributeType="CurrencySource" GroupingBehavior="DiscourageGrouping"&gt;
          &lt;InstanceSelection&gt;DropDown&lt;/InstanceSelection&gt;
          &lt;KeyColumns&gt;
            &lt;KeyColumn ColumnName="CurrencyName" NullProcessing="Error" /&gt;
          &lt;/KeyColumns&gt;
        &lt;/Attribute&gt;
        &lt;Attribute Name="Source Currency Code" EstimatedCount="105" OrderBy="Name" AttributeType="CurrencyIsoCode" Usage="Key" GroupingBehavior="DiscourageGrouping"&gt;
          &lt;InstanceSelection&gt;DropDown&lt;/InstanceSelection&gt;
          &lt;KeyColumns&gt;
            &lt;KeyColumn ColumnName="CurrencyKey" NullProcessing="Error" /&gt;
          &lt;/KeyColumns&gt;
          &lt;NameColumn ColumnName="CurrencyAlternateKey" /&gt;
        &lt;/Attribute&gt;
      &lt;/Attributes&gt;
      &lt;Relationships&gt;
        &lt;Relationship Name="Source Currency" ParentAttributeName="Source Currency Code" ChildAttributeName="Source Currency" Type="Rigid" /&gt;
      &lt;/Relationships&gt;
    &lt;/Dimension&gt;
  &lt;/Dimensions&gt;
&lt;/Biml&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===BimlScript===
All BimlScript tags begin and end with &lt;# and #&gt; delimiters, respectively. Special types of BimlScript tags use augmented versions of these delimiters, to indicate specific usages.

====Directives====
A Biml file, with BimlScript, begins with at least one directive. Directives provide instructions to the Biml engine, regarding how to process the BimlScript and generate its Biml. Directives are single tags that begin with &lt;#@. Each directive begins with a single term, followed by attributes that supply required values.

The two most common directives are template and import.

=====Template=====
This directive indicates that the file's BimlScript uses the C# programming language.
&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt;
&lt;#@ template language="C#" #&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=====Import=====
This directive specifies .NET namespaces that should be imported for the file. It is functionally equivalent to the C# using statement or VB.NET Imports statement.
&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Languages.Biml.Connection" #&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====Delimiters====
When authoring BimlScript, additional delimiters may be used. These delimiters match the behavior of T4 template delimiters.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Delimiter !! Description
|-
| &lt;# || Defines statements, in .NET code, that provide control flow in a Biml file.
|-
| &lt;#= || Evaluates .NET code, converts it to a string, and then embeds it in the Biml file.
|-
| &lt;#+ || Defines properties, methods, and files that are excluded from the Biml file but may be accessed by other BimlScript code nuggets.
|}

====Example====
This BimlScript example imports a database's assets via a connection, declared in a separate file, named "AdventureWorksLT". Each schema and table from the imported database is then embedded directly within the Schemas and Tables collections, respectively.
&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt; 
&lt;#@ template language="C#" hostspecific="True" tier="2" #&gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Languages.Biml.Connection" #&gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Hadron.Extensions" #&gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Hadron.Extensions.SchemaManagement" #&gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Hadron.CoreLowerer.SchemaManagement" #&gt;

&lt;#+ public ImportResults Results
{ 
    get 
    { 
        return ((AstOleDbConnectionNode)RootNode.Connections["AdventureWorksLT"]).ImportDB();
    }
}
#&gt; 

&lt;Biml xmlns="http://schemas.varigence.com/biml.xsd"&gt;
    &lt;Databases&gt;
        &lt;Database Name="MyDatabase" ConnectionName="AdventureWorksLT" /&gt;
    &lt;/Databases&gt;
    &lt;Schemas&gt;
        &lt;#=Results.SchemaNodes.GetBiml()#&gt;
    &lt;/Schemas&gt;
    &lt;Tables&gt; 
        &lt;#=Results.TableNodes.GetBiml()#&gt;
    &lt;/Tables&gt;
&lt;/Biml&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This example shows how developers can use Biml and BimlScript to:
# Import schemas and tables directly from a database, and use them without needing to manually copy their structure.
# Have any changes to the assets be automatically reflected the next time this code is run.
# Import the assets and convert them to Biml using only two simple lines of code.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16948">'''Business education''' involves teaching students the fundamentals, theories, and processes of [[business]]. Education in this field occurs at several levels, including [[secondary education]] and [[higher education]] or [[university]] education.  Approximately 38% of students enroll in one or more business courses during their high school tenure.

==Secondary education==
{{Main|Business studies}}

Business is taught as an academic subject at [[secondary education|secondary]] level in many countries, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Nepal]], [[New Zealand]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nigeria]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Argentina]], [[Sweden]], [[Tanzania]], [[Malaysia]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. At pre-tertiary level, it is often called '''Business Studies''', and usually combines elements of [[accountancy]], [[finance]], [[marketing]], [[organizational studies]], [[human resource management]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sh.se/p3/ext/content.nsf/aget?openagent&amp;key=about_the_subject_1298025420871|title=Business studies|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Undergraduate education==
At the [[university]] level, students have the opportunity to take [[undergraduate degree]]s, usually a [[bachelor's degree]], in business and management. Specific curricula and degree-granting procedures differ by program and by region.  In general though, the program will comprise either preparation for management and general business, or a detailed - more academic - focus on a specific area. Regardless, all will typically include basic selections such as Accounting, Marketing, Finance, and [[Operations Management]].

Management-directed programs&lt;ref&gt;See for example BBA program outlines at: [https://www.uregina.ca/admin/academic/business_school/majors.htm uregina.ca]; [http://iitrade.ac.in/courses.asp?detail=bba Institute of International Trade]&lt;/ref&gt; are designed to give a broad knowledge of the functional areas of a company, and their interconnection, and also to develop the student's practical managerial skills, communication skills and business decision-making capability. These programs thus incorporate [[training]] and practical experience, in the form of [[case study|case projects]], presentations, [[internship]]s, industrial visits, and interaction with experts from the industry.

Subject specific programs, on the other hand, focus on a particular area, and are often more weighted towards theory. Even in these cases, however, additional to their [[academic major|major]], students are exposed to general business principles, taking initial courses in accounting/finance, human resources, statistics, marketing, economics, and information systems.

Degrees offered here include:
* The [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] (BBA) degree is awarded to students who complete three to four years of full-time study in [[business administration]]. The degree often, though not always, requires a major in a specific field such as [[accountancy|accounting]], finance, [[human resource management|HRM/personnel]], marketing, [[management]], [[management information systems]], [[real estate]], [[strategic management]], or others. Similar programs include the [[Bachelor of Science in Business Administration]] (BSBA), a quantitative variant on the BBA, [[Bachelor of Science in Business]] and [[Bachelor of Administrative Studies]] degrees. The [[Bachelor of Public Administration]] (BPA) is an [[undergraduate degree]] in [[public administration]]. The [[Bachelor of Business Management]]/[[Bachelor of Management Studies]] are similar to the BBA, but with a stronger emphasis on leadership and management skills.
* The Bachelor of International Business economics (BIBE) degree is awarded to students who complete four years of full-time study in business administration. In the last 2 years students must choose a specific field (such as the ones mentioned in the BBA). This degree is taught only in English and its aim is to enable students to work abroad and be prepared to manage large, multinational firms. It is compulsory to study abroad for at least 6 months. This degree appeared with the Bologna Process in Europe and is taught in universities like the [[Pompeu Fabra University]].
* The [[Bachelor of Commerce]] (B.Com, or B.Comm; [[Bachelor of Commerce and Administration]] (BCA) is an alternate title) is, likewise, an undergraduate degree in general [[business management]], although it is more theory-based and usually incorporates an [[Bachelor of Commerce#Areas of study|academic major]]. The distinction between the B.Comm and the BBA, then, is often that the latter specifically applies theories to real-life business situations, while the former concentrates more broadly on a wide range of ideas and concepts in [[commerce]] and related subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBA and BCom: What's the difference? |url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bba-amd-bcom-whats-difference |publisher=University of Toronto â News@UofT |website=News.utoronto.ca |date=10 June 2008 |accessdate=8 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628141733/http://www.news.utoronto.ca/social-sciences-business-law/bba-amd-bcom-whats-the-difference.html |archivedate=28 June 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Bachelor of Business]] (B.Bus or B.Bus (Major)) degree is an undergraduate degree in general business management offered by universities in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. Similar in nature to the Bachelor of Commerce degree, Bachelor of Business degrees are often awarded at technology-focused universities in accordance with the Dawkins review (1986) of the Australian higher education sector. At many Australian universities, a Bachelor of Business degree enables graduates to undertake greater specialty in their chosen academic major as compared to a general BBA degree.
* The [[Bachelor of Management and Organizational Studies]] degree (BMOS in Canada) is a four-year undergraduate degree in business management. However, this degree teaches knowledge-based business and is as much theoretical as it is case-based. The BMOS degree especially emphasizes social sciences such as psychology, sociology, economics, etc.
* The [[Bachelor of Business Science]] (B.Bus.Sc) degree is similar to the BCom. However, it is a four-year honors-level course with an increased focus on the major and covers [[list of management topics|management theory]] in further depth. Also, students taking this approach are able to major in various quantitative disciplines not (typically) available in the B.Comm or BBA; related to thisâand similarly in distinctionâ''all'' B.Bus.Sc students require a full first-year [[mathematics]] course, and in addition to this, courses in statistics.
* The [[Bachelor of Accountancy]] (B.Acy or B.Acc or B. Accty) degree is a specialized degree in accountancy; it is often the principal (or only) undergraduate degree [[First professional degree#Professional degrees|recognized for later professional practice]]. It is distinct from a BBA or B.Comm with a major in accountancy in that the entire program is focused on accountancy, while other topics are supplementary. It is also known as Bachelor of Accounting, Bachelor of Accounting Science, or Bachelor of Comptrolling (B.Acc.Sci or B.Compt).
* The [[Bachelor of Economics]] (B.Ec, B.Econ.Sc; sometimes BA (Econ), B.Sc (Econ), B.S.Sc (Econ) or BBA (Econ)) degree is similarly a specialized degree in the field of economics. Courses may last anywhere from three years to six years and are typically more [[theoretical]] and [[mathematical]] than the BBA or B.Comm with a major in economics (often substantially so). Economics is not a business discipline ''per se'' but a social science, and economics degrees are therefore often offered through liberal arts colleges.
* There are various other specialized business degrees such as the [[Bachelor of Finance and Banking]]. A further example is the [[Bachelor of Arts in Organizational Management]] (BAOM) degree, which is awarded to students who complete a four-year course of study in the field. The core functions of this program are the teaching of organizational functions, communication, group behavior, decision-making, human resources management, ethics, and to develop and deploy in the students effective skills in management and leadership. Also offered are the [[Bachelor of Science in Business Education]] (BSBE), an undergraduate degree in [[the teaching of business]] and the [[Bachelor of Business Teacher Education]] (BBTE), a variant on the BSBE.

==Postgraduate education==
At the [[graduate school]] level, students seek a variety of [[master's degrees]], either in [[general management]]âvery commonly the [[MBA]]âor in a specific area, such as marketing or finance.  A further distinction is that students pursuing postgraduate degrees often have some business experience, although this is not always a program requirement. 

Corresponding to both of these, graduate degrees in business and management are generally of two sorts. 
* On the one hand, programs such as the Master of Science (M.Sc) or Arts (MA) or Commerce (M.Com) in General Management (sometimes also called Master in Management, or MIM) usually do not require professional experience. (Often the M.Sc in Management is for graduates with a first academic degree in a social science, while the MA in Management is for other backgrounds. The Master of Engineering Management, MEM, is aimed at graduates with an engineering background.) 
* On the other hand, the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) requires a minimum of two to three years of professional experience and is open for graduates from any field. 

A related distinction: the M.Sc in Management is more specialized than an MBA, and is more suited for academic research, while the MBA is more industry- and management-focused. 

As regards degree structure, postgraduate business programs are, in general, designed such that students gain exposure to theory and practice alike;&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [http://www.hbs.edu/mba/academic-experience/Pages/the-hbs-case-method.aspx "The HBS case-method", hbs.edu]; [http://www.chicagobooth.edu/about/chicago-approach "The Chicago Approach", chicagobooth.edu]; [http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/mba/learning/practical-learning/ "Practical Learning", jbs.cam.ac.uk]; [http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/mba/academic-experience "Academic Experience", gsb.stanford.edu].&lt;/ref&gt; the mix, though, will differ by degree and by school,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronaldyeaple/2012/07/09/is-the-mba-case-method-passe/ Is the MBA Case Method PassÃ©?] [[forbes.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; as discussed. Learning is then through lectures, case studies, and often team projects (âsyndicateâ work). The theory is covered in the classroom setting by [[Professor|academic faculty]]. Particularly in the MBA, the theory is then reinforced, and revisited, also in the classroom setting, through the [[case method]], placing the student in the role of the decision maker, "complete with the constraints and incomplete information found in real business issues." Practical learning often comprises [[Management consulting|consulting project]]s with real clients, or at least addressing an actual case, and is often undertaken in teams. The practical elements (as well as the case studies) may involve [[Professor#Non-tenure-track positions 2|external practitioners]], and sometimes executives, supporting the teaching from academic faculty.  (See [[Business school #Use of case studies]] and [[Business_school#Other_approaches|#Other approaches]].) One of the challenges for business academics is demonstrating that their curriculum is relevant to those who want to become managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacIntosh|first=Robert|last2=Beech|first2=Nic|last3=Bartunek|first3=Jean|last4=Mason|first4=Katy|last5=Cooke|first5=Bill|last6=Denyer|first6=David|date=2017-01-01|title=Impact and Management Research: Exploring Relationships between Temporality, Dialogue, Reflexivity and Praxis|journal=British Journal of Management|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=3â13|doi=10.1111/1467-8551.12207|issn=1467-8551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctoral==
At the [[doctoral]] level, all degrees offered are research focused, although they do differ as regards their relative weightings of theory versus practice. Typically, the DBA, DPA, DHA and D.Mgt emphasize [[Management#Levels of management|managerial practice]] alongside research; relatedly, the theses for these degrees will often focus on [[applied research]]. The other doctorates here are (exclusively) theory and research based. Entrance is usually on the basis of a relevant master's degree, and for practice-weighted degrees, relevant managerial experience. For the topic areas applicable to the [[thesis]] component see: [[List of fields of doctoral studies in the United States#Business Management.2FAdministrative Services|List of fields of doctoral studies in the United States
 #Business Management/Administrative Services]]. Degrees offered here include:
*[[Doctor of Business Administration]] (DBA)
*[[Doctor of Commerce]] (D.Com)
*[[Doctor of Health Administration]] (D.H.A.)
*[[Doctor of Management]] (D.M., D.Mgt)
*[[Doctor of Public Administration]] (DPA)
*[[PhD in Management]] (Ph.D)
*[[Ph.D/M.B.A]] ([[double degree]])
*[[Fellow Program in Management]] (FPM)
*[[Engineering Doctorate]] (EngD), A professional doctorate involving a management thesis and taught MBA courses in the UK

Originally, this was associated with [[manufacturing]] firms, such as [[Coca-Cola]] that outsourced large segments of its [[supply chain]].&lt;ref&gt;Tas, J. &amp; Sunder, S. 2004, ''Financial Services Business Process Outsourcing'', Communications of the ACM, Vol 47, No. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

BPO is typically categorized into [[back office]] outsourcing, which includes ''internal business functions'' such as [[human resources]] or [[finance]] and [[accounting]], and [[front office]] outsourcing, which includes ''customer-related services'' such as [[contact centre (business)|contact centre]] (customer care) services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work = Forbes |title = Getting A Piece Of Business Process Outsourcing |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2015/06/22/getting-a-piece-of-business-process-outsourcing/#12b9f2c56f90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BPO that is contracted outside a company's country is called [[offshore outsourcing]]. BPO that is contracted to a company's neighbouring (or nearby) country is called [[nearshoring|nearshore outsourcing]].

Often the business processes are [[information technology]]-based, and are referred to as '''ITES-BPO''', where ITES stands for Information Technology Enabled Service.&lt;ref name="NellisParker2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. G. Nellis|author2=David Parker|title=Principles of Business Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a8RFUZHfz2gC&amp;pg=PA213|year=2006|publisher=Financial Times Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-273-69306-2|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Knowledge process outsourcing]] (KPO) and [[legal process outsourcing]] (LPO) are some of the sub-segments of business process outsourcing industry.

==Benefits==
The main advantage of any BPO is the way in which it helps increase a company's flexibility. However, several sources{{Which|date=August 2009}} have different ways in which they perceive organizational flexibility. In early 2000s BPO was all about cost efficiency, which allowed a certain level of flexibility at the time. Due to technological advances and changes in the industry (specifically the move to more service-based rather than product-based contracts), companies who choose to outsource their back-office increasingly look for time flexibility and direct quality control.&lt;ref&gt;Sagoo, Anoop. [http://www.cio.co.uk/article/3378334/how-it-is-reinvigorating-business-process-outsourcing/ "How IT is reinvigorating business process outsourcing"] CIO. 6 Sep 2012. Retrieved 25 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Business process outsourcing enhances the flexibility of an organization in different ways:

Most services provided by BPO vendors are offered on a fee-for-service basis, using business models such as Remote In-Sourcing or similar software development and outsourcing models.&lt;ref&gt;BPM Watch. "In-Sourcing Remotely: A Closer Look at an Emerging Outsourcing Trend" {{cite web |url=http://www.bpmwatch.com/columns/in-sourcing-a-closer-look-at-an-emerging-outsourcing-trend/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303212216/http://www.bpmwatch.com/columns/in-sourcing-a-closer-look-at-an-emerging-outsourcing-trend/ |archivedate=2013-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cio-asia.com/mgmt/outsourcing/boundaries-between-it-outsourcing-and-bpo-are-becoming-blurred-ovum/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025113103/http://www.cio-asia.com/mgmt/outsourcing/boundaries-between-it-outsourcing-and-bpo-are-becoming-blurred-ovum/ |archive-date=2014-10-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can help a company to become more flexible by transforming fixed into [[variable costs]].&lt;ref&gt;Willcocks, L., Hindle, J., Feeny, D. &amp; Lacity, M. 2004, ''IT and Business Process Outsourcing: The Knowledge Potential'', Information Systems Management, Vol. 21, pp 7â15&lt;/ref&gt; A variable cost structure helps a company responding to changes in required capacity and does not require a company to invest in assets, thereby making the company more flexible.&lt;ref&gt;Gilley, K.M., Rasheed, A. 2000. ''Making More by Doing Less: An Analysis of Outsourcing and its Effects on Firm Performance.'' Journal of Management, 26 (4): 763-790.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way in which BPO contributes to a companyâs flexibility is that a company is able to focus on its [[core competencies]], without being burdened by the demands of bureaucratic restraints.&lt;ref&gt;Kakabadse, A., Kakabadse. N. 2002. ''Trends in Outsourcing: Contrasting USA and Europe.'' European Management Journal Vol. 20, No. 2: 189â198&lt;/ref&gt; Key employees are herewith released from performing non-core or administrative processes and can invest more time and energy in building the firmâs core businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Weerakkody, Vishanth, Currie, L. Wendy and Ekanayake, Yamaya. 2003.  ''Re-engineering business processes through application service providers â challenges, issues and complexities.'' Business Process Management Journal Vol. 9 No. 6: 776-794&lt;/ref&gt; The key lies in knowing which of the main value drivers to focus on â customer intimacy, product leadership, or operational excellence. Focusing more on one of these drivers may help a company create a competitive edge.&lt;ref&gt;Leavy, B. 2004. ''Outsourcing strategies: opportunities and risk.'' Strategy and Leadership, 32 (6) : 20-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third way in which BPO increases organizational flexibility is by increasing the speed of business processes. Supply chain management with the effective use of supply chain partners and business process outsourcing increases the speed of several business processes, such as the throughout in the case of a manufacturing company.&lt;ref&gt;Tas, Jeroen, Sunder, Shyam. 2004. ''Financial Services Business Process Outsourcing.'' COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM Vol. 47, No. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, flexibility is seen as a stage in the organizational life cycle: A company can maintain growth goals while avoiding standard business bottlenecks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.strategy-business.com/press/16635507/11153 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408061144/http://www.strategy-business.com/press/16635507/11153 |archive-date=2008-04-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; BPO therefore allows firms to retain their entrepreneurial speed and agility, which they would otherwise sacrifice in order to become efficient as they expanded. It avoids a premature internal transition from its informal entrepreneurial phase to a more bureaucratic mode of operation.&lt;ref&gt;(Leavy 2004, 20-25)&lt;/ref&gt;

A company may be able to grow at a faster pace as it will be less constrained by large capital expenditures for people or equipment that may take years to amortize, may become outdated or turn out to be a poor match for the company over time.

Although the above-mentioned arguments favour the view that BPO increases the flexibility of organizations, management needs to be careful with the implementation of it as there are issues, which work against these advantages. Among problems, which arise in practice are: A failure to meet service levels, unclear contractual issues, changing requirements and unforeseen charges, and a dependence on the BPO which reduces flexibility. Consequently, these challenges need to be considered before a company decides to engage in business process outsourcing.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, Vaughan, Fitzgerald, Guy. 1997. ''The IT outsourcing market place: vendors and their selection.'' Journal of Information Technology 12: 223-237&lt;/ref&gt;

A further issue is that in many cases there is little that differentiates the BPO providers other than size. They often provide similar services, have similar geographic footprints, leverage similar technology stacks, and have similar Quality Improvement approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Adsit, D. (2009)  Will a Toyota Emerge from the Pack of Me-Too BPO's?, ''In Queue'' {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalcallcenters.org/pubs/In_Queue/vol3no21.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410035351/http://www.nationalcallcenters.org/pubs/In_Queue/vol3no21.html |archivedate=2009-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats==
Risk is the major drawback with business process outsourcing. Outsourcing of an information system, for example, can cause security risks both from a communication and from a privacy perspective. For example, security of North American or European company data is more difficult to maintain when accessed or controlled in other countries.{{fact|date=September 2016}} From a knowledge perspective, a changing attitude in employees, underestimation of running costs and the major risk of losing independence, outsourcing leads to a different relationship between an organization and its contractor.&lt;ref&gt;Bunmi Cynthia Adeleye, Fenio Annansingh and Miguel Baptista Nunes. "Risk management practices in IS outsourcing: an investigation into commercial banks in Nigeria", International Journal of Information Management 24 (2004): 167-180.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Altinkemer, A. Chaturvedi and R. Gulati. "Information systems outsourcing: Issues and evidence", International Journal of Information Management 14- 4 (1994): 252- 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Risks and threats of outsourcing must therefore be managed, to achieve any benefits. In order to manage outsourcing in a structured way, maximising positive outcome, minimising risks and avoiding any threats, a [[business continuity management]] (BCM) model is set up. BCM consists of a set of steps, to successfully identify, manage and control the business processes that are, or can be outsourced.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes Gibb, and Steven Buchanan. "A framework for business continuity management", International Journal of Information Management 26- 2 (2006): 128- 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Analytical hierarchy process''' [[analytic hierarchy process|(AHP)]] is a framework of BPO focused on identifying potential outsourceable information systems.&lt;ref&gt;Chyan Yang and Jen-Bor Huang. "A decision model for IS outsourcing", International Journal of Information Management 20- 3 (2000): 225- 239.&lt;/ref&gt; L. Willcocks, M. Lacity and G. Fitzgerald identify several contracting problems companies face, ranging from unclear contract formatting, to a lack of understanding of technical IT processes.&lt;ref&gt;L. Willcocks, M. Lacity and G. Fitzgerald. "Information technology outsourcing in Europe and the USA: Assessment issues", International Journal of Information Management 15- 5 (1995): 333- 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological pressures===
Industry analysts have identified [[robotic process automation]] (RPA) software as a potential threat to the industry&lt;ref name="HfSThreat"&gt;{{Citation|title=Robotic Automation Emerges as a Threat to Traditional Low Cost Outsourcing|publisher=HfS Research|url=http://www.hfsresearch.com/Robotic-Automation-as-Threat-to-Traditional-Low-Cost-Outsourcing|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921062911/http://www.hfsresearch.com/Robotic-Automation-as-Threat-to-Traditional-Low-Cost-Outsourcing|archivedate=2015-09-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GartnerPredicts2014"&gt;{{Citation|title=Gartner Predicts 2014: Business and IT Services Are Facing the End of Outsourcing as We Know It|publisher=Gartner|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2656215/predicts--business-it-services}}&lt;/ref&gt; and speculate as to the likely long term impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Visions of the Future: The Next Decade in BPO|publisher=Outsource Magazine|url=http://outsourcemagazine.co.uk/visions-of-the-future-the-next-decade-in-bpo/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413032822/http://outsourcemagazine.co.uk/visions-of-the-future-the-next-decade-in-bpo/|archivedate=2015-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the short term, however, there is likely to be little impact as existing contracts run their course: it is only reasonable to expect demand for cost efficiency and innovation to result in transformative changes at the point of contract renewals. With the average length of a BPO contract being 5 years or more&lt;ref name="GartnerLength"&gt;{{Citation|title=Market Trends: Outsourcing Contracts, Worldwide|publisher=Gartner|url=http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?ref=g_search&amp;id=490855}}&lt;/ref&gt; - and many contracts being longer - this hypothesis will take some time to play out.

On the other hand, an academic study&lt;ref name="LSEXchanging"&gt;{{Citation|title=Robotic  Process Automation at Xchanging|publisher=London School of Economics|url=http://www.xchanging.com/system/files/dedicated-downloads/robotic-process-automation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by the [[London School of Economics]] was at pains to counter the so-called "myth" that ''RPA will bring back many jobs from offshore''. One possible argument behind such an assertion is that new technology provides new opportunities for increased quality, reliability, scalability and cost control, thus enabling BPO providers to increasingly compete on an outcomes based model rather than competing on cost alone. With the core offering potentially changing from a "lift and shift" approach based on fixed costs to a more qualitative, service based and outcomes-based model, there is perhaps a new opportunity to grow the BPO industry with a new offering.

==Industry size==
One estimate of the worldwide BPO market from the BPO Services Global Industry Almanac 2017, puts the size of the industry in 2016 at about US$140 billion.&lt;ref name="almanac"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itproportal.com/features/the-battle-of-the-bpo-titans-eastern-europe-vs-india/|title=The battle of the BPO titans: Eastern Europe vs. India|author=|date=|website=itproportal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

India, China and the Philippines are major powerhouses in the industry. In 2017, in India the BPO industry generated US$30 billion in revenue according to the national industry association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/enterprise-services-and-applications/india-holds-its-global-edge-in-bpm-sector-with-28billion-revenue/54474665|title=India holds its global edge in BPM sector with $28billion revenue|website=ETCIO.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BPO industry is a small segment of the total outsourcing industry in India.

'''Business process outsourcing to India''' refers to the [[business process outsourcing]] services in the outsourcing industry in India, catering mainly to Western operations of [[multinational corporation]]s (MNCs).

As of 2012, around 2.8 million people work in outsourcing sector.&lt;ref name="feout"/&gt; Annual revenues are around $11 billion,&lt;ref name="feout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/indias-outsourcing-revenue-to-hit-50-bn/266661/|title=India's outsourcing revenue to hit $50 bn|publisher=Financial Express|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 1% of GDP. Around 2.5 million people graduate in India every year. Wages are rising by 10â15 percent as a result of skill shortage.&lt;ref name="feout"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Gurgoan5.JPG|thumb|right|A BPO hub in DLF Cyber City in [[Gurgaon]], India.]]

===Amex===
In the second half of the 1980s, [[American Express]] consolidated its JAPAC (Japan and Asia Pacific) [[back office]] operations into [[Gurgaon]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanexpress.com/india/customerservice/contactamex_phone.shtml Amex Phone and Address listings]&lt;/ref&gt; This centre (called the Financial Resource Centre East or FRC-E)was headed by an Expat Harry Robertson, a veteran American Express employee with Raman Roy reporting to him, Raman Roy later on quit Amex to join GE and later on started his own enterprise called Spectramind which got later on merged with Wipro and then later on started [[Quatrro]] BPO.

===General Electric===
In the 1990s [[Jack Welch]] was influenced by [[K.P. Singh]], (a Delhi-based realtor) to look at [[Gurgaon]] in the NCR region as a base for back office operations. [[Pramod Bhasin]], the India head of G.E. hired Raman Roy and several of his management from American Express to start this enterprise called [[GECIS]] (GE Capital International Services). Raman for the first time tried out voice operations out of India. The operations in India were the Beta site for the GE [[Six sigma]] enterprise, as well. The results made GE ramp up their Indian presence and look at other locations. In 2004 GECIS was spun off as a separate legal entity by GE, called [[Genpact]]. GE has retained a 40% stake and sold a 60% stake for $500 million to two equity companies, [[Oak Hill Capital Partners]] and [[General Atlantic Partners]]..
[[File:Infosys India.JPG|thumb|250px|'''IT:''' The headquarters of [[Infosys]], India's third largest IT company, is located in Bengaluru]]

===Third party BPOs===
Until G.E. most of the work was being done by "captives"- a term used for in house work being done for the parent organisation. In 2000 Raman Roy and some team members from GECIS quit, and with VC funding from Chrysalis Capital, started Spectramind. At the same time, an organisation called Efunds started in Mumbai and Gurgaon, vCustomer in New Delhi and Daksh in Gurgaon. One of the current big BPO firms, EXL Services, started in April 1999, and in 2012 hit $442.9 million in revenues.

However, recently, most of the Indian BPOs, even smaller and mid-sized ones, are setting up their onshore presence in the markets they serve. Most of the large players are improving the outsourced business processes by leveraging on their years of experience, and now some are offering more than just plain vanilla BPO processes. KPO, transformation and Consulting opportunities are gaining favour among large third party BPO providers like Genpact, Infosys BPM, WNS and EXL Services.

===Future of outsourcing services to India===
Analysts believe that India remains a vital destination for outsourcing and expect its annual GDP to grow at 8â10% for the next decade. In addition, outsourcing efforts to India are held up as an effective remedy for concerns about both Chinese government policy and labour force issues, such as increasing costs and shortages.

==Size of the industry ==

The industry has been growing rapidly. It grew at a rate of 38% over 2005.  For the FY06 financial year the projections is of US$7.2 billion worth of services provided by this industry. The base in terms of headcount being roughly 400,000 people directly employed in this Industry.  The global BPO Industry is estimated to be worth 120â150 billion dollars, of this the offshore BPO is estimated to be some US$11.4 billion. India thus has some 5â6% share of the total Industry, but a commanding 63% share of the offshore component.  The U.S $7.2 billion also represents some 20% of the IT and BPO Industry which is in total expected to have revenues worth US$36 billion for 2006. The headcount at 400,000 is some 40% of the approximate one million workers estimated to be directly employed in the IT and BPO Sector.

The related Industry dependent on this are Catering, BPO training and recruitment, transport vendors (home pick up and drops for night shifts being the norm in the industry), security agencies, facilities management companies.

== Registration of BPO as OSP ==
BPO/KPO/Domestic &amp; International Call Centres/NOC etc. are covered under the 'Other Service Provider' (OSP) Category by the Department of Telecommunications.

The companies who are providing the 'Applications Services' means providing services like tele-banking, tele-medicine, tele-education, tele-trading, e-commerce, call centre, network operation centre and other IT Enabled Services, by using Telecom Resources provided by
Authorised Telecom Service Providers. The 'Telecom Resource' means Telecom facilities used by the OSP including, but not limited to Public Switched Telecom Network (PSTN), Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and /or the telecom bandwidth provided by authorized telecom service provider having valid licence under Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.
The 'Company' means a company registered under Indian Companies Act including foreign companies permitted by RBI under Foreign Exchange Management Regulations and registered under Part-XI(Section 591 to 608) of the Companies Act, 1956 for setting up a place of business in India.
'Domestic OSP' are the OSP providing the Application Services within national
boundaries. 'International OSP' are the OSP providing the Application Services beyond
national boundaries.

=== General conditions of OSP registration ===

(1) Registration may be granted to any company to provide Application Services. These service providers will not infringe on the jurisdiction of other Authorised Telecom Service Providers and they will not provide switched telephony.
(2) The entities entitled for OSP registration must be a company registered under
Indian Companies Act,1956.
(3) A Company may apply for registration to the Authority in the proforma prescribed by the Authority from time to time.

=== Online system for OSP registration ===

It is mandatory to get new Registration Number allotted by the Online OSP Registration system for the existing OSP Registrations. In case you have existing registered OSP sites for which you would like to get the new Registration Number from the system please contact Assistant Director General (ADG) of the concerned Telecom Enforcement, Resource and Monitoring Cell (TERM Cell)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dot.gov.in/vtm/vtm.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915140722/http://dot.gov.in/vtm/vtm.htm|date=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; preferably before applying for the login-id from the system.

Terms and conditions of the OSP registration are available on the DOT website
&lt;ref&gt;http://dotosp.gov.in/OSP_files/{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}/ospTermsandConditions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dotosp.gov.in/ |title=Welcome To OSP |publisher=Dotosp.gov.in |accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bangalore]], [[Chennai]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Gurgaon]], [[National Capital Region (India)|NCR]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Pune]] are Tier I cities that are leading IT cities in India.

With rising infrastructure costs in these cities, many BPO's are shifting operations to Tier II cities like [[Nashik]], [[Sangli]], [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] (Maharashtra), [[Mangalore]], [[Mysore]], [[Hubli-Dharwad]], [[Belgaum]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Nagpur]], [[Trichy]], [[Kochi, India|Kochi]], [[Trivandrum]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Mohali]], [[Panchkula]], [[Bhubaneshwar]], [[Jaipur]], [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Raipur]] and [[Lucknow]].

Tier II cities offer lower [[business process overhead]] compared to Tier I cities, but have a less reliable infrastructure system which may hamper dedicated operations. The [[Government of India]] in partnership with private infrastructure corporations is working on bringing all around development and providing robust infrastructure all over the nation.

==Criticisms==

The BPO industry in India has attracted criticism from some observers.

* Shehzad Nadeem, of the Sociology Department at Lehman College, City University of New York, reports that Indian call-centre employees, to confirm to expectations of the US consumers who they support long-distance, are expected to imitate the Western employees they have replaced in terms of the use of US vernacular, even temporarily adopting an Anglo name during the call. While this is true, Nadeem claims further that this temporary switch to an American-like identity inflicts psychological distress, and has led to the adoption of Western-style-consumer lifestyles by the employees, who earn far more than their compatriots.&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, Shehzad (2011). ''Dead Ringers:How Outsourcing is Changing the Way Indians Understand Themselves'', Princeton University Press, New Jersey. {{ISBN|0691147876}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jyoti Saraswati of the Stern School of Business, New York University, claims that the outsourcing industry's political influence far exceeds the industry's economic contribution, and has allowed the industry to secure the support and resources of the Indian state ahead of other sectors of the national economy where the developmental returns would be far greater.&lt;ref&gt;Saraswati, Jyoti (2012). ''Dot.compradors: Power and Policy in the Development of the Indian Software Industry'', Pluto Press, London. {{ISBN|9780745332659}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point that should be considered while outsourcing, not only to India but any other region, is Intellectual Property Protection. When companies outsource their work, they have to dilute their core knowledge related to process before transferring the diluted knowledge to the outsourcee. If they fail to do this, the outsourcee can learn enough about the outsourcing organization's business to compete with them later by offering similar services in their own country or even multi-nationally.

{{wikt | businessperson}}

A '''businessperson''' (also '''businessman''' or '''businesswoman''') is a person involved in the [[business sector]] â in particular someone undertaking activities ([[commerce|commercial]] or [[industry|industrial]]) for the purpose of generating [[cash flow]], [[sales]], and [[revenue]] utilizing a combination of [[Human capital|human]], [[Financial capital|financial]], [[intellectual capital|intellectual]] and [[physical capital]] with a view to fuelling [[economic development]] and [[Economic growth|growth]].&lt;ref&gt;

 |quote= businessman[:] A person who is employed by an organization or company. Businessmen are often associated with white collar jobs. In order to avoid sexism or the perpetuation of stereotypes, the term is often replaced with "businessperson". The term "businesswoman" is less commonly used.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[entrepreneur]] is an example of a businessperson.

The term "businessperson" may refer to a founder, owner, or majority shareholder of a [[commercial enterprise]]; or it can characterize a high-level [[senior management|executive]] who does the everyday running and management of a [[company]] even if that executive is not the owner.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The term may sometimes refer to someone who is involved in an upper-level [[management]] role in a [[corporation]], company, enterprise, firm, [[organization]], or agency.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==History==
===Prehistoric period: Traders===
Since a "businessman" can mean anyone in industry or commerce,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.audioenglish.org/dictionary/businessman.htm | title=BUSINESSMAN | publisher=Audioenglish | accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; businessmen have existed as long as industry and commerce have existed. "Commerce" can simply mean "[[trade]]", and trade has existed through all of [[recorded history]]. The first businessmen in human history were traders or [[merchants]].

===Medieval period: Rise of the merchant class===
Merchants emerged as a "[[class (social)|class]]" in [[medieval Italy]]. Between 1300 and 1500, modern [[accounting]], the [[bill of exchange]], and [[limited liability]] were invented, and thus the world saw "the first true bankers", who are certainly businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=J.M.|title=The Penguin History of the World, Sixth Edition|year=2013|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|pages=506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, Europe saw the "emergence of rich merchants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=J.M.|title=The Penguin History of the World, Sixth Edition|year=2013|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|pages=509}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "rise of the merchant class" came as Europe "needed a middleman" for the first time, and these "burghers" or "[[bourgeois]]" were the people who played this role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=J.M.|title=The Penguin History of the World, Sixth Edition|year=2013|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|pages=510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance to Enlightenment: Rise of the capitalist===
Europe became the dominant global commercial power in the 16th century, and as Europeans developed new tools for business, new types of business people began to use those tools. In this period, Europe developed and used [[banknote|paper money]], [[cheque|cheques]], and [[joint-stock companies]] (and their shares of [[stock]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=J.M.|title=The Penguin History of the World, Sixth Edition|year=2013|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|pages=558}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developments in [[actuarial science]] led to [[insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=J.M.|title=The Penguin History of the World, Sixth Edition|year=2013|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|pages=559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these new tools were used by a new kind of businessman, the [[capitalist]]. These people owned or financed businesses as [[bankers]], but they were not merchants of goods. These capitalists were a major force in the [[Industrial Revolution]]...

===Modern period: Rise of the manager===
The newest kind of businessperson is the [[manager]]. One of the first true managers was [[Robert Owen]] (1771â1858), an industrialist in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drucker|first=Peter|title=Management, Revised Edition|year=2008|publisher=Collins Business|location=New York|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied the "problems of [[productivity]] and [[motivation]]", and was followed by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], who was the first person who studied [[work (project management)|work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drucker|first=Peter|title=Management, Revised Edition|year=2008|publisher=Collins Business|location=New York|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War I]], management became popular due to the example of [[Herbert Hoover]] and the [[Harvard Business School]], which offered [[MBA|degrees in business administration]] (management).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drucker|first=Peter|title=Management, Revised Edition|year=2008|publisher=Collins Business|location=New York|pages=15â16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salary==
Salaries for businesspeople vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/home.htm |title=Business and Financial Occupations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Bureau of Labor and Statistics |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|access-date=2015-09-18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/management/ |title=Management Occupations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Bureau of Labor and Statistics |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|access-date=2015-09-18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The salaries of the top CEOs can be millions of dollars per year. For example, Discovery Communications' head, [[David Zaslav|David M. Zaslav]], made $156 million in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aflcio.org/Corporate-Watch/Paywatch-2014/100-Highest-Paid-CEOs |title=100 Highest Paid CEOs |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=AFL-CIO |publisher= AFL-CIO  |access-date=2015-09-18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high salary which executives earn has often been a source of criticism with many believing that they are paid excessively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2014/09/ceos-get-paid-too-much-according-to-pretty-much-everyone-in-the-world/ |title=CEOs Get Paid Too Much |author=Gretchen Gavett |website=Harvard Business Review |publisher=Harvard Business Review |access-date=2015-09-18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business guru==
Some leading business theorists look to leaders in academic research on business or to successful business leaders for guidance. Collectively, these people are called "[[business guru]]s."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1005">A '''captive unit''' is a business unit of a [[company]] functioning [[Offshoring|offshore]] as an entity of its own while retaining the work and close operational tie ups within the parent company.

Captive unit is one way of establishing presence in cheap [[Wage labour|labour]] markets such as [[China]] and [[India]] rather than [[outsourcing]] work to [[wikt:third party|third party]] companies established offshore.

Captive Generating plant means a power plant set up by any person to generate electricity primarily for his or her own use and includes a power plant set up by any co-operative society or association of persons for generating electricity primarily for use of members of such co-operative society or association. Note that the word primarily is not defined anywhere. Also note that by this definition, a group of industries can set up a big generating station for their groups use and sell excess power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4804">A '''chief creative officer''' ('''CCO''') is the highest ranking position of the creative team within a company. Depending on the type of company, this position may be responsible for the overall look and feel of [[marketing]], [[Mass media|media]], and [[brand]]ing associated with the organization. The CCO may also be charged with managing, developing, and leading the team of [[creative director]]s, [[art director]]s, [[designer]]s, and [[copywriter]]s.

==Overall description==
The CCO directs a company's creative output, developing the artistic design strategy that defines the company's brand.&lt;ref name="do"&gt;Written By: Terry Masters, Edited By: Allegra J. Lingo [http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-chief-creative-officer-do.htm "What Does a Chief Creative Officer Do"], 14 October 2014, Retrieved on 30 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The CCO creates the unique image of the firm and deliver this distinctive design to consumers and to create a clear [[brand image]] which is a fundamental and essential work throughout the company. Advertisements present a certain memorable artistic design while also structured to accomplish functional goals. The CCO ensures that the design and functionality combine harmoniously so the firm can present a product that successfully represents its creative brand.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt;

CCOs, in some cases are called [[creative directors]], are demanded in firms which involve creative thinking and artistic design. The position of generic head of marketing is usually replaced by chief creative officer in advertising firms.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt; The power of chief creative officer can even be compared to [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and at the early stages of a small company, usually at the start of [[partnerships]], the CCO and the CEO manage jointly.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt;

==About==
ClearCheckbook was originally conceived as a way to reconcile bank account transactions with "actual" spending (a process called ''jiving''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdmproofing.com/iym/interviews/clear-checkbook-brandon-obrien.html|title=Interview with Brandon O'Brien, Creator, ClearCheckbook.com|date=Feb 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ClearCheckbook lingo).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="502">A '''Collateral Billing number''' (CBN) is a number that sometimes can be given in place of a [[purchase order]] or a [[credit card number]] to ensure a products return. For example, you receive a defective product and call the manufacturer, they in turn send you a replacement unit after collecting a purchase order, credit card or collateral billing number from you to charge the cost of the unit to in the event that you do not return the original unit.

A '''comp card''' (also called '''composite card''', '''z card''', '''zed card''' or '''sed card''') is a [[marketing]] tool for actors and especially [[Model (person)|models]].  They serve as the latest and best of a model's [[Career portfolio|portfolio]] and are used as a [[business card]]. A [[Z-CARD]] is also a folded leaflet format, typically used for marketing communications campaigns for example a loyalty programme or seasonal promotion.

==History==
Peter Marlowe in London invented models composites in 1965, then printed on paper to [[DIN A4|A4]] format.&lt;ref&gt;âModelâ (1995) by Michael Gross p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Molyneux (April 1989 &amp; May 1989) Marlowe Press - The Story, Model Journal, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The format was changed in 1972 to [[DIN A5|A5]] card format, for filing purposes, and a few other companies started publishing cards for the model industry under different trade names since Peter Marlowe had registered the trademark âModel Compositeâ in Europe and the USA. Amongst these was Sebastian Sed who traded under the name Sed Cards, which are sometimes mis-pronounced as Z ("Zed") or Set cards. The publishing house of Marlowe Press stopped trading in 1990 and the words "models composites" and "comp cards" became generic within the model industry. Comp card databases and creation tools have moved online in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Model woman : Eileen Ford and the business of beauty|last=Lacey|first=Robert|publisher=Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers|year=2015|isbn=978-0062108074|location=New York, NY|pages=199, 200, 206, 207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
A comp card typically contains a minimum of two pages â a cover page with full size portrait and a second page with a selection of  representative shots from the portfolio. It lists the model's basic stats &amp;ndash; typically height, weight, [[three sizes]]  (bust, waist, hips) for women, suit or chest size and waist and inseam sizes for men, plus [[shoe size]], eye and [[hair color]], nationality and contact information. It is printed on both sides of an 8.5" x 5.5" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessofmodeling.com/comp-cards/what-is-a-comp-card/&lt;/ref&gt; piece of [[card stock]] (12 pt stock) (US) or A5 on card weight (350/400&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; stock in metric countries) which is between 300 and 450&amp;nbsp;[[Âµm]] thick depending on the card stock or quality chosen (Europe, Asia).

==Use==
Comp cards have been around for many years as the essential marketing tool for a model and are likely to retain this standing because they are an inexpensive way to effectively and professionally showcase a model's ability. Composite cards are used on three major levels &amp;ndash; they are used by models, agents and the agent's client

==Production==
Currently, models have many different options of creating comp cards. They can ask their photographer or create their own on their computers using image editing or [[graphics software]]. In addition, with technology's increasingly strong influence in the digital market, many printing companies have looked to the internet to facilitate the ordering process. Comp card printing prices can vary depending on the number of pictures used on the card, the type of paper stock used, and the general printing quality. Different layout styles are available or can be created.

{{Business administration}}

'''Corporate governance''' is the mechanisms, processes and relations by which [[corporation]]s are controlled and directed.&lt;ref&gt;Shailer, Greg. ''An Introduction to Corporate Governance in Australia'', Pearson Education Australia, Sydney, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Governance structures and principles identify the distribution of rights and responsibilities among different participants in the corporation (such as the board of directors, managers, shareholders, creditors, auditors, regulators, and other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]) and includes the rules and procedures for making decisions in corporate affairs.&lt;ref&gt;The Corporate Governance of Iconic Executives, 87 Notre Dame Law Review 351 (2011), available at:http://ssrn.com/abstract=2040922&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate governance includes the processes through which corporations' objectives are set and pursued in the context of the social, regulatory and market environment. Governance mechanisms include monitoring the actions, policies, practices, and decisions of corporations, their agents, and affected stakeholders. Corporate governance practices are affected by attempts to align the interests of stakeholders.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, 2004|url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/ca/oecdprinciplesofcorporategovernance.htm|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tricker, Adrian, ''Essentials for Board Directors: An AâZ Guide'', Bloomberg Press, New York, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-57660-354-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the corporate governance practices of modern corporations, particularly in relation to accountability, increased following the high-profile collapses of a number of large corporations during 2001â2002, most of which involved accounting fraud; and then again after the recent [[Financial crisis of 2007â08|financial crisis in 2008]].

[[Corporate scandals]] of various forms have maintained public and political interest in the [[regulation]] of corporate governance. In the U.S., these include [[Enron]] and [[MCI Inc.]] (formerly WorldCom). Their demise led to the enactment of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] in 2002, a [[U.S. federal law]] intended to restore public confidence in corporate governance. Comparable failures in Australia ([[HIH Insurance|HIH]], [[One.Tel]]) are associated with the eventual passage of the [[CLERP 9]] reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Janet &amp; Shailer, Greg. The Effect of Board-Related Reforms on Investors Confidence. ''Australian Accounting Review'', 18(45) 2008: 123-134.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar corporate failures in other countries stimulated increased regulatory interest (e.g., [[Parmalat]] in Italy).

==Stakeholder interests==
In contemporary business corporations, the main external stakeholder groups are shareholders, debtholders, trade [[creditor]]s and suppliers, customers, and communities affected by the corporation's activities. Internal stakeholders are the [[board of directors]], [[Executive (management)|executives]], and other employees.

Much of the contemporary interest in corporate governance is concerned with mitigation of the [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interests]] between stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Goergen, Marc, International Corporate Governance, (Prentice Hall 2012) {{ISBN|978-0-273-75125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In large firms where there is a separation of ownership and management and no controlling shareholder, the [[principalâagent problem|principalâagent issue]] arises between upper-management (the "agent") which may have very different interests, and by definition considerably more information, than shareholders (the "principals"). The danger arises that, rather than overseeing management on behalf of shareholders, the board of directors may become insulated from shareholders and beholden to management.&lt;ref&gt;Pay Without Performance â the Unfulfilled Promise of Executive Compensation by Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried, Harvard University Press 2004, 15â17&lt;/ref&gt;  This aspect is particularly present in contemporary public debates and developments in regulatory [[policy]].&lt;ref name="oecd.org"/&gt; More explicitly, the danger is that executives paid by stock option have incentive to divert the retained earnings of the firm into buying shares of own company stock, which will then cause the share price to rise.  However, retained earnings will then not be used to purchase the latest equipment or to hire quality people. Over the thirty or forty years that the model has been in place, the diversion of retained earnings to stock price manipulation has gradually eroded the competitiveness of the US industrial base.  While the public blames low wages in China for eliminating US jobs, the reality is that many US firms compete with high wage nations such as Canada, Germany, or Japan.  It is failure of large publicly-held corporations to invest in new equipment and people that holds the US back and erodes the middle class (fewer engineers, chemists, CNC machinists, accountants are needed as plants are left to age out).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/36211184/Deindustrialization_in_the_Granite_State_Part_2_Rising_Asset_Bubbles_Distort_the_Industrial_Base; see also https://www.npr.org/2017/02/06/513713606/glass-house-chronicles-the-sharp-decline-of-an-all-american-factory-town; see also https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ways of mitigating or preventing these conflicts of interests include the processes, customs, policies, laws, and institutions which affect the way a company is controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Financial Times Lexicon|url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=corporate-governance|work=[[The Financial Times]]|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; An important theme of governance is the nature and extent of [[corporate accountability]]. A related discussion at the macro level focuses on the effect of a corporate governance system on [[economic efficiency]], with a strong emphasis on shareholders' welfare.&lt;ref name="DainesKlausner"&gt;Daines, Robert, and [[Michael Klausner]], 2008 "corporate law, economic analysis of," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000285&amp;edition=current&amp;q= Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;  This has resulted in a literature focused on economic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;â¢ [[Andrei Shleifer|Shleifer, Andrei]], and [[Robert W. Vishny]] (1997).

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;â¢ [[Valentin Zelenyuk]], and [[Vitaliy Zheka]] (2006). "Corporate Governance and Firmâs Efficiency: The Case of a Transitional Country, Ukraine," ''Journal of Productivity Analysis'', 25(1), pp. 143-157, [https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/jproda/v25y2006i1p143-157.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other definitions==
Corporate governance has also been more narrowly defined as "a system of law and sound approaches by which corporations are directed and controlled focusing on the internal and external corporate structures with the intention of monitoring the actions of management and directors and thereby, mitigating agency risks which may stem from the misdeeds of corporate officers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sifuna|first=Anazett Pacy|title=Disclose or Abstain: The Prohibition of Insider Trading on Trial|journal=Journal of International Banking Law and Regulation|year=2012|volume=27|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate governance has also been defined as "Is the act of externally directing, controlling and evaluating a corporation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grcglossary.org/terms/corporate-governance |title=Corporate Governance via GRC Glossary |publisher=Open Compliance and Ethics Group |date=21 April 2010 |website=GRC Glossary |access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and related to the definition of Governance as "The act of externally directing, controlling and evaluating an entity, process or resource".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grcglossary.org/terms/governance |title=Governance via GRC Glossary |publisher=Open Compliance and Ethics Group |date=21 April 2010 |website=GRC Glossary |access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, governance and corporate governance are different from management because governance must be EXTERNAL to the object being governed. Governing agents do not have personal control over, and are not part of the object that they govern. For example, it is not possible for a CIO to govern the IT function. They are personally accountable for the strategy and management of the function. As such, they âmanageâ the IT function; they do not âgovernâ it. At the same time, there may be a number of policies, authorized by the board, that the CIO follows. When the CIO is following these policies, they are performing âgovernanceâ activities because the primary intention of the policy is to serve a governance purpose. The board is ultimately âgoverningâ the IT function because they stand outside of the function and are only able to externally direct, control and evaluate the IT function by virtue of established policies, procedures and indicators. Without these policies, procedures and indicators, the board has no way of governing, let alone affecting the IT function in any way.

One source defines corporate governance as "the set of conditions that shapes the [[ex post]] bargaining over the [[quasi-rent]]s generated by a firm."&lt;ref&gt;[[Luigi Zingales]], 2008.

==Principles==
Contemporary discussions of corporate governance tend to refer to principles raised in three documents released since 1990: The [[Cadbury Report]] (UK, 1992), the Principles of Corporate Governance (OECD, 1999, 2004 and 2015), and the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002 (US, 2002).  The Cadbury and [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) reports present general principles around which businesses are expected to operate to assure proper governance.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, informally referred to as Sarbox or Sox, is an attempt by the federal government in the United States to legislate several of the principles recommended in the Cadbury and OECD reports.
* '''Rights and equitable treatment of shareholders''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, 2004, Articles II and III|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/18/31557724.pdf|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial service Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, Sections 3.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002'', US Congress, Title VIII&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations should respect the rights of shareholders and help shareholders to exercise those rights. They can help shareholders exercise their rights by openly and effectively communicating information and by encouraging shareholders to participate in general meetings.
* '''Interests of other stakeholders''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, 2004, Preamble and Article IV|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/18/31557724.pdf|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations should recognize that they have legal, contractual, social, and market driven obligations to non-shareholder stakeholders, including employees, investors, creditors, suppliers, local communities, customers, and policy makers.
* '''Role and responsibilities of the board''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, 2004, Article VI|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/18/31557724.pdf|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, Section 3.4&lt;/ref&gt; The board needs sufficient relevant skills and understanding to review and challenge management performance. It also needs adequate size and appropriate levels of independence and commitment.
* '''Integrity and ethical behavior''':&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, Sections 3.2, 3.3, 4.33, 4.51 and 7.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002'', US Congress, Title I, 101(c)(1), Title VIII, and Title IX, 406&lt;/ref&gt; Integrity should be a fundamental requirement in choosing corporate officers and board members.  Organizations should develop a code of conduct for their directors and executives that promotes ethical and responsible decision making.
* '''Disclosure and transparency''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principals of Corporate Governance, 2004, Articles I and V|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/18/31557724.pdf|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, Section 3.2&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations should clarify and make publicly known the roles and responsibilities of board and management to provide stakeholders with a level of accountability. They should also implement procedures to independently verify and safeguard the integrity of the company's financial reporting. Disclosure of material matters concerning the organization should be timely and balanced to ensure that all investors have access to clear, factual information.

==Models==
Different models of corporate governance differ according to the variety of capitalism in which they are embedded. The Anglo-American "model" tends to emphasize the interests of shareholders. The coordinated or [[multistakeholder model]] associated with Continental Europe and Japan also recognizes the interests of workers, managers, suppliers, customers, and the community. A related distinction is between market-oriented and network-oriented models of corporate governance.&lt;ref&gt;[Sytse Douma] &amp; [Hein Schreuder] (2013) ''[http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Economic-Approaches-to-Organisations/9780273735298.page Economic Approaches to Organizations]'', 5th edition, chapter 15, London: Pearson&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental Europe (Two-tier board system) ===
{{main article|Aktiengesellschaft}}
Some continental European countries, including Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands, require a two-tiered board of directors as a means of improving corporate governance.&lt;ref&gt;Tricker, Bob, ''Essentials for Board Directors: An AâZ Guide, Second Edition'', Bloomberg Press, New York, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-57660-354-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the two-tiered board, the executive board, made up of company executives, generally runs day-to-day operations while the supervisory board, made up entirely of non-executive directors who represent shareholders and employees, hires and fires the members of the executive board, determines their compensation, and reviews major business decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Hopt, Klaus J., "The German Two-Tier Board (Aufsichtsrat), A German View on Corporate Governance" in Hopt, Klaus J. and Wymeersch, Eddy (eds), ''Comparative Corporate Governance: Essays and Materials'', de Gruyter, Berlin &amp; New York, {{ISBN|3-11-015765-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] Committee on Corporate Governance defines corporate governance as the "acceptance by management of the inalienable rights of shareholders as the true owners of the corporation and of their own role as trustees on behalf of the shareholders. It is about commitment to values, about ethical business conduct and about making a distinction between personal  &amp; corporate funds in the management of a company."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the SEBI Committee on Corporate Governance, February 2003|url=http://www.sebi.gov.in/commreport/corpgov.pdf|work=[[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] Committee on Corporate Governance|accessdate=2011-07-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928135443/http://www.sebi.gov.in/commreport/corpgov.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mia Mahmudur Rahim|author2=Sanjaya Kuruppu|editor1-last=Franklin|editor1-first=Ngwu|editor2-last=Onyeka|editor2-first=Osuji|editor3-last=Frank|editor3-first=Stephen|title=Corporate Governance in Developing and Emerging Markets|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|location=London|url=http://www.tandfebooks.com/isbn/9781315666020|chapter=Corporate Governance in India: The Potential for Ghandism}}&lt;/ref&gt; India is a growing economy and it is quite important to safeguard the interests of investors and also ensure that the responsibility of management is fixed.

This is the reason that corporate governance in India has taken the centre stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jetir.org/papers/JETIRA006061.pdf Advantages of Corporate Governance for Indian Enterprises], By Shailendra Sial.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States, United Kingdom===
The so-called "Anglo-American model" of corporate governance emphasizes the interests of shareholders. It relies on a single-tiered board of directors that is normally dominated by non-executive directors elected by shareholders. Because of this, it is also known as "the unitary system".&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mallin, Christine A., "Corporate Governance Developments in the UK" in Mallin, Christine A (ed), ''Handbook on International Corporate Governance: Country Analyses, Second Edition'', Edward Elgar Publishing, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-84980-123-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this system, many boards include some executives from the company (who are [[ex officio]] members of the board). Non-executive directors are expected to outnumber executive directors and hold key posts, including audit and compensation committees. In the United Kingdom, the [[CEO]] generally does not also serve as Chairman of the Board, whereas in the US having the dual role has been the norm, despite major misgivings regarding the effect on corporate governance.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, William G, ''The Board Book: An Insider's Guide for Directors and Trustees'', W.W. Norton &amp; Company, New York &amp; London, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-393-06645-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of US firms combining both roles is declining, however.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.russellreynolds.com/newsroom/splitting-the-ceo-and-chairman-roles-yes-or-no&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, corporations are directly governed by state laws, while the exchange (offering and trading) of securities in corporations (including shares) is governed by federal legislation. Many US states have adopted the [[Model Business Corporation Act]], but the dominant state law for publicly traded corporations is [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], which continues to be the place of incorporation for the majority of publicly traded corporations.&lt;ref name=Bebchuck2004&gt;Bebchuck LA. (2004).[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=387940 The Case for Increasing Shareholder Power].''Harvard Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual rules for corporations are based upon the [[corporate charter]] and, less authoritatively, the corporate [[bylaw]]s.&lt;ref name=Bebchuck2004/&gt;
Shareholders cannot initiate changes in the corporate charter although they can initiate changes to the corporate bylaws.&lt;ref name=Bebchuck2004/&gt;

It is sometimes colloquially stated that in the USA and the UK 'the shareholders own the company'. This is, however, a misconception as argued by Eccles &amp; Youmans (2015) and Kay (2015).&lt;ref&gt;http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/materiality-in-corporate-governance-the-statement-of-significant-audiences-and-materiality; https://next.ft.com/content/7bd1b20a-879b-11e5-90de-f44762bf9896&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founder centrism===
Recent scholarship from the [[University of Oxford]] outlines a new theory of corporate governance, founder centrism, which is premised upon a narrowing in the separation between ownership and control. Through the lens of concentrated equity ownership theory, a new theory of the firm, the traditional checklist of best practices are inapplicable, as evidenced by the significant outperformance of technology companies with dual-class share structures and integrated CEO/Chairman positions:

{{Cquote|
"Founder-run companies, such as Facebook, Netflix and Google are at the forefront of a new wave of organizational structure better suited to long-term value creation. Founder centrism, an inclusive concept within CEO theory, integrates the capacity of founder and non-founder senior leadership to adopt an ownerâs mindset in traditionally structured corporations, such as Thomas J. Watson Sr. and Thomas Watson Jr. with IBM, Steve Jobs and Tim Cook with Apple, Jamie Dimon with JPMorgan Chase, Lloyd Blankfein with Goldman Sachs, Rick George with Suncor Energy, and many others. In substance, all fall within the ambit of founder centrism â leaders with a founderâs mindset, an ethical disposition towards the shareholder collective, and an intense focus on exponential value creation without enslavement to a quarter-by-quarter upward growth trajectory. In traditionally structured firms, high performing executives gain deference, become highly influential, and take on the qualities of concentrated equity owners. To the extent these leaders embrace founder centrism, their companies will experience efficiency advantages relative to competitors operating within traditional parameters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rojas|first1=Claudio|title=Eclipse of the Public Corporation Revisited: Concentrated Equity Ownership Theory|url=https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2017/06/eclipse-public-corporation-revisited-concentrated-equity-ownership|publisher=The University of Oxford|accessdate=June 27, 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;|100%|cquote}}

An article published by the Australian Institute of Company Directors called 'Do Boards Need to become more Entrepreneurial?' written by Nigel Hennessy FAICD also considered the need for Founder Centrism behaviour at board level to appropriately manage disruption. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hennessy|first1=Nigel|title=Do boards need to become more Entrepreneurial|url=http://www.aicd.companydirectors.com.au/-/media/cd2/resources/advocacy/governance-leadership-centre/pdf/the-entrepreneurial-board.ashx|publisher=AICD|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
{{Corporate law|doctrines}}

Corporations are created as [[legal person]]s by the laws and regulations of a particular jurisdiction. These may vary in many respects between countries, but a corporation's legal person status is fundamental to all jurisdictions and is conferred by statute. This allows the entity to hold property in its own right without reference to any particular real person. It also results in the perpetual existence that characterizes the modern corporation. The statutory granting of corporate existence may arise from general purpose legislation (which is the general case) or from a statute to create a specific corporation, which was the only method prior to the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In addition to the statutory laws of the relevant jurisdiction, corporations are subject to [[common law]] in some countries, and various laws and regulations affecting business practices. In most jurisdictions, corporations also have a constitution that provides individual rules that govern the corporation and authorize or constrain its decision-makers. This constitution is identified by a variety of terms; in English-speaking jurisdictions, it is usually known as the Corporate Charter or the [[memorandum of association|Memorandum]] and Articles of Association. The capacity of shareholders to modify the constitution of their corporation can vary substantially.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The U.S. passed the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) in 1977, with subsequent modifications. This law made it illegal to bribe government officials and required corporations to maintain adequate accounting controls. It is enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Substantial civil and criminal penalties have been levied on corporations and executives convicted of bribery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/guidance/ DOJ Website â Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Guidance â May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK passed the [[Bribery Act 2010|Bribery Act]] in 2010. This law made it illegal to bribe either government or private citizens or make facilitating payments (i.e., payment to a government official to perform their routine duties more quickly). It also required corporations to establish controls to prevent bribery.

===Sarbanes-Oxley Act===
The [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002 was enacted in the wake of a series of high-profile corporate scandals. It established a series of requirements that affect corporate governance in the U.S. and influenced similar laws in many other countries.  The law required, along with many other elements, that:
* The [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB) be established to regulate the auditing profession, which had been self-regulated prior to the law. Auditors are responsible for reviewing the financial statements of corporations and issuing an opinion as to their reliability.
* The [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) and [[Chief Financial Officer]] (CFO) attest to the financial statements. Prior to the law, CEOs had claimed in court they hadn't reviewed the information as part of their defense.
* Board audit committees have members that are independent and disclose whether or not at least one is a financial expert, or reasons why no such expert is on the audit committee.
* External audit firms cannot provide certain types of consulting services and must rotate their lead partner every 5 years. Further, an audit firm cannot audit a company if those in specified senior management roles worked for the auditor in the past year. Prior to the law, there was the real or perceived conflict of interest between providing an independent opinion on the accuracy and reliability of financial statements when the same firm was also providing lucrative consulting services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ204/pdf/PLAW-107publ204.pdf Text of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Codes and guidelines==
Corporate governance principles and codes have been developed in different countries and issued from stock exchanges, corporations, institutional investors, or associations (institutes) of directors and managers with the support of governments and international organizations. As a rule, compliance with these governance recommendations is not mandated by law, although the codes linked to stock exchange [[Stock exchange#Listing requirements|listing requirements]] may have a coercive effect.

===Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development principles===
One of the most influential guidelines on corporate governance are the [[G20]]/[[OECD]] Principles of Corporate Governance, first published as the OECD Principles in 1999, revised in 2004 and revised again and endorsed by the G20 in 2015.&lt;ref name="oecd.org" /&gt; The Principles are often referenced by countries developing local codes or guidelines. Building on the work of the OECD, other international organizations, private sector associations and more than 20 national corporate governance codes formed  the [[United Nations]] [[Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting]] (ISAR) to produce their Guidance on Good Practices in Corporate Governance Disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/iteteb20063_en.pdf Guidance on Good Practices in Corporate Governance Disclosure.]&lt;/ref&gt; This internationally agreed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/c2isard31_en.pdf TD/B/COM.2/ISAR/31&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; benchmark consists of more than fifty distinct disclosure items across five broad categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Standards of Accounting and Reporting, Corporate Governance Disclosure |url=http://www.unctad.org/Templates/Page.asp?intItemID=2920&amp;lang=1 |work=[[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] |accessdate=2008-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123092039/http://www.unctad.org/Templates/Page.asp?intItemID=2920&amp;lang=1 |archivedate=2008-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Auditing
* Board and management structure and process
* Corporate responsibility and compliance in organization
* Financial transparency and information disclosure
* Ownership structure and exercise of control rights

The [http://www.oecd.org/daf/ca/guidelines-corporate-governance-soes.htm OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises] are complementary to the [http://www.oecd.org/corporate/principles-corporate-governance.htm G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance], providing guidance tailored to the corporate governance challenges unique to [[state-owned enterprise]]s.

===Stock exchange listing standards===
Companies listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) and other stock exchanges are required to meet certain governance standards. For example, the NYSE Listed Company Manual requires, among many other elements:
* Independent directors: "Listed companies must have a majority of independent directors...Effective boards of directors exercise independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities. Requiring a majority of independent directors will increase the quality of board oversight and lessen the possibility of damaging conflicts of interest." (Section 303A.01) An independent director is not part of management and has no "material financial relationship" with the company.
* Board meetings that exclude management: "To empower non-management directors to serve as a more effective check on management, the non-management directors of each listed company must meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions without management." (Section 303A.03)
* Boards organize their members into committees with specific responsibilities per defined charters. "Listed companies must have a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors." This committee is responsible for nominating new members for the board of directors. Compensation and Audit Committees are also specified, with the latter subject to a variety of listing standards as well as outside regulations.

===Other guidelines===
The investor-led organisation International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) was set up by individuals centered around the ten largest pension funds in the world 1995. The aim is to promote global corporate governance standards. The network is led by investors that manage 18 trillion dollars, and members are located in fifty different countries. ICGN has developed a suite of global guidelines ranging from shareholder rights to business ethics.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]] (WBCSD) has done work on corporate governance, particularly on [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515141435/http%3A//www.wbcsd.org/Pages/EDocument/EDocumentDetails.aspx?ID%3D80%26NoSearchContextKey%3Dtrue Accounting and Reporting], and in 2004 released [https://archive.is/20140625080626/http://www.wbcsd.org/Pages/EDocument/EDocumentDetails.aspx?ID=15610&amp;NoSearchContextKey=true Issue Management Tool: Strategic challenges for business in the use of corporate responsibility codes, standards, and frameworks]. This document offers general information and a perspective from a business association/think-tank on a few key codes, standards and frameworks relevant to the sustainability agenda.

In 2009, the International Finance Corporation and the UN Global Compact released a report, [http://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/issues_doc/Corporate_Governance/Corporate_Governance_IFC_UNGC.pdf Corporate Governance - the Foundation for Corporate Citizenship and Sustainable Business], linking the environmental, social and governance responsibilities of a company to its financial performance and long-term sustainability.

Most codes are largely voluntary. An issue raised in the U.S. since the 2005 Disney decision&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akingump.com/docs/publication/795.pdf The Disney Decision of 2005 and the precedent it sets for corporate governance and fiduciary responsibility, Kuckreja, Akin Gump, Aug 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615105810/http://www.akingump.com/docs/publication/795.pdf |date=2007-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the degree to which companies manage their governance responsibilities; in other words, do they merely try to supersede the legal threshold, or should they create governance guidelines that ascend to the level of best practice.  For example, the guidelines issued by associations of directors, corporate managers and individual companies tend to be wholly voluntary, but such documents may have a wider effect by prompting other companies to adopt similar practices.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== United States of America ===
[[Robert E. Wright]] argues in ''Corporation Nation'' (2014) that the governance of early U.S. corporations, of which over 20,000 existed by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] of 1861-1865, was superior to that of corporations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries because early corporations governed themselves like "republics", replete with numerous "checks and balances" against fraud and against usurpation of power by managers or by large shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Wright, Corporation Nation (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; (The term [[Robber baron (industrialist)|"robber baron"]] became particularly associated with US corporate figures in the [[Gilded Age]] - the late 19th century.)

In the immediate aftermath of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] legal scholars such as [[Adolf Augustus Berle]], Edwin Dodd, and [[Gardiner C. Means]] pondered on the changing role of the modern corporation in society.&lt;ref&gt;Berle and Means' ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'', (1932, Macmillan)&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Chicago school of economics]], [[Ronald Coase]]&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Coase, ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the notion of transaction costs into the understanding of why firms are founded and how they continue to behave.&lt;ref name="catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk"&gt;[[Sytse Douma]] &amp; [[Hein Schreuder]] (2013) "Economic Approaches to Organizations", 5th edition, London: Pearson [http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Economic-Approaches-to-Organisations/9780273735298.page]&lt;/ref&gt;

US economic expansion through the emergence of multinational corporations after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] (1939-1945) saw the establishment of the [[managerial class]]. Several [[Harvard Business School]] management professors studied and wrote about the new class: [[Myles Mace]] (entrepreneurship), [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]] (business history), [[Jay Lorsch]] (organizational behavior) and Elizabeth MacIver (organizational behavior). According to Lorsch and MacIver "many large corporations have dominant control over business affairs without sufficient accountability or monitoring by their board of directors".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In the 1980s, [[Eugene Fama]] and [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Fama]] and [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]] ''The Separation of Ownership and Control'', (1983, Journal of Law and Economics)&lt;/ref&gt; established the [[principalâagent problem]] as a way of understanding corporate governance: the firm is seen as a series of contracts.&lt;ref&gt;See also the 1989 article by [[Kathleen Eisenhardt]]: "Agency theory: an assessment and review", ''Academy of Management Review'')&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period from 1977 to 1997, corporate directors' duties in the U.S. expanded beyond their traditional legal responsibility of duty of loyalty to the corporation and to its shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Curtis J.

In the first half of the 1990s, the issue of corporate governance in the U.S. received considerable press attention due to a spate of CEO dismissals (for example, at [[IBM]], [[Kodak]], and [[Honeywell]]) by their boards. The [[CalPERS|California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS)]] led a wave of ''institutional'' shareholder activism (something only very rarely seen before), as a way of ensuring that corporate value would not be destroyed by the now traditionally cozy relationships between the CEO and the board of directors (for example, by the unrestrained issuance of stock options, not infrequently [[Options backdating|back-dated]]).

In the early 2000s, the massive bankruptcies (and criminal malfeasance) of [[Enron]] and [[Worldcom]], as well as lesser [[corporate scandals]] (such as those involving [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia Communications]], [[AOL]], [[Arthur Andersen]], [[Global Crossing]], and [[Tyco International|Tyco]]) led to increased political interest in corporate governance. This was reflected in the passage of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002. Other triggers for continued interest in the corporate governance of organizations included the [[Financial crisis of 2007â08|financial crisis of 2008/9]] and the level of CEO pay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Steven N.

In 1997 the [[East Asian Financial Crisis]] severely affected the economies of [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[South Korea]], [[Malaysia]], and the [[Philippines]] through the exit of foreign capital after property assets collapsed.

==Stakeholders==
Key parties involved in corporate governance include stakeholders such as the board of directors, management and shareholders. External stakeholders such as creditors, auditors, customers, suppliers, government agencies, and the community at large also exert influence. The agency view of the corporation posits that the shareholder forgoes decision rights (control) and entrusts the manager to act in the shareholders' best (joint) interests. Partly as a result of this separation between the two investors and managers, corporate governance mechanisms include a system of controls intended to help align managers' incentives with those of shareholders. Agency concerns (risk) are necessarily lower for a [[controlling interest|controlling shareholder]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In private for-profit corporations, shareholders elect the board of directors to represent their interests. In the case of nonprofits, stakeholders may have some role in recommending or selecting board members, but typically the board itself decides who will serve on the board as a 'self-perpetuating' board.&lt;ref&gt;Dent, George W., Corporate Governance Without Shareholders: A Cautionary Lesson from Non-Profit Organizations (2014). Delaware Journal of Corporate Law (DJCL), Vol. 39, No. 1, 2014; Case Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2014-34. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2481646 Available at SSRN]&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of leadership that the board has over the organization varies; in practice at large organizations, the executive management, principally the CEO, drives major initiatives with the oversight and approval of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://perma.cc/2YHV-KXNR|title=Why Nonprofits Have a Board Problem - HBS Working Knowledge - Harvard Business School|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Harvard Business School|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responsibilities of the board of directors===
Former Chairman of the Board of [[General Motors]] John G. Smale wrote in 1995: "The board is responsible for the successful perpetuation of the corporation.  That responsibility cannot be relegated to management."&lt;ref name="HBRGov1"&gt;{{cite book

| first = HBR
| year = 2000
| title = HBR on Corporate Governance | publisher = Harvard Business School Press
| isbn = 1-57851-237-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[board of directors]] is expected to play a key role in corporate governance. The board has responsibility for: CEO selection and succession; providing feedback to management on the organization's strategy; compensating senior executives; monitoring financial health, performance and risk; and ensuring accountability of the organization to its investors and authorities. Boards typically have several committees (e.g., Compensation, Nominating and Audit) to perform their work.&lt;ref name="Charan 2005"&gt;{{cite book

The OECD Principles of Corporate Governance (2004) describe the responsibilities of the board; some of these are summarized below:&lt;ref name="oecd.org" /&gt;
* Board members should be informed and act ethically and in good faith, with due diligence and care, in the best interest of the company and the shareholders.
* Review and guide corporate strategy, objective setting, major plans of action, risk policy, capital plans, and annual budgets.
* Oversee major acquisitions and divestitures.
* Select, compensate, monitor and replace key executives and oversee succession planning.
* Align key executive and board remuneration (pay) with the longer-term interests of the company and its shareholders.
* Ensure a formal and transparent board member nomination and election process.
* Ensure the integrity of the corporation's accounting and financial reporting systems, including their independent audit.
* Ensure appropriate systems of internal control are established.
* Oversee the process of disclosure and communications.
* Where committees of the board are established, their mandate, composition and working procedures should be well-defined and disclosed.

===Stakeholder interests===
All parties to corporate governance have an interest, whether direct or indirect, in the [[financial performance]] of the corporation. Directors, workers and management receive salaries, benefits and reputation, while investors expect to receive financial returns. For lenders, it is specified interest payments, while returns to equity investors arise from dividend distributions or capital gains on their stock. Customers are concerned with the certainty of the provision of goods and services of an appropriate quality; suppliers are concerned with compensation for their goods or services, and possible continued trading relationships. These parties provide value to the corporation in the form of financial, physical, human and other forms of capital. Many parties may also be concerned with [[corporate social responsibility|corporate social performance]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

A key factor in a party's decision to participate in or engage with a corporation is their confidence that the corporation will deliver the party's expected outcomes. When categories of parties (stakeholders) do not have sufficient confidence that a corporation is being controlled and directed in a manner consistent with their desired outcomes, they are less likely to engage with the corporation. When this becomes an endemic system feature, the loss of confidence and participation in markets may affect many other stakeholders, and increases the likelihood of political action. There is substantial interest in how external systems and institutions, including markets, influence corporate governance.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;

===âAbsentee landlordsâ vs. capital stewards===
[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]]  experts insist that âinstitutional asset owners now seem more eager to take to task [the] negligent CEOsâ of the companies whose shares they own.&lt;ref name="Analyse FinanciÃ¨re"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M. Nicolas J. |last1=Firzli |title= Beyond SDGs: Can Fiduciary Capitalism and Bolder, Better Boards Jumpstart Economic Growth? |url= https://www.academia.edu/28982570/Beyond_SDGs_Can_Fiduciary_Capitalism_and_Bolder_Better_Boards_Jumpstart_Economic_Growth |accessdate=1 November 2016 |work=Analyse FinanciÃ¨re| date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This development is part of a broader trend towards more fully exercised asset ownership â notably from the part of the [[board of directors|boards of directors]] (âtrusteesâ) of large UK, Dutch, Scandinavian and Canadian pension investors:

: âNo longer â[[absentee landlords]]â, {{bracket|[[pension fund]]}} trustees have started to exercise more forcefully their [[governance]] prerogatives across the boardrooms of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Benelux]] and [[America]]: coming together through the establishment of engaged pressure groups [â¦] to âshift the [whole economic] system towards sustainable investmentâ.â&lt;ref name="Analyse FinanciÃ¨re"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M. Nicolas J. |last1=Firzli |title= Beyond SDGs: Can Fiduciary Capitalism and Bolder, Better Boards Jumpstart Economic Growth? |url= https://www.academia.edu/28982570/Beyond_SDGs_Can_Fiduciary_Capitalism_and_Bolder_Better_Boards_Jumpstart_Economic_Growth |accessdate=1 November 2016 |work=Analyse FinanciÃ¨re| date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This could eventually put more pressure on the [[CEO]]s of [[public company|publicly listed companies]], as âmore than ever before, many [North American,] UK and European Union [[trustee|pension trustees]] speak enthusiastically about flexing their [[fiduciary]] muscles for the UNâs [[Sustainable Development Goals]]â, and other [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG-centric]] investment practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In Britain, âThe widespread social disenchantment that followed the [2008-2012] [[great recession]] had an impactâ on all stakeholders, including [[pension fund]] board members and investment managers.&lt;ref name="Pensions Age"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Louise |last1=Farrand |title= Investing in Change |url= http://www.pensionsage.com/pa/images/activism_Nov2016.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2017 |work=Pensions Age| date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the UKâs largest pension funds are thus already active stewards of their assets, engaging with [[corporate board]]s and speaking up when they think it is necessary.&lt;ref name="Pensions Age"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Louise |last1=Farrand |title= Investing in Change |url= http://www.pensionsage.com/pa/images/activism_Nov2016.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2017 |work=Pensions Age| date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control and ownership structures===
Control and ownership structure refers to the types and composition of shareholders in a corporation. In some countries such as most of Continental Europe, ownership is not necessarily equivalent to control due to the existence of e.g. '''dual-class shares''', '''ownership pyramids''', '''voting coalitions''', '''proxy votes''' and '''clauses in the articles of association that confer additional voting rights to long-term shareholders'''.&lt;ref name="Goergen, Marc 2012"&gt;Goergen, Marc, ''International Corporate Governance'', Prentice Hall, Harlow, January, 2012, Chapter 3, {{ISBN|978-0-273-75125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership is typically defined as the ownership of cash flow rights whereas control refers to ownership of control or voting rights.&lt;ref name="Goergen, Marc 2012"/&gt; Researchers often "measure" control and ownership structures by using some observable measures of control and ownership concentration or the extent of inside control and ownership. Some features or types of control and ownership structure involving [[corporate group]]s include pyramids, [[cross ownership|cross-shareholdings]], rings, and webs. German "concerns" (Konzern) are legally recognized corporate groups with complex structures. Japanese [[keiretsu]] (ç³»å) and South Korean [[chaebol]] (which tend to be family-controlled) are corporate groups which consist of complex interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. Cross-shareholding is an essential feature of keiretsu and chaebol groups[http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/1397.html]. Corporate engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders can differ substantially across different control and ownership structures.

====Family control====
Family interests dominate ownership and control structures of some corporations, and it has been suggested that the oversight of family-controlled corporations are superior to corporations "controlled" by institutional investors (or with such diverse share ownership that they are controlled by management). A recent study by Credit Suisse found that companies in which "founding families retain a stake of more than 10% of the company's capital enjoyed a superior performance over their respective sectorial peers." Since 1996, this superior performance amounts to 8% per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.credit-suisse.com/research/en/ Error 404&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081111151350/http://www.credit-suisse.com/research/en/ |date=2008-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forget the celebrity CEO. "Look beyond Six Sigma and the latest technology fad. One of the biggest strategic advantages a company can have is blood ties," according to a ''Business Week'' study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_45/b3857002.htm Bloomberg Business&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724055953/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_45/b3857002.htm |date=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BpkhYDj4tm0C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Forget+the+celebrity+CEO.+%22Look+beyond+Six+Sigma+and+the+latest+technology+fad&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oj5p95CpPG&amp;sig=txNGvX1pBsY1jWP58bBT35z6HGE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0aXsT5XcA4rmqgH1sLXoBQ&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Forget%20the%20celebrity%20CEO.%20%22Look%20beyond%20Six%20Sigma%20and%20the%20latest%20technology%20fad&amp;f=false Programme Management: Managing Multiple Projects Successfully] By Prashant Mittal&lt;/ref&gt;

====Diffuse shareholders====
The significance of institutional investors varies substantially across countries. In developed Anglo-American countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, U.K., U.S.), institutional investors dominate the market for stocks in larger corporations. While the majority of the shares in the Japanese market are held by financial companies and industrial corporations, these are not institutional investors if their holdings are largely with-on group.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The largest pools of invested money (such as the mutual fund '[[Vanguard 500]]', or the largest investment management firm for corporations, [[State Street Corp.]]) are designed to maximize the benefits of diversified investment by investing in a very large number of different corporations with sufficient [[liquidity]]. The idea is this strategy will largely eliminate individual firm [[financial risk|financial]] or other risk. A consequence of this approach is that these investors have relatively little interest in the governance of a  particular corporation. It is often assumed that, if institutional investors pressing for changes decide they will likely be costly because of "[[golden handshake]]s" or the effort required, they will simply sell out their investment.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Mechanisms and controls==
Corporate governance mechanisms and controls are designed to reduce the inefficiencies that arise from [[moral hazard]] and [[adverse selection]]. There are both internal monitoring systems and external monitoring systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sytse Douma]] &amp; [[Hein Schreuder]] (2013) "Economic Approaches to Organizations", 5th edition, chapter 15, London: Pearson [http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Economic-Approaches-to-Organisations/9780273735298.page]&lt;/ref&gt; Internal monitoring can be done, for example, by one (or a few) large shareholder(s) in the case of privately held companies or a firm belonging to a [[business group]]. Furthermore, the various board mechanisms provide for internal monitoring. External monitoring of managers' behavior occurs when an independent third party (e.g. the [[external auditor]]) attests the accuracy of information provided by management to investors. Stock analysts and debt holders may also conduct such external monitoring. An ideal monitoring and control system should regulate both motivation and ability, while providing [[incentive alignment]] toward corporate goals and objectives. Care should be taken that incentives are not so strong that some individuals are tempted to cross lines of ethical behavior, for example by manipulating revenue and profit figures to drive the share price of the company up.&lt;ref name="catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk"/&gt;

===Internal corporate governance controls===
Internal corporate governance controls monitor activities and then take corrective actions to accomplish organisational goals. Examples include:
* '''Monitoring by the board of directors''': The board of directors, with its legal authority to hire, fire and compensate top management, safeguards invested capital. Regular board meetings allow potential problems to be identified, discussed and avoided. Whilst non-executive directors are thought to be more independent, they may not always result in more effective corporate governance and may not increase performance.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagat &amp; Black, "The Uncertain Relationship Between Board Composition and Firm Performance", 54 Business Lawyer&lt;/ref&gt; Different board structures are optimal for different firms. Moreover, the ability of the board to monitor the firm's executives is a function of its access to information. Executive directors possess superior knowledge of the decision-making process and therefore evaluate top management on the basis of the quality of its decisions that lead to financial performance outcomes, ''ex ante''. It could be argued, therefore, that executive directors look beyond the financial criteria.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''Internal control procedures and internal auditors''': Internal control procedures are policies implemented by an entity's board of directors, audit committee, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance of the entity achieving its objectives related to reliable financial reporting, operating efficiency, and compliance with laws and regulations. Internal auditors are personnel within an organization who test the design and implementation of the entity's internal control procedures and the reliability of its financial reporting.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''Balance of power''': The simplest balance of power is very common; require that the President be a different person from the Treasurer.  This application of separation of power is further developed in companies where separate divisions check and balance each other's actions.  One group may propose company-wide administrative changes, another group review and can veto the changes, and a third group check that the interests of people (customers, shareholders, employees) outside the three groups are being met.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''Remuneration''': Performance-based remuneration is designed to relate some proportion of salary to individual performance. It may be in the form of cash or non-cash payments such as [[share (finance)|shares]] and [[share option]]s, [[superannuation]] or other benefits. Such incentive schemes, however, are reactive in the sense that they provide no mechanism for preventing mistakes or opportunistic behavior, and can elicit myopic behavior.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''Monitoring by large shareholders''' and/or '''monitoring by banks and other large creditors''': Given their large investment in the firm, these stakeholders have the incentives, combined with the right degree of control and power, to monitor the management.&lt;ref&gt;Goergen, Marc, ''International Corporate Governance'', Prentice Hall, Harlow, January, 2012, pp. 104â105, {{ISBN|978-0-273-75125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In publicly traded U.S. corporations, boards of directors are largely ''chosen'' by the President/CEO and the President/CEO often takes the Chair of the Board position for him/herself (which makes it much more difficult for the institutional owners to "fire" him/her). The practice of the CEO also being the Chair of the Board is fairly common in large American corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Tom C. W., The Corporate Governance of Iconic Executives (2011). 87 Notre Dame Law Review 351 (2011). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2040922&lt;/ref&gt;

While this practice is common in the U.S., it is relatively rare elsewhere. In the U.K., successive codes of best practice have recommended against duality.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===External corporate governance controls===
External corporate governance controls the external stakeholders' exercise over the organization. Examples include:
* competition
* debt covenants
* demand for and assessment of performance information (especially [[financial statements]])
* government regulations
* managerial labour market
* media pressure
* takeovers
* [[proxy firm]]s

===Financial reporting and the independent auditor===
The board of directors has primary responsibility for the corporation's internal and external [[financial report]]ing functions. The [[chief executive officer]] and [[chief financial officer]] are crucial participants, and boards usually have a high degree of reliance on them for the integrity and supply of accounting information. They oversee the internal accounting systems, and are dependent on the corporation's [[accountant]]s and [[internal auditor]]s.

Current accounting rules under [[International Accounting Standards]] and U.S. [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] allow managers some choice in determining the methods of measurement and criteria for recognition of various financial reporting elements.  The potential exercise of this choice to improve apparent performance increases the [[information risk]] for users. Financial reporting fraud, including non-disclosure and deliberate falsification of values also contributes to users' information risk. To reduce this risk and to enhance the perceived integrity of financial reports, corporation financial reports must be audited by an independent [[external auditor]] who issues a report that accompanies the financial statements.

One area of concern is whether the auditing firm acts as both the independent auditor and management consultant to the firm they are auditing. This may result in a conflict of interest which places the integrity of financial reports in doubt due to client pressure to appease management. The power of the corporate client to initiate and terminate management consulting services and, more fundamentally, to select and dismiss accounting firms contradicts the concept of an independent auditor.  Changes enacted in the United States in the form of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] (following numerous corporate scandals, culminating with the [[Enron scandal]]) prohibit accounting firms from providing both auditing and management consulting services. Similar provisions are in place under clause 49 of Standard Listing Agreement in India.

==Systemic problems==
* Demand for information: In order to influence the directors, the shareholders must combine with others to form a voting group which can pose a real threat of carrying resolutions or appointing directors at a general meeting.&lt;ref name=6.9&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K8zJw-CshBYC&amp;pg=SA6-PA9&amp;dq=%22A+barrier+to+shareholders+using+good+information+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=E_vkT8HeH66I2gW44dTZCQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20barrier%20to%20shareholders%20using%20good%20information%20%22&amp;f=false Current Trends in Management] 6.9&lt;/ref&gt;
* Monitoring costs: A barrier to shareholders using good information is the cost of processing it, especially to a small shareholder. The traditional answer to this problem is the [[efficient-market hypothesis]] (in finance, the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) asserts that financial markets are efficient), which suggests that the small shareholder will free ride on the judgments of larger professional investors.&lt;ref name=6.9/&gt;
* Supply of accounting information: Financial accounts form a crucial link in enabling providers of finance to monitor directors. Imperfections in the financial reporting process will cause imperfections in the effectiveness of corporate governance. This should, ideally, be corrected by the working of the external auditing process.&lt;ref name=6.9/&gt;

==Issues==

===Executive pay===
{{main article|Say on pay}}
Increasing attention and regulation (as under the [[Swiss referendum "against corporate rip-offs" of 2013]]) has been brought to executive pay levels since the [[financial crisis of 2007â2008]]. Research on the relationship between firm performance and [[executive compensation]] does not identify consistent and significant relationships between executives' remuneration and firm performance. Not all firms experience the same levels of agency conflict, and external and internal monitoring devices may be more effective for some than for others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=current/&gt; Some researchers have found that the largest CEO performance incentives came from ownership of the firm's shares, while other researchers found that the relationship between share ownership and firm performance was dependent on the level of ownership. The results suggest that increases in ownership above 20% cause management to become more entrenched, and less interested in the welfare of their shareholders.&lt;ref name=current/&gt;

Some argue that firm performance is positively associated with share [[Option (finance)|option]] plans and that these plans direct managers' energies and extend their decision horizons toward the long-term, rather than the short-term, performance of the company.  However, that point of view came under substantial criticism circa in the wake of various security scandals including mutual fund timing episodes and, in particular, the backdating of option grants as documented by University of Iowa academic Erik Lie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X06001644 | doi=10.1016/j.jfineco.2005.12.003 | volume=83 | issue=2 | title=Does backdating explain the stock price pattern around executive stock option grants? | year=2007 | journal=Journal of Financial Economics | pages=271â295 | last1 = Heron | first1 = Randall A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported by James Blander and Charles Forelle of the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref name=current&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K8zJw-CshBYC&amp;pg=SA6-PA14&amp;lpg=SA6-PA14&amp;dq=Some+researchers+have+found+that+the+largest+CEO+performance+incentives+came+from+ownership+of+the+firm%27s+shares&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ihr3qx-hpF&amp;sig=P9L9MBVyoD8BsKIvr6nxOn8NPj4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xuDkT4fuHeW42wXIn5XaCQ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Some%20researchers%20have%20found%20that%20the%20largest%20CEO%20performance%20incentives%20came%20from%20ownership%20of%20the%20firm%27s%20shares&amp;f=false Current Trends in Management]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/7193 As Companies Probe Backdating, More Top Officials Take a Fall] |Charles Forelle and James Bandler| October 12, 2006| wsj.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the negative influence on public opinion caused by the 2006 backdating scandal, use of options faced various criticisms.  A particularly forceful and long running argument concerned the interaction of executive options with corporate stock repurchase programs.  Numerous authorities (including U.S. Federal Reserve Board economist Weisbenner) determined options may be employed in concert with stock buybacks in a manner contrary to shareholder interests.  These authors argued that, in part, corporate stock buybacks for U.S. Standard &amp; Poor's 500 companies surged to a $500 billion annual rate in late 2006 because of the effect of options.  A compendium of academic works on the option/buyback issue is included in the study [http://ssrn.com/abstract=927111 ''Scandal''] by author [http://ssrn.com/author=665434 M. Gumport] issued in 2006.

A combination of accounting changes and governance issues led options to become a less popular means of remuneration as 2006 progressed, and various alternative implementations of buybacks surfaced to challenge the dominance of "open market" cash buybacks as the preferred means of implementing a [[share repurchase]] plan.

===Separation of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board roles===
Shareholders elect a board of directors, who in turn hire a [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) to lead management. The primary responsibility of the board relates to the selection and retention of the CEO.  However, in many U.S. corporations the CEO and Chairman of the Board roles are held by the same person. This creates an inherent conflict of interest between management and the board.

Critics of combined roles argue the two roles should be separated to avoid the conflict of interest and more easily enable a poorly performing CEO to be replaced. [[Warren Buffett]] wrote in 2014: "In my service on the boards of nineteen public companies, however, Iâve seen how hard it is to replace a mediocre CEO if that person is also Chairman. (The deed usually gets done, but almost always very late.)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Letters-Warren Buffett-2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates argue that empirical studies do not indicate that separation of the roles improves stock market performance and that it should be up to shareholders to determine what corporate governance model is appropriate for the firm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/opinion/the-jamie-dimon-witch-hunt.html?_r=0 NYT â Jeffrey Sonnenfeld â The Jamie Dimon Witch Hunt â May 8, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, 73.4% of U.S. companies had combined roles; this fell to 57.2% by May 2012. Many U.S. companies with combined roles have appointed a "Lead Director" to improve independence of the board from management. German and UK companies have generally split the roles in nearly 100% of listed companies. Empirical evidence does not indicate one model is superior to the other in terms of performance. However, one study indicated that poorly performing firms tend to remove separate CEOs more frequently than when the CEO/Chair roles are combined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3290632/SHOULD_THE_USA_FOLLOW_THE_UKS_LEAD_AND_SPLIT_THE_DUAL_CEO_CHAIRPERSONs_ROLE University of Cambridge-Magdalena Smith â Should the USA follow the UK's lead and split the dual CEO/Chairperson role?]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24671">'''Corporate welfare''' is a term that [[Analogy|analogizes]] corporate [[subsidy|subsidies]] to [[Welfare|welfare payments]] for the poor.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140327"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kristof |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Kristof |title=A Nation of Takers? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/27/opinion/kristof-a-nation-of-takers.html |date=March 27, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used to describe a government's bestowal of [[Grant (money)|money grants]], [[tax break]]s, or other special favorable treatment for [[corporation]]s. It highlights how wealthy corporations are less in need of such treatment than the poor.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140327"/&gt;

The definition of corporate welfare is sometimes restricted to direct government subsidies of major corporations, excluding tax loopholes and all manner of regulatory and trade decisions, which, in practice, could be worth much more than any direct subsidies.

== Origin of term ==
The term "corporate welfare" was reportedly invented in 1956 by [[Ralph Nader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== "Socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor" ===
Believed to have been first popularised by [[Michael Harrington]]'s 1962 book ''[[The Other America]]''&lt;ref&gt;Harrington 1962, p.170, quote: "socialism for the rich and private enterprise for the poor"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert P.

=== "Privatizing profits and socializing losses" ===
"Privatizing profits and socializing losses" refers to the idea that corporations want to reserve financial gains for themselves and pass along losses to the rest of society, potentially through lobbying the government for assistance. This practice was criticized in the [[Wall Street bailout]] of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privatizing-profits-and-socializing-losses.asp|title=Privatizing Profits And Socializing Losses|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=15 April 2012|website=investopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Background ===
[[Subsidies]] considered excessive, unwarranted, wasteful, unfair, inefficient, or bought by [[lobbying]] are often called corporate welfare.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140327" /&gt; The label of corporate welfare is often used to decry projects advertised as benefiting the general welfare that spend a disproportionate amount of funds on large corporations, and often in uncompetitive, or [[anti-competitive]] ways. For instance, in the United States, [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] are usually portrayed as helping independent farmers stay afloat. However, the majority of income gained from commodity support programs actually goes to large [[agribusiness]] corporations such as [[Archer Daniels Midland]], as they own a considerably larger percentage of production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usda.gov/factbook/chapter3.htm USDA: American Farms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210035144/http://www.usda.gov/factbook/chapter3.htm |date=2007-02-10 }} www.USDA.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comprehensive analyses ===
==== Cato Institute ====

==== Independent ====
Daniel D. Huff, [[professor emeritus]] of [[social work]] at [[Boise State University]], published a comprehensive analysis of corporate welfare in 1993.&lt;ref name='Huff 1993'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phantom Welfare: Public Relief for Corporate America |journal=Social Work |date=May 1993 |first=Daniel D. |last=Huff |author2=David A.

{{quote|In 1990 the federal government spent 4.7 billion dollars on all forms of international aid. Pollution control programs received 4.8 billion dollars of federal assistance while both secondary and elementary education were allotted only 8.4 billion dollars. More to the point, while more than 170 billion dollars is expended on assorted varieties of corporate welfare the federal government spends 11 billion dollars on Aid for Dependent Children. The most expensive means tested welfare program, Medicaid, costs the federal government 30 billion dollars a year or about half of the amount corporations receive each year through assorted tax breaks. S.S.I., the federal program for the disabled, receives 13 billion dollars while American businesses are given 17 billion in direct federal aid.&lt;ref name='Huff 1993'/&gt;}}

Huff argued that deliberate [[obfuscation]] was a complicating factor.&lt;ref name='Huff 1993'/&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
In 2015, Kevin Farnsworth, a senior lecturer in [[Social Policy]] at the [[University of York]] published a paper in which he claimed that the government was providing corporate subsidies of Â£93 billion.&lt;ref name=farnsworthpaper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speri.dept.shef.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SPERI-Paper-24-The-British-Corporate-Welfare-State.pdf |title=The British Corporate Welfare State: Public Provision for Private Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/07/corporate-welfare-a-93bn-handshake |title=The Â£93bn handshake: businesses pocket huge subsidies and tax breaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amount includes the role of the government in increasing trade, tax relief for businesses that invest in new plants and machinery (estimated by Farnsworth at Â£20 billion), not charging fuel duty on fuel used by railways or airlines, green energy subsidies, a lower corporation tax rate for small companies, [[regional development]] grants and government procurement for businesses (which Farnsworth suggests often favours British businesses even when these are not the best value option available).&lt;ref name=farnsworthpaper /&gt; However, ''[[The Register]]'' wrote that Farnsworth's figure for tax relief for investment was incorrect and that he had made mistakes in his calculations, noting that he was not an accountant. It also stated that not charging businesses taxes under certain circumstances (when the reliefs applied) was not the same as giving them a subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/12/political_memes_economics_corporate_welfare/?page=1 |title=Taxpayers are NOT giving businesses Â£93bn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel duty is not charged on airlines due to the [[Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation|Convention on International Civil Aviation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/publications/pages/doc7300.aspx |title=Convention on International Civil Aviation}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a [[United Nations|UN agency]]) which specifies that aeroplanes should be exempt from fuel duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fullfact.org/factchecks/airline_industry_subsidies_green_taxes-3256 |title=Does the government subsidise airlines by Â£10 billion?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political discussion ===
In 2015, [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party leader]] [[Jeremy Corbyn]] said he would âstrip outâ the Â£93bn of âcorporate tax relief and subsidiesâ Farnsworth referred to and use the proceeds for public investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-allies-accuse-chris-leslie-of-deliberately-misrepresenting-labour-leader-contenders-economic-policies-10436258.html|title=Jeremy Corbyn allies accuse Chris Leslie of deliberately misrepresenting Labour frontrunner's economic policies | location=London | work=The Independent|first=Andrew|last=Grice|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corbyn did not say which specific policies he would change. ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote the policy "sounds wonderful, but careful scrutiny of 'corporate welfare' shows that it includes capital allowances designed to persuade companies to invest, regional aid to boost growth in rundown parts of the UK, and subsidies to keep bus and rail routes open â none of which Corbyn would presumably like to see stopped."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/20/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leader-tory-economy-plans |title=Jeremy Corbyn has the vision, but his numbers donât yet add up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canada ==
The [[New Democratic Party]] in [[Canada]] picked up the term as a major theme in its [[Canadian federal election, 1972|1972 federal election]] campaign. Its leader, [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], used the term in the title of his 1972 book, ''Louder Voices: The Corporate Welfare Bums''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Louder voices: the corporate welfare bums|last=Lewis|first=David|publisher=James Lewis &amp; Samuel|year=1972|isbn=9780888620316|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] and its successor the [[Canadian Alliance]] were known for opposing mostly business subsidies. However, after their merger with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada candidates, 1997 Canadian federal election|Progressive Conservative]] party, they dropped their opposition  to it. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=zxjshaowfeYC&amp;pg=PT66&amp;lpg=PT66&amp;dq=reform+party+corporate+welfare&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lDUyasx11z&amp;sig=B8UXPouQ_G4D-7uKOFfwNe5J3Ok&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj-k5v3oa3dAhXJmVkKHVqVCT04FBDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=reform%20party%20corporate%20welfare&amp;f=false|title=A Nation of Serfs: How Canada's Political Culture Corrupts Canadian Values|last=Milke|first=Mark|date=2010-01-14|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470675175|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== India ==
It was observed by [[The Wire (Indian web publication)|The Wire]] that the [[Effective tax rate]] was low for the larger corporations which meant companies making smaller profits are competing in an unequal environment against bigger companies with substantial taxation benefits, with the gap in effective tax rates widening over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thewire.in/economy/why-52911-profitable-indian-companies-pay-0-tax|title=Why 52,911 Profitable Indian Companies Pay 0% Tax |website=The Wire|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's Union government's prime minister criticised this practice and said
{{quote| "Why is it that subsidies going to the well-off are portrayed in a positive manner? Let me give you an example. The total revenue loss from incentives to corporate tax payers was over Rs 62,000 croreâ¦I must confess I am surprised by the way words are used by experts on this matter. When a benefit is given to farmers or to the poor, experts and government officers normally call it a subsidy. However, I find that if a benefit is given to industry or commerce, it is usually an âincentiveâ or a âsubvention'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/business/modi-calls-for-targeted-subsidies-questions-corporate-tax-breaks/story-IP1WX17PvJeyOfyLf0ZXxJ.html|title=Modi calls for targeted subsidies, questions corporate tax breaks|date=2016-01-30|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;!-- needs more exmaples, should cover Wallenberg,  Maxwell etc, fraud, loss of control, breaking the connection between ownership and management --&gt;
'''Cross ownership''' is a method of reinforcing business relationships by owning stock in the companies with which a given company does business. Heavy cross ownership is referred to as circular ownership.

In the US, "cross ownership" also refers to a type of investment in different mass-media properties in one market.

==Cross ownership of stock==
Some countries where cross ownership of shares is a major part of the business culture are:
* [[Japan]]
* [[Germany]]

Positives of cross ownership:
* Closely ties each business to the economic destiny of its business partners
* Promotes a slow rate of economic change

Cross ownership of shares is criticized for:
* Stagnating the economy
* Wasting capital that could be used to improve productivity
* Expanding economic downturns by preventing reallocation of capital

A major factor in perpetuating cross ownership of shares is a high [[capital gains tax]] rate.  A company has less incentive to sell cross owned shares if taxes are high because of the immediate reduction in the value of the assets.

For example, a company owns $1000 of stock in another company that was originally purchased for $200.  If the capital gains tax rate is 25% (like Germany) and the company sells the stock,
the company has $800 which is 20 percent less than before it sold the stock.

Long term cross ownership of shares combined with a high capital tax rate greatly increases periods of asset deflation both in time and in severity.

==Media cross ownership==
{{main|Media cross-ownership in the United States}}

Cross ownership also refers to a type of media ownership in which one type of communications (say a newspaper) owns or is the sister company of another type of medium (such as a radio or TV station). One example is ''[[The New York Times]]'' 's former ownership of [[WQXR-FM|WQXR]] Radio and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'''s similar relationship with WGN Radio ([[WGN-AM]]) and Television ([[WGN-TV]]).

The [[Federal Communications Commission]] generally does not allow cross ownership, to keep from one license holder having too much local media ownership, unless the license holder obtains a waiver, such as [[News Corporation]] and the [[Tribune Company]] have in New York.

The mid-1970s cross-ownership guidelines grandfathered already-existing crossownerships, such as ''Tribune''-WGN, ''New York Times''-WQXR and the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' ownership of [[WPIX]] Television and Radio.

== History ==

In 1996, Finlay Cumming established Cumming LLC in [[Southern California]]. Between 2002 and 2006, Cumming opened new offices in [[Northern California]], [[Colorado]], [[Nevada]], [[Florida]], [[Arizona]], [[Texas]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Later in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://enr.construction.com/people/toplists/topcmfee/topcmfee_1-50.asp ENR's Top 100 CM for Fee] Engineering-News Record, June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Cumming was named to [[Engineering News-Record|Engineering News-Recordâs]] listing of the Top 100 CM-for-Fee firm in the United States, and continues to receive the honor, ranking in the top 40 every year since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enr.construction.com/toplists/cm-fee/001-100.asp ENR's Top 100 Construction Management Firms Throughout the Years] Engineering-News Record, June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the firm officially incorporated as Cumming Corporation and a year later in 2008, Cumming acquired Construction Controls Group (CCG), a Los Angeles-based program and project/construction management business. Shortly after the acquisition of CCG, Cumming acquired Southern Management Group (SMG),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernmanagementgroup.com/ Southern Management Group] Southern Management Group, January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; a South Carolina-based firm with more than 20 years of experience in program and project/construction management. Later in 2008, after several years working abroad, Cumming established Cumming International and opened its first overseas office in [[Abu Dhabi]]. 
== Present ==
Cumming currently has 37 offices across the U.S. and internationally with more than 620 employees. According to Engineering News-Record (ENR),&lt;ref&gt;[http://enr.construction.com/toplists/Top-CM-Fee-Firms/001-100.asp/ Construction Management-for-Fee Firms] Engineering News-Record, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Cumming has ranked among the top 40 [[construction management]] firms on its annual listing of the Top 100 CM-for-Fee Firms in the United States for the past six years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdbj.com/news/2013/jun/17/cumming-moves-top-100-construction-management-list/ Cumming Moves Up on Top 100 Construction Management List] San Diego Business Journal, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

It is akin to a [[rÃ©sumÃ©]] in North America. In some countries, a CV is typically the first item that a potential [[employer]] encounters regarding the job seeker and is typically used to screen applicants, often followed by an [[job interview|interview]]. CVs may also be requested for applicants to postsecondary programs, scholarships, grants and bursaries. In the 2010s, some applicants provide an electronic text of their CV to employers using [[email]], an online [[employment website]] or using a job-oriented [[social networking service|social-networking-service]] [[website]], such as [[LinkedIn]].

&lt;!-- Deleted for image removed: [[Image:Simple British CV.jpg|thumb|The first part of a Isi CV used in the United States] --&gt;
In the [[United Kingdom]], most [[Commonwealth countries]], and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], a CV is short (usually a maximum of two sides of [[ISO 216|A4]] paper), and therefore contains only a summary of the job seeker's employment history, qualifications, education, and some personal information. Some parts of Asia require applicants' photos, date of birth, and most recent salary information. CVs are often tailored to change the emphasis of the information according to the particular position for which the job seeker is applying. A CV can also be extended to include an extra page for the jobseeker's publications if these are important for the job.

In the [[United States]], [[Pakistan]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Germany]], [[India]], and [[Cuba]] a CV is a comprehensive document used in academic circles and medical careers that elaborate on education, publications, and other achievements. A CV contains greater detail than a [[rÃ©sumÃ©]], a shorter summary which is more often used in applications for jobs, but it is often expected that professionals use a short CV that highlights the current focus of their academic lives and not necessarily their full history. A CV is generally used when applying for a position in academia, while a resume is generally used when applying for a position in industry, non-profit, and the public sector.&lt;ref name="ucdavis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://icc.ucdavis.edu/materials/resume/resumecv.htm|title=Resume vs. Curriculum Vitae: What's the Difference? &amp;#124; Internship and Career Center|publisher=icc.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology, spellings and pronunciation ==
''Curriculum vitae'' is a [[Latin]] expression which can be loosely translated as ''[the] course of [my] life''. In current usage, ''curriculum'' is less [[markedness|marked]] as a foreign [[loanword]]. Traditionally the word ''vitae'' is rendered in English using the [[Ligature (typography)|ligature]] [[Ã¦]], hence ''vitÃ¦'',&lt;ref&gt;[[List of words that may be spelled with a ligature]]&lt;/ref&gt; although this convention (curriculum vitÃ¦) is less common in contemporary practice.

The plural of ''curriculum vitae'', in Latin, is formed following Latin rules of grammar as ''curricula vitae'', and is used along with ''curricula vitarum'',&lt;ref name=aueFAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxplural.html |title=alt.usage.english FAQ |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403101518/http://www.alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxplural.html |archivedate=3 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; each of which is debated as being more grammatically correct than the other.

In English, the plural of the full expression curriculum vitae is seldom used; the plural of ''curriculum'' on its own is usually written as "curricula",&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition, Houghton Mifflin, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the traditional ''curriculums''.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;''[[OED]]'', 2nd edition, [[Oxford University Press]], 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5136">'''Debtor-in-possession financing''' or '''DIP financing''' is a special form of [[financing]] provided for companies in [[financial distress]], typically during restructuring under corporate bankruptcy law (such as [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] in the US or [[Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act|CCAA]] in Canada&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Canada Income Tax Act: Enforcement, Collection, Prosecution, 4th Ed.|author=Lyndon Maither, B.C.|publisher=Lyndon Maither|isbn=9781300772286|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mrxbeR2IiXgC|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Usually, this debt is considered senior to all other [[debt]], [[Stock|equity]], and any other [[Security (finance)|securities]] issued by a company&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vault Guide to Bankruptcy Law Careers|author1=Stuhl, S.A.|author2=Vault (Firm)|date=2003|publisher=Vault Incorporated|isbn=9781581312577|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96kIg4mRZQkC|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; â violating any ''absolute priority rule'' by placing the new financing ahead of a company's existing debts for payment.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Subnational Insolvency: Cross-Country Experiences and Lessons|author=Liu, L.|date=2008|publisher=World Bank|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUQRqYb_oj0C|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DIP financing may be used to keep a business operating until it can be sold as a [[going concern]],&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Canada Income Tax Act: Enforcement, Collection, Prosecution, 6th Edition: |author=Lyndon Maither, B.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZjeAgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; if this is likely to provide a greater return to creditors than the firm's closure and a [[liquidation]] of assets. It may also give a troubled company a new start, albeit under strict conditions. In this case, "debtor in possession" financing refers to debt incurred while in bankruptcy, and "exit financing" is debt incurred upon emerging from reorganisation under bankruptcy law.&lt;ref name="google5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Commercial Aviation: Bankruptcy and Pension Problems Are Symptoms of Underlying Structural Issues|author=Hecker, J.E.Z.|date=2006|publisher=DIANE Publishing Company|isbn=9781422304327|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NhDjMtWwvwMC|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Two notable examples are the government financing of [[Chrysler]]&lt;ref name="google6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Financial Audit: Office of Financial Stability (Troubled Asset Relief Program) Fiscal Year 2009 Financial Statements|author=Engel, G.T.|date=2010|publisher=DIANE Publishing Company|isbn=9781437926811|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D3NU3Ohs0hsC|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[General Motors]]&lt;ref name="google7"&gt;{{cite book|title=Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP): Quarterly Report to Congress by the Office of the Special Inspector General (SIGTARP)(October 26, 2010)|author=Barofsky, N.|date=2011|publisher=DIANE Publishing Company|isbn=9781437942019|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7tcGqgQvLTYC|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; during their respective 2009 bankruptcies.

==American law vs. French law==
The willingness of governments to allow lenders to place debtor-in-possession financing claims ahead of an insolvent company's existing debt varies; US bankruptcy law expressly allows this&lt;ref name="google8"&gt;{{cite book|title=Use of TARP Funds in the Support and Reorganization of the Domestic Automotive Industry|author=Warren, E.|date=2010|publisher=DIANE Publishing Company|isbn=9781437923698|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FODXmeZA6xgC|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; while French law had long treated the practice as ''soutien abusif'', requiring employees and state interests be paid first even if the end result was liquidation instead of corporate restructuring.&lt;ref name="google9"&gt;{{cite book|title=Corporate Restructuring: Lessons from Experience|author1=Pomerleano, M.|author2=Shaw, W.|author3=Bank, W.|date=2005|publisher=World Bank|isbn=9780821359280|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7MbS7-At5XAC|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Decision Support System for John Day Reservoir.jpg|thumb|360px|Example of a decision support system for [[John Day Dam|John Day Reservoir]].]]
{{Recommender systems}}

A '''decision support system''' ('''DSS''') is an [[Information systems|information system]] that supports business or organizational [[decision-making]] activities. DSSs serve the management, operations and planning levels of an organization (usually mid and higher management) and help people make decisions about problems that may be rapidly changing and not easily specified in advanceâi.e. unstructured and semi-structured decision problems. Decision support systems can be either fully computerized or human-powered, or a combination of both.

While academics have perceived DSS as a tool to support [[decision making process]], DSS users see DSS as a tool to facilitate organizational processes.&lt;ref&gt;Keen, Peter; (1980),"Decision support systems : a research perspective."Cambridge, Massachusetts : Center for Information Systems Research, Alfred P. Sloan School of Management.http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/47172&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have extended the definition of DSS to include any [[system]] that might support [[decision making]] and some DSS include a [[decision-making software]] component; Sprague (1980)&lt;ref name='sprague1980'&gt;Sprague, R;(1980). "A Framework for the Development of Decision Support Systems." MIS Quarterly. Vol. 4, No. 4, pp.1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; defines a properly termed DSS as follows:
# DSS tends to be aimed at the less well structured, underspecified [[problem]] that upper level [[Management|manager]]s typically face;
# DSS attempts to combine the use of models or analytic techniques with traditional [[data access]] and retrieval functions;
# DSS specifically focuses on features which make them easy to use by non-computer-proficient people in an interactive mode; and
# DSS emphasizes [[flexibility]] and [[adaptability]] to accommodate changes in the [[Knowledge environment|environment]] and the [[decision making]] approach of the user.

DSSs include [[knowledge-based systems]]. A properly designed DSS is an interactive software-based system intended to help decision makers compile useful information from a combination of raw data, documents, and personal knowledge, or business models to identify and solve problems and make decisions.

Typical information that a decision support application might gather and present includes:
*inventories of information assets (including legacy and relational data sources, cubes, [[data warehouse]]s, and [[data mart]]s),
*comparative sales figures between one period and the next,
*projected revenue figures based on product sales assumptions.

==History==
The concept of decision support has evolved mainly from the theoretical studies of organizational decision making done at the [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Institute of Technology]] during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the implementation work done in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Scott Morton "&gt;Keen, P. G. W. (1978). ''Decision support systems: an organizational perspective''. Reading, Mass., Addison-Wesley Pub. Co. {{ISBN|0-201-03667-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; DSS became an area of research of its own in the middle of the 1970s, before gaining in intensity during the 1980s. In the middle and late 1980s, [[executive information system]]s (EIS), group decision support systems (GDSS), and organizational decision support systems (ODSS) evolved from the single user and model-oriented DSS.

According to Sol (1987)&lt;ref name="HGS87"&gt;[[Henk G. Sol]] et al. (1987). ''Expert systems and artificial intelligence in decision support systems: proceedings of the Second Mini Euroconference, Lunteren, The Netherlands, 17â20 November 1985''. Springer, 1987. {{ISBN|90-277-2437-7}}. p.1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; the definition and scope of DSS has been migrating over the years: in the 1970s DSS was described as "a computer-based system to aid decision making"; in the late 1970s the DSS movement started focusing on "interactive computer-based systems which help decision-makers utilize data bases and models to solve ill-structured problems"; in the 1980s DSS should provide systems "using suitable and available technology to improve effectiveness of managerial and professional activities", and towards the end of 1980s DSS faced a new challenge towards the design of intelligent workstations.&lt;ref name="HGS87" /&gt;

In 1987, [[Texas Instruments]] completed development of the Gate Assignment Display System (GADS) for [[United Airlines]]. This decision support system is credited with significantly reducing travel delays by aiding the management of ground operations at various [[airport]]s, beginning with [[O'Hare International Airport]] in [[Chicago]] and Stapleton Airport in [[Denver]] [[Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Efraim Turban |author2=Jay E. Aronson |author3=Ting-Peng Liang |page=574 |year=2008 |title=Decision Support Systems and Intelligent Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in about 1990, [[data warehouse|data warehousing]] and [[Online analytical processing|on-line analytical processing]] (OLAP) began broadening the realm of DSS. As the turn of the millennium approached, new Web-based analytical applications were introduced.

The advent of more and better reporting technologies has seen DSS start to emerge as a critical component of  [[management]] design.  Examples of this can be seen in the intense amount of discussion of DSS in the education environment.

DSS also have a weak connection to the [[user interface]] paradigm of [[hypertext]].  Both the [[University of Vermont]] [[Problem-Oriented Medical Information System|PROMIS]] system (for medical decision making) and the Carnegie Mellon [[ZOG (hypertext)|ZOG]]/[[KMS (Hypertext)|KMS]] system (for military and business decision making) were decision support systems which also were major breakthroughs in user interface research.  Furthermore, although [[hypertext]] researchers have generally been concerned with [[information overload]], certain researchers, notably [[Douglas Engelbart]], have been focused on decision makers in particular.

==Taxonomies==
Using the relationship with the user as the criterion, Haettenschwiler&lt;ref name="Haettenschwiler 1999"&gt;Haettenschwiler, P. (1999). Neues anwenderfreundliches Konzept der EntscheidungsunterstÃ¼tzung. Gutes Entscheiden in Wirtschaft, Politik und Gesellschaft. Zurich, vdf Hochschulverlag AG: 189-208.&lt;/ref&gt; differentiates ''passive'', ''active'', and ''cooperative DSS''. A ''passive DSS'' is a system that aids the process of decision making, but that cannot bring out explicit decision suggestions or solutions. An ''active DSS'' can bring out such decision suggestions or solutions. A ''cooperative DSS'' allows for an iterative process between human and system towards the achievement of a consolidated solution: the decision maker (or its advisor) can modify, complete, or refine the decision suggestions provided by the system, before sending them back to the system for validation, and likewise the system again improves, completes, and refines the suggestions of the decision maker and sends them back to them for validation.

Another taxonomy for DSS, according to the mode of assistance, has been created by Daniel Power: he  differentiates ''communication-driven DSS'', ''data-driven DSS'', ''document-driven DSS'', ''knowledge-driven DSS'', and ''model-driven DSS''.&lt;ref name="Power 2002"&gt;Power, D. J. (2002). Decision support systems: concepts and resources for managers. Westport, Conn., Quorum Books.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*A '''communication-driven DSS''' enables cooperation, supporting more than one person working on a shared task; examples include integrated tools like Google Docs or [[Microsoft SharePoint Workspace]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanhope, P. (2002). Get in the Groove: building tools and peer-to-peer solutions with the Groove platform. New York, Hungry Minds&lt;/ref&gt;
*A '''data-driven DSS''' (or data-oriented DSS) emphasizes access to and manipulation of a [[time series]] of internal company data and, sometimes, external data.
*A '''document-driven DSS''' manages, retrieves, and manipulates unstructured information in a variety of electronic formats.
*A '''knowledge-driven DSS''' provides specialized [[problem-solving]] expertise stored as facts, rules, procedures, or in similar structures.&lt;ref name="Power 2002" /&gt;
*A '''model-driven DSS''' emphasizes access to and manipulation of a statistical, financial, optimization, or [[Computer Simulation|simulation]] model. Model-driven DSS use data and parameters provided by users to assist decision makers in analyzing a situation; they are not necessarily data-intensive. Dicodess is an example of an [[open-source model]]-driven DSS generator.&lt;ref&gt;Gachet, A. (2004). Building Model-Driven Decision Support Systems with Dicodess. Zurich, VDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using scope as the criterion, Power&lt;ref name="Power 1996"&gt;Power, D. J. (1996). What is a DSS? The On-Line Executive Journal for Data-Intensive Decision Support 1(3).&lt;/ref&gt; differentiates ''enterprise-wide DSS'' and ''desktop DSS''. An ''enterprise-wide DSS'' is linked to large data warehouses and serves many managers in the company. A ''desktop, single-user DSS'' is a small system that runs on an individual manager's PC.

==Components==
[[File:Drought Mitigation Decision Support System.png|thumb|360px|Design of a [[drought]] mitigation decision support system]]
Three fundamental components of a DSS [[Systems architecture|architecture]] are:&lt;ref name="Haettenschwiler 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Power 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sprague and Carlson 1982"&gt;Sprague, R. H. and E. D. Carlson (1982). Building effective decision support systems. Englewood Cã´liffs, N.J., Prentice-Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-086215-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haag, Cummings, ãã´ãMcCubbrey, Pinsonneault, Donovan (2000). Management Informatããion Systems: For The Information Age. McGraw-Hill Ryerson Limited: 136-140. {{ISBN|0-07-281947-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marakas, G. M. 1999"&gt;Marakas, G. M. (1999). Decision support systems in the twenty-first century. Upper Saddle River, N.J., Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;
# the [[database]] (or [[knowledge base]]),
# the [[Model (abstract)|model]] (i.e., the decision context and user criteria)
# the [[user interface]].

The [[End-user (computer science)|users]] themselves are also important components of the architecture.&lt;ref name="Haettenschwiler 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marakas, G. M. 1999" /&gt;

==Development frameworks==
Similarly to other systems, DSS systems require a structured approach. Such a framework includes people, technology, and the development approach.&lt;ref name="Sprague and Carlson 1982" /&gt;

The Early Framework of Decision Support System consists of four phases:
* '''Intelligence''' â Searching for conditions that call for decision; 
* '''Design''' â Developing and analyzing possible alternative actions of solution; 
* '''Choice''' â Selecting a course of action among those; 
* '''Implementation''' â Adopting the selected course of action in decision situation.

DSS technology levels (of hardware and software) may include:
#The actual application that will be used by the user. This is the part of the application that allows the decision maker to make decisions in a particular problem area. The user can act upon that particular problem.
#Generator contains Hardware/software environment that allows people to easily develop specific DSS applications. This level makes use of case tools or systems such as Crystal, [[Analytica (software)|Analytica]] and [[iThink]].
#Tools include lower level hardware/software. DSS generators including special languages, function libraries and linking modules

An iterative developmental approach allows for the DSS to be changed and redesigned at various intervals. Once the system is designed, it will need to be tested and revised where necessary for the desired outcome.

== Classification ==
There are several ways to classify DSS applications. Not every DSS fits neatly into one of the categories, but may be a mix of two or more architectures.

Holsapple and Whinston&lt;ref name="Holsapple Whinston 1996"&gt;Holsapple, C.W., and A. B. Whinston. (1996). Decision Support Systems: A Knowledge-Based Approach. St. Paul: West Publishing. {{ISBN|0-324-03578-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; classify DSS into the following six frameworks: text-oriented DSS, database-oriented DSS, spreadsheet-oriented DSS, solver-oriented DSS, rule-oriented DSS, and compound DSS. A compound DSS is the most popular classification for a DSS; it is a hybrid system that includes two or more of the five basic structures.&lt;ref name="Holsapple Whinston 1996" /&gt;

The support given by DSS can be separated into three distinct, interrelated categories:&lt;ref&gt;Hackathorn, R. D., and P. G. W. Keen. (1981, September). "Organizational Strategies for Personal Computing in Decision Support Systems." MIS Quarterly, Vol. 5, No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Personal Support, Group Support, and Organizational Support.

DSS components may be classified as:
# '''Inputs:''' Factors, numbers, and characteristics to analyze
# '''User knowledge and expertise:''' Inputs requiring manual analysis by the user
# '''Outputs:'''  Transformed data from which DSS "decisions" are generated
# '''Decisions:'''  Results generated by the DSS based on user criteria

DSSs which perform selected [[cognitive]] decision-making functions and are based on [[artificial intelligence]] or [[intelligent agent]]s technologies are called [[intelligent decision support system]]s (IDSS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=F. Burstein |author2=C. W. Holsapple |year=2008 |title=Handbook on Decision Support Systems. Berlin: Springer Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nascent field of [[decision engineering]] treats the decision itself as an engineered object, and applies engineering principles such as [[design]] and [[quality assurance]] to an explicit representation of the elements that make up a decision.

==Applications==
DSS can theoretically be built in any knowledge domain.

One example is the [[clinical decision support system]] for [[medical diagnosis]]. There are four stages in the evolution of clinical decision support system (CDSS): the primitive version is standalone and does not support integration; the second generation supports integration with other medical systems; the third is standard-based, and the fourth is service model-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=A|author2=Sittig, D|title=A framework and model for evaluating clinical decision support architectures q|journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics|date=2008|volume=41|pages=982â990|doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2008.03.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DSS is extensively used in business and management. [[Executive dashboard]] and other business performance software allow faster decision making, identification of negative trends, and better allocation of business resources. Due to DSS all the information from any organization is represented in the form of charts, graphs i.e. in a summarized way, which helps the management to take strategic decision. For example, one of the DSS applications is the management and development of complex anti-terrorism systems.&lt;ref name = "Zhang &amp; Babovic"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang |first=S.X. |last2=Babovic |first2=V. |year=2011 |title=An evolutionary real options framework for the design and management of projects and systems with complex real options and exercising conditions |journal=Decision Support Systems |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=119â129 |doi= 10.1016/j.dss.2010.12.001|ssrn= |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220197192_An_evolutionary_real_options_framework_for_the_design_and_management_of_projects_and_systems_with_complex_real_options_and_exercising_conditions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include a bank loan officer verifying the credit of a loan applicant or an engineering firm that has bids on several projects and wants to know if they can be competitive with their costs.

A growing area of DSS application, concepts, principles, and techniques is in [[agriculture|agricultural production]], marketing for [[sustainable development]].  For example, the [[DSSAT| DSSAT4]] package,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aglearn.net/resources/isfm/DSSAT.pdf DSSAT4 (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icasa.net/dssat/ The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer]&lt;/ref&gt; developed through financial support of [[USAID]] during the 80s and 90s, has allowed rapid assessment of several agricultural production systems around the world to facilitate decision-making at the farm and policy levels. [[Precision agriculture]] seeks to tailor decisions to particular portions of farm fields. There are, however, many constraints to the successful adoption on DSS in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, W. and Middleton, T. (2002). Why has the uptake of Decision Support Systems been so poor? In: Crop-soil simulation models in developing countries. 129-148 (Eds R.B. Matthews and William Stephens). Wallingford:CABI.&lt;/ref&gt;

DSS are also prevalent in [[forest management]] where the long planning horizon and the spatial dimension of planning problems demands specific requirements. All aspects of Forest management, from log transportation, harvest scheduling to sustainability and ecosystem protection have been addressed by modern DSSs. In this context the consideration of single or multiple management objectives related to the provision of goods and services that traded or non-traded and often subject to resource constraints and decision problems. The Community of Practice of Forest Management Decision Support Systems provides a large repository on knowledge about the construction and use of forest Decision Support Systems.&lt;ref&gt;Community of Practice Forest Management Decision Support Systems, http://www.forestdss.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A specific example concerns the [[Canadian National Railway]] system, which tests its equipment on a regular basis using a decision support system. A problem faced by any [[railroad]] is worn-out or defective rails, which can result in hundreds of [[derailment]]s per year. Under a DSS, the Canadian National Railway system managed to decrease the incidence of derailments at the same time other companies were experiencing an increase.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">'''Elemental cost planning''' is a system of [[Cost planning]] and [[Cost control]], typically for buildings, which enables the cost of a scheme to be monitored during design development.

1951 saw the publication of the Ministry of Education Building Bulletin No 4 which essentially introduced the concept of elemental cost planning to the UK construction industry. Its Author was James Nisbet. The concept has been refined and developed over more than 50 years in the UK by [[BCIS]] (the Building Cost Information Service of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors).

Elemental Cost Planning relies upon the adoption of a Standard Form of Cost Analysis for buildings which allows costs to be compared on a common format and forms the basis of the benchmarking analysis central to the concept of Elemental Cost Plans.

It should :-
*Ensure that the tender amount is close to the first estimate, or that any likely difference between the two is anticipated and is acceptable. 
*Ensure that the money available for the projects is allocated consciously and economically to the various components and finishes.
*Always involves the measurement and pricing of approximate quantities at some stage of the process.
*Aim to achieve good value at the desired level of expenditure. 

Elemental cost planning is often referred to as 'designing to a cost' or 'target cost planning' since a cost limit is fixed for the scheme and the architect must then prepare a design not to exceed this cost.

[[File:EMEA region worldmap.svg|thumbnail|EMEA: [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]], marked on a world map.]]

'''EMEA''' ('''EMEIA''' if [[India]] is included) is a shorthand designation meaning [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]]. It is used by institutions and governments, as well as in marketing and business. It is particularly common among [[North America]]n companies.

The [[region]] is generally accepted to include all European nations, all African nations, and extends east to [[Iran]], including [[Russia]]. Typically this does not include independent overseas territories of mainland countries in the region, such as [[French Guiana]].

'''Exit planning''' is the preparation for the exit of an [[entrepreneur]] from his company to maximize the [[enterprise value]] of the company in a [[mergers and acquisitions]] transaction and thus his [[shareholder value]], although other non-financial objectives may be pursued including the transition of the company to the next generation, sale to employees or management, or other altruistic, non-financial objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Kupferman, Martin. "Savvy exit strategies for mid-sized companies." Journal of Corporate Accounting &amp; Finance 14.2 (2003): 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Exit planning differs from [[succession planning]] in that the later is a sub-component of exit planning, and refers to the hiring, training and retention of a successor President/CEO of the company in a planned manner.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Pramodita, James J. Chrisman, and Jess H. Chua. "Succession planning as planned behavior: Some empirical results." Family Business Review 16.1 (2004): 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Succession Planning is but one of the many considerations when conducting exit planning.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkey, John. Exit Strategy Planning: Grooming your business for sale or succession. Gower Publishing Company, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Company owners commonly do not see their company from the standpoint of a potential buyer, and thus, ignore the strategic management of the company.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Xoq_4e1qleUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=preparing+a+company+for+sale+exit+planning&amp;ots=vkbbbspL2G&amp;sig=fUcLLX84fv1prR8DY_-Nt37OIKI#v=onepage&amp;q=preparing%20a%20company%20for%20sale%20exit%20planning&amp;f=false | Kuhn, Robert Lawrence. "Building Value into the Entrepreneurial Company." Leadership and Entrepreneurship: Personal and Organizational Development in Entrepreneurial Ventures (1996): 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other authors define exit planning in a broader sense. For example, Business Exit Planning is the process of explicitly defining exit-related objectives for the owner(s) of a business, followed by the design of a comprehensive strategy and road map that take into account all personal, business, financial, legal, and taxation aspects of achieving those objectives, usually in the context of planning the leadership succession and continuity of a business. Objectives may include maximizing (or setting a goal for) proceeds, minimizing risk, closing a Transaction quickly, or selecting an investor that will ensure that the business prospers. The strategy should also take into account contingencies such as illness or death.&lt;ref&gt;Nemethy, Les, Business Exit Planning: Options, Value Enhancement, and Transaction Management for Business Owners. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Company owners commonly do not see their company from the standpoint of a potential buyer, and thus, ignore the strategic management of the company. To achieve their desired outcomes, business owners often focus their attention on exit planning from the beginning of the investment, in order to prepare adequately for trade and financial sales, make effective use of the buy back option, market their businesses more widely for sale, use intermediaries and get the support of management&lt;ref&gt;http://griequity.astraea.net/resources/InvestmentIndustry/vc/evca/BetterExits.pdf | Wall, John, and Julian Smith. "Better exits." The Journal of Private Equity 1.2 (1997): 31-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Significant value is lost due to an absence of or inadequate exit planning.  Roughly 30% of businesses will be  transferred to family member in some manner, 18% intend to sell to its employees, and many will simply be closed.&lt;ref&gt;Holaday, David W. "Exit Plans for Financed Life Insurance: Preparing to Cross That Bridger before Coming to It." J. Pract. Est. Plan. 8 (2006): 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Up to one-third of businesses that are closed were successful at their termination&lt;ref&gt;http://cmapspublic.ihmc.us/rid%3D1227459615945_1100677163_14681/Preparing%20for%20Organizational%20Death.pdf | Marks, Mitchell Lee, and Ronny Vansteenkiste.

The three sources of enterprise value in a company are firstly the value of its tangible assets, and secondly the value of its [[intellectual capital]] (intangible assets), which consist of [[human capital]], [[relational capital]], and [[structural capital]] (including is subcomponents [[organizational capital]], innovation capital and process capital.  Most of a [[middle-market company]]'s and [[Middle-market company|lower middle market]] company's value is derived from its relational capital, specifically, its customer relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Relational Capital: Strategic Advantage for Small-and-Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) Negotiation and Collaboration, Theresa M. Welbourne, Manuela Pardo del Val, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lervik, Elisabeth. "Relational Capital: A study on its importance, quantification and its impact on business sectors and markets."&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Small to medium enterprises|SMEs]], also referred to as middle market companies, create innovation capital (part of structural capital).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smeal.psu.edu/cmtoc/cmtoc/research/nistnpd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Most small-to-medium-sized businesses use a [[boutique investment bank]] to market their company in a mergers and acquisitions transaction to potential buyers. Some boutique investment banks also offer exit planning preparation, while certain consulting firms offer one or more of the services needed to conduct exit planning, such as [[human resources]], in connection with succession planning.

[[Private Equity|Private Equity Groups]] are common acquirers of [[Middle-market company|middle market]] businesses, whether as [[Platform Company|Platform companies]] or add-on or tack-on acquisitions.

In addition to business aspects, personal considerations need to be taken into consideration, including considerations about estate taxes, capital gains taxes, or other taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fambusiness.org/article_estatetax.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831123200/http://www.fambusiness.org/article_estatetax.html |archivedate=2011-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Fuld-Gilad-Herring Academy of Competitive Intelligence''' is an educational organization  bringing professional training to the field of [[competitive intelligence]] (CI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scip.org/Publications/CIMagIssueDetail.cfm?ItemNumber=1988 CI Education Issue]&lt;/ref&gt;  Established in 1996, the Academy has expanded its training to thousands of managers from 58 countries and six continents at its campuses in [[Cambridge, MA]] and [[Brussels, Belgium]]. The Academy is the only CI-dedicated institution to be externally accredited by the [[International Association of Continuing Education and Training]] (IACET).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academyci.com The Academy's web site]&lt;/ref&gt; It grants the Competitive Intelligence Professional (CIP) certification based on a 9-course program, including a course in ethics and a pioneering course in business war gaming.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Hall, âMilitary moves on the corporate battlefieldâ, The Evening Standard, 8 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale Buss, âBerlitz for the bossâ, Chief Executive, 1 December 2001, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; To be certified, managers must complete the required coursework and pass a certification exam. To accommodate managers whose main interest is in using CI tools and managers working as CI professionals, the Academy offers two levels of certification: a basic CIP-I, and an advanced CIP-II. The Academy is currently the largest training institute in its field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academyci.com/About/alumni.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competitive Intelligence Standards ==

On March, 2011, the board of the professional association in the field of competitive intelligence- '''SCIP''' (Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Professionals) voted to adopt the Academy's CIP program as its official global certification program to help create standards in the field of strategic and competitive intelligence. The certification was renamed SCIP-CIP certificate conferred by ACI.&lt;ref&gt;http://info.intelligencecareers.com/index.php/2011/03/22/2011-06-1324-certification-in-competitive-intelligence-boston-massachusetts/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The history of the Academy tracks closely the history of the field of competitive intelligence which has risen in importance during the 1980s with the increase in global competitive pressures and the spread of [[Internet search engines]] which made information more accessible. In 1986, the [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] (SCIP) was founded in Washington, DC to serve as the professional association for academics, practitioners and consultants in CI. During the next decade, organizations experimented in acquiring and using CI with little discipline and no consistent results. For example, as a survey by the Academy showed, one of CI's main objectives, avoiding strategic surprises, was not being accomplished in many large companies.&lt;ref&gt;George S. Day and Paul J.H. Schoemaker, âScanning the Peripheryâ, ''Harvard Business Review'', November 2005, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Three early developers of the Society banded together to create a standard of training and performance in the field. They were: Leonard Fuld, whose book, ''Competitor Intelligence'', was the first best seller on the subject,&lt;ref&gt;Fuld, Leonard, ''Competitor Intelligence: How to get it, how to use it''. NY: Wiley, 1985.  {{ISBN|978-0471809678}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Gilad|Ben Gilad]], whose book The Business Intelligence System created the benchmark for setting up a corporate CI function,&lt;ref&gt;Gilad, Ben and Tamar Gilad, The Business Intelligence System. NY: American Management Association, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and Jan Herring who was the founding director of the first competitive intelligence function created in 1982 at [[Motorola]] Corp.&lt;ref&gt;Herring, Jan P. Measuring the Effectiveness of Competitive Intelligence: Assessing &amp; Communicating CI's Value to Your Organization. Virginia: Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the growth of SCIP, the creation of the Academy accelerated greatly the formalization and acceptance of CI functions and positions across global companies, with some estimating that 97% of Fortune 500 corporations today have at least one CI analyst in each of their larger business units.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Boyle, âThe Prying Game: A little knowledge is a dangerous...weapon. No wonder competitive intelligence schools are on the rise.â Fortune Magazine, Advisor/Careers, 17 September 2001, Vol. 144, (5), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==

As the field continued to evolve, several organizations in recent years have joined the Academy in offering training programs in competitive intelligence, mostly as an extension of other degree programs, among them [[Mercyhurst College Institute for Intelligence Studies]] in PA (an extension of a government intelligence program), [[Simmons College (Massachusetts)|Simmons College]] in MA (part of Library and Information studies), and the [[University of Denver]] in CO (part of a graduate degree in information management). Other programs include the [[Ecole de Guerre Economique]] in France and Institute for Competitive Intelligence in Germany. Entry level courses are also offered by the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals.

==Student body==

The functional distribution of the Academy's alumni body covers managers and professionals from competitive and market intelligence functions, [[marketing]], [[market research]], [[business development]], [[strategic planning]], research scientists and development engineers. Though the typical trainee is a manager at a Global Fortune 500 company, past participants included some unusual representatives from the [[Catholic Church]], various governments' defense agencies, farmer cooperatives, national economic development boards, and a Cabinet Minister.

The '''future map''' is a method for building scenarios based on the collection of anticipated events.

The concept is based on the idea that a group of people who integrate the partial visions of its members into a common, shared, discussed, large enough, collection of anticipated events it can eventually reveal its own "shared future".

Because the [[Policy Analysis Market|FutureMap]] methodology is dynamic and implemented on a [[wiki]]-platform the Future projected by the group is constantly under revision. By process, the community learns how to adapt to future changes and increases its ability to face "unexpected events", it improves what the author calls its '''future-readiness'''.

* '''[[Construction]]''', in the fields of architecture and civil engineering, is a process that consists of the building or assembling of infrastructure. Far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of multitasking. Normally the job is managed by the project manager and supervised by the construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

The HP Service Manager is one of the applications acquired by HP when it purchased [[Peregrine Systems]] in 2005. The application was originally known as PNMS (Peregrine Network Management System). After releasing the first version of PNMS, Peregrine Systems eventually added functionality such as Request Management, Call Management, and Change Management and rebranded the application as Peregrine ServiceCenter.

After the acquisition by HP, the application was rebranded as HP Service Manager and was included in the [[HP OpenView]] product suite. HP offers the application as a service desk solution that enables IT to work as a single organization, governed by a consistent set of processes to handle service delivery and support quickly and efficiently.

After the acquisition, the product has been updated with the following significant changes:
* ServiceCenter 3: Client and GUI
* ServiceCenter 4: Process Model and Module Alignment
* ServiceCenter 5 / 5.1: Client, GUI, introduction of Document Engine
* ServiceCenter 6: New Client, New Server-side Application stack (servlets), inclusion of JavaScript, inclusion of SOAP
* Service Manager 7 / 7.11: GUI, Web Client, Process Model (IIA)
* Service Manager 9.2: GUI, introduction of Process Designer
* Service Manager 9.40: Reporting, Smart Analytics.
* Service Manager 9.41: Smart Search, autocomplete, undo in ScriptLibrary editor
* Service Manager 9.50: New Service Portal, Smart Email, Smart Chat.

The '''Innovators Under 35''' is an annual list published by [[MIT Technology Review]] magazine, naming the world's top 35 innovators under the age of 35.&lt;ref name=TR35&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/TR35/ |title=Top Young Innovators Under 35 |publisher=[[Technology Review]] | accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://portal.ctrl.ucla.edu/cnsi/news/item?item_id=935314 |title=Aydogan Ozcan Recognized by Technology Review's Prestigious TR35 Listing of the World's Top Young Innovators for 2009 |publisher=[[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] |date=August 18, 2009 |accessdate=August 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006122143/http://portal.ctrl.ucla.edu/cnsi/news/item?item_id=935314 |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The subcategories for the awards change from year to year, but generally focus on [[biomedicine]], [[computing]], [[communication]]s, [[business]], [[energy]], [[materials science|materials]], and the [[World Wide Web|web]]. Nominations are sent from around the world and evaluated by a panel of expert judges. In some years, an Innovator of the Year or a Humanitarian of the Year is also named from among the winners.

The purpose of the award is to honor "accomplishments that are poised to have a dramatic impact on the world as we know it."&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt;

== History ==
The award was started in 1999 as the TR100, with 100 winners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/tr35/?year=1999 |title=1999 Top 100 Innovators Under 35 |publisher=[[Technology Review]] | year=1999 | accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was changed to 35 winners starting in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/tr35/?year=2005 |title=2005 Top 35 Innovators Under 35 |publisher=[[Technology Review]] | year=2005 | accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards are presented to the winners at the annual [[Emtech]] conference on emerging technologies, held in the fall at MIT, where there is an awards ceremony and reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2009/August/aug18_treuille.shtml |title=Technology Review Names Carnegie Mellon's Treuille to Prestigious TR35 List of Top Young Innovators |publisher=[[Carnegie Mellon University]] | date=August 18, 2009 | accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several regional TR35 lists produced by ''Technology Review'' also, such as the [[TR35 India|list of the top 35 innovators under 35 in India]], [[Spain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emtechspain.com/en/emerging-talent-awards-tr35/ |title=MITâs TR35 Spain Awards |publisher=[[Technology Review]] | accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.it/?p=article&amp;a=2077 |title=TR35 Italia - Giovani Innovatori - Edizione 2012 |publisher=[[Technology Review]] | accessdate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[France]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tr35france.com/ |title=Les MIT Technology Review Innovateurs de moins de 35 ans France |publisher=[[Technology Review]] | accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mexico]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://es.technologyreview.com/tr35/ediciones_regionales/mexico/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140911125830/http://es.technologyreview.com/tr35/ediciones_regionales/mexico/ |archivedate=2014-09-11 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin America]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.innovatorsunder35.com/latam |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912001009/http://www.innovatorsunder35.com/latam |archivedate=2016-09-12 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.es/tr35turkey/|title=Innovadores Menores De 35 TurquÃ­a 2014 - MIT Technology Review|website=Technologyreview.es|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regional winners are then considered as candidates for the global list.

In 2013, the list was renamed to "Innovators Under 35".

The cryptonym '''TR 35''' is actually the name of an analgesic NSAID, [58892-44-7] patented by Mitsubishi in 1976 .

'''KXEN''' was an American [[software company]] which existed from 1998 to 2013 when it was acquired by [[SAP AG]].

==History==
KXEN was founded in June 1998 by Roger Haddad and Michel Bera, based on an original idea from [[LÃ©on Bottou]] using [[VapnikâChervonenkis theory]] on [[structural risk minimization]]. Erik MarcadÃ© joined as chief technical officer in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/kxen  CrunchBase KXEN]. October 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  It was based in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] with offices in Paris and London. On September 10, 2013 SAP AG announced plans to acquire KXEN.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sap.com/news-reader/index.epx?pressid=21521  SAP Extends the Power of Predictive Analytics to Unlock Big Data With Acquisition of KXEN]". September 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Kanaracus, September 10, 2013, PC World. "[http://www.pcworld.com/article/2048486/sap-buying-kxen-for-predictive-analytics.html  SAP buying KXEN for predictive analytics]".&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 1, 2013, a letter to KXEN customers announced the acquisition closed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kxen.com/SAP-Customer-Letter|SAP Acquires KXEN, Inc. - A Letter to Our Customers]. October 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

KXEN primarily marketed [[predictive analytics]] software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garner|first=Rochelle|title=KXEN: Predictive Analytics Made Easy|url=http://www.crn.com/news/applications-os/171203310/kxen-predictive-analytics-made-easy.htm;jsessionid=vygKArOtFyp-8N5dI-hiuw**.ecappj02|publisher=CRN|accessdate=February 6, 2012|date=October 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predictive analytics==
InfiniteInsight is a [[predictive modeling]] suite developed by KXEN that assists analytic professionals, and business executives to extract information from data. Among other functions, InfiniteInsight is used for variable importance, [[Statistical classification|classification]], [[Regression analysis|regression]], [[Market segmentation|segmentation]], [[time series]], [[association rule learning|product recommendation]], as described and expressed by the [[Java Data Mining]] interface, and for [[social network analysis]]. InfiniteInsight allows prediction of a behavior or a value, the [[forecasting|forecast]] of a time series or the [[Market segment|understanding of a group of individuals with similar behavior]]. Advanced functions include behavioral modeling, exporting the model code into different target environments or building predictive models on top of [[SAS System|SAS]] or [[SPSS]] data files. Competitors are [[SAS (software)|SAS Enterprise Miner]], [[SPSS Modeler|IBM SPSS Modeler]], and [[Statistica]]. Open source predictive tools like the [[R (programming language)|R package]] or [[Weka (machine learning)|Weka]] are also competitors, since they provide similar features free of charge.

A '''lead time''' is the [[:wikt:latency|latency]] between the initiation and execution of a process. For example, the lead time between the placement of an order and delivery of a new car from a manufacturer may be anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months.

==Journalism==
Lead time in [[publishing]] describes the amount of time that a [[journalist]] has between receiving a writing assignment and submitting the completed piece.  Depending on the publication, lead times can be anything from a couple of hours to many months/years.

==Medicine==
Lead time (when referring to a disease) is the length of time between detection of a disease through screening and the moment in time where it would have normally presented with symptoms and led to a diagnosis. An example of this is seen with breast cancer population screening, where women who are asymptomatic have a positive test result with mammography, whereas the underlying disease would have taken many more years to manifest.

==Supply chain management==
A more conventional definition of lead time in the [[supply chain management]] realm is the time from the moment the customer places an order (the moment the supplier learns of the requirement) to the moment it is ready for delivery. In the absence of [[finished goods]] or intermediate (work in progress) inventory, it is the time it takes to actually manufacture the order without any inventory other than raw materials. The [[Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply]] identifies "total lead time" as a combination of "internal lead time" (the time required for the buying organisation's internal processes to progress from identification of a need to the issue of a [[purchase order]]) and "external lead time" (the time required for the supplying organisation's processes, including any [[New product development|development]] required, manufacture, despatch and delivery).&lt;ref&gt;CIPS in partnership with Profex Publishing, ''Procurement and Supply Operations'', 2012, revised 2016, pp. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing==
In the manufacturing environment, lead time has the same definition as that of Supply Chain Management, but it includes the time required to ship the parts from the supplier.  The shipping time is included because the manufacturing company needs to know when the parts will be available for [[material requirements planning]].  It is also possible for lead time to include the time it takes for a company to process and have the part ready for manufacturing once it has been received.  The time it takes a company to unload a product from a truck, inspect it, and move it into storage is non-trivial.  With tight manufacturing constraints or when a company is using [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] manufacturing it is important for supply chain to know how long their own internal processes take.

Lead time is made of:&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.supply-chain-consultant.eu/10/lead-time-supply-chain/ ''Lead Times'']. "Lead times in supply chain" Supply Chain Consultant Website.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Preprocessing Lead Time''' (also known as "planning time" or "paperwork"): It represents the time required to release a purchase order (if you buy an item) or create a job (if you manufacture an item) from the time you learn of the requirement.
* '''Processing Lead Time''': It is the time required to procure or manufacture an item.
* '''Postprocessing Lead Time''': It represents the time to make a purchased item available in inventory from the time you receive it (including quarantine, inspection, etc.)

'''Example'''

Company A needs a part that can be manufactured in two days once Company B has received an order.  It takes three days for company A to receive the part once shipped, and one additional day before the part is ready to go into manufacturing.
*If Company A's Supply Chain calls Company B they will be quoted a lead time of 2 days for the part.
*If Company A's Manufacturing division asks the Supply Chain division what the lead time is, they will be quoted 5 days since shipping will be included.
*If a line worker asks the Manufacturing Division boss what the lead time is before the part is ready to be used, it will be 6 days because setup time will be included.

'''In more detail'''

Lead Time terminology has been defined in greater detail.&lt;ref&gt;Rajaniemi, J. (2012) [http://www.leadtimes.org/ ''www.leadtimes.org''] Lead Time Terminology in Manufacturing.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supply Chain from customer order received to the moment the order is delivered is divided into five lead times.
* '''Order Lead Time''' - Time from customer order received to customer order delivered.
* '''Order Handling Time''' - Time from customer order received to sales order created.
* '''Manufacturing Lead Time''' - Time from sales order created to production finished (ready for delivery).
* '''Production Lead Time''' - Time from start of physical production of first submodule/part to production finished (ready for delivery).
* '''Delivery Lead Time''' - Time from production finished to customer order delivered.

'''Example '''

A restaurant opens up and a customer walks in. A waiter guides him to a table, gives him the menu and asks what he would like to order. The customer selects a dish and the waiter writes it in his notepad. At that moment the customer has made an order which the restaurant has accepted â Order Lead Time and Order Handling Time have begun. Now the waiter marks the order in the cash register, rips the paper from the notepad, takes it into the kitchen and puts into the order queue. The order has been handled and is waiting in the factory (kitchen) for manufacturing. As there are no other customers, the waiter decides to stand outside the kitchen, by the door, waiting for the dish to be prepared and begins calculating Manufacturing Lead Time.

Meanwhile, the chef finishes what he was doing, takes the order from the queue, starts his clock as a mark for the start of Production Lead Time and begins cooking. The chef chops the vegetables, fries the meat and boils the pasta. When the dish is ready, the chef rings a bell and stops his clock. At the same time the waiter stops calculating Manufacturing Lead Time and rushes through the kitchen door to get the food while it is hot.

When he picks it up, begins counting of Delivery Lead Time that ends when the dish is served to the customer, who can now happily say that the Order Lead Time was shorter than he had expected.

==Order lead time==
When talking about Order Lead Time (OLT) it is important to differentiate the definitions that may exist around this concept. Although they look similar there are differences between them that help the industry to model the order behavior of their customers. The four definitions are : 
*The '''Actual Order Lead Time ''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Actual&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, A. (1989). Component inventory costs in an assembly problem with uncertain supplier lead-times. IIE transactions, 21(2), 112-121.&lt;/ref&gt; The order lead-time'', refers to the time which elapses between the receipt of the customer's order (Order Entry Date) and the  '''''delivery''''' of the goods."&lt;ref&gt;Gunasekaran, A., Patel, C., &amp;  Tirtiroglu, E., 2001  "Performance measures and metrics in a supply chain environment." International journal of operations &amp; production Management 21, no. 1/2: 71-87.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The '''Requested Order Lead Time ''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Requested&lt;/sub&gt;) represents the time between the Order Entry Date and the customer '''''requested''''' delivery date; this measurement could help the company to understand the order behavior of the customers and help to design profitable models to fulfill customer needs.&lt;ref&gt;2)Cousens, A., Szwejczewski, M., &amp; Sweeney, M. 2009. "A process for managing manufacturing flexibility." International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management, 29(4), pp.357-385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Silva, L., 2013, "Supply Chain Contract Compliance Measurements" Master thesis (work in progress), Aalto University, Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Quote Order Lead Time ''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Quote&lt;/sub&gt;) is the '''''agreed'' ''' time between the Order Entry Date and the supplierâs committed deliver date of goods as stipulated in a supply chain contract.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;
*The '''Confirmed Order Lead Time''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Confirmed&lt;/sub&gt;) represents the time between the Order Entry Date and the by the supplier '''''confirmed''''' delivery date of goods.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

[[Image:OLT Definitions.jpg|thumb|OLT Definitions&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;]]

=== OLT formulas ===
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Requested&lt;/sub&gt; = Wish Date â Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Requested&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the date the customer wants the material in his facilities (wish date) and the date when they provided its order to the supplier. 
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Quote&lt;/sub&gt; = Quote Date â Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Quote&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the date the customer agree to receive the material in their facilities (Quote date) and the date when the order is provided to the supplier.
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Actual&lt;/sub&gt; = Delivery Date â Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Actual&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the day the provider deliver the material (Delivery date) and the date when they enter the order in the system. 
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Confirmed&lt;/sub&gt; = Confirmed Date â Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Confirmed&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the date the confirmed date by the provider to deliver the material in the customer facilities (Confirmed date) and the date when they provide the order to the supplier.

===Average OLT based on volume===
The Average OLT based on Volume (OLT&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;) is the addition of all the multiplications between the volume of product we deliver (quantity) and the OLT divided by the total quantity delivered in the period of time we are studying for that specific facility.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;OLTV= \frac{\sum_{j}{Quantity_j \cdot OLT_j}}{_{Total Quantity Deliver}} \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
By doing this the company will be able to find a relation of volume weighted between the quantities of material required for an order and the time requested to accomplish it. The volume metric could be applied to the 4 types of OLT. &lt;br /&gt;
The figure obtained from this calculation will be the average time (e.g. in days) between order placing and the requested delivery date of a specific customer under consideration of the average quantities ordered during that particular time.

===Potential application areas for order lead time measurement===
The correct analysis of OLT will give the company:
*Better understanding of the market behavior making it able to develop more profitable schemas that fit better with customer needs (Revenue Management).
*Increases company ability to detect and correct any behavior that is not within terms agreed in the contract (by penalization or different contract schema).  
*The OLT measurement creates an opportunity area to improve the customer relations by increasing the level of communication with them.

==Project management==
In [[project management]] lead time is the time it takes to complete a task or a set of interdependent tasks. The lead of the entire [[project]] would be the overall duration of the [[critical path method|critical path]] for the project.

Lead time is also the saved time by starting an activity before its predecessor is completed.

According to the PMI (2008), lead is a dependency between two activities (p.&amp;nbsp;140).&lt;ref&gt;PMI. (2008). A guide to a project management body of knowledge (4th. ed.). ''The Project Management Institute''. Newton Square, PA: PMI Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be scheduling the start of a 2-week activity dependent with the finish of the successor activity with a lead of 2 weeks so they will finish at the same time.

'''PerForm''' and '''PerForm PRO''' were electronic form programs, initially designed to work under [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]] in [[DOS]]. Later versions were designed to work in [[Windows 3.1]], at which point it was succeeded by [[FormFlow]]. 

The initial version of PerForm was created in 1988 and was the first product released by [[Canada|Canadian]] software firm [[Delrina]], which became best known for its later fax software program, [[WinFax]]. Chief Technical Officer [[Bert Amato]] and President of the company [[Mark Skapinker]] came up with the idea for the product while working as consultants that what their clients wanted was a way to fill in forms electronically, rather than an easier way to create paper-based forms from a computer.&lt;ref name="Softwarriors p34"&gt;{{Cite journal
  | last = Walmsley
  | first = Ann
  | title = Attack of the Softwarriors
  | journal = Report on Business Magazine
  | page = 34
  | date = March 1994
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program consisted of two parts: a form design module which gave users a graphical user interface for creating and arranging form elements, using tools largely familiar to those using desktop publishing or paint programs of the era, and a separate form filling program which would display the resulting form that the user could then fill in&lt;ref name="Zisman"&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher= INPUT
 |access-date= November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Those entering information into the forms could not change or alter the forms; they were limited to adding information in the various form fields on screen. Some of the potential uses of the program included being able to create invoices, payment records, personnel and payroll forms, and just about any other standardized  form that may have been required.&lt;ref name="Zisman"&gt;{{cite web

There was significant and long-term uptake of electronic forms products within governmental agencies both in Canada&lt;ref name="TransportCanada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/gol/environment.htm |title="TRANSPORT CANADA'S IM/IT ENVIRONMENT 2006/2007", with a contemporary reference to the use of Delrina FormFlow |accessdate=2007-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902012852/http://www.tc.gc.ca/gol/environment.htm |archivedate=2007-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States,&lt;ref name="USOffice"&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the firm's early major software deals included a multi-year agreement to sell PerForm to the U.S. Navy in 1990.&lt;ref name="Softwarriors p34"/&gt; Soon after the software was installed on [[Compaq]] [[laptops]] that accompanied U.S. troops during the [[First Gulf War]], where it was used to requisition "everything from [[Coca-Cola]] to [[Outhouse|privies]]".&lt;ref name="Softwarriors p34"/&gt; Other significant volume sales went to [[3M]] and [[Rockwell International]].&lt;ref name="Softwarriors p34"/&gt; What helped set apart Delrina's electronic forms from its competitors in product reviews included its easy-to-use interface, its extensive development tools, and its comparatively low price.&lt;ref name="FormTest"&gt;{{Cite journal
  | title = Putting electronic forms to the test
  | journal = InfoWorld
  | pages = 93â105
  | date = May 2, 1994
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also scored highly when it came to workflow and routing functions as well as security features.&lt;ref name="Melnitsky"&gt;{{Cite journal
  | last = Melnitsky
  | first = Stuart
  | title = Form is function
  | journal = Network World
  | page = 48
  | date = December 2, 1996
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1991 [[InfoWorld]] selected PerForm Pro
as its "Product of the Year" in the electronic forms
category, and [[PC World Magazine]] gave the product it's "Best Buy" designation.&lt;ref name="ProductOfTheYear1990"&gt;{{cite press release
  | title = Delrina's PerFORM Chosen Product of the Year
  | publisher = Delrina Technology Inc.
  | date = February 18, 1991
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; PerForm proved to be successful in its niche, effectively capturing the retail market by 1993.&lt;ref name="Kevin Strehlo p.88"&gt;{{Cite journal

  | title = FormFlow has the smarts to truly automate form routing

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electronic forms division of Delrina was sold to [[JetForm]] in 1996. JetForm in turn was bought by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], and the electronic forms products were officially discontinued in 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">'''Remote service software''' is used by equipment manufacturers to remotely monitor, access and repair products in use at customer sites. Itâs a secure, auditable gateway for service teams to troubleshoot problems, perform proactive maintenance, assist with user operations and monitor performance.  This technology is typically implemented in mission-critical environments like hospitals or IT data centers â where equipment downtime is intolerable.

==Benefits==
Remote service software helps to:
* Increase uptime, improve performance and extend the life of a device
* Control service costs by deploying patches and upgrades remotely, and ensure a first-time fix when an onsite visit is required
* Streamline administration of pay-per-use models, with automated usage monitoring
* Focus highly trained service teams on preventative maintenance, by diagnosing and repairing issues before they cause system failure
* Increase customer satisfaction and loyalty

Manufacturers are using aftermarket service a competitive differentiator.  Remote service software provides a platform for manufacturers to offer and meet stringent [[service level agreement]]s (SLAs) without increasing the size of their service team.

== Key characteristics of remote service software==
* '''Proactive:''' Remote monitoring of devices in use allows service teams to detect potential issues before they escalate, degrade performance or cause a system failure. This early warning system is a key component to issue avoidance and ability to meet more stringent [[key performance indicators|key performance indicator]] (KPIs) in SLAs. Once an issue is detected, service professionals can also use remote service technology gateways to push patches or resolve issues.
* '''Secure:''' Secure access is a core consideration of remote service.  Solutions should adhere to compliance guidelines and protect the remote connection between the manufacturer and the customer â ensuring that no data has been stolen and no outsiders have been granted access.
* '''Auditable:''' [ [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|SOX]], [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and [[PCI DSS|PCI]] ] compliance regulations require businesses to keep track of who does what on their network.  Auditors require forensic logs to trace the steps of every interaction a remote service technician has with every device.

== Other names for remote service software==
* [[Intelligent device management|IDM: intelligent device management]]
* SSM: strategic service management
* RDM: remote device management

'''Sense and respond''' has been used in [[control theory]] for several decades, primarily in [[closed system]]s such as refineries where comparisons are made between measurements and desired values, and system settings are adjusted to narrow the gap between the two. Since  the early 1980s, sense and respond has also been used to describe the behavior of certain open systems. 

Sense and respond is based on [[Lean manufacturing|lean principles]] and follows URSLIMM:
*U - understand customer value
*R - remove waste
*S - standardize
*L - learn by doing
*I - involve everyone
*M - measure what matters
*M - manage performance visually

The term "sense and respond" as a business concept was used in a 1992 [[American Management Association]] ''Management Review'' article by [[Stephan H. Haeckel]].  It was Developed by Haeckel at [[IBM]]âs Advanced Business Institute.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10185">[[File:Telephone operators, 1952.jpg|thumb|[[Seattle]] telephone operators in a [[private branch exchange]] in 1952.]]
In the early days of telephony, through roughly the 1960s, companies used manual [[telephone switchboard]]s, and '''switchboard operators''' connected calls by inserting a pair of [[Phone connector (audio)|phone plug]]s into the appropriate jacks.

==Description==
Each pair of plugs was part of a [[cord circuit]] with a switch associated that let the operator participate in the call. Each jack had a light above it that lit when the telephone receiver was lifted (the earliest systems required a generator on the phone to be cranked by hand). Lines from the central office were usually arranged along the bottom row. Before the advent of operator distance dialing and customer [[direct distance dialing|direct dial]] (DDD) calling, switchboard operators would work with their counterparts in the distant central office to complete [[long distance call]]s. With the development of [[Stored Program Control exchange|computerized]] telephone dialing systems, many [[telephone call]]s which previously required a live operator can be placed automatically by the [[calling party]] without additional human intervention. Switchboard operators are typically required to have very strong communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;Principles of Hotel Front Office Operations - Page 55, Sue Baker, Pam Bradley, Jeremy Huyton - 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan Civil Service Exams - Page xii, Kaplan - 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the advent of [[telephone exchange|automatic exchanges]], an operator's assistance was required for anything other than calling telephones across a shared [[Party line (telephony)|party line]]. Callers spoke to an operator at a Central Office who then connected a cord to the proper circuit in order to complete the call. Being in complete control of the call, the operator was in a position to listen to private conversations. Automatic, or Dial systems were developed in the 1920s to reduce labor costs as usage increased, and to ensure privacy to the customer. As phone systems became more sophisticated, less direct intervention by the telephone operator was necessary to complete calls.

As well as the people that were employed by the public networks, operators were required at [[private branch exchange]]s to answer incoming [[telephone call]]s and connect them to the correct [[extension (telephone)|extension]]. Today, most large organizations have direct-dial extensions.  Smaller workplaces may have an automated system which allows callers to enter the extension of the called party, or a [[receptionist]] who answers calls and performs operator duties.  Depending on the employment setting, the roles and level of responsibilities of a PBX operator can vary greatly, from performing [[Wake-up call (service)|wake-up calls]] in a hotel to coordinating emergency responses, dispatching, and overhead paging in hospitals. Operators employed in healthcare settings have other duties, such as [[data entry clerk|data entry]], [[Receptionist|greeting patients]] and visitors, taking messages, triaging, or acting as an after hours [[answering service]]. Experienced, well-trained operators generally command a higher salary.

In January 1878 George Willard Croy became the world's first telephone operator when he started working for the Boston Telephone Dispatch company.&lt;ref name="Google Books"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b2mMzS0hCkAC&amp;pg=PA696&amp;lpg=PA696&amp;dq=%22emma+nutt%22+telephone+operator&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kKYQAmoXhW&amp;sig=GEOi4yd-4NQnw3T4cb2mtOkBNRY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3bKTSo_9DqOZjAf496HzDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=%22emma%20nutt%22%20telephone%20operator&amp;f=false|title=The Telecommunications Illustrated Dictionary, Second Edition|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emma Nutt]] became the first female telephone operator on 1 September 1878 when she started working for the Boston Telephone Dispatch company, because the attitude and behaviour of the teenage boys previously employed as operators was unacceptable.&lt;ref name="ATT 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=4800&amp;cdvn=news&amp;newsarticleid=20902|title=AT&amp;T Press Release Headlines &amp; News from AT&amp;T|work=att.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emma was hired by [[Alexander Graham Bell]],&lt;ref name="Google Books"/&gt; and reportedly, could remember every number in the telephone directory of the [[New England Telephone and Telegraph Company|New England Telephone Company]].&lt;ref name="Google Books"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ATT 1"/&gt; More women began to replace men within this sector of the workforce for several reasons. The companies observed that women were generally more courteous to callers, and women's labor was cheap in comparison to men's. Specifically, women were paid from one half to one quarter of a man's salary.&lt;ref name="Rakow 207â225"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rakow|first=Lana|title=Women and the Telephone: The Gendering of a Communications Technology|pages=207â225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harriot Daley]] became the first telephone switchboard operator at the [[United States Capitol]] in 1898.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/obituaries/overlooked-harriott-daley.html|title=Overlooked No More: Harriott Daley, the Capitol's First Telephone Operator|last=Jacobs|first=Andrea|date=19 April 2018|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-04-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/hec.23122/ |title=First Capitol telephone operator still on job.

Women of the Signal Corps Female Telephone Operators Unit, American bilingual female switchboard operators in [[World War I]], were known colloquially as [[Hello Girls]] and were not formally recognized for their military service until 1978.

[[Julia O'Connor]], a former telephone operator, led the Telephone Operators' Strike of 1919 and the Telephone Operators' Strike of 1923 against [[Verizon New England|New England Telephone Company]] on behalf of the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers|IBEW]] Telephone Operators' Department for better wages and working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Norwood |first=Stephen H. |title=Labor's Flaming Youth: Telephone Operators and Worker Militancy, 1878-1923 |place=Urbana and Chicago, IL |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpJAAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Labor's+Flaming+Youth&amp;dq=Labor's+Flaming+Youth&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9nWnTeDUNMPAswaB5KiQCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA |pages=180â193|isbn=0-252-01633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Telephone Strike Won by Workers | work= New York Times, April 21, 1919 | url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/04/21/118147542.pdf | accessdate= 2011-04-17 | date=April 21, 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norwood, ''Labor's Flaming Youth'', pp. 262-291&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1919 strike, after five days, Postmaster General Burleson agreed to negotiate an agreement between the union and the telephone company, resulting in an increase in pay for the operators and recognition of the right to bargain collectively.&lt;ref&gt;Norwood, ''Labor's Flaming Youth'', pp. 180-193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Telephone Strike Won by Workers | work= New York Times, April 21, 1919 | url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/04/21/118147542.pdf | accessdate= 2011-04-17 | date=April 21, 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 1923 strike was called off after less than a month without achieving any of its goals.&lt;ref&gt;Norwood, ''Labor's Flaming Youth'', pp. 262-291&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, any switchboard operator employed by an independently owned public telephone company which had not more than seven hundred and fifty stations was excluded from the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]].

In 1983, in [[Bryant Pond, Maine]], Susan Glines became the last switchboard operator for a hand-crank phone when that exchange was converted;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goodbye, Central: Crank Phone Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/12/us/goodbye-central-crank-phone-dies.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; manual central office switchboards continued in operation at rural points like [[Kerman, California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-04-08/news/mn-130_1_manual-switchboard|title=Pulling the Plug :  Phone Company to Replace Last Manual Switchboard|work=latimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wanaaring, New South Wales]] as late as 1991, but these were central-battery systems with no hand-cranked magnetos.

The Blue Book associates with restaurants, retail brands and leisure destinations to sign up for the scheme each year. Each outlet is allocated space in the book to feature discount vouchers in the appropriate category. Users have to tear out the vouchers and present it to the concerned person at the outlet to avail the offer. The merchant/outlet discounts the bill on payment by the appropriate amount. The Blue Book generates revenue through sale of the books, advertising and premium positions in the book.

'''Winâloss analytics''' involves identifying and analyzing the reasons why a visitor to a website was or wasn't persuaded to engage in a desired action ([[conversion (marketing)|conversion]]).

This information allows web teams to improve the website's navigation and content, identify individuals that are more likely to convert, to improve marketing efforts.

== History==
Determining why one person engaged in a desired action and another did not has long been a topic of interest in sales, where measurement of conversion has always been possible through sales data &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dvir|first=Nim|last2=Gafni|first2=Ruti|date=2018|title=When Less Is More: Empirical Study of the Relation Between Consumer Behavior and Information Provision on Commercial Landing Pages|url=https://www.informingscience.org/Publications/4015|journal=Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline|language=en|volume=21|pages=019â039|doi=10.28945/4015|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In contrast, [[marketing]] has been mostly concerned with targeting with the masses, and the results of marketing have traditionally been more difficult to accurately measure. With the internet, it is much easier for marketers to collect data for analysis and evaluation in order to understand and demonstrate the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of their efforts and to make changes to improve them. Thus yielding the best result of a specific marketing campaign. This is the Win-Loss analytics.

== Win-loss analytics vs. web analytics ==
[[Web analytics]] tools have existed since the early days of the [[internet]] and are now ubiquitous.  These tools provide a bird's eye view of a [[website traffic|website's traffic]].  The information that is gathered allows webmasters to make informed decisions about making changes in order to improve a website.

Winâloss analytics tools track the individual perspectives of each visitor, uncovering who the visitor was, what products they were qualified for, how well they were persuaded, and why they did or didn't convert.

Win Loss programs typically focus on different elements of the buying process, including gathering buyer feedback on the solution being sold (whether it's a product or service), the buyer's perception of the effectiveness of the sales representative or sales team, buyer perceptions of the selling vendor overall (such as the firm's reputation or its long-term financial viability), and price. These categories can be broken down into greater detail for more refined feedback. For example, questions about the product or service might include the intuitiveness of the user interface or the effectiveness of specific features or functionality.
