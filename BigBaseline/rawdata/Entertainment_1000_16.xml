'''''Battle Dome''''' was a [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] American television series that aired from September 1999 to April 2001. It combined elements of ''[[American Gladiators (1989 TV series)|American Gladiators]]'' – inspired athletic competition with scripted antics more reminiscent of [[professional wrestling]]. Recurring character-athletes known as "Warriors" competed against weekly contestants in a variety of physically demanding (and sometimes dangerous) events.  The series was filmed at the [[Los Angeles Sports Arena]] and produced by [[Columbia TriStar Television]].

The entire first and second season of ''Battle Dome'' is available for purchase on [[iTunes]] and [[Amazon Video]].

==Overview==
A Warrior typically entered the show's arena accompanied by his own bombastic theme music and-in several cases-a comely female sidekick; in later episodes, weekly contestants were also allotted female companions, courtesy of ''[[Perfect 10 (magazine)|Perfect 10]]'' magazine.

The announcer for the show was [[Steve Albert]] (brother of [[Marv Albert|Marv]] and the uncle of [[Kenny Albert|Kenny]]); [[Scott Ferrall]] provided [[color commentary]]. [[Seth Stockton]] served as referee for the entire run. [[Downtown Julie Brown]] appeared in early episodes, as a sideline correspondent but was replaced by [[Kathleen McClellan]] for the run of the show. The "Chairman", whose [[List of unseen characters|face remained off camera]], oversaw the proceedings. Halfway through the show's run, Ferrall and Brown were replaced by [[Ed Lover]] and [[Brien Blakely]], respectively, and "The chairman" was dropped from the show.

''Battle Dome'' was also broadcast in the UK, on the [[Challenge TV|Challenge]] and [[Bravo (UK TV network)|Bravo]] networks, as well as on Channel 5, now "Five." It was also broadcast in Ireland on [[TV3 Ireland|TV3]].

Three male contestants competed in a series of four or five events, which varied in intensity and danger factor. After the fourth or fifth event, the two highest scoring competitors advanced to the Battle Dome final. In addition to facing the contestants, the Battle Dome Warriors were in a show-long competition against each other for the Battle Dome Warriors Championship belt. The Warriors were ranked before the competition started and could move up or down the list depending on either how well they performed during the show or how well they politicked with the chairman or his on-camera assistant, Bobbie Haven (played by model [[Bobbie Brown]], who prior to this was best known for her appearance in the video for [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]]'s "[[Cherry Pie (Warrant song)|Cherry Pie]]").

If the second and third place players were tied, the tie was broken in a rather novel way. Both players would stand on platforms on two separate metal discs, with the discs being pulled back and rammed together at high rates of speed. The intensity of the hit grew until one player fell off, at which point they would be going home. This also would help determine the Warriors champion if the championship was in question at the end of a show.

After all ties and championships between the Warriors and contestants were settled, the two remaining players moved into the Battle Dome for the final round, in which the two competitors wrestled each other in an attempt to throw the opponent off an elevated platform. Doing so won the match, a cash prize, and a Battle Dome championship ring. The winner would also advance in the Battle Dome tournament, with the winner getting a large cash prize, a motorcycle, and a [[Battle Dome Championship]] belt at the end of the season.

===Second season changes===
*The Battle Dome Warriors Championship and Warrior Championship Belt were removed.
*In addition to the male competitors, season two added a female special where five women competed against each other with the warriors acting as "Coaches".
*The Battle Dome Cage event changed significantly. Wrestling was no longer permitted with the emphasis put much more onto martial arts style fighting, in particular kickboxing. The aim was to remove your opponent from the platform. if both men fell, the battle would restart. this final event had no time limit.
*Most of the Battle Dome Warriors' valets (among those who had them) were replaced by the ''Perfect 10'' models that the contestants were accompanied by. With the exception of T-Money, who kept "The Possee".

===World Championship Wrestling===
In fall of 2000, the stars of ''Battle Dome'' and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) began a brief cross-promotional [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]]. It kicked off when WCW wrestlers disrupted a ''Battle Dome'' taping. In retaliation, on the November 6 edition of ''[[Monday Nitro]]'', [[Terry Crews|T-Money]], Cuda, [[Michael O'Hearn|Mike O'Dell]] (husband of WCW star [[Melinda O'Hearn|Midajah]]), [[Chad Bannon|D.O.A.]], and Bubba King began heckling in the audience as [[Diamond Dallas Page]] spoke to the Chicago crowd. [[Rick Steiner]], [[Ernest Miller]], and [[Buff Bagwell]] came to Page's aid before security ended the physical dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_Nov_7/ai_66686873 ``BATTLE DOME'' Warriors Shock ``Monday Nitro''; Live Broadcast Interrupted by Five Warriors Issuing Challenge to WCW] ''Business Wire'' (November 7, 2000). Retrieved on 9–21–08.&lt;/ref&gt; The feud between these men continued as far as November 20,&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_Nov_21/ai_67223910 ADVISORY/Photo of "Battle Dome" 'Warriors' Bubba King, Cuda, D.O.A. and T-Money is available on BW PhotoWire/AP PhotoExpress, NewsCom, PressLink and Business Wire's Web Site] ''Business Wire'' (November 21, 2000). Retrieved on 9–21–08.&lt;/ref&gt; mere months before the buyout of WCW by the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).

==Events==

All events were overseen by Referee [[Seth Stockton]]. His actual level of authority is unclear although he did ban a few warriors from competing for bad behaviour.

'''Battle Wheel'''

Two warriors competed.  The event took place on a large, rotating platform which resembled a right circular [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] with its outside edge and apex flattened.  The contenders had 60 seconds to force both warriors to touch the bottom ring of the wheel with any part of their body. The warriors were allowed to do essentially anything necessary to keep this from occurring. The contenders had to dispatch of the first warrior on the lower portion of the wheel (usually Jake Fury) before taking on the warrior at the top of the wheel (usually Cuda). 25 points were earned for removing the lower warrior from the wheel, and an additional 25 points were earned for getting the 2nd warrior off the wheel.

*Jake Fury suffered a nasty ankle injury on the Battle Wheel towards the end of Season 1. Fury's ankle was "blown out" and facing the incorrect direction. He only competed sparingly on the show afterwards.
*Scott Anthony, a contestant, also had his ankle broken/twisted (similar to Jake Fury's) under virtually the same circumstances in episode four of season 1.
*In Season 2, the Battle Wheel was significantly changed as the Wheel was lowered and wider, making it difficult for a contestant to defeat a warrior and so the ankle blow-out injury never happened again.

'''Take Down'''

A football type event. The contender was placed in the center of an enclosed area with 2 warriors on each end (Michael O'Dell participated in this event most often). Behind each warrior were 4 different lights with actuators beneath them. In the 1st season, a light was lit up behind the warrior (Steve and Scott typically noted that the warriors did not know which light was lit). On the referee's whistle, the contender tried to hit the actuator to turn the light off. Each light turned off was worth 25 points. The contender was only allowed one attempt per light; no "second effort" was allowed. After each attempt, the contender returned to the center and repeated against the other warrior. This would continue for 60 seconds. In the 2nd season, all 8 lights (4 at each end) were lit up. The contender chose which light to go after and the warrior would have to stop them. Otherwise, the rules remained the same from season 1.

'''Rollercage of Fire (1st Season), Rollercage (2nd Season)'''

Contenders were raised up into a revolving [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] cage with holes built into it. In the 1st season, a ring of fire was set outside the cage at each end, mainly to set the atmosphere. The fire ring was removed in season two, as well as the reference to it in the event's title. Contenders had 60 seconds to force the warrior (Almost always T-Money, with 1 or 2 appearances by DOA in the later part of the 1st season) through one of the holes while avoiding the same fate. Forcing the warrior out earned 25 points (later 50). Draws originally scored nothing, but were later increased to a 25-point score.

'''Aerial Kickboxing'''

Contenders and opposing warriors hung from an undulating metal grid roughly 10 feet off the ground. The contender attempted to kick the warrior (most often Bubba King) off the grid within 60 seconds without being removed from the grid themselves. Kicks to the head were technically against the rules and would result in DQ's. At least 1 contender was DQ'd because of head shots. If the contender kicked the warrior off the grid, the contender scored 50 points. Draws scored 25 points. Most contenders were lucky to score short of a DQ of the warrior. Bubba King and Sleepwalker were almost impossible to beat, but O'Dell actually was impossible to defeat, as he never lost a match and rarely surrendered a draw.

*On one occasion, a contestant kicked Bubba King in the head. Bubba was stunned, but he still won.
After the match, the "reporter" had Bubba talk about the match. Bubba was angry, and complained about the contestant breaking the rules (by kicking him in the head), and Bubba said half his body went numb from the head kick.

'''G-Force'''

A central rotating tower had three arms extending from the top of the central tower.  Each of the contenders hung onto a handle at the end of each arm.  A warrior stood on a platform above this tower, throwing balls at the contenders as the tower spun.  The tower's speed increased steadily as the event progressed.  The last contender/s standing earned 25 points, and a bonus 25 points was earned for lasting 60 seconds.

'''Battle Bridge'''

A large bridge spun quickly in mid-air. The contender and the warrior were each given a large padded club to use to knock the other off the bridge as it spun. Contenders scored 50 points for successfully knocking the warrior off the bridge, or 25 points for lasting 60 seconds.

'''Battle Field'''

This event was similar to [[List of American Gladiators events|Powerball]] on [[American Gladiators]]. Unlike Powerball, contenders competed one-on-one against a single warrior, who defended a single scoring bin. The scoring bin was located in the center of the playing field atop an approximately {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} pyramid. The warrior wore boxing gloves and could freely attack the contender as much as they wanted to keep them from scoring. Each ball scored was worth 25 points.

'''Battle Hoop'''

Contenders began in the center of a circular field. A large hanging hoop moved around the outside perimeter of the field, with its opening always facing the center of the field. A warrior stood on the outside perimeter of the field to block the contender from jumping through the hoop. Contenders had 60 seconds to try to jump through the hoop as many times as they could, returning to the center after each attempt. Each successful pass through the hoop earned 25 points.

'''Battle Wall'''

Contenders had to get over three walls defended by the Battle Dome warriors. A warrior stood on the opposite side of each wall. Each wall was around 3 feet in height. The walls became narrower as the event went on making it harder to get by the warriors. Each wall that a contender was successful in climbing was worth 25 points.

'''Evader'''

A contender had to light targets while avoiding medicine balls being launched by two warriors. Contenders had 60 seconds to light up all the targets on the two towers (one at a time).  Originally, the warriors only had to hit the contenders 3 times to end the match, but it was later increased to 5 times.  Lighting up all the targets on a tower (this may not have ever been done) was worth 25 points and lighting up all the targets was worth 50.  This event was considered to be Jake Fury's signature event.

'''Anti-Gravity'''

This event, along with Interceptor, was always played last because of the point opportunities. Contenders had to light strips by hitting buttons on a grid while moving along handles placed on the grid. Every strip lit was worth 25 points, for a possible 150. The contenders were also chased by a Battle Dome Warrior, which was almost always The Commander, and could lose the game in one of two ways: either losing their grip, which would result in the contender floating away, or having the Warrior rip their harness off and send them to the floor.

'''Interceptor'''

Called a game of cat and mouse, a contender had to fly around the Interceptor grid lighting targets worth 25 points each until caught by the warrior (again, almost always The Commander) or time ran out. Each target was worth 25 points.  There was a maximum of 175 points available to the contenders.

'''Ultimate Body Slam'''

This was a tiebreaker, usually between the warriors for the right to hold the warrior belt. If the top warrior had been less than stellar and a fellow warrior close in the rankings had performed well, but not well enough to win the belt outright, the two warriors would compete in Ultimate Body Slam. This game was simply a test of endurance; each player stood on a platform behind a metal disk. The disks were then pulled back and slammed into each other at increasing speed until one of the two fell off and lost.

==Warriors==
During the first season, the warriors maintained distinct personalities, similar to [[professional wrestling]] characters. The warriors competed for the Battledome Belt. After each event the warriors were "ranked", according to how well they did in the competition. At the end of that days competition the top ranked warrior received the Battledome Belt. The "ranking" was done by the mysterious chairman. The chairman supposedly owned the Battledome. He was only seen in silhouette wearing a large [[cowboy hat]]. What little else was known about him is that he was supposedly an older man. Karen Ko was supposed to be his [[trophy wife]], and Bobbie Haven his secretary. It was Bobbie he would deliver the messages from The chairman to the other warriors and the fans. At the start of the second season The chairman, standings board and the Battledome Belt were dropped from the competition.

'''First season warriors'''

The original series had 9 warriors. Some competed every week with some making only a few appearances.

* Bubba King ([[Timothy Elwell]])
The "king" of aerial kickboxing. Had very few defeats and proved almost invincible with most challengers lasting a maximum of 30 seconds. Did not play any other event during the shows run.

* The Commander ([[Christian Boeving]])
Speciality event appeared to be Anti-Gravity with Interceptor a close second. One of the smaller warriors proved very speedy and powerful against challengers.

* Cuda ([[Randolph Jones]])
The largest warrior during season 1. Dominated Battle Wheel. Always appeared in the top position on this event. Did make fleeting appearances on other events.

* D.O.A. ([[Chad Bannon]])
Made few appearances in Season one but became much more prolific in Season 2. Speciality event appeared to be Rollercage.

* Jake Fury, ([[Gary Kasper]])
The wild and unpredictable Fury appeared in several games. Particularly able at games G- force and Evader. Suffered a severe ankle injury during season one while participating in Battle Wheel. Thankfully he recovered and did return for season 2.

* Michael O'Dell ([[Michael O'Hearn]])
The poster boy of Battledome. Handsome, toned and tanned. One of the most all round warriors. Played most games with Aerial Kickboxing and Takedown proving specialities.

* Payne ([[John Sperandeo]])
Appeared fleeting during season 1. Mainly as cover for injured warriors.  Entered arena wearing a straitjacket and howling. Difficult to tell what he was good at as he didn't participate in many events.

* Sleepwalker ([[Woon Young Park]])
Another warrior who seemed to be cover for fellow injured warriors. Did participate in Anti-Gravity and aerial kickboxing but suffered a shoulder injury in the event. Seemed very capable in events he participated in.

* T-Money ([[Terry Crews]])
Smug, arrogant and always accompanied by "The Posse". Blinged up with jewellery and a dollar sign chain around his neck. Very good at several games but Rollercage was his speciality. Did not take losing very well!

'''Second season warriors'''

Season 2 saw the departure of Payne and Sleepalker for unknown reasons. The remaining 7 warriors returned and were accompanied by 6 new warriors to bring the total up to 13.

'Returning Warriors:
* Bubba King
* The Commander
* Cuda
* D.O.A.
* Jake Fury

Did not appear until later in the season then became a regular. Played several games. Takedown and Battle Hoop clearly his best.

* Snake ([[Jesse "Justice" Smith, Jr.]])
An all-rounder who participated in lots of games. No real stand out performances but very capable on events he played in.

* Mad Dog Steele([[Stefan Gamlin]])
Dominated his early appearances and Participated in many games. Got injured later in the season and did not appear again.

==The women of ''Battle Dome''==
A partial list of female companions:
* Nicole, Jaclyn and Erica Dahm – [[Nicole, Erica and Jaclyn Dahm|The Dahm Triplets]] – Always accompanied O'Dell during his outings. Unless they were tempted away by another warrior! 
* Bobbie Haven ([[Bobbie Brown]], best known for Warrant's "[[Cherry Pie (Warrant song)|Cherry Pie]]" music video) – The Chairman's very helpful and giving secretary...
* Angel (Karen Taucher) – Girlfriend of Jake Fury.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1912">[[File:William Haggars Bioscope1902.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|[[William Haggar]]'s travelling Bioscope from 1902]]
A '''Bioscope''' show was a [[music hall]] and [[funfair|fairground]] attraction consisting of a travelling [[Movie theater|cinema]]. The heyday of the Bioscope was from the late 1890s until [[World War I]].

Bioscope shows were fronted by the largest [[fairground organ]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steamfairground.co.uk/l3_bioscope.html "Hollycombe Steam Museum bioscope show"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these formed the entire public face of the show. A stage was usually in front of the organ, and dancing girls would entertain the crowds between film shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairground-heritage.org.uk/newsite/research/research-bioscopes.html "Fairground Heritage Trust"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703073622/http://www.fairground-heritage.org.uk/newsite/research/research-bioscopes.html |date=July 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Films shown in the Bioscope were primitive, and the earliest of these were made by the showmen themselves. Later, films were commercially produced.

Bioscope shows were integrated, in Britain at least, into the Variety shows in the huge Music Halls which were built at the end of the nineteenth century.

After the Music Hall Strike of 1907 in London, bioscope operators set up a trade union to represent them. There were about seventy operators in London at this point.

==Modern use==
In South Africa "Bioscope" or in [[Afrikaans]] "bioskoop" is an archaic word for the cinema and some people (especially older generations) still use it regularly.

In modern day Dutch, "bioscoop" is a wide-spread term, and the equivalent of the English "movie theater" or "cinema".

==The construction of the Buffyverse==
The Buffyverse is a fictional construct created by hundreds of individual stories told through TV, novels, comics and other media. It began with the first episodes of the ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' television series in 1997 and expanded with the spinoff TV series ''Angel'' in 1999. The popularity of these series led to licensed fiction carrying the ''Buffy'' and ''Angel'' labels.

Outside of the TV series, the Buffyverse has been expanded and elaborated by various authors and artists in the so-called "Buffyverse [[Expanded Universe]]".{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The [[Buffyverse novels]], [[Buffy video games]] and the vast majority of [[Buffyverse comics]], are licensed by [[20th Century Fox]]. The works sometimes flesh out background information on characters. For example, ''[[Go Ask Malice]]'' provides information about the origins of the character, [[Faith Lehane]].

The [[Buffyverse comics]] were first published by [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] who have retained the right to produce [[Buffy comics]]. [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] now hold the license to produce [[Angel comics]]. Joss Whedon wrote an eight-issue miniseries for [[Dark Horse Comics]] entitled ''[[Fray (comic)|Fray]]'', about a futuristic vampire slayer. Its final issue was published in August 2003. [[Pocket Books]] holds the license to produce [[Buffy novels]], but their license to produce [[Angel novels]] expired in 2004.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

== Characteristics of the Buffyverse ==
The Buffyverse is distinguished from the real world in that it contains supernatural elements, though only a small proportion of the human population is aware of this. In regards to the presentation of morality, many aspects of the Buffyverse are introduced as good or evil and are usually treated as such, though certain instances are often forced into more ambiguous grey areas. A few of the main aspects of the Buffyverse follow.

=== The Old Ones ===
{{Main|Old Ones (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)}}
The world was originally ruled by powerful pure-breed demons, the [[Old Ones (Buffyverse)|Old Ones]]. The Old Ones were eventually driven out of this dimension. Any who remained were vanquished or imprisoned in the "Deeper Well", which is essentially a hole in the Earth with one end opening in England. The entrance within England is in a tree ("Hole in the World" Angel Season 5). These demons are revered and worshiped by lesser demon species, and await chances to return and reclaim Earth.

=== Vampires ===
{{Main|Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)}}
{{Original research|section|date=August 2011}}
According to legend in the Buffyverse, the last Old One to leave this dimension fed off a human and their blood mixed. A demon was trapped in the human body in the place of the soul. [[Rupert Giles]] describes how the being "bit another, and another, and so they walk the Earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | episodelink = The Harvest (Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode) | title = The Harvest | series = Buffy the Vampire Slayer | season = 1 | number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some elements of traditional vampire mythology are used while others are abandoned. These said elements (listed below) are essentially the rules of a vampire's life.

Can be killed by:
*Wooden stake through the heart
*Extensive exposure to sunlight (Possible that other dimensions Suns do not work the same as Earth's, as Pylea's dual suns did not kill Angel)
*Extensive exposure to fire
*Decapitation
*Holy water (ingestion)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | series = Buffy the Vampire Slayer | season = 3 | number = 12 | title = Helpless | episodelink = Helpless (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Magical and supernatural devices and spells

Vulnerable to:
*Exposure to holy water
*Physical contact with a [[Christian Cross|cross]]
*Limited exposure to sunlight
*Limited exposure to fire
*Possession by other supernatural creatures and forces
*Supernatural spells and devices

Other vampire features:
*Cannot enter private dwellings unless invited.
*Vampires' bodies and clothes explode to dust when slain. (Except for articles of importance, magical rings, amulets, etc.)
*Have no reflection (but do have a shadow)
*Superhuman strength, endurance, speed, and senses
*Have no soul (unless it is in some way restored such as with Angel and later Spike)
*Cannot have children (unless foretold by prophecy such as Angel and Darla's son Connor)
*[[Bullet]]s cannot kill vampires, but can cause them extreme pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | episodelink = Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode) | title = Angel | series = Buffy the Vampire Slayer | season = 1 | number = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the first episode, garlic is seen in Buffy's trunk along with stakes, crosses, and holy water. It is also used by Buffy in "[[Wrecked (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Wrecked]]" to repel [[Spike (Buffy)|Spike]]. Also, in the episode "The Wish," which explored an episode where Buffy Summers never came to Sunnydale, allowing vampires to rule the city, garlic is seen lining the lockers of Sunnydale High. Also in this episode they allude that bright colors attract the vampires, and therefore the townspeople wear dark, muted colors.
*They can be tranquilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Doppelgangland | episodelink = Doppelgangland | series = Buffy the Vampire Slayer | season = 3 | number = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Can become intoxicated by consuming alcohol or the blood of a human who is intoxicated with drugs, according to Spike in season two, where he claims that after he drank from a hippie at Woodstock, he spent "the next six hours watching [his] hand move," and as seen in season four of Angel, when Faith becomes high on the drug orpheus and allows Angelus to feed on her, causing him to react to the drug as well.

=== Werewolves ===
As in historical [[werewolf]] mythology, werewolves are people who suffer from [[lycanthropy]]. In the Buffyverse, werewolf characters are shown to have an animal side which either complements or clashes with their human side. They transform not only on the [[full moon]] of each month, but the day before and the day after as well. Prominent werewolf characters include [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Oz]], [[Veruca (Buffyverse)|Veruca]], and [[Nina Ash]]. Some werewolves have shown the ability to gain control/achieve harmony between their human and bestial sides (Oz and his teacher in the comics).

===Demons===
{{Main|Demon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)}}
In the Buffyverse, the term "demon" is inexact; it has been applied to just about every creature that isn't a god, robot, unmodified human, or standard terrestrial animal. Some classes of creature, such as Vampires and Old Ones, are known to be demons but not always referred to as such.

There are many kinds of demons portrayed in the Buffyverse, of many different natures and origins. Some demons are shown to live and reproduce on Earth (the Bezoar in "[[Bad Eggs (Buffy episode)|Bad Eggs]]"), but some are extraterrestrial (the Queller demon in "[[Listening to Fear]]"), extradimensional ([[Lorne (Buffyverse)|Lorne]] on ''Angel''), ex-humans ([[Anya Jenkins]] was a peasant who became a vengeance demon), and hybrids ([[Cordelia Chase]] had aspects of demon fused in her). Some species of demon are capable of breeding with humans ([[Allen Francis Doyle|Doyle]] has a human mother and a demon father). [[Anya Jenkins]] states in the episode "[[Graduation Day (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Graduation Day]]" that the demons that walk the earth are not pure demons, they are half-breeds. She states that true demons are "bigger", in reference to Mayor [[Richard Wilkins (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Richard Wilkins]]' Ascension into a true demon.

Some demons in ''Buffy'' are shown to be inherently evil and interested in causing suffering, death, and harm. Other characters challenge this notion however, with demons such as [[Clem (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Clem]] and Lorne who appear basically good.

=== Slayers ===
{{Main|Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)}}

A group of shamans used the essence of a demon to produce [[the First Slayer]]. She was banished from her own village and forced to fight the forces of darkness alone. When she died another girl was "chosen" in her place. The line of Slayers is maintained until Buffy's two deaths and revivals cause a disturbance in the Slayer line that ultimately leads to the awakening of the [[First Evil]]. The Slayer is given great strength, lightning reflexes, fast healing powers and is highly skilled with many weapons and martial arts.

=== Watchers ===
{{Main|Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)}}

The [[Watchers' Council]] historically offers guidance to the Slayer, assisting them by supervising their training and by researching existing and possible demonic or supernatural threats. Notable Watchers include Rupert Giles, Watcher of series protagonist Buffy, and Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, who temporarily takes over in season 3.

=== "The Good Fight" ===
While most of humanity in the Buffyverse seems oblivious to the existence of demons, other groups and organizations that are waging their own battles against evil come to light over the course of ''Buffy'' and ''Angel'' and in related media. For example, a group of socially disadvantaged youth in L.A. organized themselves to battle the vampires destroying their community. (See [[Charles Gunn (Angel)|Charles Gunn]].) And, although some of their methods and goals proved questionable, a government-funded group known as [[The Initiative (Buffyverse)|The Initiative]] was also aware of the existence of demons and was fighting a secret war against them. Other large scale groups appear in both Buffy and Angel, often as antagonists to the heroes due to differing views on how to fight the good fight.

=== Magic ===
{{Main|Witch (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)}}
Magic in the Buffyverse can be used for all manner of control. Spells can be performed by anyone by use of magical items while saying particular words. Witches and warlocks however have more knowledge and power for using it for their purposes.

A witch can inherit their lineage from their parents or develop their craft over many years, and neither a witch nor warlock must necessarily be human, such as [[Cyrus Vail|Cyvus Vail]].

=== Humans with powers ===
While not prominent in the Buffyverse, there are individuals who gain special powers through means other than the ones mentioned above. [[Gwen Raiden]] and Bethany (from the ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' episode ''[[Untouched (Angel)|Untouched]]'') seem to be born with their powers. Drusilla had psychic powers as a human before becoming a vampire though their origins are never explained. Others, like Marcie Ross from the episode ''[[Out of Mind, Out of Sight (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Out of Mind, Out of Sight]]'' or the trio of Nerds gain their powers by other magical, non-magical, or "scientific" means. [[Connor (Angel)]] is also a human with supernatural powers, similar to those of vampires, because he was born as a product of two vampire parents.

=== Technology ===
Technology in the Buffyverse is more advanced than in the real world at the time it was produced, although the applications of it do not seem to be common knowledge. Examples of advanced technology include:

* The demon Moloch has an advanced robotic body built for him to inhabit "[[I, Robot... You, Jane]]."
* Inventor Ted Buchannon built a highly advanced [[Android (robot)|android]] version of himself in the 1950s that was capable of impersonating a human being without drawing suspicion. ("[[Ted (Buffy episode)|Ted]]")
* [[Warren Mears]] builds a lifelike android named April as a companion in the episode "[[I Was Made to Love You (Buffy episode)|I Was Made to Love You]]", then builds the [[Buffybot]] for Spike as well as an android version of himself. He later forms and leads the [[Trio (Buffyverse)|Trio]] as their technology guru. The trio is shown to use a freeze ray ("[[Smashed (Buffy episode)|Smashed]]"), an invisibility ray ("[[Gone (Buffy episode)|Gone]]"), a Cerebral Dampener capable of removing someone's free will ("[[Dead Things]]"), and jet packs ("[[Seeing Red (Buffy episode)|Seeing Red]]").
* Pete Clarner is shown to create a chemical compound that gives him highly enhanced strength. ("[[Beauty and the Beasts]]")

Additionally, there is much technology specifically geared towards the supernatural, used by the government organization known as "[[Initiative (Buffyverse)|The Initiative]]" and the demonic law firm [[Wolfram and Hart]].

[[Image:Magicianatparty.jpg|thumb|An amateur magician performing "children's magic" for a birthday party audience.]]
'''Children's magic''' is a specialized aspect of [[parlor magic]] and is meant to entertain children. It is typically performed at birthday parties, churches, preschools, elementary schools, Sunday Schools or libraries. It is often the only type of magic most Westerners experience other than that seen on television. This type of magic is usually comedic in nature.&lt;ref name="Fiscus, David 1980"&gt;Fiscus, David. Birthday Magician's Handbook. Lee Jacobs Productions. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction should be made between Children's magic and "young magicians." The former is meant for audiences made up of mostly children while the latter refers to performers who are under-aged. The later has organizations dedicated to them including [[Society of Young Magicians]], [[Magic Youth International]] and [[Young Magicians' Club]].

Not every magician is interested in performing for children both artistically and in terms of patience. When Br. [[John Hamman]], sm, was honored in 1995 during the first St. Louis Magical Heritage Awards, he explained in his acceptance speech the key to a successful magic performance:

{{quote|
"''The object of magic is misdirection. Audiences are more apt to believe what they hear than what they see, and intelligent people are the easiest to fool because they don't expect me to use some childish gimmick to deceive them. On the other hand, '''children are hard to fool, because they watch closely and don't listen'''''." (bold letters added)
}}

Since children do not have the social filters adults have in such situations, they have no compunction against pointing out every error or inconsistency a magician makes during his performance. This makes performing for children exceedingly difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Children's magicians often use certain gambits while performing for children. Some performers use their knowledge to intentionally misdirect the children in a given audience. One form of this type of misdirection is referred to as "Magician-in-Trouble" wherein a performer pretends to have made a mistake.

The style used for children's magic is often comical and frequently uses [[theatrical property|props]] that are large and colorful.
It is not uncommon for magicians to dress as clowns or in wild and outlandish costumes while performing.&lt;ref&gt;Ginn, David. Clown Magic. Piccadilly Books. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, children's magicians are reluctant to use tricks that focus on the use of playing cards, however magic with coins (see Coin magic) or paper money are frequently popular with children. Movement and action are preferable to patter. Buffoonery is a better vehicle than "mystery" for children.[1] These performers commonly use as many audience members as impromptu assistants as possible.[1] Common Children's Magic Props include: Run Rabbit Run, Hip Hop Rabbits, Change Bag Routines, Breakaway Wand, Tipsy Turvy Bottles, and Spongeballs. Older children (from 7 upwards) tend to have a far greater logic and less traditional and more innovative magic effects can be performed.

{{Filmmaking sidebar}}
'''Cinematography''' (from [[ancient greek]] κίνημα, ''kìnema''  "movement" and γράφειν, ''gràphein'' "to write") is the science or art of [[motion-picture]] photography by recording light or other [[electromagnetic radiation]], either electronically by means of an [[image sensor]], or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as [[film stock]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book
|title= The Focal Dictionary of Photographic Technologies 
|last= Spencer|first= D A |year= 1973 
|publisher= Focal Press |isbn=978-0133227192 
|page=454
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cinematographer]]s use a [[lens (optics)|lens]] to focus reflected light from objects into a [[real image]] that is transferred to some [[image sensor]] or [[film|light-sensitive material]] inside a [[movie camera]]. These [[Exposure (photography)|exposures]] are created sequentially and preserved for later processing and viewing as a [[motion picture]]. Capturing images with an electronic image sensor produces an [[Charge-coupled device|electrical charge]] for each [[pixel]] in the image, which is [[Video processing|electronically processed]] and stored in a [[video file]] for subsequent processing or display. Images captured with [[photographic emulsion]] result in a series of invisible [[latent image]]s on the film stock, which are chemically "[[Photographic developer|developed]]" into a [[Positive (photography)|visible image]]. The images on the film stock are [[movie projector|projected]] for viewing the motion picture.

Cinematography finds uses in many fields of [[science]] and [[business sector|business]] as well as for entertainment purposes and [[mass communication]].

The word "cinematography" is based on the Greek words {{lang|el|[[wikt:κίνημα|κίνημα]]}} (''kinema''), meaning "movement, motion" and {{lang|el|[[wikt:γράφειν|γράφειν]]}} (''graphein'') meaning "to record", together meaning "recording motion". The word used to refer to the art, process, or job of filming movies, but later its meaning became restricted to "motion picture photography".

===Precursors===

In the 1830s, moving images were produced on revolving drums and disks, with independent invention by Simon von Stampfer ([[stroboscope]]) in Austria, Joseph Plateau ([[phenakistoscope]]) in Belgium, and William Horner ([[zoetrope]]) in Britain.

In 1845, [[Francis Ronalds]] invented the [[Francis Ronalds#Continuously recording camera|first successful camera]] able to make [[Photography#Science and forensics|continuous recordings]] of the varying indications of [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic]] instruments over time. The cameras were supplied to numerous observatories around the world and some remained in use until well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=2016|title=The Beginnings of Continuous Scientific Recording using Photography: Sir Francis Ronalds’ Contribution|url=http://www.eshph.org/blog/2016/04/19/1642/|journal=European Society for the History of Photography|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sirfrancisronalds.co.uk/camera.html|title=The First "Movie Camera"|website=Sir Francis Ronalds and his Family|access-date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Lincoln patented a device, in 1867, that showed animated pictures called the "wheel of life" or "[[zoopraxiscope]]". In it, moving drawings or photographs were watched through a slit.

On 19 June 1873, [[Eadweard Muybridge]] successfully photographed a horse named "[[Sallie Gardner at a Gallop|Sallie Gardner]]" in fast motion using a series of 24 stereoscopic cameras. The cameras were arranged along a track parallel to the horse's, and each camera shutter was controlled by a trip wire triggered by the horse's hooves. They were 21&amp;nbsp;inches apart to cover the 20 feet taken by the horse stride, taking pictures at one thousandth of a second.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Clegg|first=Brian|title=The Man Who Stopped Time| publisher=Joseph Henry Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-309-10112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the decade, Muybridge had adapted sequences of his photographs to a zoopraxiscope for short, primitive projected "movies," which were sensations on his lecture tours by 1879 or 1880.

Nine years later, in 1882, French scientist [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] invented a chronophotographic gun, which was capable of taking 12 consecutive frames a second, recording all the frames of the same picture.

The late nineteenth to the early twentieth century brought rise to the use of film not only for entertainment purposes but for scientific exploration as well. French biologist and filmmaker Jean Painleve lobbied heavily for the use of film in the scientific field, as the new medium was more efficient in capturing and documenting the behavior, movement, and environment of microorganisms, cells, and bacteria, than the naked eye.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landecker|first=Hannah|date=2006|title=Microcinematography and the History of Science and Film|url=|journal=Isis|doi=10.1086/501105}}&lt;!--|accessdate = 2014-10-26--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of film into scientific fields allowed for not only the viewing "new images and objects, such as cells and natural objects, but also the viewing of them in real time",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; whereas prior to the invention of moving pictures, scientists and doctors alike had to rely on hand drawn sketches of human anatomy and its microorganisms. This posed a great inconvenience in the science and medical worlds. The development of film and increased usage of cameras allowed doctors and scientists to grasp a better understanding and knowledge of their projects.

[[File:Roundhay Garden Scene.ogv|thumb|left|[[Roundhay Garden Scene]] (1888), the world's earliest surviving motion-picture film.]]

The experimental film ''[[Roundhay Garden Scene]]'', filmed by [[Louis Le Prince]] on 14 October 1888, in [[Roundhay]], [[Leeds]], England, is the earliest surviving motion picture. This movie was shot on paper film.

[[William Kennedy Laurie Dickson|W. K. L. Dickson]], working under the direction of [[Thomas Alva Edison]], was the first to design a successful apparatus, the [[Kinetograph]], patented in 1891. This camera took a series of instantaneous photographs on standard Eastman Kodak photographic emulsion coated onto a transparent [[Celluloid|celluloid strip]] 35&amp;nbsp;mm wide. The results of this work were first shown in public in 1893, using the viewing apparatus also designed by Dickson, the [[Kinetoscope]]. Contained within a large box, only one person at a time looking into it through a peephole could view the movie.

In the following year, [[Charles Francis Jenkins]] and his projector, the [[Phantoscope]], made a successful audience viewing while [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Louis and Auguste Lumière]] perfected the [[Cinématographe]], an apparatus that took, printed, and projected film, in Paris in December 1895. The Lumière brothers were the first to present projected, moving, photographic, pictures to a paying audience of more than one person.

In 1896, movie theaters were open in France ([[Paris]], [[Lyon]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Nice]], [[Marseille]]); Italy ([[Rome]], [[Milan]], [[Naples]], [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Bologna]], [[Forlì]]); [[Brussels]]; and [[London]].

In 1896, Edison showed his improved Vitascope projector, the first commercially successful projector in the U.S.

Cooper Hewitt invented mercury lamps which made it practical to shoot films indoors without sunlight in 1905.

The first animated cartoon was produced in 1906.

Credits began to appear at the beginning of motion pictures in 1911.

The Bell and Howell 2709 movie camera invented in 1915 allowed directors to make close-ups without physically moving the camera.

By the late 1920s, most of the movies produced were sound films.

Wide screen formats were first experimented with in the 1950s.

By the 1970s, most movies were color films. IMAX and other 70mm formats gained popularity. Wide distribution of films became commonplace, setting the ground for "blockbusters."

Film cinematography dominated the motion picture industry from its inception until the 2010s when digital cinematography became dominant. Film cinematography is still used by some directors, especially in specific applications or out of fondness of the format.

===Black and white===

From its birth in the 1880s, movies were predominantly monochrome. Contrary to popular belief, monochrome doesn't always mean black and white; it means a movie shot in a single tone or color. Since the cost of tinted film bases was substantially higher, most movies were produced in black and white monochrome. Even with the advent of early color experiments, the greater expense of color meant films were mostly made in black and white until the 1950s, when cheaper color processes were introduced, and in some years the percentage of films shot on color film surpassed 51%. By the 1960s, color became by far the dominant film stock. In the coming decades, the usage of color film greatly increased while monochrome films became scarce.

[[File:Serpentine Dance (1895) - yt.webm|thumb|left|[[Annabelle Serpentine Dance]], hand-tinted version (1895)]]
After the advent of motion pictures, a tremendous amount of energy was invested in the production of photography in natural color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = New Developments in Colour Cinematography|last = Baker|first = T. Thorne|date = 1932|journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Arts|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the talking picture further increased the demand for the use of color photography. However, in comparison to other technological advances of the time, the arrival of color photography was a relatively slow process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = New Developments in Colour Photography|last = Baker|first = T. Thorne|date = 1932|journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Arts|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early movies were not actually color movies since they were shot monochrome and hand-colored or machine-colored afterwards. (Such movies are referred to as ''colored'' and not ''color''.) The earliest such example is the hand-tinted [[Annabelle Serpentine Dance]] in 1895 by [[Edison Manufacturing Company]]. Machine-based tinting later became popular. Tinting continued until the advent of natural color cinematography in the 1910s. Many black and white movies have been colorized recently using digital tinting. This includes footage shot from both world wars, sporting events and political propaganda.

In 1902, [[Edward Raymond Turner]] produced the first films with a natural color process rather than using colorization techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-19557914|title=World's first colour film footage viewed for first time|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, [[kinemacolor]] was introduced. In the same year, the short film ''[[A Visit to the Seaside]]'' became the first natural color movie to be publicly presented.

In 1917, the earliest version of [[Technicolor]] was introduced. [[Kodachrome]] was introduced in 1935. [[Eastmancolor]] was introduced in 1950 and became the color standard for the rest of the century.

In the 2010s, color films were largely superseded by color digital cinematography.

[[File:Arri Alexa camera.jpg|thumb|[[Arri Alexa]], a digital movie camera.]]

In digital cinematography, the movie is shot on digital medium such as flash storage, as well as distributed through a digital medium such as a hard drive.

Beginning in the late 1980s, [[Sony]] began marketing the concept of "electronic cinematography," utilizing its analog [[Sony HDVS]] [[professional video camera]]s. The effort met with very little success. However, this led to one of the earliest digitally shot feature movies, ''[[Julia and Julia]]'', being produced in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093092/trivia|title=Julia and Julia (1987)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, with the introduction of [[HDCAM]] recorders and 1920 × 1080 pixel digital professional video cameras based on [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] technology, the idea, now re-branded as "digital cinematography," began to gain traction in the market.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Shot and released in 1998, ''[[The Last Broadcast (film)|The Last Broadcast]]'' is believed by some to be the first feature-length video shot and edited entirely on consumer-level digital equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Last Broadcast is A First: The Making of a Digital Feature|url=http://www.thelastbroadcastmovie.com/|website=thelastbroadcastmovie.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1999, [[George Lucas]] challenged the supremacy of the movie-making medium of film for the first time by including footage filmed with high-definition digital cameras in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]''. In late 2013, Paramount became the first major studio to distribute movies to theaters in digital format, eliminating 35mm film entirely. Since then the demand of movies to be developed onto digital format rather than 35mm has increased drastically.

As digital technology improved, movie studios began increasingly shifting towards digital cinematography. Since the 2010s, digital cinematography has become the dominant form of cinematography after largely superseding film cinematography.

== Aspects ==
{{main article|Cinematic techniques}}
Numerous aspects contribute to the art of cinematography, including:

===Cinema technique===
[[File:Melstud2.gif|thumb|upright|[[Georges Méliès]] (left) painting a backdrop in his studio]]
The first film cameras were fastened directly to the head of a tripod or other support, with only the crudest kind of leveling devices provided, in the manner of the still-camera tripod heads of the period. The earliest film cameras were thus effectively fixed during the shot, and hence the first camera movements were the result of mounting a camera on a moving vehicle. The first known of these was a film shot by a Lumière cameraman from the back platform of a train leaving Jerusalem in 1896, and by 1898, there were a number of films shot from moving trains. Although listed under the general heading of "panoramas" in the sales catalogues of the time, those films shot straight forward from in front of a railway engine were usually specifically referred to as "[[phantom ride]]s".

In 1897, [[Robert W. Paul]] had the first real rotating camera head made to put on a tripod, so that he could follow the passing processions of Queen Victoria's [[Diamond Jubilee]] in one uninterrupted shot. This device had the camera mounted on a vertical axis that could be rotated by a [[worm gear]] driven by turning a crank handle, and Paul put it on general sale the next year. Shots taken using such a [[panning (camera)|"panning"]] head were also referred to as "panoramas" in the film catalogues of the first decade of the cinema. This eventually led to the creation of a panoramic photo as well.

The standard pattern for early film studios was provided by the studio which Georges Méliès had built in 1897. This had a glass roof and three glass walls constructed after the model of large studios for still photography, and it was fitted with thin cotton cloths that could be stretched below the roof to diffuse the direct ray of the sun on sunny days. The soft overall light without real shadows that this arrangement produced, and which also exists naturally on lightly overcast days, was to become the basis for film lighting in film studios for the next decade.

=== Image sensor and film stock ===
Cinematography can begin with digital [[image sensor]] or rolls of film. Advancements in film emulsion and grain structure provided a wide range of available [[film stock]]s. The selection of a film stock is one of the first decisions made in preparing a typical film production.

Aside from the [[film gauge]] selection – [[8 mm film|8 mm]] (amateur), [[16 mm]] (semi-professional), [[35 mm]] (professional) and [[65 mm]] (epic photography, rarely used except in special event venues) – the cinematographer has a selection of stocks in [[reversal film|reversal]] (which, when developed, create a positive image) and negative formats along with a wide range of [[film speed]]s (varying sensitivity to light) from [[Film speed|ISO]] 50 (slow, least sensitive to light) to 800 (very fast, extremely sensitive to light) and differing response to color (low [[Colorfulness|saturation]], high saturation) and contrast (varying levels between pure black (no exposure) and pure white (complete overexposure).
Advancements and adjustments to nearly all gauges of film create the "super" formats wherein the area of the film used to capture a single frame of an image is expanded, although the physical gauge of the film remains the same. [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8&amp;nbsp;mm]], Super 16&amp;nbsp;mm, and [[Super 35]]&amp;nbsp;mm all utilize more of the overall film area for the image than their "regular" non-super counterparts. The larger the film gauge, the higher the overall image resolution clarity and technical quality. The techniques used by the [[film laboratory]] to [[photographic processing|process the film stock]] can also offer a considerable variance in the image produced. By controlling the temperature and varying the duration in which the film is soaked in the development chemicals, and by skipping certain chemical processes (or partially skipping all of them), cinematographers can achieve very different looks from a single film stock in the laboratory.  Some techniques that can be used are [[push processing]], [[bleach bypass]], and [[cross processing]].

Most of modern cinema uses [[digital cinematography]] and has no film stocks {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}, but the cameras themselves can be adjusted in ways that go far beyond the abilities of one particular film stock. They can provide varying degrees of color sensitivity, image contrast, light sensitivity and so on. One camera can achieve all the various looks of different emulsions. Digital image adjustments such as ISO and contrast are executed by estimating the same adjustments that would take place if actual film were in use, and are thus vulnerable to the camera's sensor designers perceptions of various film stocks and image adjustment parameters.

=== Filters ===
[[Filter (photography)|Filters]], such as diffusion filters or color effect filters, are also widely used to enhance mood or dramatic effects. Most photographic filters are made up of two pieces of optical glass glued together with some form of image or light manipulation material between the glass. In the case of color filters, there is often a translucent color medium pressed between two planes of optical glass. Color filters work by blocking out certain color [[wavelengths]] of light from reaching the film. With color film, this works very intuitively wherein a blue filter will cut down on the passage of red, orange, and yellow light and create a blue tint on the film. In black-and-white photography, color filters are used somewhat counter intuitively; for instance a yellow filter, which cuts down on blue wavelengths of light, can be used to darken a daylight sky (by eliminating blue light from hitting the film, thus greatly underexposing the mostly blue sky) while not biasing most human flesh tone. Certain cinematographers, such as [[Christopher Doyle]], are well known for their innovative use of filters. Filters can be used in front of the lens or, in some cases, behind the lens for different effects. [[Christopher Doyle]] was a pioneer for increased usage of filters in movies. He was highly respected throughout the cinema world.

=== Lens ===
[[Camera lens|Lenses]] can be attached to the camera to give a certain look, feel, or effect by focus, color, etc.

As does the [[human eye]], the camera creates [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and spatial relations with the rest of the world. However, unlike one's eye, a cinematographer can select different lenses for different purposes. Variation in [[focal length]] is one of the chief benefits. The focal length of the lens determines the [[angle of view]] and, therefore, the [[field of view]]. Cinematographers can choose from a range of [[wide-angle lens]]es, "normal" lenses and [[long focus lens]]es, as well as [[Macro photography|macro lenses]] and other special effect lens systems such as [[borescope]] lenses. Wide-angle lenses have short focal lengths and make spatial distances more obvious. A person in the distance is shown as much smaller while someone in the front will loom large. On the other hand, long focus lenses reduce such exaggerations, depicting far-off objects as seemingly close together and flattening perspective. The differences between the perspective rendering is actually not due to the focal length by itself, but by the distance between the subjects and the camera. Therefore, the use of different focal lengths in combination with different camera to subject distances creates these different rendering. Changing the focal length only while keeping the same camera position doesn't affect perspective but the [[camera angle]] of view only.

A [[zoom lens]] allows a camera operator to change his focal length within a shot or quickly between setups for shots. As [[prime lens]]es offer greater optical quality and are "faster" (larger aperture openings, usable in less light) than zoom lenses, they are often employed in professional cinematography over zoom lenses. Certain scenes or even types of filmmaking, however, may require the use of zooms for speed or ease of use, as well as shots involving a zoom move.

As in other photography, the control of the exposed image is done in the lens with the control of the [[diaphragm aperture]]. For proper selection, the cinematographer needs that all lenses be engraved with [[F-number#T-stop|T-stop]], not [[F-number|f-stop]] so that the eventual light loss due to the glass doesn't affect the exposure control when setting it using the usual meters. The choice of the aperture also affects image quality (aberrations) and depth of field.

=== Depth of field and focus ===
[[Image:Citizen Kane deep focus.jpg|alt=A stern looking man and a woman sit on the right side of a table with documents on the table. A top hat is on the table. An unkempt man stands to the left of the picture. In the background a boy can be seen through a window playing in the snow.|thumb|right|A [[deep focus]] shot from ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941): everything, including the hat in the foreground and the boy (young [[Charles Foster Kane]]) in the distance, is in sharp focus.]]
Focal length and diaphragm aperture affect the [[depth of field]] of a scene – that is, how much the background, mid-ground and foreground will be rendered in "acceptable focus" (only one exact plane of the image is in precise focus) on the film or video target. Depth of field (not to be confused with [[depth of focus]]) is determined by the aperture size and the focal distance. A large or deep depth of field is generated with a very small iris aperture and focusing on a point in the distance, whereas a shallow depth of field will be achieved with a large (open) iris aperture and focusing closer to the lens. Depth of field is also governed by the format size. If one considers the field of view and angle of view, the smaller the image is, the shorter the focal length should be, as to keep the same field of view. Then, the smaller the image is, the more depth of field is obtained, for the same field of view. Therefore, 70mm has less depth of field than 35mm for a given field of view, 16mm more than 35mm, and early video cameras, as well as most modern consumer level video cameras, even more depth of field than 16mm. 

In ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), cinematographer [[Gregg Toland]] and director [[Orson Welles]] used tighter apertures to create every detail of the foreground and background of the sets in sharp focus. This practice is known as [[deep focus]]. Deep focus became a popular cinematographic device from the 1940s onwards in Hollywood. Today, the trend is for more [[shallow focus]]. To change the plane of focus from one object or character to another within a shot is commonly known as a ''[[rack focus]]''.

Early in the transition to digital cinematography, the inability of digital video cameras to easily achieve shallow depth of field, due to their small image sensors, was initially an issue of frustration for film makers trying to emulate the look of 35mm film. Optical adapters were devised which accomplished this by mounting a larger format lens which projected its image, at the size of the larger format, on a ground glass screen preserving the depth of field. The adapter and lens then mounted on the small format video camera which in turn focused on the ground glass screen. 

[[Digital SLR]] still cameras have sensor sizes similar to that of the 35mm film frame, and thus are able to produce images with similar depth of field. The advent of video functions in these cameras sparked a revolution in digital cinematography, with more and more film makers adopting still cameras for the purpose because of the film-like qualities of their images. More recently, more and more dedicated video cameras are being equipped with larger sensors capable of 35mm film-like depth of field.

=== Aspect ratio and framing ===
The [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of an image is the ratio of its width to its height. This can be expressed either as a ratio of 2 integers, such as 4:3, or in a decimal format, such as 1.33:1 or simply 1.33.

Different ratios provide different aesthetic effects. Standards for aspect ratio have varied significantly over time.

During the silent era, aspect ratios varied widely, from square [[List of film formats#Film formats|1:1]], all the way up to the extreme widescreen 4:1 [[Polyvision]].  However, from the 1910s, silent motion pictures generally settled on the ratio of 4:3 (1.33). The introduction of sound-on-film briefly narrowed the aspect ratio, to allow room for a sound stripe. In 1932, a new standard was introduced, the [[Academy ratio]] of 1.37, by means of thickening the [[frame line]].

For years, mainstream cinematographers were limited to using the Academy ratio, but in the 1950s, thanks to the popularity of [[Cinerama]], [[widescreen]] ratios were introduced in an effort to pull audiences back into the theater and away from their home [[history of television|television]] sets. These new widescreen formats provided cinematographers a wider frame within which to compose their images.

Many different proprietary photographic systems were invented and utilized in the 1950s to create widescreen movies, but one dominated film: the [[anamorphic]] process, which optically squeezes the image to photograph twice the horizontal area to the same size vertical as standard "spherical" lenses. The first commonly used anamorphic format was [[CinemaScope]], which used a 2.35 aspect ratio, although it was originally 2.55. CinemaScope was used from 1953 to 1967, but due to technical flaws in the design and its ownership by Fox, several third-party companies, led by [[Panavision]]'s technical improvements in the 1950s, dominated the anamorphic cine lens market. Changes to [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|SMPTE]] projection standards altered the projected ratio from 2.35 to 2.39 in 1970, although this did not change anything regarding the photographic anamorphic standards; all changes in respect to the aspect ratio of anamorphic 35&amp;nbsp;mm photography are specific to camera or projector gate sizes, not the optical system. After the [[List of film formats|"widescreen wars"]] of the 1950s, the motion-picture industry settled into 1.85 as a standard for theatrical projection in the United States and the United Kingdom. This is a cropped version of 1.37.  Europe and Asia opted for 1.66 at first, although 1.85 has largely permeated these markets in recent decades. Certain "epic" or adventure movies utilized the anamorphic 2.39.

In the 1990s, with the advent of [[high-definition video]], television engineers created the 1.78 (16:9) ratio as a mathematical compromise between the theatrical standard of 1.85 and television's 1.33, as it was not practical to produce a traditional CRT television tube with a width of 1.85. Until that point, nothing had ever been originated in 1.78. Today, this is a standard for high-definition video and for widescreen television.

=== Lighting ===
Light is necessary to create an image exposure on a frame of film or on a digital target (CCD, etc.). The art of lighting for cinematography goes far beyond basic exposure, however, into the essence of visual storytelling. Lighting contributes considerably to the emotional response an audience has watching a motion picture. The increased usage of filters can greatly impact the final image and affect the lighting.

=== Camera movement ===
[[File:Tower Heist marching band jeh.theora.ogv|thumb|Camera on a small motor vehicle representing a large one]]
Cinematography can not only depict a moving subject but can use a camera, which represents the audience's viewpoint or perspective, that moves during the course of filming. This movement plays a considerable role in the emotional language of film images and the audience's emotional reaction to the action. Techniques range from the most basic movements of [[Panning (camera)|panning]] (horizontal shift in viewpoint from a fixed position; like turning your head side-to-side) and tilting (vertical shift in viewpoint from a fixed position; like tipping your head back to look at the sky or down to look at the ground) to [[Dolly shot|dollying]] (placing the camera on a moving platform to move it closer or farther from the subject), [[tracking shot|tracking]] (placing the camera on a moving platform to move it to the left or right), [[crane shot|craning]] (moving the camera in a vertical position; being able to lift it off the ground as well as swing it side-to-side from a fixed base position), and combinations of the above. Early cinematographers often faced problems that were not common to other graphic artists because of the element of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Production Problems: Cinematography|last = Moore|first = Harris C.|date = 1949|journal = Journal of the University Film Producers Association|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Filming outdoor.jpg|thumb|left|Live filming for TV (2013)]]
Cameras have been mounted to nearly every imaginable form of transportation.

Most cameras can also be [[handheld camera|handheld]], that is held in the hands of the camera operator who moves from one position to another while filming the action. Personal stabilizing platforms came into being in the late 1970s through the invention of [[Garrett Brown]], which became known as the [[Steadicam]]. The Steadicam is a body harness and stabilization arm that connects to the camera, supporting the camera while isolating it from the operator's body movements. After the Steadicam patent expired in the early 1990s, many other companies began manufacturing their concept of the personal camera stabilizer. This invention is much more common throughout the cinematic world today. From feature-length films to the evening news, more and more networks have begun to use a personal camera stabilizer.

== Special effects ==
{{main article|Special effect}}
The first special effects in the cinema were created while the film was being shot. These came to be known as "[[In-camera effect|in-camera]]" effects. Later, [[optical printer|optical]] and [[Digital compositing|digital effects]] were developed so that editors and visual effects artists could more tightly control the process by manipulating the film in [[post-production]].

The 1896 movie [[The Execution of Mary Stuart]] shows an actor dressed as the queen placing her head on the execution block in front of a small group of bystanders in Elizabethan dress. The executioner brings his axe down, and the queen's severed head drops onto the ground. This trick was worked by stopping the camera and replacing the actor with a dummy, then restarting the camera before the axe falls. The two pieces of film were then trimmed and cemented together so that the action appeared continuous when the film was shown, thus creating an overall illusion and successfully laying the foundation for special effects.

This film was among those exported to Europe with the first Kinetoscope machines in 1895 and was seen by Georges Méliès, who was putting on magic shows in his Theatre Robert-Houdin in Paris at the time. He took up filmmaking in 1896, and after making imitations of other films from Edison, Lumière, and Robert Paul, he made ''Escamotage d'un dame chez Robert-Houdin ([[The Vanishing Lady]])''. This film shows a woman being made to vanish by using the same [[stop motion]] technique as the earlier Edison film. After this, Georges Méliès made many single shot films using this trick over the next couple of years.

===Double exposure===
[[File:SantaW1.gif|thumb|left|A scene inset inside a circular vignette showing a "dream vision" in ''Santa Claus'' (1898).]]

The other basic technique for trick cinematography involves [[Multiple exposure|double exposure]] of the film in the camera, which was first done by [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]] in July 1898 in the UK. Smith's ''[[The Corsican Brothers]]'' (1898) was described in the catalogue of the [[Warwick Trading Company]], which took up the distribution of Smith's films in 1900, thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"One of the twin brothers returns home from shooting in the Corsican mountains, and is visited by the ghost of the other twin. By extremely careful photography the ghost appears *quite transparent*. After indicating that he has been killed by a sword-thrust, and appealing for vengeance, he disappears. A 'vision' then appears showing the fatal duel in the snow. To the Corsican's amazement, the duel and death of his brother are vividly depicted in the vision, and overcome by his feelings, he falls to the floor just as his mother enters the room."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ghost effect was done by draping the set in black velvet after the main action had been shot, and then re-exposing the negative with the actor playing the ghost going through the actions at the appropriate point. Likewise, the vision, which appeared within a circular vignette or [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte]], was similarly superimposed over a black area in the backdrop to the scene, rather than over a part of the set with detail in it, so that nothing appeared through the image, which seemed quite solid. Smith used this technique again in ''[[Santa Claus (1898 film)|Santa Claus]]'' (1898).

[[Georges Méliès]] first used superimposition on a dark background in ''La Caverne maudite (The Cave of the Demons)'' made a couple of months later in 1898, and elaborated it with multiple superimpositions in the one shot in ''[[Un Homme de têtes]] ([[The Four Troublesome Heads]])''. He created further variations in subsequent films.

Motion picture images are presented to an audience at a constant speed. In the theater it is 24 [[frames per second]], in [[NTSC]] (US) Television it is 30 frames per second (29.97 to be exact), in [[PAL]] (Europe) television it is 25 frames per second. This speed of presentation does not vary.

However, by varying the speed at which the image is captured, various effects can be created knowing that the faster or slower recorded image will be played at a constant speed. Giving the cinematographer even more freedom for creativity and expression to be made.

For instance, [[time-lapse photography]] is created by exposing an image at an extremely slow rate. If a cinematographer sets a camera to expose one frame every minute for four hours, and then that footage is projected at 24 frames per second, a four-hour event will take 10 seconds to present, and one can present the events of a whole day (24 hours) in just one minute.

The inverse of this, if an image is captured at speeds above that at which they will be presented, the effect is to greatly slow down ([[slow motion]]) the image. If a cinematographer shoots a person diving into a pool at 96 frames per second, and that image is played back at 24 frames per second, the presentation will take 4 times as long as the actual event. Extreme slow motion, capturing many thousands of frames per second can present things normally invisible to the [[human eye]], such as bullets in flight and shockwaves travelling through media, a potentially powerful cinematographical technique.

In motion pictures, the manipulation of time and space is a considerable contributing factor to the narrative storytelling tools. Film editing plays a much stronger role in this manipulation, but frame rate selection in the photography of the original action is also a contributing factor to altering time. For example, [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[Modern Times (film)#Production|Modern Times]]'' was shot at "silent speed" (18 fps) but projected at "sound speed" (24 fps), which makes the slapstick action appear even more frenetic.

[[Speed ramping]], or simply "ramping", is a process whereby the capture frame rate of the camera changes over time. For example, if in the course of 10 seconds of capture, the capture frame rate is adjusted from 60 frames per second to 24 frames per second, when played back at the standard movie rate of 24 frames per second, a unique time-manipulation effect is achieved. For example, someone pushing a door open and walking out into the street would appear to start off in [[slow-motion]], but in a few seconds later within the same shot, the person would appear to walk in "realtime" (normal speed). The opposite speed-ramping is done in ''[[The Matrix]]'' when Neo re-enters the Matrix for the first time to see the Oracle. As he comes out of the warehouse "load-point", the camera zooms into Neo at normal speed but as it gets closer to Neo's face, time seems to slow down, [[foreshadowing]] the manipulation of time itself within the Matrix later in the movie.

===Other special techniques===
G. A. Smith initiated the technique of [[reverse motion]] and also improved the quality of self-motivating images. This he did by repeating the action a second time while filming it with an inverted camera and then joining the tail of the second negative to that of the first. The first films using this were ''Tipsy, Topsy, Turvy'' and ''The Awkward Sign Painter'', the latter which showed a sign painter lettering a sign, and then the painting on the sign vanishing under the painter's brush. The earliest surviving example of this technique is Smith's ''The House That Jack Built'', made before September 1901. Here, a small boy is shown knocking down a castle just constructed by a little girl out of children's building blocks. A title then appears, saying "Reversed", and the action is repeated in reverse so that the castle re-erects itself under his blows.

Cecil Hepworth improved upon this technique by printing the negative of the forwards motion backwards frame by frame, so that in the production of the print the original action was exactly reversed. Hepworth made ''The Bathers'' in 1900, in which bathers who have undressed and jumped into the water appear to spring backwards out of it, and have their clothes magically fly back onto their bodies.

The use of different camera speeds also appeared around 1900. Robert Paul's ''On a Runaway Motor Car through Piccadilly Circus'' (1899), had the camera turn so slowly that when the film was projected at the usual 16 frames per second, the scenery appeared to be passing at great speed. Cecil Hepworth used the opposite effect in ''The Indian Chief and the [[Seidlitz powder]]'' (1901), in which a naïve [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Red Indian]] eats a lot of the fizzy stomach medicine, causing his stomach to expand and then he then leaps around balloon-like.  This was done by cranking the camera faster than the normal 16 frames per second giving the first "[[slow motion]]" effect.

== Personnel ==
[[File:FMPU camera crew 1944.jpg|thumb|A camera crew from the [[First Motion Picture Unit]]]]
In descending order of seniority, the following staff is involved:

* '''Director of photography''' also called '''[[cinematographer]]'''
* '''Camera operator''' also called '''[[cameraman]]'''
* '''First assistant camera''' also called '''[[focus puller]]'''
* '''Second assistant camera ''' also called '''[[clapper loader]]'''

In the film industry, the '''[[cinematographer]]''' is responsible for the technical aspects of the images (lighting, lens choices, composition, exposure, filtration, film selection), but works closely with the director to ensure that the artistic [[aesthetic]]s are supporting the director's vision of the story being told. The cinematographers are the heads of the camera, [[Grip (job)|grip]] and [[Lighting technician|lighting crew]] on a set, and for this reason, they are often called '''directors of photography''' or '''DPs'''. The ASC defines cinematography as a creative and interpretive process that culminates in the authorship of an original work of art rather than the simple recording of a physical event. Cinematography is not a subcategory of photography. Rather, photography is but one craft that the cinematographer uses in addition to other physical, organizational, managerial, interpretive. and image-manipulating techniques to effect one coherent process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In British tradition, if the DOP actually operates the camera him/herself they are called the ''cinematographer''. On smaller productions, it is common for one person to perform all these functions alone. The career progression usually involves climbing up the ladder from seconding, firsting, eventually to operating the camera.

Directors of photography make many creative and interpretive decisions during the course of their work, from pre-production to post-production, all of which affect the overall feel and look of the motion picture. Many of these decisions are similar to what a photographer needs to note when taking a picture: the cinematographer controls the film choice itself (from a range of available stocks with varying sensitivities to light and color), the selection of lens focal lengths, aperture [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] and focus. Cinematography, however, has a temporal aspect (see [[persistence of vision]]), unlike still photography, which is purely a single still image. It is also bulkier and more strenuous to deal with movie cameras, and it involves a more complex array of choices. As such a cinematographer often needs to work co-operatively with more people than does a photographer, who could frequently function as a single person. As a result, the cinematographer's job also includes personnel management and logistical organization. Given the in-depth knowledge. a cinematographer requires not only of his or her own craft but also that of other personnel, formal tuition in analogue or digital filmmaking can be advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyfa.edu/digital-filmmaking/|title=New York Film Academy – Filmmaking|work=nyfa.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10582">The '''classical unities''', '''Aristotelian unities''', or '''three unities''' are rules for [[drama]] derived from a passage in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. In their [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] form they are as follows:

#''unity of action'': a play should have one action that it follows, with minimal subplots.
#''unity of time'': the action in a play should occur over a period of no more than 24 hours.
#''unity of place'': a play should exist in a single physical space and should not attempt to compress geography, nor should the stage represent more than one place.

==Aristotle's unities==
Aristotle dealt with the unity of action in some detail, under the general subject of "definition of tragedy", where he wrote: "serious, complete in itself and of a certain magnitude". 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, according to our definition, Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is complete, and whole, and of a certain magnitude&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ari/poe/poe08.htm Aristotle's ''Poetics'', VII].&lt;/ref&gt; … As therefore, in the other imitative arts, the imitation is one when the object imitated is one, so the plot, being an imitation of an action, must imitate one action and that a whole, the structural union of the parts being such that, if any one of them is displaced or removed, the whole will be disjointed and disturbed. For a thing whose presence or absence makes no visible difference, is not an organic part of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ari/poe/poe09.htm Aristotle's ''Poetics'', VIII].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His only reference to the time in the fictive world is in a distinction between the [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[tragedy|tragic]] forms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Epic poetry agrees with Tragedy in so far as it is an imitation in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] of characters of a higher type. They differ, in that Epic poetry admits but one kind of metre, and is narrative in form. They differ, again, in their length: for Tragedy endeavours, as far as possible, to confine itself to a single revolution of the sun, or but slightly to exceed this limit; whereas the Epic action has no limits of time.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle's ''Poetics'', V.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike his prescriptive attitude regarding the plot (unity of action), Aristotle here merely remarks on the typical duration of a tragedy's action, and does not suggest any kind of imperative that it always ought to be so. He was writing after the golden age of [[Greek drama]], and many [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] playwrights wrote plays that do not fit within these conventions.

Aristotle does not actually mention the neoclassical unity of place at all. However, the prevalent interpretation of his ''Poetics'' during the Middle Ages inclined toward interpreting his comment on time as another "unity".

==European literature==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
[[Italy|Italian]] critics of the 16th century, from [[Lodovico Castelvetro]] onwards, and then [[French literature of the 17th century|17th-century French]] critics, proponents of the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] movement, both expanded Aristotle's descriptions. The result was to make them into prescriptions for structuring plays.  French drama of the 17th century, particularly that of [[Molière]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]], was highly regular, and [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]] incurred harsh criticism for departing from the unities in ''[[Le Cid]]''. The [[England|English]] dramatists writing for the [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan and Jacobean stage]] were largely unaware of these structures.

By the later 17th century, however, English dramatists (under the influence of French criticism picked up by those in exile during the [[English Interregnum]]) did begin to assess their own plays according to these rules. Thus, [[John Dryden]], among many others, compares the "irregular" [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] (only two of Shakespeare's plays conform to the unities – ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' and ''[[The Tempest]]'') with the "regular" [[Dryden]] in his ''[[Essay of Dramatick Poesie]]'' (1668), and makes use of the unity of time in this passage criticizing [[Shakespearean histories|Shakespeare's history plays]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;... if you consider the Historical Playes of Shakespeare, they are rather so many Chronicles of Kings, or the business many times of thirty or forty years, crampt into a representation of two hours and a half, which is not to imitate or paint Nature, but rather to draw her in miniature, to take her in little; to look upon her through the wrong end of a Perspective, and receive her Images not onely much less, but infinitely more imperfect then the life: this instead of making a Play delightful, renders it ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, ''An Essay of Dramatick Poesie'' (1668), para. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Dryden declared Shakespeare "incomparable" because of his disregard for convention:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... in most of the irregular Playes of Shakespeare or [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]] (for Ben Johnson's are for the most part regular) there is a more masculine fancy and greater spirit in all the writing, then[sic] there is in any of the French.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, ''An Essay of Dramatick Poesie'' (1668), para. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Alexander Pope]] criticizes the violation of the unities in his ''[[Dunciad]]''.  In the 1728 version of the poem, the goddess Dulness notes that "Time himself stands still at her command,/ Realms shift their place, and Ocean turns to land" (''Dunciad'' 1728, i, 69&amp;ndash;70).  Additionally, he notes a violation of unity of action, as tragedy and comedy were mixed.

[[Samuel Johnson]], too, applied the unities to drama in his ''Prefaces to Shakespeare''. He was well aware that Aristotle had only recommended the unity of action, and knew that rules must serve drama, not vice versa:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whether Shakespeare knew the unities, and rejected them by design, or deviated from them by happy ignorance, it is, I think, impossible to decide, and useless to inquire. We may reasonably suppose, that, when he rose to notice, he did not want the counsels and admonitions of scholars and critics, and that he at last deliberately persisted in a practice, which he might have begun by chance. As nothing is essential to the fable, but unity of action, and as the unities of time and place arise evidently from false assumptions, and, by circumscribing the extent of the drama, lessen its variety, I cannot think it much to be lamented, that they were not known by him, or not observed: Nor, if such another poet could arise, should I very vehemently reproach him, that his first act passed at Venice, and his next in Cyprus. Such violations of rules merely positive, become the comprehensive genius of Shakespeare…&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''Preface to his Edition of Shakespeare's Plays (1765),'' ff. a7r&amp;ndash;a7v, para. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Pitcher]], in his [[Arden Shakespeare]] Third Series edition of ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' (2010), argues that Shakespeare was familiar with the unities due to an English translation of ''Poetics'' that became popular around 1608, and that &lt;i&gt;The Winter's Tale&lt;/i&gt; is intentionally breaking all the rules.

The classical unities were influential in dramatic criticism until [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'' (1830); one of the things that made that play controversial at its debut was its violation of these rules of [[classicism]]. In the Spanish theatrical tradition, there is [[Lope de Vega]]'s ''Arte nuevo de hacer comedias'' of 1609, which is a defense of the new form for writing and representation of [[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]] Spanish theatre. Lope's ''Arte nuevo'' is a 389 verse poem which explicitly defends his and other dramaturges, distancing from Aristotelian unities of theatre.

A '''clown''' is a comic [[performer]] who employs [[slapstick]] or similar types of [[physical comedy]], often in a [[mime artist|mime]] style.

== History ==
[[File:1954 Episode of the TV series "Super Circus".ogg|thumb|left|Video of a 1954 episode of the ''[[Super Circus]]'' show.]]

Clowns have a varied tradition with significant variations in costume and performance. The most recognisable modern clown character is the ''[[Circus clown#The auguste|Auguste]]'' or "red clown" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, [[exaggerated]] footwear, and colourful clothing. Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Modern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the [[circus clown]], which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or ''Varieté'' shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.

Many circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right. The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]] in the [[harlequinade]] that formed part of British [[pantomime]]s, notably at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and the [[Sadler's Wells]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as "Joey", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.

The [[comedy]] that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary—and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The "fear of clowns," circus clowns in particular as a psychiatric condition has become known by the term [[coulrophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Crosswell |first=Julia |contribution=clown |title=Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |edition={{subscription}} online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t292.e1047 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin ===
The "''clown''" character developed out of the [[zanni]] "''rustic fool''" characters of the early modern [[commedia dell'arte]], which were themselves directly based on the "''rustic fool''" characters of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]].
Rustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as '' sklêro-paiktês'' (from ''paizein'' "to play (like a child)") or ''deikeliktas'', besides other generic terms for "rustic" or "peasant". In Roman theater, a term for clown was ''fossor'', literally "digger; labourer".

The English word ''[[:wikt:clown|clown]]'' was first recorded c. 1560 (as ''clowne,  cloyne'') in the generic meaning  "rustic, boor, peasant". 
The origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with ''clumsy''.&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic ''klunni'', Swedish ''kluns'' "clumsy, boorish person";  c.f. North Frisian  ''klönne'' and "kluns", also meaning "clumsy person". An alternative proposal derives ''clown'' from Latin ''colonus'' "colonist, farmer".
The verb ''to clown''  "to play the clown onstage" is from about 1600. {{cite web|title=Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=clown&amp;searchmode=none|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is in this sense that "Clown" is used as the name of [[Shakespearean fool|fool characters]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.
The sense of ''clown'' as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on [[Elizabethan theater|Elizabethan]] "rustic fool" characters such as Shakespeare's.

The [[harlequinade]] developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by the commedia dell'arte. It was here that "Clown" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for [[Harlequin]]'s slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants' garb.

The now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by [[Joseph Grimaldi]], who played Clown in [[Charles Dibdin the younger|Charles Dibdin's]] 1800 pantomime ''Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.&lt;ref name=Neville6&gt;Neville, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkins&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 95–100&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern circus clown ===
{{main article|Circus clown}}
The [[circus clown]] developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from [[Philip Astley]]'s London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian [[George L. Fox (clown)|George L. Fox]] became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.
[[Tom Belling]] senior (1843–1900) developed the "red clown" or "Auguste" (''Dummer August'') character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated "white clown". Belling worked for [[Circus Renz]] in Vienna. Belling's costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children's clown, based on a lower class or "hobo" character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s 1892 opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' ("Clowns").
Belling's ''Auguste'' character was further popularized by [[Nicolai Poliakoff]]'s ''Coco'' in the 1920s to 1930s.

The English word ''clown'' was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, into many other languages, such as French ''clown'', Russian (and other Slavic languages) кло́ун, Greek κλόουν, Danish/Norwegian ''klovn'', Romanian ''clovn'' etc.

Italian retains ''Pagliaccio'', a Commedia dell'arte [[zanni]] character,&lt;ref&gt;From ''paglia'', the word for "straw" (after the straw costume of the rustic buffoon character), or from ''bajaccio'' "mocker, scoffer".&lt;/ref&gt; and derivations of the Italian term are found in other Romance languages, such as French ''Paillasse'', Spanish ''payaso'', Catalan/Galician ''pallasso'', Portuguese ''palhaço'', Greek παλιάτσος, Turkish ''palyaço'',   German ''Pajass'' (via French),&lt;ref&gt;Dialectal [https://digital.idiotikon.ch/idtkn/id4.htm#!page/41099/mode/1up Bajass] in ''[[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Yiddish פּאַיאַץ  (''payats''), Russian пая́ц.

=== History in 20th-century North America ===
In the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the [[tramp]] or [[hobo]]. Examples include [[Marceline Orbes]], who performed at the [[New York Hippodrome|Hippodrome Theater]](1905), [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Tramp]]'' (1914), and [[Emmett Kelly]]'s ''Weary Willie'' based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by [[Otto Griebling]] during the 1930s to 1950s. [[Red Skelton]]'s Dodo the Clown in ''[[The Clown (1953 film)|The Clown]]'' (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, "a funny man with a drinking problem".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the United States, [[Bozo the Clown]] was an influential ''Auguste'' character since the late 1950s. ''[[The Bozo Show]]'' premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. [[McDonald's]] derived its mascot clown, [[Ronald McDonald]], from the ''Bozo'' character in the 1960s. [[Willard Scott]], who had played ''Bozo'' during 1959–1962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald's trademark application for the character dates to 1967.

Based on the ''Bozo'' template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children's parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (''Bozo''-derived) clown character with children's entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to "[[Clown Care]]" or "hospital clowning" in children's hospitals by the mid 1980s. [[Clowns of America International]] (established 1984) and [[World Clown Association]] (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.

The shift of the ''Auguste'' or "red clown" character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a ''Bozo''-derived standalone character in children's entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the [[evil clown]] character, the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature.&lt;ref&gt;A study by the [[University of Sheffield]] concluded "that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable."{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7189401.stm |title=Health &amp;#124; Hospital clown images 'too scary' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2011-07-05 }} {{cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-01-16|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7191721.stm|title=Why are clowns scary?|first=Finlo|last=Rohrer}}. The natural dislike of clowns makes them effective in eliciting laughter by releasing tension in acting clumsy or rendering themselves helpless.{{cite journal| last=Durwin| first=Joseph| title=Coulrophobia and the Trickster| journal=Trickster's Way| volume=3| issue=1| publisher=Trinity University| location=San Antonio| date=15 November 2004| url=http://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=trickstersway&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.co.uk%2Fscholar%3Fstart%3D20%26q%3Devil%2Bclown%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0%2C5| issn=1538-9030| accessdate=2 January 2013}}{{cite web |url=http://www.trinity.edu/org/tricksters/trixway/current/Vol%203/Vol3_1/Durwin.htm |title=Trinity.edu |publisher=Trinity.edu|accessdate=2011-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624001158/http://www.trinity.edu/org/tricksters/trixway/current/Vol%203/Vol3_1/Durwin.htm |archivedate=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further information|Circus clown}}

=== Pierrot and Harlequin ===
:''See [[Harlequinade]]''
The classical pairing of the White Clown with Auguste in modern tradition
has a precedent in the pairing of [[Pierrot]] and [[Harlequin]] in the [[Commedia dell'arte]].
Originally, Harlequin's role was that of a light-hearted, nimble and astute servant, paired with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.

In the 18th-century English [[Harlequinade]], Harlequin was now paired with Clown.
As developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.

=== White clown and Auguste ===
{{anchor|Auguste}}
[[File:LES ROSSYANN Weisscloun und dummer August.JPG|thumb|left|Les Rossyann. ''White clown'' and clumsy ''Auguste'' from France.]]

The ''white clown'', or ''clown blanc'' from the original French, is a sophisticated character, as opposed to the clumsy auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter, Joel () [https://books.google.com/books?id=avG5rDz3ENUC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139 ''Popular Theatre: A Sourcebook''] p.139&lt;/ref&gt; They are also distinguished as the "sad clown" (blanc) and "happy clown" (auguste).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Danièle |last1=Berton |first2=Jean-Pierre |last2=Simard |year=2007 |title=Création théâtrale: Adaptation, schèmes, traduction |language=French}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=q7FLWMA8MiAC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330 p.330]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or in a costume that does not fit — either oversize or too small is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.

The auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the auguste character to perform his bidding. The auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.

The ''contra-auguste'' plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.

=== Whiteface makeup ===
{{anchor|Whiteface}}
There are two major types of clowns with "whiteface" makeup:
The classic "white clown" is derived from the [[Pierrot]] character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque ''Auguste'' types. [[Francesco Caroli]] and [[Glen Little (clown)|Glenn "Frosty" Little]] are examples of this type.  The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the ''[[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]]'' type, known as "Comedy" or "Grotesque Whiteface". This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. 
In the comedic partnership of [[Abbott and Costello]], Bud Abbot would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Tiffany McCoy, [http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html Clown Types] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026152528/http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html |date=2015-10-26 }} (2010), citing ''Strutter's Complete Guide to Clown Makeup'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the whiteface clown uses "clown white" makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118 /&gt; In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.

Whiteface makeup was originally designed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

America's first great whiteface clown was stage star [[George L. Fox (clown)|George "G.L." Fox]]. Following English [[Joseph Grimaldi]], Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the land in the first half of the 19th century in America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/var1993000449/PP/ "G.L. Fox the original Humpty Dumpty"], Library of Congress (online), accessed 24 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Character clown ===
The character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or [[hobo]]. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps [[Otto Griebling]] and [[Emmett Kelly]]. [[Red Skelton]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] would all fit the definition of a character clown.

The character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.

==== North American ====
The most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the ''hobo'', ''tramp'' or ''bum'' clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. According to American circus expert [[Hovey Burgess]], they are :
* The Hobo: Migratory and finds work where he travels. Down on his luck but maintains a positive [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]].
* The Tramp: Migratory and does not work where he travels. Down on his [[luck]] and depressed about his situation.
* The Bum: Non-migratory and non-working.

== Clown organizations ==
=== Clowns International ===
Clowns International claims to be the oldest clown society in the world. It was set up in 1946. Apart from being a membership organisation, Clowns International has set up a museum of clown memorabilia and a register of clown make-up. The latter also has a collection of full eggshells decorated as replicas of the specific clown's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egg Gallery|url=http://www.clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|accessdate=June 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907170445/http://clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|archivedate=September 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Clown Association ===
{{main article|World Clown Association}}
The World Clown Association (WCA) is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.

=== Clowns of America International ===
{{main article|Clowns of America International}}
Clowns of America International, Inc. (COAI) is a Minnesota-based nonprofit clown arts membership organization which aims "to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns".

== Clowning terminology ==

=== Other roles and skills ===
In the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as [[tightrope]], [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], [[MC|Master of Ceremonies]], or ride an animal. Clowns may also "sit in" with the [[orchestra]]. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.

=== Frameworks ===
'''Frameworks''' are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act.&lt;ref name="simplycircus.com"&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=March 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202950/http://simplycircus.com/circus_dictionary/clowning_framework|url=http://www.simplycircus.com/Circus_Dictionary/Clowning_Framework|website=simplycircus.com|title=Clowning Framework}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.

'''Shows''' are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entrées, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.

=== Gags, bits and business ===
* '''Business''' — the individual motions the clown uses, often used to express the clown's character.
* '''Gag''' — very short piece of clown comedy that, when repeated within a "bit" or "routine," may become a ''running gag''. Gags are, loosely, the jokes clowns play on each other. A gag may have a beginning, a middle, and an end — or may not. Gags can also refer to the prop stunts/tricks or the stunts that clowns use, such as a squirting flower.
* '''Bit''' — the clown's sketch or routine, made up of one or more "gags" either worked out and timed before going on stage, or impromptu bits composed of familiar improvisational material.

=== Menu ===
* '''Entrée''' — clowning acts lasting 5–10 minutes. Typically made up of various gags and bits, usually within a clowning framework. Entrées almost always end with a "blow-off" — the comedic ending of a show segment, "bit," "gag," "stunt," or "routine."
* '''Side dish''' — shorter feature act. Side dishes are essentially shorter versions of the "entrée," typically lasting 1–3 minutes. Typically made up of various "gags" and "bits," side dishes are usually within a clowning framework. Side dishes almost always end with a "blow-off."

=== Interludes ===
"Clown Stops" or "interludes" are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few ''gags'' or several ''bits''. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called "reprises" or "run-ins" by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of "business" usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a [[tightrope walker]] the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the ''artiste'' by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.

=== Prop stunts ===
Among the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the "[[Clown car|too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car]]" stunt; doing just about anything with a [[rubber chicken]], tripping over one's own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or "[[Clown bicycle|clown bikes]]". Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.

In anthropology, the term "clown" has been extended to comparable jester or fool characters in non-Western cultures. A society in which such "clowns" have an important position are termed "[[clown society|clown societies]]", and a "clown" character involved in a religious or ritual capacity is known as a "[[ritual clown]]".

The most ancient "clowns"  have been found in the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt]], around 2400 BC.&lt;ref name="Bala2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bala |first=Michael |date=Winter 2010 |jstor=10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |title=The Clown: An Archetypal Self-Journey |journal=[[Jung Journal: Culture &amp; Psyche]] |volume=4 |issue=1 | pages=50–71 |quote=The one who swallows the largest amount of filth with the greatest gusto is most commended by the fraternity and onlookers. |doi=10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In Native American mythology, the [[Trickster]] channels the spirit of the Coyote and becomes a sacred Clown character.  A [[Heyoka]] is an individual in Native cultures who lives outside the constraints of normal cultural roles.  The Heyoka plays the role of a backwards clown, doing everything in reverse.  The Heyoka role is sometimes best filled by a [[Winkte]].

Many native tribes have a history of clowning.
The [[Canadian Clowning]] method developed by [[Richard Pochinko]] and furthered by his former apprentice, [[Sue Morrison]], combines European and Native American clowning techniques.

In this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator's eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the [[medicine wheel]]. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology that explores their personal experiences.

A '''comedy''' is entertainment consisting of jokes intended to make an audience laugh.&lt;ref name = OED/&gt; For ancient Greeks and Romans a comedy was a stage-play with a happy ending. In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings and a lighter tone. In this sense [[Dante]] used the term in the title of his poem, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Divina Commedia'').

The phenomena connected with laughter and that which provokes it has been carefully investigated by psychologists and  agreed upon the predominating [[:wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s are incongruity or contrast in the object, and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus [[Thomas Hobbes]] speaks of laughter as a "sudden glory." Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the "play instinct" and its emotional expression.

Much comedy contains variations on the elements of surprise, incongruity, conflict, repetitiveness, and the effect of [[irony|opposite expectations]], but there are many recognized genres of comedy. [[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use ironic comedy used to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of humor.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[Parody]] borrows the form of some popular genre, [[Work of art|artwork]], or [[Written language|text]] but uses certain [[irony|ironic]] changes to critique that form from within (though not necessarily in a condemning way). [[Screwball comedy]] derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters. [[Black comedy]] is defined by dark humor that makes light of so-called dark or [[evil]] elements in human nature. Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], [[sexual humor]], and [[race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comedic ways.

A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms, and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.

== Etymology ==
The word "comedy" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] '''''κωμῳδία''''', which is a compound either of ''[[komos|κῶμος]]'' (revel) or ''κώμη'' (village) and ''ᾠδή'' (singing): it is possible that ''κῶμος'' itself is derived from ''κώμη'', and originally meant a village revel. The adjective "comic" (Greek κωμικός), which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of "laughter-provoking".&lt;ref name="Francis MacDonald Cornford 1934"&gt;Francis MacDonald Cornford, The Origin of Attic Comedy, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia ''and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.&lt;ref name = OED&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient [[Greece]], comedy seems to have originated in songs or recitations apropos of fertility festivals or gatherings, or also in making fun at other people or stereotypes. In the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] states that [[comedy]] originated in phallic rituals and festivals of mirth. It is basically an imitation of 'the ridiculous, which is a species of the ugly.' However, [[Aristotle]] taught that comedy is a good thing. It brings forth happiness, which for [[Aristotle]] is the ideal state, the final goal in any activity. He does believe that we humans feel pleasure oftentimes by doing the wrong thing, but he does not necessarily believe that comedy and humor is the wrong thing. It is also not true for [[Aristotle]] that a comedy must involve sexual humor to qualify as a comedy. A comedy is about the fortunate arise of a sympathetic character. A happy ending is all that is required in his opinion. 

On the contrary, the Greek Philosopher [[Plato]] taught that [[comedy]] is a destruction to the self. He believed it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In [[The Republic (Plato)]], he says that the Guardians of the state should avoid laughter, "for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction." Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.

Northrop Frye described the comic [[genre]] as a drama that pits two societies against each other in an amusing [[agon]] or conflict. He depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old", ''The Anatomy of Criticism''. 1957, but this [[dichotomy]] is seldom described as an entirely satisfactory explanation.  A later view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes; in this sense, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse to ruses which engender very dramatic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15076">A '''dialect coach''' is an acting [[coaching|coach]] who helps an actor design the voice and speech of a character in the context of an on-camera (film, television or commercial), stage (theatre, musical theatre, opera, etc.), radio or animation [[voiceover]] production. The dialect coach often does original research on dialects and speech patterns, prepares training materials, provides instruction and works on lines with the actor. A dialect coach will give the actor feedback focusing on issues of credibility, consistency, and clarity. A dialect coach may also be employed to help comedians hone impressions of celebrities, to train non-actor public speakers in vocal character and delivery, or to help singers improve in diction and attain a balance between tone and articulation, especially when singing in a second language.

==Terminology==

The term ''dialect coach'' persists as the primary designation for an accent or language coach in the US and Canadian entertainment businesses. However, other designations may also be used. Some dialect coaches will refer to themselves as ''dialogue coaches'' (or, occasionally, by the historical designation, ''dialogue directors''), especially when working on a second language or when offering acting coaching on straight dialogue in the performer's own language or dialect.

In the [[opera]] world, coaches who help opera singers with articulation of lyrics (often in an unfamiliar language, such as Russian, German or Czech) are called ''diction coaches.'' In the United Kingdom, dialect coaches are generally called ''accent coaches'' and are not [[acting coach]]es.

The term ''[[vocal coach|voice coach]]'' is applied to those who work with breathing, voice and text in the theatre in the UK, though this usage is not common in the US film and television businesses where the term "voice coach" would generally be understood to refer to a singing coach (a.k.a., a ''[[vocal coach]]'').

Likewise, on US stage productions the term ''voice coach'' is also avoided to prevent confusion with either a vocal (singing) coach or someone who coaches actors in techniques for inducing a state of heightened relaxation prior to a rehearsal or performance, and who may offer guidance on breath support or vocal practices intended to promote effective placement of resonances in the upper body, the actor's availability of expression and appropriate projection.&lt;ref name="Fitzmaurice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodenburg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linklater" /&gt;

==Activities==
In some cases, voice warm-up coaching integrates full-body work in [[yoga]], movement or balance. Many actors believe that such warm-ups and exercises reduce the likelihood of vocal damage, most especially during expression of high intensity emotion outdoors or in a large performing venue in the absence of electronic amplification (e.g., microphones and a PA system).&lt;ref name="claims" /&gt; A dialect coach may also be engaged to coach voice issues in this latter sense in conjunction with theatrical dialect coaching. Not every dialect coach has the training and knowledge to also do vocal coaching in a singing sense.

==Hiring and management==

===On-camera productions===
On a film or television production, dialect coaches are typically hired by the [[line producer]] during pre-production to begin preparing cast far in advance of the first day of [[principal photography]]. If engaged during principal photography, it is the [[unit production manager]], [[production manager]], [[production supervisor]], [[production coordinator]] or, in some cases, [[executive producer]] who is likely to interview prospective coaches in behalf of the production. If engaged only during post-production, the coach may even be hired directly by the post producer. In advance of being hired, coaches may be interviewed by the [[showrunner]] or a staff writer in the case of episodic television or by the [[film director]] in the case of a feature film. Dialect coaches may work with any members of the cast, but are brought in especially often to work with celebrity actors who have been cast in roles which require accents other than their own or even the performance of dialogue in languages unknown to the actors. Therefore, frequently, the actors themselves will ask Production to hire a particular coach. 

However the coach comes to be hired, the creatives will often consult with the dialect coach early in the process in order to acquaint the dialect coach with the overall creative vision and to start the actor as early as possible to allow time for the character's voice to become fully integrated by the actor prior to the actor's first shoot day. Once hired, the coach will typically prepare actors over a number of sessions either remotely, on set, at the Production Office or in the actor's own home. Coaches who work in serialized television are expected to be especially flexible as there may be no opportunity for a meeting between the episode director and coach, as shooting scripts may not be finalized until very close to the day of the shoot and as last-minute casting decisions and limitations on actor-availability may make it difficult to schedule advance coaching.

During production, the [[key second assistant director]] typically schedules coaching sessions. Many creatives will ask that the coach be present at read-throughs or story conferences, at production meetings (if serving as key coach) and during at least some first-team rehearsals. While a shot is set-up, the coach will be kept in close proximity to the actors to be coached. Often, the coach will be assigned a dressing room, or, on location, a room in the honeywagon, double-banger or triple-banger near the actors' trailers. On set, the dialect coach will be issued a wireless headset and given a chair (exclusive, if on set regularly) in video village in order to facilitate access to the director and to the script supervisor who may be asked by the coach to relay notes on pronunciation and clarity, particularly if the dialogue is in dialect or language unfamiliar to the post-production team. An on-set coach may also work with an actor between takes if needed, especially on last minute changes to the script. Later, the coach may be brought back for dubbing or to pick up new lines during the post-production process, sometimes via a feed from a remote studio when the actors are no-longer available in person.&lt;ref name="Blaise" /&gt;

===Stage productions===
On a stage production, dialect coaches are typically brought in by a director or artistic director with contractual terms negotiated by a producer or general manager. Coaches work closely with the production stage manager who coordinates meetings with the director and coaching sessions for the cast collectively or individually. The coach will often also be present to give notes to the actors at some rehearsals, partial runs and full runs. Coaching typically takes place throughout the rehearsal process, but especially before the actors begin memorizing their lines and again after the show is loaded into the performance space. Understudies may be coached alongside the principal performers or after the show goes into previews. Coaching may continue in a limited way during a run.

==Status and compensation==
In the film and television businesses, dialect coaches are very well paid. Coaches are customarily given on-screen credits for their work on films and for substantial contributions to serialized television. The wording of the credit may vary with the specific requirements of the production. On some shows, dialect coaches may be asked to contribute intellectual property to the production in the form of, for instance, dialogue polishing in English or other languages. They may serve as technical consultants in the areas of culture and written language. They often guide, or engage with, the cast's process of creating a character and consult on the overall vocal design for the production. Consequently, the deal memos for coaches may include compensation terms that are not typical for crew positions, leading to the adage that dialect coaches are neither [[above the line (filmmaking)|above-the-line]] nor [[below the line (filmmaking)|below-the-line]], but on-the-line.

In the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, the UK and the US, dialect coaches remain among a very small minority of production staff who are not unionized; their deals may differ in substance from production to production in these jurisdictions. In Australia and New Zealand, dialect coaches who are employed on a film or theatre set are covered under the [[Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance]]. On English-language Canadian film and television productions, dialect coaches are unionized under the [[Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists]]. Coaches are not unionized under the [[Union des artistes]] for French-language productions in Canada.

In the theater, coaches who help actors hone dialects or character voices typically seek compensation on a par with designers and may be credited as dialect coaches, dialect designers or voice and speech directors. Dialect coaches are not unionized for live performances in Canada, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, the UK or the US. 

There is no membership branch of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] that incorporates dialect coaching, nor is there a peer group of the [[Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] that accords active membership status to coaches.

==Cost-cutting for low-budget productions==
Due to budget constraints, producers of student films and stage plays, showcase theater and slimly financed independent films and web series may avoid hiring a dialect coach, and instead substitute the services of a low-paid or volunteer native speaker model in hopes that the actors will be able to learn mimetically, retain the accent and act in it without expert guidance or monitoring. In some such cases, cast members may themselves pay a coach, sometimes in consultation with the director, though employing crew is not normally regarded as a cast member’s responsibility. In other cases, actors may attempt to self-study the dialect using commercially available training materials or web-based voice archives&lt;ref name="IDEA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VADA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCVoices" /&gt; which host native-speaker recordings of oral histories or interviews or other scripted speech.&lt;ref name="SAA" /&gt; The majority of such archives also provide native-speaker recordings of phonemically balanced narrative passages, especially ''Comma Gets a Cure,''&lt;ref name="Comma" /&gt; which is structured around the [[lexical sets]] of English and other phonological patterns of potential interest to the student of dialect.&lt;ref name="VSR" /&gt;

==Job prospects==
While there are many hundreds of voice and speech trainers connected with drama courses throughout the English-speaking world who may control a stock of ''stage dialects'' for general use, far fewer specialize in dialect coaching. A web search of dialect coaches with [[Internet Movie Database]] listings produces fewer than 100 living film and TV coaches worldwide, the majority showing few recent jobs, credited or uncredited. Most of these dialect coaches work on an ad hoc basis on individual productions. However, in some cases, a coach may become attached to a theatre company as a resident voice and speech director, especially if the coach has a second specialization (esp. [[Shakespeare]] or voice). As with many aspects of the entertainment business, entry into the field of dialect coaching is very competitive. Because dialect coaches are not always called for every day of a shoot, many coaches find a way to supplement income while maintaining their availability for coaching, often by acting, directing (including animation voice directing), teaching in related areas (public speaking, etc.) or taking on private students, especially for auditions.&lt;ref name="Kopf" /&gt; Outside of the entertainment businesses based in English-speaking countries, dialect coaching is less common, and opportunities rarer.

==Professional societies==
Dialect coaches, especially those who teach in theater education programs, may become active in such professional societies as the Australian Voice Association, the British Voice Association, the International Centre for Voice and the Voice and Speech Trainers Association.

{{confuse|Ethnos (disambiguation){{!}}Ethnos}}
[[File:Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly and the statue Ethos.jpg|thumb|A sculpture representing Ethos outside the [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly]] in Canberra, Australia]]
'''Ethos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|θ|ɒ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|iː|θ|oʊ|s}}) is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning "character" that is used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community, nation, or ideology. The Greeks also used this word to refer to the power of music to influence emotions, behaviours, and even morals.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Piero and Taruskin, Richard, "Music in the Western World: A History in Documents" (1984) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Early Greek stories of [[Orpheus]] exhibit this idea in a compelling way. The word's use in [[rhetoric]] is closely based on the Greek terminology used by [[Aristotle]] in his concept of the three artistic proofs or [[modes of persuasion]].

==Etymology and origin==
''Ethos'' ({{lang|grc|ἦθος}}, {{lang|grc|ἔθος}}; ''plurals:'' ''ethe'', {{lang|grc|ἤθη}}; ''ethea'', {{lang|grc|ἤθεα}}) is a Greek word originally meaning "accustomed place" (as in {{lang|grc|ἤθεα ἵππων}} "the habitats of horses", ''[[Iliad]]'' 6.511, 15.268),&lt;ref&gt;Proscurcin Jr., ''Der Begriff Ethos bei Homer.'' (2014) pp. 162–63&lt;/ref&gt; "custom, habit", equivalent to Latin ''[[mores]]''.

''Ethos'' forms the root of ''ethikos'' ({{lang|grc|ἠθικός}}), meaning "moral, showing moral character".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Book 2 (1103a17)&lt;/ref&gt; As an adjective in the neuter plural form ''ta ethika'' ({{lang|grc|τὰ ἠθικά}}), used for the study of morals, it is the origin of the modern English word ''[[ethics]]''.

==Current usage==
In modern usage, ethos denotes the disposition, character, or fundamental values particular to a specific person, people, corporation, culture, or movement. For example, the poet and critic [[T. S. Eliot]] wrote in 1940 that "the general ethos of the people they have to govern  determines the behaviour of politicians".&lt;ref&gt;T. S. Eliot, ''The idea of a Christian society'' (1940) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the historian [[Orlando Figes]] wrote in 1996 that in Soviet Russia of the 1920s "the ethos of the  [[Communist]] party dominated every aspect of public life".&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Figes, ''A people's tragedy: the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], 1891–1924'' (1996) p. 682&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--This statement requires further elaboration to be intelligible: When used in the rhetorical tradition, in addition to what motivates the individual, ethos establishes credibility for the individual among the audience, which is essential in a successful attempt at persuasion.--&gt;
Ethos may change in response to new ideas or forces. For example, according to the Jewish historian Afrie Krampf, ideas of economic modernization which were imported into [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the 1930s brought about "the abandonment of the agrarian ethos and the reception of...the ethos of rapid development".&lt;ref&gt;Afrie Krampf, "Reception of the Developmental Approach in the Jewish Economic Discourse of Mandatory Palestine, 1934–1938," ''Israel Studies,'' Summer 2010, Vol. 15#2, pp. 80–103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==
{{POV-section|date=January 2016}}
In [[rhetoric]], ethos is one of the three artistic proofs (''pistis'', πίστις) or [[modes of persuasion]] (other principles being ''[[logos#Aristotle.27s rhetorical logos|logos]]'' and ''[[pathos]]'') discussed by [[Aristotle]] in '[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]' as a component of argument. Speakers must establish ethos from the start.  This can involve "moral competence" only; Aristotle however broadens the concept to include [[expertise]] and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Ethos Dwells Pervasively'' In: ''The Ethos of Rhetoric.'' (2004) pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woerther, ''L'èthos aristotélicien.'' (2007) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Ethos is limited, in his view, by what the speaker says. Others however contend that a speaker's ethos extends to and is shaped by the overall moral character and history of the speaker—that is, what people think of his or her character before the speech has even begun (cf [[Isocrates]]).

According to [[Aristotle]], there are three categories of ethos:

* ''[[phronesis]]''&amp;nbsp;– useful skills &amp; wisdom
* ''[[Arete (excellence)|arete]]''&amp;nbsp;– virtue, goodwill
* ''[[eunoia]]''&amp;nbsp;– goodwill towards the audience

In a sense, ethos does not belong to the speaker but to the audience. Thus, it is the audience that determines whether a speaker is a high- or a low-ethos speaker. Violations of ethos include:

* The speaker has a direct interest in the outcome of the debate (e.g. a person pleading innocence of a crime);
* The speaker has a vested interest or ulterior motive in the outcome of the debate;
* The speaker has no expertise (e.g. a lawyer giving a speech on space flight is less convincing than an astronaut giving the same speech).

Completely dismissing an argument based on any of the above violations of ethos is an informal fallacy ([[Appeal to motive]]). The argument may indeed be suspect; but is not, in itself, invalid.

===Modern interpretations===
{{Cleanup reorganize|section|date=June 2018}}

For Aristotle, a speaker's ethos was a rhetorical strategy employed by an orator whose purpose was to "inspire trust in his audience" (''Rhetorica'' 1380). ''Ethos'' was therefore achieved through the orator's "good sense, good moral character, and goodwill", and central to Aristotelian virtue ethics was the notion that this "good moral character" was increased in virtuous degree by habit (''Rhetorica'' 1380). Aristotle links virtue, habituation, and ''ethos'' most succinctly in Book II of ''Nichomachean Ethics'': "Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teaching [...] while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit, whence also its name ''ethike'' is one that is formed by a slight variation from the word ''ethos'' (habit)" (952). Discussing women and rhetoric, scholar Karlyn Kohrs Campbell notes that entering the public sphere was considered an act of moral transgression for females of the nineteenth century: "Women who formed moral reform and abolitionist societies, and who made speeches, held conventions, and published newspapers, entered the public sphere and thereby lost their claims to purity and piety" (13).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Man Cannot Speak for Her: Volume I; A Critical Study of Early Feminist Rhetoric|last = Campbell|first = Karlyn Kohrs|publisher = Praeger|year = 1989|isbn = |location = |pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crafting an ethos within such restrictive moral codes, therefore, meant adhering to membership of what Nancy Fraser and Michael Warner have theorized as counterpublics. While Warner contends that members of counterpublics are afforded little opportunity to join the dominant public and therefore exert true agency, Nancy Fraser has problematized Habermas's conception of the public sphere as a dominant "social totality"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Publics and Counterpublics|last = Warner|first = Michael|date = 2002|journal = Public Culture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; by theorizing "subaltern counterpublics", which function as alternative publics that represent "parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses, which in turn permit them to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs" (67).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of the Actually Existing Democracy|last = Fraser|first = Nancy|date = 1990|journal = Social Text|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though feminist rhetorical theorists have begun to offer more nuanced ways to conceive of ethos, they remain cognizant of how these classical associations have shaped and still do shape women's use of the rhetorical tool. Johanna Schmertz draws on Aristotelian ethos to reinterpret the term alongside feminist theories of subjectivity, writing that, "Instead of following a tradition that, it seems to me, reads ethos somewhat in the manner of an Aristotelian quality proper to the speaker's identity, a quality capable of being deployed as needed to fit a rhetorical situation, I will ask how ethos may be dislodged from identity and read in such a way as to multiply the positions from which women may speak" (83).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Constructing Essences: Ethos and the Postmodern Subject of Feminism|last = Schmertz|first = Johanna|date = 1999|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetorical scholar and professor Kate Ronald's claim that "ethos is the appeal residing in the tension between the speaker's private and public self", (39)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Reexamination of Personal and Public Discourse in Classical Rhetoric|last = Ronald|first = Kate|date = 1990|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; also presents a more postmodern view of ethos that links [[credibility]] and identity. Similarly, Nedra Reynolds and Susan Jarratt echo this view of ethos as a fluid and dynamic set of identifications, arguing that "these split selves are guises, but they are not distortions or lies in the philosopher's sense. Rather they are 'deceptions' in the sophistic sense: recognitions of the ways one is positioned multiply differently" (56).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ethos: New Essays in Rhetorical and Critical Theory|last = Susan|first = Jarratt|publisher = Southern Methodist University Press|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Dallas|pages = 37–69|last2 = Reynolds|first2 = Nedra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhetorical scholar Michael Halloran has argued that the classical understanding of ethos "emphasizes the conventional rather than the idiosyncratic, the public rather than the private" (60). Commenting further on the classical etymology and understanding of ''ethos'', Halloran illuminates the interdependence between ''ethos'' and cultural context by arguing that "To have ethos is to manifest the virtues most valued by the culture to and for which one speaks" (60).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Aristotle's Concept of Ethos, or if not His, Someone Else's|last = Halloran|first = Michael|date = 1982|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While scholars do not all agree on the dominant sphere in which ethos may be crafted, some agree that ethos is formed through the negotiation between private experience and the public, rhetorical act of self-expression. Karen Burke LeFevre's argument in ''Invention as Social Act'' situates this negotiation between the private and the public, writing that ethos "appears in that socially created space, in the 'between', the point of intersection between speaker or writer and listener or reader" (45-46).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invention as a Social Act|last = LeFevre|first = K. B.|publisher = Southern Illinois University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nedra Reynolds, "ethos, like postmodern subjectivity, shifts and changes over time, across texts, and around competing spaces" (336). However, Reynolds additionally discusses how one might clarify the meaning of ethos within rhetoric as expressing inherently communal roots. This stands in direct opposition to what she describes as the claim "that ethos can be faked or 'manipulated'" because individuals would be formed by the values of their culture and not the other way around (336). Rhetorical scholar John Oddo also suggests that ethos is negotiated across a community, and not simply a manifestation of the self (47). In the era of mass-mediated communication, Oddo contends, one's ethos is often created by journalists and dispersed over multiple news texts. With this in mind, Oddo coins the term intertextual ethos, the notion that a public figure's "ethos is constituted within and across a range of mass media voices" (48).

In "Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos", scholar Coretta Pittman notes that race has been generally absent from theories of ethos construction, and that this concept is troubling for black women. Pittman writes, "Unfortunately, in the history of race relations in America, black Americans' ethos ranks low among other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. More often than not, their moral characters have been associated with a criminalized and sexualized ethos in visual and print culture" (43).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos: Harriet Jacobs, Billie Holiday, and Sister Souljah|last = Pittman|first = Corretta|date = 2007|journal = Rhetoric Society Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character in Greek tragedy==
The ways in which characters were constructed is important when considering ethos, or character, in [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell, ''Aristotle's Poetics.'' (1998) pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus Taber Murray explains that the depiction of a character was limited by the circumstances under which Greek tragedies were presented. These include the single unchanging scene, necessary use of the chorus, small number of characters limiting interaction, large outdoor theatres, and the use of masks, which all influenced characters to be more formal and simple.&lt;ref name=M534&gt;Murray (1916), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray also declares that the inherent characteristics of Greek tragedies are important in the makeup of the characters. One of these is the fact that tragedy characters were nearly always mythical characters. This limited the character, as well as the plot, to the already well-known myth from which the material of the play was taken. The other characteristic is the relatively short length of most Greek plays.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Ancient Theater and Performance Culture'' In: ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek and Roman Theater.'' (2007) pp. 36 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This limited the scope of the play and characterization, so that the characters were defined by one overriding motivation toward a certain objective from the beginning of the play.&lt;ref name=M546&gt;Murray (1916), pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Murray clarifies that strict constancy is not always the rule in Greek tragedy characters. To support this, he points out the example of Antigone who, even though she strongly defies Creon in the beginning of the play, begins to doubt her cause and plead for mercy as she is led to her execution.&lt;ref name=M59&gt;Murray (1916), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other aspects of the character element in ancient Greek tragedy are worth noting.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, ''Aristoteles über das Wesen und die Wirkung der Tragödie (Kap. 6)'' In: ''Aristoteles. Poetik.'' (2009) pp. 87 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of these, which C. Garton discusses, is the fact that either because of contradictory action or incomplete description, the character cannot be viewed as an individual, or the reader is left confused about the character.&lt;ref name=G247&gt;Garton (1957), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; One method of reconciling this would be to consider these characters to be flat, or type-caste, instead of round. This would mean that most of the information about the character centers around one main quality or viewpoint.&lt;ref name=G2478&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable to the flat character option, the reader could also view the character as a symbol. Examples of this might be the Eumenides as vengeance, or Clytemnestra as symbolizing ancestral curse.&lt;ref name=G248&gt;Garton (1957), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another means of looking at character, according to Tycho von Wilamowitz and Howald, is the idea that characterisation is not important. This idea is maintained by the theory that the play is meant to affect the viewer or reader scene by scene, with attention being only focused on the section at hand. This point of view also holds that the different figures in a play are only characterised by the situation surrounding them, and only enough so that their actions can be understood.&lt;ref name=G2489&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garet makes three more observations about character in Greek tragedy. The first is an abundant variety of types of characters in Greek tragedy. His second observation is that the reader or viewer's need for characters to display a unified identity that is similar to human nature is usually fulfilled. Thirdly, characters in tragedies include incongruities and idiosyncrasies.&lt;ref name=G250&gt;Garton (1957), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect stated by Garet is that tragedy plays are composed of language, character, and action, and the interactions of these three components; these are fused together throughout the play. He explains that action normally determines the major means of characterisation. Another principle he states is the importance of these three components' effect on each other; the important repercussion of this being character's impact on action.&lt;ref name=G2501&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 250–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustus Taber Murray also examines the importance and degree of interaction between plot and character. He does this by discussing Aristotle's statements about plot and character in his Poetics: that plot can exist without character, but character cannot exist without plot, and so character is secondary to plot. Murray maintains that Aristotle did not mean that complicated plot should hold the highest place in a tragedy play. This is because the plot was, more often than not, simple and therefore not a major point of tragic interest. Murray conjectures that people today do not accept Aristotle's statement about character and plot because to modern people, the most memorable things about tragedy plays are often the characters.&lt;ref name=M52&gt;Murray (1916), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Murray does concede that Aristotle is correct in that "[t]here can be no portrayal of character [...] without at least a skeleton outline of plot".&lt;ref name=M53&gt;Murray (1916), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character, or ethos, in pictorial narrative==
{{Cleanup reorganize|section|date=June 2018}}

Ethos, or character, also appears in the visual art of famous or mythological ancient Greek events in murals, on pottery, and sculpture, referred to generally as pictorial narrative. Aristotle even praised the ancient Greek painter Polygnotos because his paintings included characterization. The way in which the subject and his actions are portrayed in visual art can convey the subject's ethical character and through this the work's overall theme, just as effectively as poetry or drama can.&lt;ref name=C11&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This characterisation portrayed men as they ought to be, which is the same as Aristotle's idea of what ethos or character should be in tragedy. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 178) Professor Mark D. Stansbury-O'Donnell states that pictorial narratives often had ethos as its focus, and was therefore concerned with showing the character's moral choices. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 175) David Castriota, agreeing with Stansbury-O'Donnell's statement, says that the main way Aristotle considered poetry and visual arts to be on equal levels was in character representation and its effect on action.&lt;ref name=C10&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Castriota also maintains about Aristotle's opinion that "his interest has to do with the influence that such ethical representation may exert upon the public". Castriota also explains that according to Aristotle, "[t]he activity of these artists is to be judged worthy and useful above all because exposure of their work is beneficial to the [[polis]]".&lt;ref name=C10 /&gt; Accordingly, this was the reason for the representation of character, or ethos, in public paintings and sculptures. In order to portray the character's choice, the pictorial narrative often shows an earlier scene than when the action was committed. Stansbury-O'Donnell gives an example of this in the form of a picture by the ancient Greek artist Exekia which shows the Greek hero Ajax planting his sword in the ground in preparation to commit suicide, instead of the actual suicide scene. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 177.) Additionally, Castriota explains that ancient Greek art expresses the idea that character was the major factor influencing the outcome of the Greeks' conflicts against their enemies. Because of this, "ethos was the essential variable in the equation or analogy between myth and actuality".&lt;ref name=C12&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accolades==
Despite a lukewarm reaction by viewers, critics appreciated the innovative perspective on the classic Greek tragedy of [[Orpheus and Eurydice]] and noted the originality of Nikolaidis' artistic techniques. It is characteristic that Nikolaidis himself believed ''Evrydiki BA 2O37'' to be his best film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thatsgreece.com/info/culture-performing-arts-cinema-Nikos-Nikolaidis|title=Nikolaidis Nikos|website=That's Greece: Culture, Performing Arts, Cinema|accessdate=5 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012125800/http://www.thatsgreece.com/info/culture-performing-arts-cinema-Nikos-Nikolaidis|archivedate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

André Z. Labarrére and Olivier Labarrére, authors of ''Atlas du cinéma'', wrote that the film was one of the "New [[cinema of Greece|Greek Cinema]]" films that "radically transformed the panorama."&lt;ref&gt;Labarrére, André Z., y Labarrére, Olivier (2009). ''Atlas del cine'' (Título original: ''Atlas du cinéma''. Paris: Librairie Générale Française, 2002). Madrid: [[Ediciones Akal]]. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ThcBFxqXKTEC&amp;pg=PA275 275]. {{ISBN|8446021501}}. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this film, Nikolaidis won the Best Director Award, the Greek National Ministry of Culture Award, as well as the [[Athens]] Film Critics Association Best Picture Award at the [[Thessaloniki Festival of Greek Cinema]] in September [[1975 in film|1975]], where Marie-Louise Bartholomew, who was involved in the production of the film, also won the Best Set Designer Award, and Andreas Andreadakis, who was involved in the editing of the film, also won the Best Editor Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiff.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&amp;page=971&amp;year=1975|script-title=el:Γενικά 1975: 16ο Φεστιβάλ Ελληνικού Κινηματογράφου|website=[[Thessaloniki International Film Festival|Διεθνές Φεστιβάλ Κινηματογράφου Θεσσαλονίκης (Πληροφορίες: Βραβεία)]]|accessdate=5 December 2014|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schuster, Mel (1979).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8544">'''Extreme cinema''' is a genre of film distinguished by its use of excessive violence, torture, and sex of extreme nature. The rising popularity of Asian films in the 21st century has contributed to the growth of extreme cinema, although extreme cinema is still considered to be a cult-based genre. Being a relatively new genre, extreme cinema is controversial and widely unaccepted by the mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;Dirks, Tim. “100 Most Controversial Films of All Time.” ''100 Most Controversial Films of All Time''. Filmsite, n.d. Web. 9 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme cinema films target a specific and small audience group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/C6FD3EB5-9542-4A98-B2E1-3F2E834B88FF]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The prehistory of extreme cinema can be traced back to censorship of [[art films]] and advertising tactics for classical [[exploitation films]] to Anglophone markets alongside later liberal representations of sex in the first half of the 20th Century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oqq_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=extreme+cinema+the+transgressive+rhetoric+of+today's+art+film+culture&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KN46_CS2kK&amp;sig=rYJ7CboAzRRup3nNc7NB502f93Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqzorAjanYAhXMOCYKHeaLAus4ChDoAQhCMAY#v=snippet&amp;q=+salo&amp;f=false|title=Extreme Cinema: The Transgressive Rhetoric of Today's Art Film Culture|first=Mattias|last=Frey|date=15 March 2016|publisher=Rutgers University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "extreme cinema" originated from a “line of Asian films that share a combination of sensational features, such as extreme violence, horror and shocking plots”.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Eunah. “Trauma, excess, and the aesthetics of the affect: the extreme cinemas of Chan-Wook Park.” ''Post Script'' 2014:33. ''Literature Resource Center''. Web. 7 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Extreme cinema is highly criticized and debated by film critics and the general public. There have been debates over the hypersexualization that makes these films a threat to the ‘mainstream’ community standards.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pett, E. “A New Media Landscape? The BBFC,&amp;nbsp; Extreme Cinema As Cult, And Technological Change.” ''New Review of Film and Television Studies'' 13.1 (2015): 83-99. Scopus. Web. 9 Feb. 2016&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been criticism over the increasing use of violence in modern-day films. Ever since the emergence of slasher-gore films in the ’70s, the rising popularity of extreme cinema has contributed to the casual violence in popular media.&lt;ref&gt;Sapolsky, Barry S., Fred Moliter, and Sarah Luque. “Sex and Violence in Slasher Films: Re-examining the Assumptions.” ''J&amp;MC Quarterl''y 80.1 (2003): 28-38. ''SAGE Journals''. Web. 9 Feb. 2016.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Some criticize the easy exposure and unintended targeting of adolescence by extreme cinema films.&lt;ref&gt;Sargent, James D., Todd F. Hetherton, M. Bridget Ahrens, Madeline A. Dalton, Jennifer J. Tickle, and Michael L. Beach. “Adolescent Exposure to Extremely Violent Movies.” ''Journal of Adolescent Health'' 31.6 (2002): 449-454. ''JAMES MADISON UNIV’s Catalog.'' Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification and guidelines ===
The [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) classifies extreme cinema films into an "R18" rating, which is defined as “special and legally restricted classification primarily for explicit works of consenting sex or strong fetish material involving adults.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''''fabula togata''''' is a Latin comedy in a Roman setting, in existence since at least the second century B.C. [[Lucius Afranius (poet)|Lucius Afranius]] and [[Titus Quinctius Atta]] are known to have written ''fabulae togatae''. No ''fabula togata'' has survived.

A '''false document''' is often promoted in conjunction with a criminal enterprise, such as [[fraud]] or a [[confidence game]]. 

However, a ''false document'' is also a technique employed to create [[verisimilitude]] in a work of fiction. By inventing and inserting documents that appear to be factual, an author tries to create a sense of authenticity beyond the normal and expected [[suspension of disbelief]] for a [[work of art]]. The goal of a false document is to convince an audience that what is being presented is factual.

==In business==
Forged documents in business are typically for financial gain.

=== Material certificates ===
A material's [[Mill Test Report|certification]], essentially a report of its composition and properties, may be forged.  A low-property material, produced for lower cost, may be passed as a higher-property material, which has a higher price.  The difference becomes illicit profit. Counterfeit fasteners have low-strength alloys or inferior production processes, but are sold as high-strength fasteners.

=== Safety certificates ===
Similarly, parts, systems, and processes for high-valued operations may have their [[Quality Assurance|quality-assurance documents]] forged.  Substandard items may be cheaper or simply more readily available. Nuclear power plants in Japan and Korea have found components with forged safety documents.
''See also'': [[Information Assurance]]

=== Degree certificates ===
Academic degrees often qualify for recruitment, promotions and additional pay. There are many methods to get false degree certificates. First, university officials have been bribed to issue a certificate without study. Second, false universities called [[diploma mill]]s issue certificates that have no legal standing and are usually purchased outright without study, but they may still be legal. Finally, degree certificates have been directly [[Forgery|forged]], which is a felony in most jurisdictions. Besides the degree certificate itself, final theses and essays have been falsified by e.g. plagiarism, ghost writing or inclusion of fake references. Thus, the degree certificate itself is genuine but it may be revoked.

==In politics==
A forged document, the [[Zinoviev Letter]], helped bring the downfall of the first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Government]] in Britain. Conspiracies within secret intelligence services have occurred more recently, leading [[Harold Wilson]]  to put in place rules to prevent in the 1960s [[phone tapping]] of [[members of Parliament]], for example.

''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', purporting to describe a [[Jew]]ish plan for global domination, was first published in Russia in 1903, translated into multiple languages, and disseminated internationally in the early part of the 20th century.

== In art ==
Artist [[J. S. G. Boggs|JSG Boggs]]'s life and work have been extensively explored by author and journalist [[Lawrence Weschler]]. Boggs draws currency with exceptional care and accuracy, but he only ever draws one side. He then attempts to buy things with the piece of paper upon which he has drawn the currency. His goal is to pass each bill for its face value in common transactions. He buys lunch, clothes, and lodging in this manner, and after the transactions are complete, his bills fetch many times their face value on the art market. Boggs does not make any money from the much larger art market value of his work, only from reselling the goods bought, the change and receipts and other such materials. He has been arrested in many countries, and there is much controversy surrounding his work.

[[Orson Welles]]' ''[[F for Fake]]'' is a prime example of a film which is both about falsification ([[art forgery]] and the journalism surrounding art forgery) as well as having falsified moments within the film. The movie follows the exploits of a famous art forger, his biographer [[Clifford Irving]], and the subsequent fake [[autobiography]] of [[Howard Hughes]] that Irving tries to publish. The issues of veracity and forgery are explored in the film, while at the same time, Welles tricks the audience by incorporating fake bits of narrative alongside the documentary footage.

==In cross-marketing==
There is a long history of producers creating tie-in material to promote and merchandise movies and television shows. Tie-in materials as far-ranging as toys, games, lunch boxes, clothing and so on have all been created and in some cases generate as much or more revenue as the original programming. One big merchandising arena is publishing. In most cases such material is not considered [[canon (fiction)|canon]] within the show's mythology; however, in some instances the books, magazines, etc. are specifically designed by the creators to be canonical. With the rise of the Internet, in-canon online material has become more prominent.

The following is a list of "false document" in-canon supplemental material:
* ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' spawned three [[Books of Twin Peaks|canon books]]:
**''[[The Autobiography of F.B.I. Special Agent Dale Cooper: My Life, My Tapes]]'' {{ISBN|0-671-74400-3}}
**''[[The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer]]'' {{ISBN|0-671-73590-X}}
**''[[Twin Peaks: An Access Guide to the Town]]'' {{ISBN|0-671-74399-6}}
Additionally, a set of [[trading cards]] was produced which are also canon.
* ''[[Gary Troup (Lost)|Bad Twin]]'' {{ISBN|1-4013-0276-9}} is a canon tie-in novel for the TV series ''[[Lost (2004 TV series)|Lost]]''

== Hoaxes ==
{{Main|Hoax}}
A number of [[hoax]]es have involved false documents:
* [[Salamander Letter]]
* ''[[The Report From Iron Mountain]]''
* The [[Oera Linda]] book
* The [[Hitler Diaries]]
* The ''[[Dossiers Secrets|Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau]]''

'''Form-versus-content humour''' is a type of [[humour]] in an [[:wikt:incongruity|incongruity]] between a statement's content and the way it is communicated makes it humorous. It is one of the basic techniques of [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How to Laugh Your Way Through Life: A Psychoanalyst's Advice |first=Paul |last=Marcus |publisher=Karnac Books |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[form and content|Form-versus-content]] humour can be delivered, for example, by presenting a message in a form that inherently defeats the ostensible purpose of the message, or in a form that is fundamentally incapable of carrying the important part of the message. The ''[[Jargon File]]'' gives an example of this type of humor: a red [[index card]] with GREEN written on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/h/hackerhumor.html |title=hacker humor |website=The Jargon File, version 4.4.8 |editor=Eric S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16569">'''Game development kits''' ('''GDK''') are specialized [[computer hardware|hardware]] used to create commercial [[video game|videogames]]. They may be partnered with game development tools, special [[game engine]] licenses, and other [[middleware]] to aid [[video game development]]. GDKs are typically not available to the public, and require [[video game developers|game developers]] to enter an agreement, partnership, or program with the hardware manufacturer to gain access to the hardware. As [[Video game console|game console]] generations pass, development kits often get sold through websites like eBay without repercussions. This is often because the console manufacturers discontinue certain development programs as time passes.

== Overview ==
In the 1980s, computing did not involve  3D modelling or any complex programming due to the limitations of hardware.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Life and Times of an 80’s Game Programmer – Putting it all together {{!}} Play It Again|url = http://playitagainproject.org/the-life-and-times-of-an-80s-game-programmer-putting-it-all-together/|website = playitagainproject.org|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, combined with the hobbyist nature of early computer game programming, meant that not many individuals or smaller companies would develop for consoles. Even when consoles became mainstream (such as the Nintendo Entertainment System), there was no official or publicly available GDK since most console manufacturers would develop their games in-house. For example, Nintendo had internal development teams for both hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Here’s How Nintendo’s Internal Teams are Organized|url = http://www.gamnesia.com/news/heres-how-nintendos-internal-teams-are-organized|website = www.gamnesia.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the fifth generation of consoles, game development kits were developed to encourage more developers to make console games and grow the videogame industry. Game development kits began as a simple way for developers to connect their computers to console hardware, allowing them to compile software on their PC and see it play directly on a console. Once most GDKs started becoming bundled with hardware-specific software, hobbyists or anyone not directly affiliated with a console manufacturer would have to write their games without the specialized software to access unique features such as the Xbox One's Kinect or the Wii U GamePad.

Modern game development kits often come bundled with the specialized software, and are much more formalized compared to previous-generation GDKs. In older generations of console gaming, developers had to make their own hardware and write games at various levels of programming (such as assembly&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;). Today, programs such as Unity 3D provide a complete software environment and console manufacturers such as Nintendo provide polished &amp; powerful development hardware through their developer programs. Other console manufacturers even allow the retail consoles to be used as development kits, provided that the development software is being used by the developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Microsoft: Every Xbox One Can Be Used To Make Games [UPDATE]|url = http://kotaku.com/microsoft-every-xbox-one-can-be-used-to-make-games-up-898750954|website = Kotaku|accessdate = 2015-12-22|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third-generation videogame development kits ==
[[File:NES-MissionCtrlRAMCartDebug1.jpg|alt=The NES Mission Control debug cartridge.|thumb|174x174px|The NES Mission Control debug cartridge.]]

=== Nintendo Entertainment System ===
For a significant portion of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] lifespan, there was no official development kit. Video game developers creating games for the NES would have to make their own development kits, such as Rocket Science Production with their "NES Mission Control" development system. At least two programs were used in conjunction with the NES Mission Control hardware; NESTEST.EXE which would be used to test and debug the development hardware, and HST.EXE which would be used for communication between a computer and the NES development hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NES Mission Control Development System|url = http://devkits.handheldmuseum.com/NES_MissionControl.htm|website = devkits.handheldmuseum.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fourth-generation videogame development kits ==

=== Super Nintendo Entertainment System ===
The [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] used specialized [[EPROM]] cartridges for development,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SNES 8 MB EPROM Cartridge|url = http://devkits.handheldmuseum.com/SNES_8MBEPROM.htm|website = devkits.handheldmuseum.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various software. Similar to the NES, developers often made their own development software or relied on middleware made by other developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NES/SNES Utilities - Zophar's Domain|url = http://www.zophar.net/utilities/nesdev.html|website = www.zophar.net|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SNES Development Wiki|url = http://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/show/HomePage|website = Super Nintendo Development Wiki|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fifth-generation video game development kits ==

=== PlayStation ===
[[File:Playstation Blue Developer Console.jpg|alt=The developer version of the PlayStation; a blue console.|thumb|The developer version of the PlayStation; a blue console.]]
The are several variations of the [[PlayStation]] development kit used for game creation. One variation of the development kit had only three components,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Store {{!}} PSXDEV|url = http://www.psxdev.net/store.html|website = www.psxdev.net|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the PlayStation Ultimate Development Kit included up to 26 components, including the complete [[Net Yaroze]] development kit.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Things you can't ever have|url = http://www.platypuscomix.net/interactive/thingsyoucanteverhave3.html|website = www.platypuscomix.net|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Net Yaroze]] version of the development kit was unique in that it had some features removed and added compared to the official (complete) PlayStation development kit. The Net Yaroze hardware was designed for hobbyists, while official developers would have access to the official PlayStation development kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 15 Years Later: How Sony's Net Yaroze Kickstarted Indie Console Development|url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/169245/15_years_later_how_sonys_net_.php|website = www.gamasutra.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a blue version of the PlayStation made for developers that would read burned discs to allow quick testing of imaged builds of their videogames. While there were official PlayStation-branded CD-Rs that could be used with the blue PlayStation, regular CD-Rs were also compatible with the system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nintendo 64/64DD ===
[[File:N64 Gangwriter.jpg|alt=The Nintendo 64 Gangwriter used to duplicate games across cartridges.|thumb|The Nintendo 64 Gangwriter used to duplicate games across cartridges.]]
The [[Nintendo 64]] development kit consisted of multiple components, both for the N64 and its add-on, the N64DD. The main hardware used in N64 game development was the Partner-N64 Development Kit,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nintendo 64 Development {{!}} level42|url = http://level42.ca/projects/nintendo-64-development/|website = level42.ca|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used tall cartridges for game development/testing rather than the short cartridges that were sold with retail games. Another hardware component in N64 development was the NU64 Flash Gang Writer, which allowed developers to copy data from one cartridge to multiple cartridges simultaneously. This device was primarily used to create press and test copies of games, and also relied on tall cartridges instead of short retail cartridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NESWORLD.COM - NU64 FLASH GANG WRITER (NINTENDO64 DEVELOPMENT TOOL)|url = http://www.nesworld.com/n64-gangwriter.php|website = www.nesworld.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions of the Nintendo 64 GDK are the SN Systems development suite, as well as the SN Maestro 64 Music development system. The development suite allowed developers to run code from a computer directly to the console, and included a software package. The Maestro 64 Music system allowed developers to load music software on to the console, and play music through the Nintendo 64's hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nintendo 64 SN64 Dev Kit and SN Maestro 64 Music Dev Kit|url = http://devkits.handheldmuseum.com/SN64.htm|website = devkits.handheldmuseum.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sixth-generation video game development kits ==

=== Dreamcast ===
[[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]] units were unique in that they used "GD-ROM" discs; giga discs that held 1GB of data. This was slightly more than a typical CD, but less than a DVD. While GD-ROM burners were used by some developers, since the Dreamcast was compatible with CDs and since most games didn't take up 1GB of data at the time, GD-ROMs remained uncommon as developers opted to use the more-easily accessible CDs for their disc media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Things you can't ever have|url = http://www.platypuscomix.net/interactive/thingsyoucanteverhave.html|website = www.platypuscomix.net|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Xbox ===
When developers were creating software for the original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], a prototype of the controller was used in the early development kits. This controller was slimmer, had elongated sides, and used a [[USB]] cable instead of an Xbox port-compatible cable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Seventh-generation video game development kits ==

=== Xbox 360 ===
[[Microsoft]] manages the [[Xbox 360]] Tools and Middleware Program, which licenses development kits (hardware and software) to professional software developers working on tools and technologies for games. Access to this program requires good industry references, prior experience in games tools and middleware development, and signing a non-disclosure agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Xbox 360 Tools and Middleware Program|url = http://www.xbox.com/en-US/developers/xbox/tools|website = www.xbox.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PlayStation 3 ===
The PlayStation developer program allows registered developers to publish their games across the [[PlayStation Network]], making their games accessible on the [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Vita]], and [[PlayStation TV]] all through one program.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Develop|url = https://www.playstation.com/en-us/develop/|website = PlayStation|accessdate = 2015-11-25|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Original-wii-dev-kit-10-years-ago-640x430.jpg|alt=The original Nintendo Wii development hardware.|thumb|The original Wii development hardware.]]

=== Wii ===
The [[Wii]] development kit was a bundle of the "NDEV" hardware - a big black box full of debugging/testing hardware that looks nothing like the slim white Wii consoles sold to consumers - and a disc containing the developer software tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = This is the original Wii dev kit that shipped to developers 10 years ago|url = http://wiiudaily.com/2015/08/this-is-the-original-wii-dev-kit-that-shipped-to-developers-10-years-ago/|website = wiiudaily.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eighth-generation video game development kits ==

=== Xbox One ===
[[Microsoft]] maintains multiple developer programs for people wanting to develop games for their platforms; ID@Xbox for [[Xbox One]] [[Game Development|game development]], and the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] Dev Center for [[Windows 8]], [[Windows 8.1]], [[Windows 10]], and Xbox One game and application development. 
* The ID@Xbox program allows qualified game developers to [[Self-publishing|self-publish]] their games to the Xbox One, as well as access free middleware and use two development hardware kits for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Independent Developer publishing program for Xbox One|url = http://www.xbox.com/en-AU/developers/id|website = www.xbox.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Windows Dev Center allows developers to create apps and games on [[Windows 8]], [[Windows 8.1]], and [[Windows 10]] platforms as part of the [[Universal Windows Platform]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Get started with Windows apps - Windows app development|url = https://dev.windows.com/en-us/getstarted|website = dev.windows.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita ===
The [[PlayStation]] developer program allows registered developers to publish their games across the [[PlayStation Network]], making their games accessible on the [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Vita]], and [[PlayStation TV]] all through one program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The PlayStation 4 development kits were known as "Orbis", though this was just a codename.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Report: Xbox 720 And PS4 Codenames And Details - IGN|url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/11/report-xbox-720-and-ps4-codenames-and-details|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130115164704/http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/11/report-xbox-720-and-ps4-codenames-and-details|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2013-01-15|website = IGN|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Academic institution]]s can register to receive PS4 development kits for educational use, and are not region-restricted unlike regular PlayStation Developer Program members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=PlayStation® Academic Program |url=https://www.playstation.com/en-us/develop/gdc-2015/academic-program/ |website=PlayStation |accessdate=2015-11-25 |language=en-US |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126034408/https://www.playstation.com/en-us/develop/gdc-2015/academic-program/ |archivedate=2015-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wii U ===
[[Nintendo]] maintains a unified developer program for both its Wii U and Nintendo 3DS families of platforms. This developer program provides software and middleware to developers, and allows developers to self-publish their games to the Nintendo eShop.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developer.nintendo.com/|title=Homepage - Nintendo Developer Portal|website=developer.nintendo.com|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games and applications published through this program are considered "third-party" and do not belong to Nintendo, allowing independent developers to publish their games on multiple different platforms.

The Wii U development hardware consists of a system called "CAT-DEV", with its accompanying peripherals such as the Display Remote Controller (presumably the [[Wii U GamePad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wii U dev kit {{!}} Wii U|url = http://wiiudaily.com/wii-u-dev-kit/|website = wiiudaily.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and sensor bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wii U Devkit (CAT-DEV V3) - VGLeaks|url = http://www.vgleaks.com/wii-u-devkit-cat-dev-v3|website = VGLeaks|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nintendo 3DS Family ===
Nintendo's developer program allows developers to use Nintendo 3DS development kits, and allows developers to self-publish their games to the Nintendo eShop.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As mentioned in the Nintendo Wii U section above, games and applications published through this program are considered "third-party" and do not belong to Nintendo, allowing independent developers to publish their games on multiple different platforms.

Strangely, some 3DS development kits cannot play [[ROM cartridge|retail games]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Heckler2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A heckler in Washington, D.C. leans across a police line toward a demonstration of [[Iran]]ians during the [[Iran hostage crisis]], August 1980]]

A '''heckler''' is a person who harasses and tries to disconcert others with questions, challenges, or gibes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Heckler |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heckler |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hecklers are often known to shout disparaging comments at a performance or event, or to interrupt set-piece speeches, with the intent of disturbing performers and/or participants.

==Origin==
Although the word ''heckler'', which originated from the textile trade, was first attested in the mid-15th century, the sense "person who harasses" was from 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=heckler|title=heckler {{!}} Origin and history of heckler by Online Etymology Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ''heckle'' was to tease or comb out [[flax]] or [[hemp]] fibres. The additional meaning, to interrupt speakers with awkward or embarrassing questions, was added in [[Scotland]], and specifically perhaps in early nineteenth century [[Dundee]], a famously radical town where the hecklers who combed the flax had established a reputation as the most radical and belligerent element in the workforce. In the heckling factory, one heckler would read out the day's news while the others worked, to the accompaniment of interruptions and furious debate.&lt;ref name=McKie&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/apr/28/broadcasting.comment |title=Unplotted ripostes |last1=McKie |first1=David |date=28 April 2005 |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heckling was a major part of the [[vaudeville]] theater. Sometimes it was incorporated into the play. [[Milton Berle]]'s weekly TV variety series in the 1960s featured a heckler named Sidney Spritzer ([[German language|German]]/[[Yiddish]] for 'squirter') played by [[Borscht Belt]] comic [[Irving Benson]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, ''[[Muppet Show|The Muppet Show]]'', which was also built around a vaudeville theme, featured two hecklers, [[Statler &amp; Waldorf]] (two old men named after famous hotels). Heckles are now particularly likely to be heard at comedy performances, to unsettle or compete with the performer.

==Politics==
{{See also|Heckler's veto}}
&lt;!-- 
NOTE: these sections could stand to be organized a bit more (by year, era, whatever)
with sub-headers (or at least date or year) for each "incident" so as to put them all in context.
--&gt;
Politicians speaking before live audiences have less latitude to deal with hecklers. Legally, such conduct may constitute protected [[free speech]]. Strategically, coarse or belittling retorts to hecklers entail personal risk disproportionate to any gain. Some politicians, however, have been known to improvise a relevant and witty response despite these pitfalls. One acknowledged expert at this was [[Harold Wilson]], British Prime Minister in the 1960s:

:'''Heckler''': (''interrupting a passage in a Wilson speech about Labour's spending plans'') What about [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]?
:'''Wilson''': The government has no plans to increase public expenditure in Vietnam.
:'''Heckler''': Rubbish!
:'''Wilson''': I'll come to your special interest in a minute, sir.&lt;ref name=McKie/&gt;

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]]'s [[I Have a Dream]] speech was largely a response to supporter [[Mahalia Jackson]] interrupting his prepared speech to shout "Tell them about the dream, Martin". &lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, Hayden of heckla.com (16th April 2018) : Former Martin Luther King, Jr. adviser and speechwriter Clarence B. Jones talks to WSJ's Monika Vosough about how Martin Luther King's favorite gospel singer Mahalia Jackson helped create the "I Have a Dream" speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlOlynG6FY&amp;ab_channel=WallStreetJournal&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, King stopped reading from his previously prepared speech and improvised the remainder of the speech - this improvised portion of the speech is the best-known part of the speech and frequently rated as one of the best of all time.

During a campaign stop just before winning the Presidency in 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]] was heckled by an audience member who kept interrupting him during a speech. Reagan tried to go on with his speech three times, but after being interrupted yet again glared at the heckler and snapped "Aw, shut up!" The audience immediately gave him a standing ovation.

In 1992, then-Presidential candidate [[Bill Clinton]] was interrupted by Bob Rafsky, a member of the AIDS activism group [[ACT UP]], who accused him of "dying of ambition to be president"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Toner |first=Robin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/27/us/the-1992-campaign-aids-protester-provokes-clinton-s-anger.html |title=NY Times |work=New York Times |date=27 March 1992 |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a rally. After becoming visibly agitated, Clinton took the microphone off the stand, pointed to the heckler and directly responded to him by saying, "[...] I have treated you and all of the other people who have interrupted my rallies with a hell of a lot more respect than you treated me. And it's time to start thinking about that!" Clinton was then met with raucous applause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=30 maart 2006 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGTQZnC-6a4 |title=Clinton's Angry Response to Heckler |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Audience control ===
&lt;!-- 
NOTE: possible use for subheader here, distinguishing the use of "audience screening" as a means of discouraging political heckling.
NOTE: 'astroturfing' and 'audience screening' are arguably distinct, changed to a 'see also'
--&gt;
&lt;!-- What? --&gt;
One modern political approach to discourage heckling is to ensure that major events are given before a "tame" audience of sympathizers, or conducted to allow restrictions on who may remain on the premises (see also, ''[[astroturfing]]''). The downside is this may make heckling incidents even more newsworthy. This happened to [[Tony Blair]] during a [[photo op]] visit to a hospital during the 2001 general election campaign, and again in 2003 during a speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2690549.stm "Blair's heckler states his case"], BBC, 24 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, American Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] was interrupted mid-speech by Perry Patterson, a middle-aged mother in a pre-screened rally audience. After various supportive outbursts that were permitted ("Four more years", "Go Bush!"), Patterson uttered  "No, no, no, no" and was removed from the speech area and told to leave. She refused, and was arrested for criminal [[trespass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/02/09/coverstory.html |title=Woman utters No |publisher=Eugeneweekly.com |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in 2005, Cheney received some heckling that was broadcast during his trip to New Orleans, after [[Hurricane Katrina]] ravaged the area. The heckling occurred during a press conference in [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], Mississippi, in an area that was cordoned off for public safety reasons, and then further secured for the press conference. Nevertheless, emergency room physician Ben Marble got close enough to the proceedings and could be heard yelling, "Go fuck yourself, Mr. Cheney." Cheney laughed it off and continued speaking.&lt;ref&gt;June Deery: ''Consuming Reality: The Commercialization of Factual Entertainment''.  MacMillan, 2012.  Page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  The heckle was a reference to Cheney's use of the phrase the previous year, when during a heated exchange with Senator [[Patrick Leahy|Patrick Joseph Leahy]], Vermont, he said "fuck yourself" on the floor of the senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheney Dismisses Critic With Obscenity|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3699-2004Jun24.html|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his speech to the CND several people were told to leave the room following protests at Iran's human rights record. Several protesters shouted "Fascists" at the ambassador and the organisers of the conference. Walter Wolfgang, the 82-year-old peace campaigner who was forced out of the Labour Party conference last month, was in the audience."

Since 2005 heckling of performing artists has become more commonplace in [[Switzerland]].  Musicians of [[Basel]] and [[Zurich]] have become an increasing focus of hecklers.  This shift is primarily perpetrated by foreigners and is often met with a positive response by the non-Swiss performers who welcome the audience interaction. 

On Thursday, 20 April 2006, a heckler from the [[Falun Gong]] spiritual movement entered the US [[White House]] grounds as a reporter and interrupted a formal arrival ceremony for [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Hu Jintao]].  Moments into Mr Hu's speech at the event, [[Wang Wenyi]], perched on the top tier of the stands reserved for the press, began screaming in English and Chinese: "President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] stop him. Stop this visit. Stop the killing and torture."&lt;!--  The heckler was allowed to continue for several minutes despite the heavy presence of security personnel typical of such high level meeting of officials, prompting speculation that the incident was planned with the tacit cooperation of the White House in order to embarrass the Chinese president, hence possibly making this heckling incident one which was found justified by its audience. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html "No breakthrough in US, China talks"]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011756/http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Bush later apologised to his guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,1758305,00.html |title=Protester gatecrashes Hu visit as China and US fail to make progress |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 21 April 2006|accessdate=12 March 2009  | first=Suzanne | last=Goldenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2009, Representative [[Joe Wilson (U.S. politician)|Joe Wilson]] (R-SC) shouted "You lie!" at President [[Barack Obama]] after President Obama stated that his health care plan would not subsidize coverage for illegal immigrants during a [[Barack Obama speech to joint session of Congress, September 2009|speech]] he was making to a joint session of Congress.  Wilson later apologized for his outburst.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/09/09/wilson-apologizes-i-let-my-emotions-get-the-best-of-me/ "Wilson apologizes: 'I let my emotions get the best of me'"].

On 25 November 2013, Ju Hong, a 24-year-old South Korean immigrant without legal documentation, shouted at Obama to use his executive power to stop deportation of illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inagist.com/all/405077610499022849/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203164254/http://inagist.com/all/405077610499022849/ |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama said "If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so." "But we're also a nation of laws, that's part of our tradition," he continued. "And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws.

==Sport==
Hecklers can also appear at sporting events, and usually (but not always) direct their taunts at a visiting team. Fans of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] [[American football]] team are notorious for heckling; among the most infamous incidents were [[booing]] and subsequently throwing snowballs at a performer dressed as [[Santa Claus]] in a halftime show in 1968, and cheering at the career-ending injury of visiting team player [[Michael Irvin]] in 1999.  Often, sports heckling will also involve throwing objects onto the field; this has led most sports stadiums to ban glass containers and bottlecaps. Another famous heckler is [[Robert Szasz]], who regularly attends [[Tampa Bay Rays]] baseball games and is known for loudly heckling one opposing player per game or series. Former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[association football|football]] star [[Dejan Savićević]] is involved in an infamous incident with a heckler in which during an interview, a man on the street is heard shouting off-camera: "You're a piece of shit!"  Dejan berated the man, and went on to finish the interview, without missing a beat.

In English and Scottish [[association football|football]], heckling and swearing from the stands, and [[football chant]]s such as [[who ate all the pies?]] are common.

Australian sporting audiences are known for creative heckling. Perhaps the most famous is [[Yabba]] who had a grandstand at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] named after him, and now a statue.

The sport of [[cricket]] is particularly notorious for heckling between the teams themselves, which is known as [[sledging (cricket)|sledging]].

At the NBA Drafts of recent years, many fans have gone with heckling [[ESPN]] [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] analyst and host of, [[Quite Frankly with Stephen A. Smith]], [[Stephen A. Smith]]. Most notably, The Stephen A. Smith Heckling Society of Gentlemen heckles him with a sock puppet dubbed as Stephen A. himself.

Tennis fans are also fairly noted for heckling. Some may call out during a service point to distract either player. Another common heckle from tennis fans is cheering after a service fault, which is considered to be rude and unsporting.

In 2009, then [[Toronto Blue Jays]] outfielder [[Alex Ríos]] was a victim of a heckling incident outside after a fund-raising event. The incident occurred after Rios declined to sign an autograph for a young fan, the same day he went 0 for 5 with 5 [[strikeouts]] in a game against the [[Los Angeles Angels]]. An older man yelled "The way you played today Alex, you should be lucky someone wants your autograph." Rios then replied with "Who gives a fuck", repeating it until being ushered into a vehicle. Rios did apologize the next day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/story/2009/06/05/sp-rios-youtube.html | work=CBC News | title=Rios apologizes for YouTube tirade at abusive fan | date=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was eventually placed on waivers and claimed by the [[Chicago White Sox]] later that year.

==Music==
{{Further|Electric Dylan controversy}}
One of the most famous heckles in music history occurred at a [[Bob Dylan]] concert at the [[Manchester Free Trade Hall]] in 1966. During a quiet moment in between songs, an audience member shouts very loudly and clearly, "Judas!" referencing Dylan's so-called betrayal of folk music by "going electric". Dylan replied: "I don't believe you, you're a liar!" before telling his band to "Play it fucking loud!" They play an acidic version of "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glover|first=Tony|title=Bob Dylan Live 1966 Liner Notes|publisher=Columbia Records|year=1998|location=New York|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was captured on tape and the full concert was released as volume four of Dylan's ''Live Bootleg Series''.

==Comedy==
Heckling often occurs during [[stand up comedy]] performances, particularly at [[Renegade_show|open stage]] performances, and/or where alcoholic beverages are being consumed. It is regarded as a sign of audience members becoming impatient with what they regard as a low quality performance. Some comedians ignore the heckling and dislike the practice. In an interview for a 2011 BBC documentary, [[Billy Connolly]] said that "I loathe hecklers. I haven't one good syllable to say about hecklers. When you've come out of the club circuit and all that and you're in the concert hall...they should be gone."&lt;ref&gt;BBC Imagine: The Art of Stand Up, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Other stand-up comedians devise a strategy for quashing such outbursts, usually by having a store of retorts (known as "squelches") on hand. The idea is to get the audience laughing at the heckler for being outwitted.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Andrew. [http://www.juggling.org/~conway/juggler/MAL.TXT "You're Ugly, Your Dick Is Small, and Everybody Fucks Your Mother—The Stand-Up Comedian's Response to the Heckler"]. ''[[Maledicta]]'' Vol. 11, December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, live comedy venues tend to discourage heckling via signage and admissions policy, but tend to tolerate it as it creates customer loyalty. The etiquette of exactly how much heckling is tolerated differs immensely from venue to venue, however, but is generally more likely to be tolerated in blue collar or working class venues. Some cities feature 'heckle nights' where heckling is actively encouraged.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The comedy TV series ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' featured a pair of hecklers named [[Statler and Waldorf]]. These characters created a kind of meta-comedy act in which the show's official comedian, [[Fozzie Bear]], acted as their usual [[Double act|foil]], although they occasionally made jokes at other characters as well.

Another notable use of heckling in comedy is in the cult favorite series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The series involves a man (either Joel Robinson or Mike Nelson) and two robots (Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot) sitting in a theater mocking bad B-movies. This style of comedy, coined as riffing, is continued with commentary-based series such as [[Rifftrax]] and [[Cinematic Titanic]].

In one of [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s plays "The School Master", a heckler interrupted his play by shouting "Here!" after Atkinson had read out an amusing name on his register. Atkinson incorporated it into his act by saying "I have a detention book..."{{cn|date=October 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5737">A '''helen''' is a [[List of humorous units of measurement|humorous unit of measurement]] based on the concept that [[Helen of Troy]], from the ''[[Iliad]]'', had a "face that launched a thousand ships". The helen is thus used to measure quantities of beauty in terms of the theoretical action that could be accomplished by the wielder of such beauty.

==Origin==
[[File:Enlèvement d'Hélène, Reni (Louvre INV 539) 09.jpg|thumb|Helen leaving for [[Troy]] with [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], as depicted by [[Guido Reni]]]]
The classic reference to Helen's beauty is [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]]'s lines from the 1592 play ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]'', "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships / And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/779/779-h/779-h.htm |title='&amp;#39;The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus'&amp;#39; by Christopher Marlowe - Project Gutenberg |date= |accessdate=2011-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tradition of humorous pseudounits, then, 1&amp;nbsp;millihelen is the amount of beauty needed to launch a single ship.

According to ''[[The Rebel Angels]]'', a 1981 novel by [[Robertson Davies]], this system was invented by [[Cambridge]] mathematician [[W.A.H. Rushton]]. [[Isaac Asimov]] claimed to have invented the term in the 1940s as a graduate student in his 1992 collection of jokes and limericks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1992 |title=Asimov Laughs Again |publisher=Harper-Collins |page=200 |isbn=0060168269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asimovhumanists.org/AboutIsaacAssimov2.htm |title=About Isaac Asimov |publisher=Asimovhumanists.org |accessdate=2011-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614180101/http://asimovhumanists.org/AboutIsaacAssimov2.htm |archivedate=2012-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1958 letter to the ''[[New Scientist]]'', R.C. Winton proposes the milli-Helen as the amount of beauty required to launch one ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Winton |first=R.C. |date=13 November 1958 |title=The Mathematics of Beauty |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=HS-tcz9b_lcC&amp;lpg=PA1287&amp;dq=New%20Scientist%2013%20November%201958&amp;pg=PA1285#v=onepage&amp;q=beauty&amp;f=false |magazine=New Scientist |access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, P.&amp;nbsp;Lockwood noted that the unit had been independently proposed by Edgar J. Westbury and extended by the pair to negative values, where &amp;minus;1&amp;nbsp;milli-Helen was the amount of ugliness required to sink a battleship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lockwood |first=P. |date=8 January 1959 |title=Unit of Ugliness |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=92k0o9xk-RcC&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=New%20Scientist%201959%20Unit%20of%20Ugliness&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q=New%20Scientist%201959%20Unit%20of%20Ugliness&amp;f=false |magazine=New Scientist |access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derived units==
The Catalogue of Ships from Book&amp;nbsp;II of ''[[The Iliad]]'', which describes in detail the commanders who came to fight for Helen and the ships they brought with them, details a total of 1,186 ships which came to fight the Trojan War.  As such, Helen herself has a beauty rating of 1.186 helens, capable of launching ''more'' than one thousand ships.

The "system" has been expanded by some writers, such as conceiving of negative values as measures of the ugliness required to ''beach'' a thousand ships. Writing a humorous article about the concept, [[David Goines]] considered a range of [[metric prefix]]es to the unit, ranging from the [[atto-|atto]]&lt;nowiki&gt;helen&lt;/nowiki&gt; (ah) which could merely "light up a [[Lucky Strike|Lucky]] while strolling past a shipyard", to the [[tera-|tera]]&lt;nowiki&gt;helen&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Th) able to "launch the equivalent of one quadrillion Greek warships and make serious inroads on the welfare of the galaxy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goines.net/Writing/HELEN_of_TROY.html |title=On the inefficiency of beauty contests and a suggestion for their modernization |first=David Lance |last=Goines |date=1987-08-04 |access-date=2012-03-18 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical physicist [[Thomas Fink]] defines beauty in ''The Man's Book''&lt;ref name=Fink_2006/&gt; both in terms of ships launched and in terms of the number of women, on average, than whom one woman will be more beautiful. He defines one ''helen'' (H) as the quantity of beauty to be more beautiful than 50&amp;nbsp;million women, the number of women estimated to have been alive in the 12th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;[[BCE]].&lt;ref name=Fink_2006&gt;{{cite book |last=Fink |first=Thomas |title=The Man's Book |location=London, UK |year=2006 |pages=44-45 |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |edition=1st |isbn=978-0297851639 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fink_personal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~tmf20/ |last=Fink |first=Thomas |title=The Man's Book |series=Thomas Fink personal webpage |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=2011-09-05 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fink also defines a related, but smaller unit called a “''helena''” (Ha), based on a [[logarithmic scale]], like the [[Richter scale]], or [[decibel]]s (dB). Ten helena (Ha) is the beauty sufficient for one oarsman (of which 50 are on a ship) to risk his life, or to be the most beautiful of a thousand women. Since the unit is logarithmic on a base of 2, for beauty to increase by 1&amp;nbsp;Ha, a woman must be the most beautiful of twice as many women, so one ''helen'' is equivalent to 25.6&amp;nbsp;Ha. The most beautiful woman who ever lived would score 34.2&amp;nbsp;Ha, the equivalent of 1.34&amp;nbsp;helen, the pick of a dozen women would be 3.6&amp;nbsp;Ha, or 0.14&amp;nbsp;helen.&lt;ref name=Fink_personal/&gt;

The stars are permanent public monuments to achievement in the [[entertainment industry]], bearing the names of a mix of musician, actors, directors, producers, musical and theatrical groups, fictional characters, and others. The Walk of Fame is administered by the '''Hollywood Chamber of Commerce''' and maintained by the self-financing '''Hollywood Historic Trust'''. It is a popular tourist destination, with a reported 10 million visitors in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/06/business/la-fi-walk-of-fame6-2010feb06|title=Golden milestone for the Hollywood Walk of Fame|last=Martín|first=Hugo|date=2010-02-06|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-08-14|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The Walk of Fame runs {{convert|1.3|mi|km}} east to west on Hollywood Boulevard from Gower Street to [[La Brea Avenue]], plus a short segment of Marshfield Way that runs diagonally between Hollywood and La Brea; and {{convert|0.4|mi|km}} north to south on Vine Street between Yucca Street and [[Sunset Boulevard]]. According to a 2003 report by the market research firm NPO Plog Research, the Walk attracts about 10 million visitors annually—more than [[Sunset Strip]], [[TCL Chinese Theatre]] (formerly Grauman's), the ''[[RMS Queen Mary|Queen Mary]]'', and the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]—and has played an important role in making tourism the largest industry in [[Los Angeles County]].&lt;ref name="Martin1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/06/business/la-fi-walk-of-fame6-2010feb06|title=Golden milestone for the Hollywood Walk of Fame|last=Martin|first=Hugo|date=February 8, 2010|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate= March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origin===
[[File:Hollywood boulevard from kodak theatre.jpg|thumb|The Walk of Fame at the 6800 block of Hollywood Boulevard, looking eastward. The Dolby Theatre is in the foreground at left. In the upper left quadrant is the famous intersection of [[Hollywood and Highland Center]].]]

The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce credits E.M. Stuart, its volunteer president in 1953, with the original idea for creating a Walk of Fame. Stuart reportedly proposed the Walk as a means to "maintain the glory of a community whose name means glamour and excitement in the four corners of the world."&lt;ref name="historyof"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Walk of Fame|work=walkoffame.com|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/history|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harry Sugarman, another Chamber member and president of the Hollywood Improvement Association, receives credit in an independent account.&lt;ref name="LA Magazine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rozbrook|first=Roslyn|issue=February 1998|title=The Real Mr. Hollywood|magazine=Los Angeles Magazine|page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=hollywood+walk+of+fame+sugarman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kTJtZiIYoY&amp;sig=I0BEDzh683qM-TtIGpO7hhYmEBA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RiAMTLSVMsT68Aa7pNSKBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hollywood%20walk%20of%20fame%20sugarman&amp;f=false|accessdate=June 6, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee was formed to flesh out the idea, and an architectural firm was retained to develop specific proposals. By 1955 the basic concept and general design had been agreed upon, and plans were submitted to the [[Los Angeles City Council]].

Multiple accounts exist for the origin of the star concept. According to one, the historic [[Hollywood Hotel]]—which stood for more than 50 years on Hollywood Boulevard at the site now occupied by the [[Hollywood and Highland|Hollywood and Highland complex]] and the [[Dolby Theatre|Dolby (formerly Kodak) Theatre]]&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Courtney (June 11, 2012) [https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/11/entertainment-us-oscars-dolby-idUSBRE85A1MH20120611 "Out with Kodak, in with Dolby at home of Oscars"].

In February 1956 a prototype was unveiled featuring a [[caricature]] of an example honoree ([[John Wayne]], by some accounts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=David|title=The Whole Equation: A History of Hollywood|publisher=Vintage|year=2006|isbn=0-375-70154-0|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;) inside a blue star on a brown background.&lt;ref name="historyof"/&gt; However, caricatures proved too expensive and difficult to execute in brass with the technology available at the time; and the brown and blue motif was vetoed by [[Charles E. Toberman]], the legendary real estate developer known as "Mr. Hollywood", because the colors clashed with a new building he was erecting on Hollywood Boulevard.&lt;ref name="historyof"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Gregory Paul|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9W4R_CZtFe8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Story of Hollywood: An Illustrated History|publisher=BL Press|isbn=978-0-9776299-0-9|accessdate=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection and construction===
By March 1956 the final design and coral-and-charcoal color scheme had been approved, and between the spring of 1956 and the fall of 1957, 1,558 honorees were selected by committees representing the four major branches of the entertainment industry at that time: motion pictures, television, audio recording, and radio. The committees met at the [[Brown Derby]] restaurant,&lt;ref name="ap2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/preview/articles/0630walkoffame0630.html&lt;!-- was http://www.azcentral.com/ent/movies/articles/0630walkoffame0630.html--&gt;|title= Price of Fame in Hollywood? $15,000|author=Cohen, Sandy|newspaper=The Arizona Republic|date=June 30, 2006|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included such prominent names as [[Cecil B. DeMille]], [[Samuel Goldwyn]], [[Jesse L. Lasky]], [[Walt Disney]], [[Hal Roach]], [[Mack Sennett]], and [[Walter Lantz]].&lt;ref name="historyof"/&gt;
[[File:hwof joanne woodward.jpg|thumb|left|Woodward's star, contrary to popular belief, was not the first.]] 
A requirement stipulated by the original audio recording committee (and later rescinded) specified minimum sales of one million records or 250,000 albums for all music category nominees. The committee soon realized that many important recording artists would be excluded from the Walk by that requirement. As a result, the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] was formed for the purpose of creating a separate award system for the music business. The first [[Grammy Award]]s were presented in Beverly Hills in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aSBAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z1gMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3612,4838071&amp;dq=paul+weston+grammy&amp;hl=en|title=Bronze Stars Begot Grammy|date=February 22, 1976|page=13|newspaper=The Robesonian|location=Lumberton, N.C.|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the Walk began in 1958 but two lawsuits delayed completion. The first was filed by local property owners challenging the legality of the [[United States dollar|$]]1.25 million tax assessment levied upon them to pay for the Walk, along with new street lighting and trees. In October 1959 the assessment was ruled legal.&lt;ref name="historyof"/&gt; The second lawsuit, filed by [[Charles Chaplin Jr.]], sought damages for the exclusion of his father, whose nomination had been withdrawn due to pressure from multiple quarters (see [[Hollywood Walk of Fame#Controversial additions|Controversial additions]]). Chaplin's suit was dismissed in 1960, paving the way for completion of the project.&lt;ref name="historyof"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/167734333.html?FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Aug%2011,%201960&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los%20Angeles%20Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Judge%20Refuses%20Chaplin%20Walk%20of%20Fame%20Request |title=Judge Refuses Chaplin Walk of Fame Request|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 11, 1960|page=B2|accessdate=June 11, 2010}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimesWhy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/#no-love|title=Why doesn't Clint Eastwood have a star?|accessdate=May 20, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Joanne Woodward]] is often singled out as the first to receive a star on the Walk of Fame,&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"&gt;{{cite news|last=Thermos|first=Wendy|date=July 22, 2005|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/22/local/me-explainer22|title=Sidewalk Shrine to Celebrities Twinkles With Stars|page=2|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fact there was no "first" recipient; the original stars were installed as a continuous project, with no individual ceremonies. Woodward's name was one of eight drawn at random from the original 1,558 and inscribed on eight prototype stars that were built while litigation was still holding up permanent construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Conklin |first=Ellis E. |date=October 30, 1986 |title=Hollywood's Walk On The Mild Side Of Fame |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |agency=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-10-30/features/8603210766_1_hollywood-chamber-gower-street-star-struck-admirers |accessdate=October 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62cOVuGc1?url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-10-30/features/8603210766_1_hollywood-chamber-gower-street-star-struck-admirers |archivedate=October 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;!-- full text--&gt; (, [https://www.webcitation.org/62cPccSwV?url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-10-30/features/8603210766_1_hollywood-chamber-gower-street-star-struck-admirers/2 p.2])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LA&amp;p_theme=la&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EF5107276D88A24&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|date=October 26, 1986|newspaper=[[Daily News of Los Angeles]] (CA)|title=Walk of Whimsy|publisher=Knight-Ridder, Mediastream}} {{subscription required}} ([https://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=revered%2Bhollywood%2Bwalk%2Bof%2Bfame+drawn+from+a+hat+&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;btnG=Search+Archives text verif.])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ellis|last=Conklin|agency=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|title=Top Stars Missing on Hall of Fame|newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=October 30, 1986|page=D17|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jsAyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=je8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1318,5172428&amp;dq=star+grant+said+they+did+and+on+feb&amp;hl=en}} (Google news archive)&lt;/ref&gt;  The eight prototypes were installed temporarily on the northwest corner of Hollywood Boulevard and [[Highland Avenue (Los Angeles)|Highland Avenue]] in August 1958 to generate publicity and to demonstrate how the Walk would eventually look.&lt;ref name="historyof"/&gt; The other seven names were [[Olive Borden]], [[Ronald Colman]], [[Louise Fazenda]], [[Preston Foster]], [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Edward Sedgwick]], and [[Ernest Torrence]].&lt;ref name="historyof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wana"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hollywood 1940–2008|first=Marc|last=Wanamaker |publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HuxSatXQwm4C&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=18|isbn=978-0-7385-5923-0|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official groundbreaking took place on February 8, 1960.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt; On March 28, 1960, the first permanent star, director [[Stanley Kramer]]'s, was completed on the easternmost end of the new Walk near the intersection of Hollywood and Gower.&lt;ref name="historyof"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/167580204.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Mar%2029,%201960&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los%20Angeles%20Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=KRAMER%20FIRST%20NAME%20PUT%20IN%20WALK%20OF%20FAME |title=Kramer First Name Put in Walk of Fame|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 29, 1960|page=15|accessdate=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joanne Woodward legend may have originated, according to one source, because she was the first to pose with her star for photographers.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"/&gt;

===Stagnation and revitalization===

Though the Walk was originally conceived in part to encourage redevelopment of Hollywood Boulevard, the 1960s and 1970s were periods of protracted urban decay in the Hollywood area as residents moved to suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shuitt|first=Doug|date=April 16, 1972|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/156913667.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Apr%2016,%201972&amp;author=DOUG%20SHUIT&amp;pub=Los%20Angeles%20Times%20%281923-Current%20File%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=AB&amp;desc=Hollywood%20Blvd.---The%20Old%20Glamor%20Has%20Vanished |title=Hollywood Blvd.---The Old Glamor Has Vanished|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vincent1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Vincent, Roger|date=May 6, 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/06/business/fi-hollyangst6|title=Neighborhood face-lift gives Hollywood pause|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the initial installation of approximately 1,500 stars in 1960 and 1961, eight years&lt;!-- [[WP:CALC]] --&gt; passed without the addition of a new star. In 1962 the Los Angeles City Council passed an ordinance naming the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce "the agent to advise the City" about adding names to the Walk, and the Chamber, over the following six years, devised rules, procedures, and financing methods to do so.&lt;ref name="historyof"/&gt;

During construction of tunnels for the [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Los Angeles subway system]] in 1996, the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] removed and stored more than 300 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rescuing Elvis : Roadwork steals shine from icon's 'flaming star'|first=David |last=Bloom |publisher=Los Angeles ''Daily News'' |date=December 4, 1996 |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/RESCUING+ELVIS+%3a+ROADWORK+STEALS+SHINE+FROM+ICON%27S+%60FLAMING+STAR%27.-a084034046

===Restoration===
In 2008 a long-term restoration project began with an evaluation of all 2,365 stars on the Walk at the time, each receiving a letter grade of A, B, C, D, or F. Honorees whose stars received F grades, indicating the most severe damage, were [[Joan Collins]], [[Peter Frampton]], [[Dick Van Patten]], [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]], [[Andrew L. Stone]], [[Willard Waterman]], [[Richard Boleslavsky]], [[Ellen Drew]], [[Frank Crumit]], and [[Bobby Sherwood]]. Fifty celebrities' stars received "D" grades. The damage ranged from minor cosmetic flaws caused by normal weathering to holes and fissures severe enough to constitute a walking hazard. At least 778 stars will eventually be repaired or replaced during the ongoing project at an estimated cost of $4 million to $4.2 million.&lt;ref name="LAT22"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pool|first=Bob|date=July 22, 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/22/local/me-walk22|title=Walk of Fame going to have a little work done|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The restoration is a collaboration among the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and various Los Angeles city and county governmental offices, along with the MTA, which operates the [[Red Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Red Line]] that runs beneath the Walk, since earth movement due to the presence of the subway line is thought to be partly responsible for the damage.&lt;ref name="WOFfix"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pool|first=Bob|date=July 17, 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/17/local/me-walk17|title=Walk of Fame fix won't be easy stroll|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversial additions===
[[File:Walk of fames Charlie.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photograph of Charlie Chaplin's star on the Walk of Fame|Charlie Chaplin's star, selected in 1956, installed in 1972]]
[[Charlie Chaplin]] is the only honoree to be selected twice for the same star on the Walk. He was unanimously voted into the initial group of 500 in 1956 but the Selection Committee ultimately excluded him, ostensibly due to questions regarding his morals (he had been charged with violating the [[Mann Act]]—and exonerated—during the [[Sexual slavery#White slavery|White Slavery]] hysteria of the 1940s&lt;ref&gt;"When the not-guilty verdict was handed down, the courtroom audience cheered.

BBC. Retrieved May 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The rebuke prompted an unsuccessful lawsuit by his son, Charles Chaplin Jr. His star was finally added to the Walk in 1972, the same year he received his [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]];&lt;ref name="LATimesWhy"/&gt; but even then, 16 years later, the Chamber of Commerce received angry letters from across the country protesting its decision to include him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shuit|first=Doug|date=April 9, 1972|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/156973192.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Apr%209,%201972&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los%20Angeles%20Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc= |title=Bitterness Survives 20 Years&amp;nbsp;– They Haven't Given Up – Letter Writers Assail Chaplin|newspaper=Los Angeles Times (archive)|page=B2|accessdate=August 31, 2010}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee's Chaplin difficulties reportedly contributed to its decision in 1978 against awarding a star to [[Paul Robeson]], a controversial opera singer, actor, athlete, writer, lawyer, and social activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=David|title=The Whole Equation: A History of Hollywood|publisher=Vintage|year=2006|isbn=0-375-70154-0|pages=164–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting outcry from the entertainment industry, civic circles, local and national politicians, and many other quarters was so intense that the decision was reversed and Robeson was awarded a star in 1979.&lt;ref name="Qualles"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Qualles|first=Paris H.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RojdPXqpnC4C&amp;pg=PA297&amp;lpg=PA297|title=What Price a Star?

Following sexual assault allegations involving comedian [[Bill Cosby]], actor [[Kevin Spacey]], reality television host and U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], and producer-director [[Brett Ratner]], the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce released a statement regarding inquiries as to the removal of stars:&lt;ref name="star.removal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/hollywood-chamber-commerce-no-plans-remove-walk-fame-stars-amid-sexual-harassment-scandals-173303074.html|title=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has no plans to remove Walk of Fame stars amid sexual misconduct scandals|work=Yahoo!|last=Ryder|first=Taryn|date=November 15, 2017|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has received inquiries asking whether we are planning to remove the stars of Walk of Famers because of alleged misconduct. The answer is no ... The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a registered historic landmark. Once a star has been added to the Walk, it is considered a part of the historic fabric of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Because of this, we have never removed a star from the Walk.&lt;ref name=star.removal/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On August 6, 2018, the West Hollywood City Council passed a resolution asking for the removal of the star for Donald Trump, after repeated vandalism to the site. The Mayor of West Hollywood, John Duran, stated that "the council unanimously passes the resolution to remove his star"; however, the West Hollywood City Council has no jurisdiction over the Walk of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Emily |title=Council Fight To 'Totally Remove' Donald Trump's Hollywood Star |url=https://www.unilad.co.uk/news/council-fight-to-totally-remove-donald-trumps-hollywood-star/ |website=Unilad |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stars with the same name===
Two pairs of stars share identical names representing different people. There are two Harrison Ford stars, honoring [[Harrison Ford (silent film actor)|the silent film actor]] (at 6665 Hollywood Boulevard), and [[Harrison Ford|the present-day actor]] (in front of the Dolby Theatre at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard). Two Michael Jackson stars represent the [[Michael Jackson|singer/dancer/songwriter]] (at 6927 Hollywood Boulevard), and the [[Michael Jackson (radio commentator)|radio personality]] (at 1597 Vine Street). When the recording artist Jackson died in 2009, fans mistakenly began leaving flowers, candles, and other tributes at the Vine Street star.&lt;ref name="LAistMJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laist.com/2009/06/25/fans_gather_around_the_other_michae.php|title=Fans gather around the other Michael Jackson's star|first=Zach|last=Behrens|date=June 29, 2010|publisher=LAist.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916024937/http://laist.com/2009/06/25/fans_gather_around_the_other_michae.php|archivedate=September 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon learning of this, the radio host wrote on his website, "I am willingly loan[ing] it to him and, if it would bring him back, he can have it."&lt;ref name="MJTalk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaeljacksontalkradio.com/MJ_Journals/MJs_09_0625.html|last=Jackson|first=Michael|title=Michael Jackson Talk Radio Content, June 25, 2009|work=M J Journals blog|publisher=MichaelJacksonTalkRadio.com|date=June 25, 2009|accessdate=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walk of Fame rules prohibit consideration of nominees whose contributions fall outside the five major entertainment categories, but the selection committee has been known to conjure some interesting rule interpretations to justify a selection. The Walk's four round Moon landing monuments at the corners of Hollywood and Vine, for example, officially recognize the [[Apollo 11]] astronauts for "contributions to the television industry". Johnny Grant acknowledged, in 2005, that classifying the first Moon landing as a television entertainment event was "a bit of a stretch". [[Magic Johnson]]'s considerable [[basketball]] skills had no direct connection to movies, music, TV, radio, or theater, but the committee added him to the motion picture category, based on his ownership of the [[Magic Johnson Theatres|Magic Johnson Theatre]] chain, citing as precedent [[Sid Grauman]], builder of Grauman's (now [[TCL Chinese Theatre|TCL]]) Chinese Theatre.  "[Now] people want [[Orville Redenbacher]]," Grant quipped in the 2005 interview, "because his popcorn is in all the theaters."&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"/&gt;

[[Muhammad Ali]]'s star was granted after the committee decided that [[boxing]] could be considered a form of "live performance". Its placement, on a wall of the Dolby Theatre, makes it the only star mounted on a vertical surface, acceding to Ali's request that his name (and by extension his namesake, the Islamic prophet Muhammad) not be walked upon.&lt;ref name="Jet111"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christian|first=Margena A.|title=How Do You Really Get A Star On The Hollywood Walk Of Fame? |journal=[[Jet Magazine]] |volume=111 |issue=15 |date=April 16, 2007 |pages=25, 29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Star for the Greatest |journal=[[Jet Magazine]] |volume=101 |issue=6 |page=52 |date=January 28, 2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2LQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52 |accessdate=September 22, 2010|via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few star recipients moved on after their entertainment careers to political notability. Two [[Presidents of the United States]], [[Ronald Reagan]] (40th President) and [[Donald Trump]] (45th President) have stars on the Walk. Reagan is also one of two [[Governor of California|Governors of California]] with a star; the other is [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref&gt;Warner, GA (October 28, 2010): Ronald Reagan sites in Southern California.

[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]], who served as Prime Minister of Poland between the World Wars, is the only European [[head of government]] represented. Film and stage actor [[Albert Dekker]] served one term in the [[California State Assembly]] during the 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Autopsy Performed on Actor Albert Dekker |date=May 7, 1968|work=The Los Angeles Times|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was notable for his outspoken public criticism of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s anti-communism demagoguery, leading to his [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisting]].&lt;ref name="hare"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hare|first=William |title=L.A.

On its 50th anniversary in 2005, [[Disneyland]] received a star adjacent to the Walk of Fame near Disney's Soda Fountain on Hollywood Boulevard. While not technically part of the Hollywood Walk of Fame (a city ordinance prohibits putting corporate names on sidewalks), the star was installed adjacent to the Walk of Fame, and was thought of by [[Johnny Grant (radio personality)|Johnny Grant]], the proverbial "Mayor of Hollywood." [[Roger Ebert]] said of the star "If you stop to think about what Disneyland has achieved and what a revolutionary idea it was to begin with, of course it deserve[s] a star." In lieu of the traditional icon indicating the specific achievement(s) of the honoree, Disneyland's star has an icon of [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]], and a plaque beneath the star reading: "Award of Excellence Special achievement for 50 years of magical entertainment Hollywood Historic Trust July 14, 2005. Johnny Grant, Chairman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disneyland to get star treatment|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/13/entertainment/et-walkfame13|website=L.A. Times|publisher=L.A.

===Fictional characters and their creators===
{{main|List of fictional characters with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame}}
[[File:Mickey Mouse star in Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|left|alt=closeup of Mickey Mouse star, showing title and Motion Picture emblem|Mickey Mouse's star was the first awarded to an animated character]]
In 1978, in honor of his 50th anniversary, [[Mickey Mouse]] became the first animated character to receive a star. Other animated recipients are [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Donald Duck]], [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Woody Woodpecker]], [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]], [[Tinker Bell]], [[Winnie the Pooh (Disney character)|Winnie the Pooh]], [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]], [[The Simpsons]], the [[Rugrats]], and [[Snoopy]]. The star inscribed [[Charlie Tuna]] honors not the animated advertising mascot, but Art Ferguson, the long-time radio personality and game show announcer.

Other fictional characters on the Walk include the Munchkins (as mentioned), two individual [[The Muppets|Muppets]] ([[Kermit the Frog]] and [[Big Bird]]) and the Muppets as a group, one monster ([[Godzilla]]), and three non-animated canine characters ([[Strongheart]], [[Lassie]], and [[Rin Tin Tin]]).

Ten stars recognize cartoonists and animators: Walt Disney, [[Chuck Jones]], [[Friz Freleng]], Walter Lantz, [[Hanna–Barbera]], [[Charles M. Schulz]], [[Jay Ward]], [[Dr. Seuss]], [[Matt Groening]] and [[John Lasseter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bacalzo|first=Dan|title=Richard Burton, Hal David, Patricia Heaton, Scarlett Johansson, et al. to Be 2012 Walk of Fame Honorees|url=http://www.theatermania.com/los-angeles/news/06-2011/richard-burton-hal-david-patricia-heaton-scarlett_38362.html|publisher=Theater Mania|accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three puppeteers have stars: [[Edgar Bergen]], [[Jim Henson]] and [[Shari Lewis]], as does [[Fran Allison]], who appeared with [[Burr Tillstrom]]'s puppets on the TV show ''[[Kukla, Fran and Ollie]]''.

===Star locations===
Locations of individual stars are not necessarily random or arbitrary. Stars of most legendary and world-famous celebrities—the so-called "show business royalty"—are found in front of TCL (formerly Grauman's) Chinese Theatre. Oscar-winners' stars are usually placed near the Dolby Theatre, site of the annual [[Academy Awards]] presentations. Decisions are occasionally made with a dollop of whimsy: [[Mike Myers]]'s star, for example, lies in front of an adult store called the International Love Boutique, an association with his [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] roles; [[Roger Moore]]'s star is located at 7007 Hollywood Boulevard in recognition of his seven [[James Bond 007]] films; [[Ed O'Neill]]'s star is located outside a shoe store in reference to his character's occupation on the TV show ''[[Married ... with Children]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ed-oneills-walk-of-fame-star-in-front-of-shoe-store/ &lt;!-- was http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20099294-10391698.html--&gt; |title=Ed O'Neill's Walk of Fame star in front of shoe store – Celebrity Circuit |publisher=CBS News |date= |accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the last star, at the very end of the westernmost portion of the Walk, belongs to The [[Dead End Kids]].

Honorees may request a specific location for their star, although final decisions remain with the Chamber.&lt;ref name = "Q&amp;A"/&gt;  [[Jay Leno]], for example, requested a spot near the corner of Hollywood Blvd. and Highland Ave. because he was twice picked up at that location by police for [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] (though never actually charged) shortly after his arrival in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/leno-returns-to-scene-of-crime-for-hollywood-honor.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=leno-returns-to-scene-of-crime-for-hollywood-honor-2000-04-29 Leno returns to scene of crime for Hollywood honor].

The theater manager fired her on the spot for "insubordination" and humiliated her by stripping the epaulets from her uniform in the theater lobby. Twenty-six years later, at her request, Burnett's star was placed at the corner of Hollywood and Wilcox—in front of the theater.&lt;ref name="Burnett"&gt;{{cite book|title=One More Time|last=Burnett|first=Carol|authorlink=Carol Burnett|year=1986|publisher=Random House|location=New York |isbn=0-394-55254-7|edition=first|pages=194–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mistake was fixed, but years later the television actor [[Dan Haggerty]] (of ''[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams|Grizzly Adams]]'' fame, no relation to Don) also received a star.

Four of the stars, which weigh about {{convert|300|lb|kg}} each, have been stolen from the Walk of Fame. In 2000, [[James Stewart]]'s and [[Kirk Douglas]]' stars disappeared from their locations near the intersection of Hollywood and Vine, where they had been temporarily removed for a construction project. Police recovered them in the suburban community of [[South Gate, California|South Gate]] when they arrested a man involved in an incident there and searched his house. The suspect was a construction worker employed on the Hollywood and Vine project. The stars had been badly damaged, and had to be remade. One of [[Gene Autry]]'s five stars (it is not clear which one) was also stolen from a construction area. Johnny Grant later received an anonymous phone tip that the missing star was in Iowa, but it was never found. "Someday, it will end up on eBay," Grant once joked. The most brazen and ambitious theft occurred in 2005 when thieves used a [[concrete saw]] to remove  [[Gregory Peck]]'s star from its Hollywood Boulevard site at the intersection of North El Centro Avenue, near North Gower. The star was replaced almost immediately, but the original was never recovered and the perpetrators never caught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pool|first=Bob|date=November 30, 2005|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/30/local/me-star30|title=A Star is Torn from Boulevard|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was commissioned in 1993 by the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency Art Program and created by the architect, production designer, and film director [[Catherine Hardwicke]] as a tribute to the multi-ethnic women of Hollywood.&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt; The gazebo is a stainless steel stylized [[Art Deco]] lattice structure. The roof is an arched square supporting a circular dome, which is topped by a central [[obelisk]] with descending [[Neon sign|neon]] block letters spelling "Hollywood" on each of its four sides. Atop the obelisk is a small gilded weathervane-style sculpture of [[Marilyn Monroe]] in her iconic billowing skirt pose from ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justabovesunset.com/photography/html/the_silver_women.html "The Silver Women" (photo montage)].

The gazebo was dedicated on February 1, 1994, to a mixed reception. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' art critic Christopher Knight called it "the most depressingly awful work of public art in recent years", representing the opposite of Hardwicke's intended tribute to women. "Sex, as a woman's historic gateway to Hollywood", he wrote, "couldn't be more explicitly described".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knight|first=Christopher|date=January 19, 1994|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-19/entertainment/ca-13098_1_la-brea-gateway|title=Caution: Bad Art Up Ahead|newspaper=Los Angeles Times (archives)|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent writer and film producer Gail Choice called it a fitting tribute to a group of pioneering and courageous women who "carried a tremendous burden on their feminine shoulders.

==Nomination process==
[[File:JamesCameronStarDec09.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Director James Cameron squats by his new star, left hand propping up his plaque|Director [[James Cameron]] unveiling his star, 2009]]
Each year an average of 200 nominations are submitted to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce Walk of Fame selection committee. Anyone, including fans, can nominate anyone active in the field of entertainment as long as the nominee or his or her management approves the nomination (a letter of agreement from the nominated celebrity or representative must accompany the application). Nominees must have a minimum of five years' experience in the category for which they are nominated and a history of "charitable contributions."&lt;ref name="Jet111"/&gt; Posthumous nominees must have been deceased at least five years. At a meeting each June, the committee selects approximately 20 to 24 celebrities to receive stars on the Walk of Fame. One posthumous award is given each year as well. The nominations of those not selected are rolled over to the following year for reconsideration; those not selected two years in a row are dropped, and must be renominated to receive further consideration. Living recipients must agree to personally attend a presentation ceremony within two years of selection. If the ceremony is not scheduled within two years, a new application must be submitted. A relative of deceased recipients must attend posthumous presentations. Presentation ceremonies are open to the public.&lt;ref name="WOFFAQ"/&gt;

A fee of $40,000 ({{as of|2018|lc=y}}),&lt;ref name="Nominations process"/&gt; payable at time of selection, is collected to pay for the creation and installation of the star, as well as general maintenance of the Walk of Fame. The fee is usually paid by the nominating organization, which may be a fan club, or a film studio, record company, broadcaster, or other sponsor involved with the prospective honoree.&lt;ref name="ap2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson-Evans, Catherine (December 3, 2003).

Numerous major entertainment figures and legendary show business acts are not included on the Walk of Fame for a variety of reasons. Some, such as [[Julia Roberts]]&lt;ref name = "Q&amp;A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UPITen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/News_Photos/Entertainment/Ten-celebrities-who-deserve-the-Walk-of-Fame-more-than-Tinker-Bell/3855/1 |title=Ten celebrities who deserve the Walk of Fame more than Tinker Bell |publisher=Upi.com |date= |accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clint Eastwood]],&lt;ref name="UPITen"/&gt; have declined to participate; nominations cannot proceed without the nominee's consent. Others, such as [[George Clooney]] and [[John Denver]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/ask-stargirl "Dear Stargirl: Hollywood's Stargirl has the answers"] Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.

Probability also plays a role as only about 10% of nominees are selected each year.

Traditionally, the identities of selection committee members, other than its chairman, have not been made public in order to minimize conflicts of interest and to discourage lobbying by celebrities and their representatives (a significant problem during the original selections in the late 1950s). However, in 1999, in response to intensifying charges of secrecy in the selection process, the chamber disclosed the members' names: Johnny Grant, the longtime chair and representative of the television category; [[Earl Lestz]], president of [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studio Group]] (motion pictures); Stan Spero, retired manager with broadcast stations [[KMPC]] and [[KABC (AM)|KABC]] (radio); Kate Nelson, owner of the [[Avalon Hollywood|Palace Theatre]] (live performance); and Mary Lou Dudas, vice president of [[A&amp;M Records]] (recording industry).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pool|first=Bob|date=January 6, 1999|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jan/06/local/me-60983|title=Hollywood Tries to Help Stars Shine|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that 1999 announcement the chamber has revealed only that Lestz (who received his own star in 2004) became chairman after Grant died in 2008. Their current official position is that "each of the five categories is represented by someone with expertise in that field."&lt;ref name="WOFFAQ"/&gt;

In 2010, Lestz was replaced as chairman by John Pavlik, former Director of Communications for the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://photos.presslist.oscars.org/listanevent.php?events=781 "Academy Appoints Unger Communications Chief"].

A [[Pink Floyd pigs|giant inflatable pig]] has been one of the staple [[Theatrical property|props]] of [[Pink Floyd live performances]] since 1977 when the album [[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|''Animals'']] was released. After [[Roger Waters]] departed [[Pink Floyd]] in 1985, he continued to use the pig as a show element during his solo live performances.

==''The Dark Side of the Moon Live'' tour 2006–2007==
Roger Waters used inflatable pigs at many shows on his 2006–2007 tour ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon Live]]'', specifically, when he performed the song "[[Sheep (song)|Sheep]]", concluding the first part of the show. The pigs used on tour were decorated with [[slogans]] and pieces of song lyrics, and with various drawings. During select performances at open-air venues the pig was released to "fly" away, a reference to the idiom "Pigs might fly".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordadvancedlearnersdictionary.com/dictionary/pig_1 pig – Definition and pronunciation | Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HollywoodBowlPig.JPG|right|thumb|A pig entering Hollywood Bowl before being walked through and then released into the Los Angeles sky during Waters' show of 5 October.]]
*5 October 2006, at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in Hollywood: [[slogans]] decorating the pig included "[[Kafka]] Rules OK!" on the pig's side, "[[Impeach]] [[George W. Bush|Bush]] Now", on the pig's backside, and "[[I Have a Dream|Free at Last]]", written on the pig's underbelly. Handlers released the pig into the night sky. Afterwards, authorities informed Waters that he would face charges if it was attempted again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The pig was released again at the Shoreline Amphitheatre show in Mountain View the following week, on 10 October.

*9 February 2007, at [[Perth Oval]] in [[Perth]], Australia: the pig was again walked through the audience, then released, apparently deliberately. It was decorated with many slogans, including "Bring [[David Hicks]] home." It was followed by [[Searchlight|spotlight]] as it rose through the night sky and eventually landed in a swimming pool about {{convert|15|km|miles}} away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===2007 Latin American tour dates===
* In [[Mexico City]], the pig had the message "Cerdo Bush derriba el muro de la frontera" ("PIG BUSH, DEMOLISH THE BORDER WALL"). The pig was released into the sky and was found in the nearby area of Azcapotzalco two days later.
* In [[Bogotá, Colombia]], the pig featured the following slogans: "El patrón Bush visita el rancho de Colombia" (The landlord Bush visits the Colombian ranch)&lt;ref name="concierto"&gt;http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-3469125 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="visita"&gt;http://www.elblablabla.com/article/l5207 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; a clear reference to Bush's visit to the country only two days later,&lt;ref name="visita"/&gt; "Libres al fin"&lt;ref name="concierto"/&gt; (Free at last) on the pig's belly, "El miedo construye paredes" (Fear Builds Walls), and "[[Franz Kafka|Kafka]] manda" (Kafka rules) on one leg, while also having peace symbols, the word "amor" (love) on his right hind foot, and the words "lechona Bush" (roasted pig Bush) on the pig's buttocks, as well as its sides reading "Devuélvanle la tierra a la gente" (Give the people back their land), and "Legalizen las drogas" (Legalize drugs),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/31515558@N00/417868256/ Visita | Flickr – Photo Sharing!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/drayru/417868253/in/photostream/ Fear | Flickr – Photo Sharing!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/drayru/420193757/in/photostream/ ¡Libre por Fin! | Flickr – Photo Sharing!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; referencing the problem of refugees, the traffic of illegal substances and poor distribution of land in Colombia. The pig vanished into the night during the bridge of "Sheep".
* In [[Lima]], the message for Peruvians was "Todos los peruanos somos iguales, no a la discriminación" (All peruvians are equal, no discrimination), due to one of the main problems in Peruvian society, discrimination against andean people, afroperuvians, gays and lesbians and others. Other messages included: "Stop Bush" and "Kafka rules".&lt;ref name="Video"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwkIYSgvLA&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Santiago]], Chile, the pig had the following messages: "Socialismo al servicio de las S.A."(''Socialism in service of the corporations''), "Libre al fin" ("[[I Have a Dream|Free at Last]]"), "Sin TAG" (''Without TAG''), "Va a nevar en el espacio, la [[NASA]] no lo sabe" (''It's going to snow in space, NASA doesn't know''), "Sorpresas de la democracia, la basura sale a flote" (''Surprises of democracy, trash rises to the top''), "Push [[George W. Bush|Bush]] contra la muralla" (''Push Bush up against the wall'', perhaps a reference to the lyrics of [[In the Flesh (Pink Floyd song)|In the Flesh]]), "¿Fey? ¿Iñ chiñ? ¿El? ¿Nosotros? Tristes metáforas" (''He? We all?'' in [[Mapudungun]], then ''He? We all? Sad metaphors'' in Spanish), "[[Víctor Jara]] no calla" (''Víctor Jara won't be silenced''), and "[[mass-energy equivalence|E=MCool]]". Some of the messages were authored by Chilean poets [[Nicanor Parra]], [[Elicura Chihuailaf]], and [[Diego Maquieira]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The pig was released at the end of "Sheep".
* In [[Buenos Aires]] the pig had different messages, like "¿Donde esta Julio Lopez?" (Where's Julio Lopez, a missing witness in a [[political trial]]), "El miedo crea paredes" (Fear creates walls), "Bush go home", "Corte Aqui" (cut here) next to a dotted line around the neck and "[[Kafka]] rules OK", among others.
* In [[São Paulo]], the pig bore messages such as "All we need is education", "Bush, não estamos à venda!" (Portuguese for "[[George W. Bush|Bush]], we're not for sale!"), "Killers, leave our kids alone" (a reference to [[João Hélio Fernandes Vieites]], a young boy who had been recently murdered in a [[Motor vehicle theft]]) and "Ordem e Progresso?", a pun with the inscription of the Brazilian flag which reads "Order and Progresso" (Order and Progress) without the [[question mark]].

===2007 European tour dates===
*3 May 2007, [[Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy]], Paris, France "What an asshole", "[[Le Pen (surname)|Le Pen]]" "Enculés", "All religions divide us".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brain-damage.co.uk/2007-tour-zone/may-3rd-palais-omnisports-de-bercy-paris-france.html Review and verifiable photo].&lt;/ref&gt;
*12 May 2007, at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]], London; in addition to much of the above, ('Stop Bush…', 'Nearly a laugh…', '[[Dick Cheney]]… asshole!'), the mention of [[Tony Blair]] had an arrow from the underside where ''good riddance'' had been added—Blair had announced the timetable for his resignation the day before the [[Gig (musical performance)|gig]]. Additionally, 'All Religions Build Walls' on one side.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB2YvbBqJnY YouTube – Pig flying around to Pink Floyd's Sheep LIVE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

*19 May 2007, In [[Tampa]], Florida: The pig was painted by James Vendetta and released at the [[Ford Amphitheatre (Tampa)|Ford Amphitheater]] despite a 40&amp;nbsp;mph wind. One side read "[[Kafka]] Rules" and "[[Habeas Corpus]] Matters". The other side read "I only answer to God – [[Tony Blair]]". Under the words "I only answer to God" was written "Is this democracy?". Under "Tony Blair" was written, "Good Riddance". On the pig's [[Buttocks|butt]], it said, "[[Impeach]] [[George W. Bush|Bush]] Now". The belly said, "[[Free at last]]". On the throat, "Cut Here" with a dotted line. The pig was paraded through the crowd and released into the sky, but because the pig was not completely inflated it didn't float quickly enough to make it out the venue. The pig finally got tangled up on one of the columns supporting the venue's massive roof and blocked a giant [[LED]] screen for the rest of the show. Roger then said "In the meanwhile, we're gonna try and free that pig!" after the first set.
*30 May 2007, New York City: On the pig's right side: "[[Habeas Corpus]] Matters" and "Fear Builds Walls". On the left side: "[[Torture]] Shames Us All!" and "Religions Divide". On the rear: "Impeach Bush" with a [[peace sign]] over the pig's [[Buttocks|ass]]. Along the neck: "Cut Here" above a dotted line with a spattering of blood. Unlike the two previous pigs, this one had a partial drawing of [[The Wall]] on both sides.
[[Image:RogerWaters HollywoodBowl 13-06-2007 pig.jpg|right|thumb|450px|The pig used at the Hollywood Bowl show on 13 June.]]
*13 June 2007, at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in Hollywood: a pig was walked around, but not released. "Torture shames us all" and "All religions divide" on the right side ("No education" in smaller writing). "Habeus {{sic}} corpus matters", "Fear builds walls" on the left side. "Free at last" on the belly. "Impeach Bush" on the rear. Various [[graffiti]]-style writings all around.
*2 July 2007, at the [[Marcus Amphitheater]] in [[Milwaukee]]: a pig was walked around, and released over Lake Michigan. Similar markings to previous events; may have been the same pig as the earlier Hollywood Bowl performance.

==Live Earth==
7 July 2007: Roger Waters played in [[Live Earth concert, New York City|the New York leg of Live Earth]]. When he began singing "[[The Happiest Days of Our Lives]]" / "[[Another Brick in the Wall#Part 2|Another Brick in the Wall Part 2]]" the pig came out again. It had a more [[cartoon]]ish look, and part of its body appeared as that of the wall. It had the words "[[Together we stand, divided we fall]]" (the last lines of "[[Hey You (Pink Floyd song)|Hey You]]") on one side and "[[SOS]]" on the other. Unlike the SOS logo for Live Earth (which stood for "[[Save Our Selves]]"), the one on the pig said "Save Our Sausages" instead.

===2008 North American tour dates===

====Coachella====
 &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Rogerwaterspig.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Special pig for [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] 27 April 2008.]] --&gt;
*27 April 2008 At the conclusion of the three-day music festival, called [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]], [[Roger Waters]] ended the night, but not before he could release a special white pig. Over 50,000 people were in attendance. The pig was adorned with political messages. One side read "Don't be led to the [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]]", with [[Uncle Sam]] holding two [[cleaver]]s. The other side said "Fear builds walls." The bottom read "[[Barack Obama|Obama]]" with a check besides it, while the butt of the pig read "Impeach Bush" in graffiti lettering. Nearing the end of the first act, during "Sheep", the handlers lost their grip on the pig. Many people in attendance at the concert thought this was planned, but later it was announced that a $10,000 reward with 4 lifetime passes to [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] would be given to whoever found the pig. It was found as "crumpled heaps of shredded, spray-painted plastic" three days later at a nearby [[country club]] in [[La Quinta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mydesert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080429/NEWS01/80429001/1006 Pig found in La Quinta country club]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the pig, a low-flying plane dropped thousands of tiny [[Leaflet (information)|leaflet]]s with the Obama [[Check Mark]] design on the crowd. This caused a problem with the nearby town of [[Indio, California|Indio]], where residents woke up to their town completely littered with trash.

====Denver====
*30 April 2008 The pig appeared during "Sheep" and dropped leaflets with "Obama" with a check box next to his name.

====Dallas====
* On 2 May 2008, Roger Waters' pig appeared during the bridge of the song "Sheep". The pig entered from the left side of the [[SuperPages.com Center]] pavilion and made its way across sections 101 and 102 just in front of the [[Very Important Person|VIP]] boxes.  The pig was then taken out the right-hand side into the lawn-seating area and proceeded to the middle rear of the crowd.  The crowd eventually took control and briefly mobbed the pig before releasing it into the night sky. The pig allegedly travelled to downtown [[Dallas]], where it hit a crane over [[Victory Park, Dallas, Texas|Victory Park]]. The pig for the Dallas show was constructed by artist [[Frank Campagna]]. The dimensions of the pig were 30 × 15 feet.  The front left leg was painted with the words "Fear Builds Walls" over a series of grey bricks.  The left side said "Obama" with a check box next to his name.  Under the Obama "ballot" were the words "Don't Be Led to the Slaughter".  The pig's penis had "Cheney" written on it.  The pig's [[anus]] was adorned with the words "Impeach Bush Now".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufrl3R1E6Sk YouTube – Roger Waters' Pig Flies In Dallas 05.02.08]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs2X6Egg-ak YouTube – Roger Waters' Pig Attacks and Flies Free in Dallas 05.02.08]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJdCquNjpgY YouTube – Pink Floyd – Roger Waters Pig Balloon Attacked]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Houston====
*4 May 2008 The pig appeared and followed much the same path as in Dallas.  The bearers of the pig struggled to keep it controlled while under the roof of the [[Woodlands Pavilion]], due to a combination of [[crosswind]] and [[downdraught]] from overhead fans.  The pig made four complete circles of the lawn-seating section before being released.  One change in the pig's appearance was the absence of the "cut here" line, and the addition of two [[black eyes]] and a number of bruises.  The pig was half pink and had large patches of bricks with graffiti-styled writing on them.  The check mark next to "OBAMA" appears as a dotted edged square. The right side of the pig had the statement "All Religions Divide" written across it.  The left side of the pig showed a [[caricature]] of President [[George W. Bush]] with [[porcine]] features, with the phrase "Only Dimly Aware" next to it—a reference to the song being sung, "Sheep":  ''"Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away / Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air"''.

===2008 European tour dates===

====Landgraaf (The Netherlands)====
*11 May 2008 Waters' pig appeared once again during the song "Sheep". It was pink with texts on both sides. On the bottom "Obama" was written, and "Fear builds walls" on the right side. It was released and floated away into the air.

Forget Israel/Palestine. Waters deployed a classic disgusting medieval anti-Semitic caricature widely used by both Nazi and Soviet propaganda to incite hatred against Jews.".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=8486393&amp;ct=13225101&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August 2013, Waters posted an open letter on his Facebook page in response to Cooper's "entirely predictable resulting rant." Addressing Cooper, Waters wrote, "I hold your outburst to be inflammatory and un-helpful and would suggest it can only impede progress towards peace and understanding between people. It is also extremely insulting to me personally in that you accuse me of being 'Anti Semitic', 'A Jew Hater' and 'Nazi Sympathizer'... I have many very close Jewish friends, one of whom, interestingly enough, is the nephew of the late [[Simon Wiesenthal]]. I am proud of that association; Simon Wiesenthal was a great man... I have often come under attack by the pro Israel lobby because of my support for BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) which I won't go into here... However I will say this, in a functioning theocracy it is almost inevitable that the symbol of the religion becomes confused with the symbol of the state, in this case the State of Israel... Like it or not, the Star of David represents Israel and its policies and is legitimately subject to any and all forms of non-violent protest. To peacefully protest against Israel's racist domestic and foreign policies is NOT ANTI-SEMITIC." Waters also wrote, "For the sake of some perspective. The inflatable pig...has appeared at every Wall Show since September 2010, some 193 shows, yours is the first complaint. Also the pig in question represents evil, and more specifically the evil of errant government. We make a gift of this symbol of repression to the audience at the end of every show and the people always do the right thing. They destroy it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/notes/roger-waters-the-wall/an-open-letter-from-roger-waters/688037331210720], ''An Open Letter from Roger Waters'', 1 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desert Trip Show 2016 &amp; ''Us + Them'' tour 2017-2018==
 
Inflatable pigs were special decorations which have been used by [[Roger Waters]] in his concert when the singer took part in [[Desert Trip]] show on Sunday, October, 9 2016. They were decorated by images and phrases. 
===Inflatable pigs at Desert Trip===
	
Spectators of the concert could see pigs floating above [[Empire Polo Field]] where the event took place. Totally the singer used 3 different pigs in his performance which was watched live by over 75 thousand viewers. In order to control oversized animals the remote control was used. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a49622/lucius-roger-waters-desert-trip Behind the Scenes of Roger Waters's Trump-Searing Desert Trip Set]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/roger-waters-the-who-desert-trip Roger Waters and the Who Close Out Desert Trip&lt;/ref&gt;
	
===Anti-Trump statements===

Inflatable pigs appeared when Roger Waters performed his song “[[Pigs (Three Different Ones)]]”. At this time there was a message for spectators on the huge screen behind the artist. It displayed a number of anti-Trump pictures. And the pig became floating up in the air. It was possible to see a phrase “F…k Trump and his wall”. Roger Waters condemned a candidate from Republican party for presidential elections in the USA [[Donald Trump]] for his statements about other nations, his racist and sexist comments. On the other side of inflatable pig it could see the phrase “Arrogant, lying, racist, sexist”. On other pig it was written “Together We Stand / Divided We Fall”. Viewers saw on a screen Trump wore Ku Klux Klan hood and there could be possible to read word Charade. If someone didn’t understand meaning for the first time, it was enough to watch at the screen once again and to see the phrase “Trump is a pig”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/roger-waters-delivers-politically-charged-desert-trip-performance Roger Waters delivers politically charged Desert Trip performance]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''involuntary narrative''' occurs as a personal reading of symbolic content transmitted by media-saturated environments. Exposure to postmodern nonlinear narratives, performative and mediated audiovisual arts, predisposes the individual to originate layers of symbolic meaning that overlap with socially codified environments.
The '''involuntary narrative''' has neither been constructed by an author of media content, nor read as such by a reader/spectator.

Illusion and displacement are some of the effects resulting in an individual, when connections are drawn between a trigger in one sensory channel and a result in another, virtual and physical states and conditions of one and the same object, media or technology are perceived as a continuum.  
When a purposeful overlap of the physical and the virtual takes place, it could be called [[vireal]] (Gramelsberger, Klein).

The '''involuntary narrative,''' [[hypnagogia]] and the [[Dreamachine]], trigger what is already in the individual by referring to his or her own past history. The '''involuntary narrative''' is accidental and in that differs from both the hypnagogic state and the state induced by the Dreamachine.

Auditive and visual signals, as for example mobile phone ringtones, virtual identity thumbnails, alert sounds, signals and information screens in public transport, adverts displayed in LED screens, constitute stimuli to trigger the occurrence of an involuntary narrative.
Anamnesis, as used by Pascal Broccolichi in his work ''Lexicon:'' ”when a sound, or a sound context, recalls a situation or an environment that has been taken out of its chronology”.&lt;ref&gt;A dictionary of “sound phenomena noted in various contexts with acoustic or psychoacoustic connotations”, published in: Palais de Tokyo/Magazine 09, Summer 2009, Spy Numbers, and available online at this address: http://www.pascalbroccolichi.com/index.php?/projets/lexicon/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Influences==
As the density of visible and audible mass communication in the urban environment increased in the 20th century, historical predecessors of '''involuntary narratives''' emerged. The attempt to create parallel levels of meaning in the perception of the physically real is an objective these predecessors have in common.
Applying the [[cut-up technique]], invented in the 1960s by [[Bryon Gysin]], to text, [[William Burroughs]]&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs, W. S. (1970). The Electronic Revolution. Ubuweb, 2005 edition. http://www.ubu.com/historical/burroughs/electronic_revolution.pdf (accessed 30-09-2010)&lt;/ref&gt; achieved results of new narratives (whose order/sequence had not been put together willingly) which would often yield surprising results, even giving account of future events that were later verified. 
The [[dérive]] (English: drift) developed in the 1950s by the [[Situationists]] is a technique to explore and navigate urban space without preformalized trajectories.
Misreadings of common everyday objects, as used in [[Surrealism]] and [[Dada]], some of no symbolic content, some of highly symbolic content produce results similar to the ones described here, but are always authored.

'''Jaime Duque Park''' is a family-oriented [[amusement park]] located in the [[Tocancipá]] municipality of the [[Metropolitan Area of Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]. The park contains the Jaime Duque Zoo, the Museum of Mankind, as well as replicas of several major locations and buildings from around the world.&lt;ref name="HornerRothkirch2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeremy Horner|author2=Cristóbal von Rothkirch|title=Bogotá from the Air|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sEuS-f0yKQC&amp;pg=PA215|year=2002|publisher=Villegas Asociados|isbn=978-958-8156-22-4|pages=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[monorail]] runs through the park to help get guests from one area to another.&lt;ref name="ShawDennison2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lisa Shaw|author2=Stephanie Dennison|title=Pop Culture Latin America!: Media, Arts, and Lifestyle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqRtnRgMm7wC&amp;pg=PA99|date=January 2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-504-9|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park also has an outdoor stage for live performances. Here, the park has hosted performances by musicians such as [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Jamiroquai]], [[The Killers]], [[David Guetta]], [[Paulina Rubio]] and [[Evanescence]].

==History==
The park first opened on February 27, 1983 and was founded by Jaime Duque Grisales, a personality of Colombian civil aviation and the first head of the [[Avianca]] airline pilots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bogota and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNUTruCz-WIC&amp;pg=PA335|publisher=VerColombia.com|pages=335|id=GGKEY:DE7E8GEAAWR}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to create a cultural and recreational space for the whole family, with the aim of generating profits to help institutions serving families.

==Attractions==
[[File:Parque Jaime Duque 15.JPG|200px|thumbnail|right|Hand of God monument]]
[[USS Ruchamkin (APD-89)|ARC ''Córdoba'']], a ship that was used during [[World War II]],&lt;ref name="HornerRothkirch2002" /&gt; and an Avianca DC6 aircraft are on display.

===Maps and replicas===
The park contains replicas of the [[Taj Mahal]] in India, as well as replicas of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], including the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]], the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]], the [[Temple of Artemis]], and the Pyramids. It also has giant figures, including a large hand holding a globe, which is meant to represent the hand of God.

There is a [[Cartographic relief depiction|relief map]] of Colombia on a scale of 1:25000, located near the aviary. There is also a map of the [[Caribbean Sea]].

===Zoo and aviary===
The park's zoo contains several birds and monkeys as well as species native to South America, such as the [[capybara]].&lt;ref name="Baker2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher P. Baker|title=National Geographic Traveler: Colombia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJ28KAzMbZ8C&amp;pg=PA84|year=2012|publisher=National Geographic|isbn=978-1-4262-0950-5|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wakatá Bio-Park===
This park was inaugurated in 1991. It is managed by Jaime Duque Park under technical and professional supervision from [[La Salle University, Colombia|La Salle University]]. Wakatá is a unit dedicated to conservation activities and environmental education. It trains students from different professions in the study and management of wild species and serves to support environment by providing a foster home for animals that have been confiscated authorities.

The '''Media Diversity Institute''' ('''MDI''') is a London based non-governmental organisation&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Diversity Institute|url=http://www.annalindhfoundation.org/members/media-diversity-institute|website=Anna Lindh Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; working with the media to improve reporting on ethnicity, religion, gender, sexuality and other diversity issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Diversity Institute|url=http://ethicaljournalismnetwork.org/supporters/media-diversity-institute|website=Ethical Journalism Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of MDI is to promote "responsible journalism as a means to improve inter-community relations, increase tolerance and encourage dialogue among individuals and groups coming from different backgrounds."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Diversity Institute|url=https://gfmd.info/en/site/members/886/Media-Diversity-Institute.htm|website=Global Forum for Media Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MDI has worked with organizations such as [[Internews]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&amp;catId=89&amp;newsId=512|title=Media4Diversity: Taking the Pulse of Diversity in the Media|last=|first=|date=March 2009|publisher=European Commission|year=|isbn=978-92-79-12419-8|location=Belgium|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Federation of Journalists]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Article 19]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rupar|first1=Verica|title=Getting the Facts Right: Reporting Ethnicity &amp; Religion|date=2012|publisher=MDI &amp; International Federation of Journalists|location=Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Federation of Journalists]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; MDI is also a member of the [[Ethical Journalism Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reporting on Migration and Refugees Training Workshop for EU Journalists|url=http://ethicaljournalismnetwork.org/reporting-migration-refugees-training-workshop-eu-journalists|website=Ethical Journalism Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
MDI was founded in 1997&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; by journalist Milica Pesic, who was working at the time for NYU Center for War, Peace and the News Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Press Freedom Day 2017|url=http://en.unesco.org/world-press-freedom-day-2017/milica-pesic|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDI works on an international scale, but has a European focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=buXzDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Media and Cultural Policy in the European Union|last=Kretzschmar|first=Sonja|publisher=Rodopi|year=2007|isbn=9789401204156|editor-last=Sarikakis|editor-first=Katharine|location=Amsterdam|pages=215|chapter=Diverse Journalists in a Diverse Europe?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MDI works to engage, educate and train the actors in society who have influence over media coverage of diversity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This includes media decision makers (owners, editors, managers), journalists, academics, students, [[Social Movement Organization|Civil Society Organisations]] and governmental organisations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-106391301.html|title=European Media Institute Publishes Manuals on Media and Diversity|last=|first=|date=7 August 2003|work=Info-Prod Research|access-date=5 October 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|subscription=yes|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also organize conferences on these topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-87676017.html|title=Diversity Reporting Program Planned for South Caucasus|last=|first=|date=23 June 2002|work=Info-Prod Research|access-date=5 October 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|subscription=yes|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
MDI's first large scale media diversity project, The Reporting Diversity Network (RDN), was launched at a conference in November 1998 with keynote speakers [[Michael Ignatieff]] and Jean-Paul Marthoz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tuller|first1=David|title=Reporting Diversity Manuel|date=2002|publisher=Media Diversity Institute &amp; European Union|location=London|page=14|url=http://www.cestim.it/argomenti/08media/2002-Reporting-Diversity-Manual-Balkan-EN.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; RDN's work focused on Central and Eastern Europe as well as the newly independent former Soviet states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pesic|first1=Milica|title=The Media's Markers of Race and Ethnicity in the Balkans|journal=Rhodes Journalism Review|date=August 2001|volume=2001|issue=20|pages=24–25|url=http://journals.co.za/content/rujr/2001/20/EJC144721;jsessionid=UgRbGlGP3pWXxTOUvp_u967d.sabinetlive}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been involved in addressing the deaths of [[Romani people|Romani]] journalists and editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gross|first=Peter|date=29 November 2006|title=A Prolegomena to the Study of the Romani Media in Eastern Europe|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Gross6/publication/249720670_A_Prolegomena_to_the_Study_of_the_Romani_Media_in_Eastern_Europe/links/56e8191808aea51e7f3b153e/A-Prolegomena-to-the-Study-of-the-Romani-Media-in-Eastern-Europe.pdf|journal=European Journal of Communication|volume=21|issue=4|pages=485|doi=10.1177/0267323106070012|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other projects that MDI have been involved in include Dune Voices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Dune Voices|url=http://www.dune-voices.info/public/index.php/en/about-us/about-dune-voices|website=Dune Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt; Get the Trolls Out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Counter Hate Speech on Twitter|url=http://www.stoppinghate.getthetrollsout.org/|website=Stopping Hate}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Media Against Hate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Media Against Hate|url=http://europeanjournalists.org/mediaagainsthate/|website=Media Against Hate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other media ==
The collaboration between MDI and [[Twitter]] in developing a guide on countering hate speech was referred to in an article in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', October 17, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Madhumita Murgia|first1=Hannah Kuchler|title=Social Media: Challenging the Jihadi Narrative|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3b03edde-8992-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731|agency=Financial Times|date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A video broadcast produced by MDI's Dune Voices project was published on the BBC website on December 30, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Mali: Artwork from Motorcycle Parts|url=http://www.bbc.com/arabic/media-38470942?SThisFB|website=BBC Arabic|publisher=Dune Sounds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MDI contributed to the Journal for Applied Journalism and Media Studies in 2017. MDI’s founder Milica Pesic presented concrete and detailed examples of how MDI has worked to promote inclusive journalism and diversity in the media in many different countries and regions.

'''Midnight Madness''' is an annual event celebrating the upcoming [[college basketball]] [[season (sports)|season]] in which a team opens its first official practice to the public, often combining it with a pep rally and other fan-friendly activities. The tradition originated from teams holding public practices at midnight on the earliest day that the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) would allow a practice to be held. In 2013, a new NCAA rule established some flexibility around the opening of a team's practice sessions. As a result, the dates on which teams celebrate Midnight Madness can vary, but most stick with the traditional date of a Friday night closest to October 15.

==History==
[[File:Lefty Driesell.jpg|thumb|left|Maryland coach Lefty Driesell held the first "Midnight Madness" session in 1971.]]
Prior to the [[2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season]] men's and women's basketball teams were not permitted to practice prior to the Friday closest to October 15. [[Maryland Terrapins men's basketball|Maryland Terrapins]] head coach [[Lefty Driesell]] began the Midnight Madness tradition at 12:03&amp;nbsp;a.m. on October 15, 1971 by inviting the public to a 1.5 [[mile]] team [[Running|run]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gRkIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=o0QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4649,3131962&amp;dq=driesell+basketball+practice&amp;hl=en Sports Whirl], ''The Virgin Islands Daily News'', October 16, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; The early practice session was attended by 3,000 fans at the [[All-weather running track|track]] surrounding [[Maryland Stadium|Byrd Stadium]] on the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] campus.&lt;ref name=NMMfUUbt/&gt; Driesell continued the annual midnight practice session throughout his tenure at Maryland, and brought the tradition with him when he became [[head coach]] at [[Georgia State Panthers men's basketball|Georgia State University]]. In 2008, that school delayed the event until sunrise for the first time since Driesell established the tradition.&lt;ref name=LmrsatM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ncb/s/2000/1011/812806.html|title=Lefty's midnight run started all the Madness|accessdate=November 30, 2008|date=October 13, 2007|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|work=[[ESPN.com]]|author=Rovell, Darren|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326190934/http://espn.go.com/ncb/s/2000/1011/812806.html|archivedate=March 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Big Blue Madness.jpeg|thumb|Big Blue Madness in 2015, at Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky.]]
In 1982, coach [[Joe B. Hall]] and the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball]] team began to officially promote a celebration dubbed "Midnight Madness" as a school event with formal entertainment acts and an invited student audience. This event was held in [[Memorial Coliseum (University of Kentucky)|Memorial Coliseum]] and held 8,500 people in the then-12,500 seat gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukathletics.com/news/sports_m-baskbl_spec-rel_101101aaa_html|title=Midnight Special - Celebrating 20 Years of Big Blue Madness|accessdate=November 30, 2015|date=October 11, 2001|publisher=[[Kentucky Wildcats|UKAthletics.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The capacity of Memorial Coliseum is now 8,500, but it was 12,500 in 1982.--&gt; Big Blue Madness is now televised and hosts celebrities including [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], who performed in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/college/kentucky/2014/10/17/big-blue-madness-big-show-great-expectations/17468477|title=Big Blue Madness: big show, great expectations|accessdate=November 30, 2015|date=October 18, 2014|newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]]|author=Jones, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the more famous events is "Late Night in the [[Allen Fieldhouse|Phog]]" at Kansas, which was started in 1985 by [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] and is now broadcast in live [[streaming video]] via the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuathletics.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/101508aaa.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019032555/http://kuathletics.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/101508aaa.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 October 2008|title=Kansas Fans Can Witness|accessdate=December 3, 2008|date=October 15, 2008|publisher=[[CBS]] Interactive|work=Official Athletics Website of the University of Kansas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event has caught on on most campuses; various programs have given away T-shirts and allowed players do stunt [[Slam dunk|dunk]]s and [[half court]] shots.&lt;ref name="NMMfUUbt"/&gt; Some schools schedule intrasquad scrimmages, [[Three-point field goal|three-point]] shooting contests and/or slam dunk contests. The event is often a co-ed event, in which both the men's and women's teams participate in the celebration, especially at schools like the [[University of Connecticut]], where the men's and women's teams have a combined 15 championships.&lt;ref name="CtcfMM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/15255167|title=Champs take court for Midnight Madness: Florida enjoyed last year’s title, but has turned all focus to this season|accessdate=November 30, 2008|date=October 13, 2006|publisher=NBC Universal}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Scout.com]]'' estimated that in 2007, approximately 160 of the top [[blue chip (sports)|blue chip]] high school basketball recruits in the country were attending a Midnight Madness event during the weekend that opens the basketball season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scouthoops.scout.com/a.z?s=75&amp;p=2&amp;c=689891&amp;ssf=1&amp;RequestedURL=http%3a%2f%2fscouthoops.scout.com%2f2%2f689891.html|title=On Campus: Midnight Madness|accessdate=December 1, 2008|date=October 12, 2007|publisher=ScoutHoops.com and Scout.com|author=Telep, Dave and Evan Daniels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the NCAA ruled that men's practices could begin two weeks earlier than the traditional date, so long as teams held no more than 30 days of practice in the six weeks prior to the first regular-season game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/9240169/ncaa-oks-rule-move-start-practice|title=Midnight Madness to start earlier|accessdate=May 9, 2013|date=May 3, 2013|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change was made to provide more flexible scheduling that accommodated off days in the preseason practice schedule. However, the women's programs rejected moving the date forward so as not to conflict with recruiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/latest+news/2013/april/calendar+moves+forward+for+midnight+madness|title=Calendar moves forward for Midnight Madness|accessdate=September 27, 2013|date=May 3, 2013|publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|author=Hosick, Michelle Brutlag|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003135152/https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/latest+news/2013/april/calendar+moves+forward+for+midnight+madness|archive-date=October 3, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/84230/earlier-practice-date-approved-for-fall|title=Earlier practice date approved for fall|accessdate=September 27, 2013|date=May 3, 2013|publisher=[[ESPN]]|first=Eamonn|last=Brennan}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of practices beginning so early, several teams opted to celebrate Midnight Madness later in the six-week practice window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/spartans/index.ssf/2013/08/michigan_states_midnight_madne.html|title=Michigan State's Midnight Madness event remains in October after NCAA allows earlier practices|accessdate=September 27, 2013|date=August 6, 2013|publisher=[[MLive.com]]|author=Leung, Diamond}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegebasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/09/24/maryland-to-host-their-2013-midnight-madness-at-cole-field-house|title=Maryland to host their 2013 Midnight Madness at Cole Field House|accessdate=September 27, 2013|date=September 24, 2013|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|author=Dauster, Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, most basketball programs from large [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] schools have planned a [[pep rally]] with MCs, [[music]], [[dancing]] and other festivities to encourage support of the program. [[Celebrity]] guests and alumni participate in entertaining the students. Often, there is significant publicity surrounding the event, which may include televised broadcasts, published [[press release]]s and various [[new media]] exposure.&lt;ref name=MMp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegebasketball.rivals.com/content.asp?CID=594522|title=Midnight Madness preview|accessdate=November 30, 2008|publisher=[[Rivals.com]]|first=Andrew|last=Skwara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, some teams attempted to host Midnight Madness in association with special early restricted practices instead of the first day of regular practices. These universities felt that since their football teams had [[home (sports)|home]] games the week before the opening date of formal practices, which had become the traditional Midnight Madness date, they would be better off holding Midnight Madness on the weekend before. In 2008, teams were allowed to practice two hours per week between September 15 and October 17 under what is known as the "Offseason Workout Rule,"&lt;ref name=KMcinbd/&gt; and at least four notable public "practice" sessions (by Illinois, Kentucky, Marshall and West Virginia) were held during these weekly practices before daily practices were permitted.&lt;ref name=UcMMawe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=3577794&amp;name=katz_andy|title=UK celebrates Midnight Madness a week early|accessdate=December 1, 2008|date=September 9, 2008|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|author=Katz, Andy}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], the [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini women's basketball|women's]] basketball teams hosted scrimmages at [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]] after an October 11 game between the [[Illinois Fighting Illini football]] team and the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football]] team.&lt;ref name=Ihlohp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/27136216|title=Illini hosts largest outdoor hoops practice: Men's, women's teams play on a portable court at football stadium|accessdate=December 1, 2008|date=October 11, 2008|publisher=NBC Universal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the attendance for the football game was 62,870,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=282850356|title=Minnesota 27, Illinois 20|accessdate=December 1, 2008|date=October 11, 2008|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; this event was described as the "World's Largest Basketball Practice".

Kentucky was one of the schools that held their public practice event a week early in part because they could lure more recruiting prospects during a week when most other programs were not hosting similar events.&lt;ref name=KMcinbd/&gt; The [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]] asked the [[Southeastern Conference]] to force Kentucky to adhere to the traditionally scheduled practice to no avail.&lt;ref name=KMcinbd/&gt; They then belatedly petitioned the NCAA to legislate conformity unsuccessfully.&lt;ref name=KMcinbd/&gt; Kentucky coach [[Billy Gillispie]] had contacted the Kentucky's compliance office, the SEC and the NCAA to ensure that no rules were being violated.&lt;ref name=KMcinbd/&gt;

'''Museum theatre''' is the use of [[theatre]] and theatrical techniques by a [[museum]] for educational, informative, and entertainment purposes.  It can also be used in a [[zoo]], an [[aquarium]], an [[art gallery]], and at historic sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Catherine|first2=Anthony |last2=Jackson |first3=Jenny |last3=Kidd |title=The Role of Theater in Museums and Historic Sites: Visitors, Audiences, and Learners|journal=International Handbook of Research in Arts Education|year=2007|volume=16|pages=679–699|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-3052-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally performed by professional actors.  Varieties of museum theatre include historical characters, puppetry, movement and music.

== Overview ==
[[Actor]]s portraying historical characters perform in [[First-person interpretation|first person]], as if he or she were an actual person from the era or culture he or she is representing.  With puppetry, actors can tell stories, create multiple characters, and portray a variety of cultures.

Theatrical techniques can be used for [[Third-person narrative|third-person]] interpretation, where an actor or trained presenter uses costumes, props. lighting, or special effects to convey historical or scientific facts, without necessarily portraying a character.&lt;ref name="Tessa"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bridal|first1=Tessa|title=Exploring Museum Theatre|date=2004|publisher=Altamira Press|location=Walnut Creek|isbn=0-7591-0413-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Museum theatre pioneers include the [[Science Museum of Minnesota]], the [[Museum of Science, Boston]], the [[National Gallery of Art]], and the [[Philadelphia Zoo]].&lt;ref name="Tessa"/&gt;

The Theatre in Museums Workshop, begun in 1983 at the [[Science Museum of Minnesota]], is an annual event now held at [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]].  It provides all the basic information needed to start a theatre program, and an opportunity to develop scripts under the guidance of experienced museum theatre practitioners.

== First-person interpretation ==

First-person interpretation is an increasingly popular way of creating a full-body experience for museum visitors by giving them the opportunity to interact with the past through actors and interpreters.

[[File:Lyme Regis Fossil Festival 09 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Actors portraying [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Mary Anning]] at the [[Lyme Regis]] fossil festival]]
Historical character interpretation is increasingly becoming the way all first-person interpretation is performed because it adds a high degree of authenticity to a given museum performance or interpretation.&lt;ref name="Tessa"/&gt; This movement corresponds with the increase in focus on the educational benefit of the museum to the visitor as opposed to the previously held belief that the visitor is a secondary concern to the objects. While this has been a strong movement since about 1980, the concern for accuracy and consequent focus on portraying real people is a marker that can be interpreted as a new stage.

One of the main ways that museum theatre differs from museum interpretation is in the degree of disbelief involved in the performance; representing a historical figure requires less [[suspension of disbelief]] because the audience knows that the character being represented did exist. It is easier for an audience to believe that the performer is accurately representing a figure that they themselves can verify existed.&lt;ref name="Tessa"/&gt;

The portrayal of a historical character in a museum environment as opposed to a traditional theatrical space is hard to define. The main distinction is perhaps that the actor in the museum environment must be prepared to interact with the audience, while the stage actor is not expected to know much about his character beyond what is developed on-stage. While acting the characters are subject to similar acting conventions, the museum actor must be prepared to answer to his audience face-to-face. The final distinction to be made is that the portrayal of a historical character is a performance of living history, as opposed to museum theatre. In taking on the identity of a person who truly lived, you are expected to become that person, which involves answering to that person’s actions, ideologies, and life experiences.&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;{{cite book|last=Roth|first=Stacy|title=Past into Present: Effective Techniques for First-person Historical Interpretation|year=1998|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=978-0-8078-4710-7|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second-person interpretation ==
[[Second-person narrative|Second-person]] interpretation is a newer form of interpretation in which visitors participate in programming and hands-on activities, as opposed to only engaging in dialogue with interpreters.&lt;ref name="mag"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magelssen|first=Scott|title=Making History in the Second Person: Post-touristic Considerations for Living Historical Interpretation|journal=Theatre Journal|date=May 2006|volume=58|issue=2|pages=291-312|doi=10.1353/tj.2006.0119}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|298}} It is employed most often in [[living history museum]]s and can be used in conjunction with first- or third-person interpretation. Common hands-on activities include candle-dipping, butter churning, weaving on a loom, and musket loading.{{r|mag|page1=291}} This form of second-person interpretation does not necessarily require the visitor to adopt a character or pretend to be part of the past. In another form, more similar to [[participatory theatre]], visitors are invited to adopt a character and interact with interpreters as that character.{{r|mag|page1=300}} One example is the "Follow the North Star" program at [[Conner Prairie]] Interactive History Park in Indiana, where visitors pretend to be fugitive slaves as a way of learning about the [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Follow the North Star|url=http://www.connerprairie.org/things-to-do/events/follow-the-north-star|website=Conner Prairie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, such interactions are carefully facilitated so that a desired outcome is achieved, but sometimes visitors are allowed to make their own choices regardless of the historical record. Allowing visitors to portray prominent historical figures and make their own choices is done less frequently because of concerns over historical accuracy.{{r|mag|page1=304}} Many educators support role-playing as a way for visitors to learn by doing, think critically about history, and make personal connections between history and their own lives.&lt;ref name=Roth/&gt;

==Demonstration==
[[File:Conner-prairie-pottery.jpg|thumb|A pottery wheel demonstration at [[Conner Prairie]] living history museum.]]
Demonstration is a form of museum interpretation that has been used in museums, historic sites, [[zoos]], and [[aquarium|aquaria]] for decades. Demonstration is a way to illustrate activities such as historical [[craft]]-making and concepts like scientific principles.&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Catherine |date=1998 |title=Museum Theatre: Communicating with Visitors Through Drama |location=Portsmouth, NH |publisher=Heinemann|isbn=9780325000565}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37–38}} It is also a way to contextualize a museum object or artifact.&lt;ref name="Boardman"&gt;{{cite web |last=Boardman |first=Kathryn |date=1997 |url=http://www.alhfam.org/whitepapers/alhfam.revisit.html |title=Revisiting Living History: A Business, An Art, A Pleasure, An Education |page=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724233240/http://www.alhfam.org/whitepapers/alhfam.revisit.html |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a demonstration, the demonstrator generally explains the activity or concept using something "real" like an object or animal.{{r|Hughes|page1=37–38}} In traditional demonstrations, the demonstrators generally do not assume to be anyone else (characterization might be involved in more theatrical demonstrations).{{r|Hughes|page1=38}} One example of a demonstration is fish feeding at the [[New England Aquarium]], in which visitors watch a diver feed fish while listening to a volunteer explain the process.{{r|Hughes|page1=38}} Another example is the lightning presentation at the [[Museum of Science (Boston)|Museum of Science]], Boston during which visitors watch lightning flashes produced by a [[Van de Graaff generator]].{{r|Hughes|page1=38}} There is a great deal of overlap between demonstration and theatre. Theatrical techniques such as [[characterization]], [[costume]], [[narrative]], and [[special effects]] are often used to enliven demonstration and draw visitor attention.{{r|Hughes|page1=37–38}} Some museums, such as [[Science Museum (London)|The National Museum of Science and Industry]] in London, classify demonstration as a form of museum theatre,{{r|Tessa|page1=5}} while other museums, such as the [[Science Museum of Minnesota]], use actors to present demonstrations.{{r|Tessa|page1=xii}} Demonstration may also serve as a component of a museum play or theatre piece.&lt;ref name="Schindel"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schindel |first=Dorothy Napp |date=Summer 2002 |title=Museum Theatre: Telling Stories Through Objects |journal=Stage of the Art |volume=14 |issue=4 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, differences remain between the conventions of demonstration and the conventions of theatre. In her book ''Exploring Museum Theatre'', Tessa Bridal warns museums against promoting a demonstration as a theatre performance, as it may cause visitor confusion or disappointment.{{r|Tessa|page1=5}} Yet like museum theatre and other forms of live interpretation, demonstration aims to engage visitors, to create interest in a topic, to serve as an alternative to lists of facts and static exhibitions, and to provoke an emotional response that leads to learning.{{r|Hughes|page1=39}}{{r|Tessa|page1=4}}

==Storytelling==
[[Storytelling]] is a discipline that has a history as long as the human race.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Storytellers inhabit the [[character (arts)|character]]s of the tale, while still maintaining the status as [[narrator]] of the events, they are both first person and third person perspectives in one.  Storytelling can help bring historical and cultural context to works of art, dinosaur bones, scientific and historical objects.{{r|Hughes|page1=65}} For this reason some museums will hire a contract storyteller to add depth and experience to exhibitions or programs by spinning children's tales, appearing as a costume character to aid in an immersive environment and to aid in depicting different cultures by sharing [[traditions]], histories, [[folklore]] and [[myths]].{{r|Tessa|page1=19–21}}

Museum theatre often adapts the archetypal storyteller to a character embodied by a trained and scripted actor. It is important to note that part of the art of storytelling is the development of the storyteller's [[persona]] and their unique style of performing,{{r|Tessa|page1=19–21}} which is similar to the creation of a character intrinsic to the acting discipline and the Theatre genre. Some purists believe that creating a theatrical piece embodying the stories and myths of a culture without the native storyteller present, is a perversion and denigration of cultural patrimony. However, professionals in museum theatre believe that the most important part of creating meaningful experiences using others' stories is that the stories and the culture they represent are handled with respect and every effort is made to portray them accurately.{{r|Hughes|page1=66}}  

Despite some detractors museums are beginning to integrate many aspects of museum theatre into their daily programming schedule.  This is probably due to recently scholarly discourse in the field of museum education that links multi-sensory experiences like storytelling with effective learning in children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Falk|first1=John|last2=Dierking|first2=Lynn|title=Learning from Museums: Visitor Experiences and the Making of Meaning|year=2000|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Walnut Creek|isbn=9780759117198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storytelling is a particularly effective type of museum theatre because children's cognitive and empathetic abilities are increased when they are asked to listen and follow the sequence of events presented by storytellers. To quote Catherine Hughes, {{quote|Juxtaposing stories (an ancient way of understanding) and science [or history, or art, etc](a new approach to understanding) creates more models and pictures for the listener, which makes for a deeper, more complex, and complete awareness of the natural world.{{r|Hughes|page1=67}}}}

==Dance/music performance==

[[Dance]] and [[music]] [[performance]] within museum theatre take on many different forms. While they can be used separately, dance and music are also used in conjunction with other forms of museum theatre, including each other, to enhance the visitor’s experience. Music as either an instrumental or vocal performance should be performed by qualified performers. The same goes for a dance performance that is either choreographed or improvised.{{r|Tessa|page1=26}} However, in other circumstances, such as after a performance or in a special program, music and dance can be explored by the visitor in a more participatory way. This helps to enhance their understanding and interpretation of the ideas and concepts the museum is trying to encourage. 

Even within a performance museums use music and dance in different ways. Music has been used as a cultural performance to show and explore different cultures through the use of music. In other cases music performance has been used to help visitors discover more about the music and instruments themselves, such as the Exploratorium, in San Francisco. They held a series of informal concerts at which, after the musician gave his or her performance, the audience were given the opportunity to converse with the musician and ask question.{{r|Tessa|page1=26}} Dance performance, presented on its own is unusual. It is often used in addition to or as a part of another museum theatre piece. There are however a few sole dance performances in museums. The Weisman holds a performance entitled ''Eddy'' that uses the museum building itself as the stage. To help visitors look at the building differently, the dancers move through the space walking up walls, using the elevator as a dance floor, and other unusual ways. The museum wants the visitor to appreciate not only the exhibits in the museum, but the building itself.{{r|Tessa|page1=27}} 

When used together dance and music provide another opportunity for museums to educate. A good example of this is ''The Ballad of Chico Mendes''. The Museum of Science, in Boston used choreographed dance and music, both as song and for background, to teach visitors about the battle for the rainforest through the life of Chico Mendes, a rubber tapper. Not only did they perform this in the museum, but latter took it “on the road” to schools in the area.{{r|Hughes|page1=86–87}} 

Using dance and music in museum theatre allows the museum to evoke greater emotion within a performance, connecting to the visitor on a different level. Music especially helps to set the stage of not only a musical or dance performance, but more traditional theatre and program pieces as well.{{r|Tessa|page1=26}}

'''Nuit Blanche''' ({{IPA-fr|nɥi ˈblɑ̃ʃ}}) ('''White Night''') is an annual all-night or night-time [[arts festival]]. A Nuit Blanche will typically have museums, private and public [[art gallery|art galleries]], and other cultural institutions open and free of charge, with the centre of the city itself being turned into a ''de facto'' art gallery, providing space for [[art installation]]s, performances (music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punkabilly.ca/nuit-blanche-2016-toronto-punk-show/|title=Nuit Blanche Punk Rock Show|publisher=punkabilly.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; film, dance, performance art), themed social gatherings, and other activities.

==History==

In 1989, the [[Helsinki Festival]] established its [[Night of the Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinginjuhlaviikot.fi/en/taiteiden-yo|title=Taiteiden yö|work=Helsingin juhlaviikot}}&lt;/ref&gt; "when every gallery, museum and bookshop is open until midnight or later and the whole city becomes one giant performance and carnival venue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofestivals.co.uk/festivals-in-finland/helsinki-festival/|title=Helsinki Festival|publisher=eurofestivals.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the mayor of Nantes, [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]]'s program included renovating the central city and establishing a "contemporary patrimony", which led arts programmer [[Jean Blaise]] to create a late-night cultural festival, "Les Allumées" ("Things Alight").&lt;ref&gt;[http://alliance-francaise.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/mai-2009-newsletter.pdf Alliance Française of New Zealand, May 2009 Newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325211624/http://alliance-francaise.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/mai-2009-newsletter.pdf |date=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His concept was to have an arts festival in Nantes, from 6&amp;nbsp;pm to 6&amp;nbsp;am, over six years with artists from six cities.&lt;ref name="Nantes"&gt;[http://www.nantes.fr/les-allumees Les Allumées (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear left}}

They were as follows:
* [[Barcelona]], 15–20 October 1990
* [[St. Petersburg]], 14–19 October 1991
* [[Buenos Aires]], 19–24 October 1992
* [[Naples]], 18–23 October 1993
* [[Cairo]], 17–22 October 1994
* [[Havana]], 16–21 October 1995. (The Cuban government refused to issue travel documents to the 300 artists expected, so the event was formally cancelled, though events did take place.)&lt;ref name="Nantes"/&gt;

In 1993, a year and a half after the St. Petersburg edition of Les Allumées, the annual [[White Nights Festival]] in that city began adding a specifically cultural component to a longstanding annual event that included street carnivals and the [[Scarlet Sails (tradition)|Scarlet Sails]] celebration. The expanded White Nights Festival has included [[popular culture|pop culture]] (e.g. the [[Rolling Stones]] in the open air at [[Palace Square]]) in 2007 and [[high culture]] events ("Stars of the White Nights Festival" at the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] under [[Valery Gergiev]]) every year since 1993.

In 1997, the [[Long Night of Museums]], took place in the [[German reunification|newly re-united]] [[Berlin]] with a dozen participating schools and exhibitions; the number has risen to 125, with over 150,000 people taking part in the January 2005 night.

In 2001, when [[Bertrand Delanoë]] became [[Mayor of Paris]], his deputy, Christophe Girard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christophe-girard.fr/a-propos/|title=Présentation|work=christophe-girard.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; invited Blaise to create an event there, and the Nuit Blanche was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paris.fr/loisirs/les-grands-rendez-vous/nuits-blanches/historique-nuit-blanche/rub_6806_stand_19173_port_15521 History of Nuit Blanche (in French)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906073353/http://www.paris.fr/loisirs/les-grands-rendez-vous/nuits-blanches/historique-nuit-blanche/rub_6806_stand_19173_port_15521 |date=6 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Les Allumées was scaled down to a single night and focused on the offerings of Paris. "The first night-time trail through the streets of Paris and its contemporary-art scene took place on 5 October 2002, and the opportunity for anyone to explore artistic creation for a night has come back every year since."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.fr/english/visit/highlights/nuit-blanche/rub_8208_stand_34123_port_18969|title=Nuit Blanche|author=Mairie de Paris|work=paris.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a night-time festival of the arts has spread around the world, with events in over 120 cities,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} including Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary, Halifax, Winnipeg and Saskatoon in Canada, and several European capitals (Paris, Brussels, Rome, Madrid, Riga, Bucharest and Valletta) which have chosen to pool their efforts as "Nuits Blanches Europe". The cities share their experiences and exchange projects and artists. Each year, new cities become candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eutrio.be/nuit-blanche-9th-edition-0|title=Nuit blanche – 9th edition – Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union|work=eutrio.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Melbourne]] hosted Australia's first White Night event with the city's galleries, theatres, music venues, [[Melbourne laneways|laneways]], shops and major cultural institutions all showcasing the city's art and culture, food and wine, fashion and sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/4156-white-night-melbourne-celebrating-our-city-from-dusk-to-dawn.html?qh=YTozOntpOjA7czo1OiJ3aGl0ZSI7aToxO3M6Nzoid2hpdGVseSI7aToyO3M6Nzoid2hpdGluZyI7fQ%3D%3D Premier of Victoria's Press Release: White Night Melbourne – celebrating our city from dusk to dawn]&lt;/ref&gt; This first Melbourne White Night saw an estimated 300,000 people attend, exceeding initial estimates and constituting the largest event of its kind in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/white-night-an-arty-delight-20130224-2ezot.html|title=White Night an arty delight|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing with its international success, Nuit Blanche was announced to be held in Santiago Chile during 2015, making this important South American capital part of the Nuit Blanche international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forum-avignon.org/en/contribution-nuit-blanche-made-paris-concept-exported-latin-america-margot-beck|title=Contribution: "Nuit Blanche, the made in Paris concept exported in Latin America" by Margot Beck – Forum d'Avignon|publisher=forum-avignon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the capital of Colombia, Bogota, the "Noche en Blanco" was made between 2013 and 2015.

==Books==
The first two Ollimania books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.limburger.nl/article/20141029/REGIONIEUWS01/141029247|title=Olli en het poepkanon|language=Dutch|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; were launched in October 2014.

==Design==
[[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] from design company John Doe designed Olli from the basic shape of a [[soccer ball]]. They believe the basic shape, size and character was part of Olli's success. This made Olli easily recognizable to audiences. Olli is drawn in a minimalist style, requiring only a few lines and one [[primary color]]. Olli was created in three sizes, one small size 4.7 in. one medium, size 11 in. and one big size 7.2&amp;nbsp;ft.

==Big Olli==
There are two big Olli's. They are the elder version of small Olli. The Big Olli's is a special creature model made for several charities. One is a permanent hard [[plastic]] [[polyester]] [[statue]] at the Sophia [[Children's hospital|Children's Hospital]] and another one has a temporarily place at the [[Rotterdam Zoo]]. The big Olli that is used in the short film to save the Rotterdam ZOO is stored at a secret location according to the creators.

==Fictional character biography==
Olli is toy elephant grown to the size of a real elephant. Olli is a lovable character with furry friends living in a [[Japan]]ese [[fantasy]] world. Later in 2013 there was a story added that he was also the favorite toy of Famous Soccer player [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]]. Together they are the main cast of a short film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fr12.nl/dump/9360-olli--amp--giovanni-van-bronckhorst.html
|title=Olli &amp; Giovanni van Bronckhorst|publisher=FR12|language=Dutch|date=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rotterdam, [[Netherlands]] of 1980, Giovanni van Bronckhorst is a little boy (played in the short film by the son of Giovanni van Bronckhorst). One day, he discovers a stuffed Elephant at the Rotterdam [[Zoo]] and immediately grows attached to it. The name of the elephant is Olli. Giovanni takes him everywhere he goes, especially when he plays soccer. One day during a soccer game, he loses Olli in the canal of Rotterdam. 28 years later in 2013, Giovanni became a Famous Soccer Player and trainer of soccer club [[Feyenoord]] and Olli, also grew big, reunite again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://christianneblogs.com/2013/03/21/olli-een-aaibare-briljante-reclame
|title=Aaibare briljante reclame|publisher=Christianne Blogs|language=Dutch|date=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] have a history in creating things that help people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fabmagazine.nl/2014/03/wereldheerschappij-voor-rotterdamse-olli|title=Wereldheerschappij voor Rotterdamse Olli|publisher=FAB|language=Dutch|date=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To give something back to society and convince big brands to do so too. Olli was a few times part of a strategy they developed in 2004 and created Olli as a separate brand to generate [[awareness]] and in one campaign to generate more traffic and money for a [[ZOO]] in [[Rotterdam]].

==Awards==
In December 2013 [[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] of John Doe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1041/Amsterdam/article/detail/2215767/2007/06/26/John-Doe-Amsterdam-grossiert-in-prijzen.dhtml|title=John Doe grossiert in prijzen|publisher=Algemeen Dagblad|language=Dutch|date= 26 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; got awarded with the highest Dutch advertising award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/22154615/__Olli_wint_Gouden_Loeki__.html|title=Olli wint Gouden Loeki|publisher=Telegraaf|language=Dutch|date= 19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2664/Nieuws/article/detail/3565250/2013/12/19/Reclamespot-Olli-wint-Gouden-Loeki.dhtml|title=Olli wint Gouden Loeki|publisher=Volkskrant|language=Dutch|date= 19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reclamewereld.blog.nl/reclameprijzen/2013/12/19/gouden-loeki-2013-asrolli-met-reclamebureau-john-doe|title=Gouden Loeki 2013: Olli met reclamebureau John Doe|publisher=Reclamewereld|language=Dutch|date= 19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Golden Loeki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welovereclame.nl/gouden-loeki|title=Gouden Loeki Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; for this [[Advertising campaign|campaign]].

==Sales==
In 2013 Olli was used to help and save the Rotterdam zoo to generate money after the zoo lost government [[funding]]. In one year over 200.000 Olli's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.ad.nl/ad/nl/1038/Rotterdam/article/detail/3555615/2013/12/03/Knuffelolifantje-Olli-reddende-engel-diergaarde-Blijdorp.dhtml
|title=Olli reddende engel diergaarde Blijdorp|publisher=Algemeen Dagblad|language=Dutch|date=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; were sold. Olli also generated 75.000 more visitors for the Rotterdam zoo. Ollimania is a [[licensing]]

==Charity==

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to theatre:

'''[[Theatre]]''' – is the generic term for the [[performing arts]] and a collaborative form of fine art involving live performers to present the experience of a real or imagined event (such as a story) through [[acting]], [[singing]], and/or [[dancing]] before a live audience in a specific place. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of speech, gesture, mime, puppets, music, dance, sound and spectacle — indeed any one or more elements of the other performing arts.  Elements of design and stagecraft are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carlson, ''Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism'', [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/jdtc/article/view/1642/1606], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of theatre==

[[History of theatre]]

===Western tradition===
Chronological movements of the [[History of theatre#Western tradition|Western tradition]] include:
* [[Theatre of ancient Greece]] – a theatrical [[culture]] that flourished in [[Classical Greece|ancient Greece]] between c. 550 and c. 220 BC.  Tragedy (late 6th century BC), [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]] (486 BC), and the [[satyr play]] were the three [[drama]]tic [[genre]]s to emerge there.  Western theatre originated in Athens and its drama has had a significant and sustained impact on [[Western culture]] as a whole.
* [[Theatre of ancient Rome]] – diverse art form, ranging from [[Roman festival|festival]] performances of [[street theatre]], nude dancing, and [[acrobatics]], to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation comedies, to the [[high culture|high-style]], verbally elaborate tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energizing effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of [[Latin literature]] of the highest quality for the stage.
* [[Medieval theatre]] – theatre of Europe between the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century AD and the beginning of the [[Renaissance]] in approximately the 15th century AD. Medieval theatre covers all drama produced in Europe over that thousand-year period and refers to a variety of genres, including [[liturgical drama]], [[mystery plays]], [[morality plays]], [[farce]]s and [[masque]]s.
* [[Commedia dell'arte]] – a form of theatre characterized by [[Mask#Masks in theatre|masked "types"]] which began in Italy in the 16th century, and was responsible for the advent of the actress and [[Improvisational theatre|improvised performances]] based on [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] or [[scenario]]s.
* [[English Renaissance theatre]] – also known as ''early modern English theatre'', refers to the theatre of England, largely based in London, which occurred between the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] and the [[closure of the theatres in 1642]].

* [[Restoration comedy]] – English [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] written and performed in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710. After public stage performances had been banned for 18 years by the [[Puritan]] regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signalled a renaissance of [[English drama]]. Restoration comedy is notorious for its [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] explicitness
* [[Restoration spectacular]] – elaborately staged productions beginning the late 17th-century [[English Restoration|Restoration]] period, enthralling audiences with action, music, dance, moveable [[theatrical scenery|scenery]], [[baroque illusionistic painting]], gorgeous costumes, and [[special effect]]s such as [[trapdoor]] tricks, "flying" actors, and [[fireworks]].
* [[Neoclassism|Neoclassical theatre]] – theatrical movement that drew inspiration from the "classical" art and culture of [[Ancient Greece]] or [[Ancient Rome]] that was dominant in Europe from the mid-18th to the 19th centuries.
* [[Nineteenth-century theatre]] – wide range of movements in the theatrical [[culture]] of Europe and the United States in the 19th century.

While some venues are constructed specifically for operas, other opera houses are part of larger [[performing arts]] centers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bayreuther-festspiele.de/en/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Black box theater|Black box]] – usually used for student productions or presentations. A small, square space with minimum amount of lighting and sound equipment needed. Often painted black or another neutral color.
*[[Proscenium]] – The proscenium arch was the most common form of theatre building in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The “arch” acts like a picture frame through which the action can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/art/proscenium&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Theatre in the round]] – a [[theatre]] in which the audience surrounds the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/discover-theatres/theatre-faqs/170-what-are-the-types-of-theatre-stages-and-auditoria&lt;/ref&gt;

==General theatre concepts==
* [[Act (drama)|Act]] – plays are separated into Acts with the Acts separated into Scenes. Each Scene is builds upon each other to the finale ending.
* [[Acting]] – the art of performing
* [[Cold reading (theatrical)|Cold reading]] – reading a script for the first time. Usually the designers have read and analyzed the text for design purposes before a cast has been selected. Sometimes a cold reading involves the entire cast, crew, and designers who are experiencing the script for the first time as an ensemble.
* [[Curtain call]] – taking a bow at the end of the performance. Actors will generally acknowledge the orchestra pit (if there were any musicians) and the running crew as well as the audience. 
* [[Drama therapy]] – the use of using Theatre as therapy for a variety of issues. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.k-state.edu/mtd/theatre/academics/areas/drama-therapy/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Everyman]] – the concept of the universal person that the audience can relate to. &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyman&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Footlights]] – originally lighting was placed at the edge of the stage under hoods to not bother the audience. It is now a musical&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/footlights-10350&lt;/ref&gt; and also a Theatrical Comedy Troupe at Cambridge University&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cambridgefootlights.org/&lt;/ref&gt;. It can become a generic term for anyone wanting to be involved with Theatre.
* [[Theatrical property]] –Props are the items actors will pick up, use, move, etc on stage. These can include consumables such as drinks, food, etc.
* [[Stage (theatre)|Stage]] – The surface upon which the sets are built upon and the Actors use to tell the story. Can be raked (that is, at an angle).
* [[Stagecraft]] – usually refers to the design aspect of theatre. Examples: lights, sound, props, costumes, makeup, set. 
* [[Theatrical constraints]] – budgets, time, allergies
* [[Theatrical scenery]] –Referred to as the Set or the Scenic element. The physical representation of the world of the play.
* [[Theatrical superstitions]] – each theatre space has its own superstition and there are universal ones that all Theatre people adhere to.
* [[Ticket (admission)|Ticket]] – this is the domain of the Front of House, as well as the programs, ushers, and seeing patrons (the audience) are seated before the lights are darkened at the beginning of the play, but also at intermission.
* [[Striking a set]] – the act of taking apart the set, putting away all the props, lights, costumes, etc after the run of a production is over.
* [[Analyzing the text]] – Actors analyze the text (the script) for motivations, clues as to how their character behaves, or what their purpose is. Designers analyze to find out how many set changes are needed, lighting cues, sound cues, costumes needed, props, etc. Costume designers also have to analyze the script like the actors as the text can give clues as to how a character should be clothed.
* [[Spectacle]] – what the audience experiences.
* [[Rehearsal]]s – where the Actors and the director (and sometimes assistant director) start to plan the movements, the tempo, timing, the energy level of all the scenes.
* [[Dress rehearsal]]s – where all the components (Costumes, Lighting, Set, Props, Actors) perform the play from start to finish (usually over the span of a week) to not only get issues such as Set &amp; Costume Changes finalized and timed correctly, but to smooth out any minor issues with lighting, Sound, tempo, etc.
* [[Tech rehearsal]]s – rehearsals were the actors are not involved. It gives the sound, lighting, and running crew a chance to rehearse and create a rhythm that is proficient and smooth prior to dress rehearsals.
*[[Run-through]]s – The meaning of this term depends on the director. Generally, is can mean just running through an act with the actors (no technical aspects involved). Sometimes it can involve costume changes as those can become complicated if wig changes are also required. Costume changes can be rehearsed and done in as little as 30 seconds to 2 minutes (if a wig is involved).

'''Performance art''' is a performance presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]]. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated, spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.

==Visual arts, performing arts, art performance==
[[File:Lubo Kristek,2007,Requiem für die Mobiltelephone,Wien.jpg|thumb|left|''Requiem für die Mobiltelephone'' by [[Lubo Kristek]], 2007, [[Vienna]]]]
Performance art is an essentially contested concept: any single definition of it implies the recognition of rival uses. As concepts like "democracy" or "art", it implies productive disagreement with itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Carlson | first1 = Marvin | title = Performance: A Critical Introduction | publisher = Routledge | year = 1998 (first 1996) | location = London and New York | pages = 1, 2 | isbn = 0-415-13703-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the term in the narrower sense is related to postmodernist traditions in Western culture. From about the mid-1960s into the 1970s, often derived from concepts of visual art, with respect to [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Dada]], the [[Situationist]]s, [[Fluxus]], [[installation art]] and [[conceptual art]], performance art tended to be defined as an [[antithesis]] to [[theatre]], challenging orthodox art forms and cultural norms. The ideal had been an ephemeral and authentic experience for performer and audience in an event that could not be repeated, captured or purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Parr | first1 = Adrian | title = Becoming + Performance Art | editors = Adrian Parr | work = The Deleuze Dictionary | publisher = Edinburgh University Press | year = 2005 | pages = 25, 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OsVOy4s1QLMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2010-10-26 | isbn = 0748618996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widely discussed difference, how concepts of visual arts and concepts of performing arts are utilized, can determine the meanings of a performance art presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Carlson | first1 = Marvin | title = Performance: A Critical Introduction | publisher = Routledge | year = 1998 (first 1996) | location = London and New York | pages = 103–105 | isbn = 0-415-13703-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance art is a term usually reserved to refer to a [[conceptual art]] which conveys a content-based meaning in a more drama-related sense, rather than being simple performance for its own sake for entertainment purposes. It largely refers to a performance presented to an audience, but which does not seek to present a conventional theatrical play or a formal linear narrative, or which alternately does not seek to depict a set of fictitious characters in formal scripted interactions. It therefore can include action or spoken word as a communication between the artist and audience, or even ignore expectations of an audience, rather than following a script written beforehand.

Some kinds of performance art nevertheless can be close to performing arts. Such performance may utilize a script or create a fictitious dramatic setting, but still constitute performance art in that it does not seek to follow the usual dramatic norm of creating a fictitious setting with a linear script which follows conventional real-world dynamics; rather, it would intentionally seek to satirize or to transcend the usual real-world dynamics which are used in conventional theatrical plays.

Performance artists often challenge the audience to think in new and unconventional ways, break conventions of traditional arts, and break down conventional ideas about "what art is". As long as the performer does not become a player who repeats a role, performance art can include satirical elements; utilize robots and machines as performers, as in pieces of the [[Survival Research Laboratories]]; involve ritualised elements (e.g. [[Shaun Caton]]); or borrow elements of any [[performing arts]] such as dance, music, and [[circus (performing art)|circus]].

Some artists, e.g. the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionists]] and [[neo-Dada]]ists, prefer to use the terms "live art", "action art", "actions", "intervention" (see [[art intervention]]) or "manoeuvre" to describe their performing activities. As genres of performance art appear [[body art]], fluxus-performance, [[happening]], [[action poetry]], and [[intermedia]].

==Origins==
[[Image:Le Saut Dans le Vide.jpg|thumb|left|Conceptual work by [[Yves Klein]] at Rue Gentil-Bernard, Fontenay-aux-Roses, October 1960, photo by Shunk Kender. ''Le Saut dans le Vide'' (''Leap into the Void'')]]
Performance art activity is not confined to European or American art traditions; notable practitioners can be found in [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]]. Performance artists and theorists point to different traditions and histories, ranging from tribal to sporting and ritual or religious events. In an episode of ''[[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]]'' broadcast on Thu, 20 Oct 2005, 21:30 on BBC Radio 4, [[Angie Hobbs]], Lecturer in Philosophy, University of Warwick; [[Miriam Griffin]], Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford; and [[John Moles]], Professor of Latin, University of Newcastle discussed with [[Melvyn Bragg]] the idea that [[Antisthenes]] and [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] in ancient Greece practiced a form of performance art and that they acquired the epithet of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic]] which means "dog" due to Diogenes behaving repeatedly like a dog in his performances.

Western cultural theorists often trace performance art activity back to the beginning of the 20th century, to the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian constructivists]], [[Futurism|Futurists]] and [[Dada]]. Dada provided a significant progenitor with the unconventional performances of poetry, often at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], by the likes of [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] and [[Tristan Tzara]]. [[Russian Futurist]] artists could be identified as precursors of performance, such as [[David Burliuk]], who painted his face for his actions (1910–20) and [[Alexander Rodchenko]] and his wife [[Varvara Stepanova]].

According to the art critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in the 1940s and 1950s [[Action Painting]] gave artists the freedom to perform—the canvas as "an arena in which to act", thereby rendering the paintings as traces of the artist's performance in his/her studio. [[Abstract expressionism]] and [[Action painting]] preceded the [[Fluxus movement]], [[Happenings]] and the emergence of Performance Art.

Performance art was anticipated, if not explicitly formulated, by [[Japan]]'s [[Gutai group]] of the 1950s, especially in such works as [[Atsuko Tanaka (artist)|Atsuko Tanaka]]'s ''Electric Dress'' (1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/art/reviews/9937/|title=Everything Is Illuminated|website=NYMag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yves Klein]] had been a precursor of performance art with the conceptual pieces of ''[[Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle]]'' (''Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility'') 1959–62, ''Anthropométries'' (1960), and works like the photomontage, Saut dans le vide (Leap into the Void). In the late 1960s [[Land art|Earth artists]] as diverse as [[Robert Smithson]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Michael Heizer]] and [[Carl Andre]] created environmental pieces that predict the performance art of the 1970s. Works of conceptual artists in the early 1980s, like [[Sol LeWitt]], who converted mural-style drawing into an act of performance by others, were influenced by Yves Klein and the Earth artists as well.

==1960s==
[[Image:Schneemann-Interior Scroll.gif|thumb|[[Carolee Schneemann]], performing her piece ''Interior Scroll.'' [[Yves Klein]] in [[France]], and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in [[New York City]] were pioneers of performance based works of art, that often entailed nudity.]]
In the 1960s a variety of new works, concepts and the increasing number of artists led to new kinds of performance art.  Prototypic for the artform later explicitly labeled "performance art", were works of artists like [[Yoko Ono]] with her ''Wall piece for orchestra'' (1962), [[Carolee Schneemann]] with pieces like ''Meat Joy'' (1964) and ''Interior Scroll'' (1975);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caroleeschneemann.com/interiorscroll.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolf Vostell]] with his Happening ''YOU'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/you/|title=Media Art Net - Vostell, Wolf: YOU|first=Media Art|last=Net|date=12 April 2018|website=www.medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1964 in New York); [[Joseph Beuys]] with ''How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare'' (1965); [[Yayoi Kusama]], with actions such as a naked flag-burning on the Brooklyn Bridge (1968) and [[Allan Kaprow]] in his many ''Happenings''.

Kaprow had coined the term [[Happening]] describing a new artform, at the beginning of the 1960s. A ''Happening'' allows the artist to experiment with body motion, recorded sounds, written and spoken texts, and even smells. One of Kaprow's earliest was "Happenings in the New York Scene," written in 1961 as the form was developing.&lt;ref&gt;Montfort, Nick, and Noah Wardrip-Fruin. The New Media Reader. Cambridge, Massachusetts [u.a.: MIT, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Notably in the Happenings of Allan Kaprow, the audience members become performers. While the audiences in Happenings had been welcomed as the performers, it is only sometimes and often unwittingly that they become an active part in a Performance. Other artists who created Happenings besides Kaprow include [[Jim Dine]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Whitman]], and [[Wolf Vostell]]: ''Theater is in the Street'' (Paris in 1958).

[[Hermann Nitsch]] in 1962 presented his "Theatre of Orgies and Mysteries" (Orgien- und Mysterien Theater), a precursor to performance art, close to the performing arts.

[[Andy Warhol]] during the early 1960s beginning to create films and video,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy_warhol_films.html|title=Andy Warhol Films|author=|date=|website=www.warholstars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-60s sponsored the [[Velvet Underground]] and staged events and performances in New York, like the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] (1966) that featured live Rock music, exploding lights, and film.

Indirectly influential for art-world performance, particularly in the United States, were new forms of theatre, embodied by the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]] and the [[Living Theatre]] and showcased in Off-Off Broadway theaters in SoHO and at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club|La MaMa]] in New York City. The Living Theatre chiefly toured in Europe between 1963 and 1968, and in the U.S. in 1968. A work of this period, ''Paradise Now'' was notorious for its audience participation and a scene in which actors recited a list of social taboos that included nudity, while disrobing.

The work of performance artists after 1968 often showed influences of the cultural and political events of that year. [[Barbara T. Smith]] with ''Ritual Meal'' (1969) was at the forefront of the feminist body-, and performance art of the 1970s; among others including: [[Carolee Schneemann]], and [[Joan Jonas]]. Schneemann and Jonas along with [[Yoko Ono]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Vito Acconci]], [[Chris Burden]] and [[Dennis Oppenheim]] pioneered the relationship between ''[[Body art]]'' and performance art.

== 1970s ==
[[Image:BeuysAchberg78.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Beuys]], 1978: ''Jeder Mensch ein Künstler — Auf dem Weg zur Freiheitsgestalt des sozialen Organismus'' ("Every person an artist — On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism")]]
At the beginning of the 1970s, artists whose work already before tended to be a performance art, as well as new artists, began to present performance art in a stricter form.

New artists with radical performances were [[Chris Burden]], with the 1971 performance piece ''Shoot'', in which he was shot in his left arm by an assistant from a distance of about five meters, and [[Vito Acconci]] in the same year with ''[[Seedbed (performance piece)|Seedbed]]''.

The book ''[[Expanded Cinema]]'', by [[Gene Youngblood]], marked a shift in the use of media by performance artists. The first book considering video art as an art form, mentions [[Jud Yalkut]] as a pioneering video artist. Since 1965 he had collaborated in dozens of intermedia performances throughout the United States, also with [[Nam June Paik]], who beginning of the 1960s already had been a fluxus performer on the way to become a media artist. As to the art of Paik, Youngblood refers to works of Carolee Schneemann and [[Robert Whitman]] from the 1960s, which had been pioneering for performance art, becoming an independent artform at the beginning of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Youngblood | first1 = Gene | title = Expanded Cinema | publisher = A. Dutton | year = 1970 | location = New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British-based pair [[Gilbert and George]], already in 1970, had documented actions of themselves on video, and created their "living sculpture" performance, being painted in gold and singing "Underneath The Arches" for extended periods. [[Joan Jonas]] began to include video in her experimental performances in 1972.

In 1973, [[Laurie Anderson]] performed ''Duets on Ice'', on the streets of New York City. [[Marina Abramović]], in the performance ''Rhythm 10'', conceptually included the violation of her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/rhythm-10-2/ | title = Marina Abramović Rhythm 10 | accessdate = 2011-03-24 | publisher = Media Art Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty years later, the theme of violation, shame, and sexual exploitation would be re-imagined in the contemporary performance works of artists such as  Clifford Owens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gothamist.com/2012/03/09/this_sunday_ps1_may_or_may_not_host.php|title=This Sunday MoMA PS1 May Or May Not Host A "Performance Art Rape"|work=[[Gothamist]]|date=9 March 2012|first=Jen|last=Carlson|accessdate=16 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810231244/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/09/this_sunday_ps1_may_or_may_not_host.php|archivedate=10 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillian Walsh, [[Pat Oleszko]] and [[Rebecca Patek]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/arts/dance/the-margins-of-a-form-are-increasingly-not-where-they-used-to-be.html?smid=fb-share&amp;_r=0 |title=The Margins of a Form Are, Increasingly, Not Where They Used to Be |work= [[The New York Times]]|date=30 July 2013|first=Gia|last=Kourlas|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1973, the Feminist Studio Workshop at the [[Woman's Building]] in Los Angeles had a formative impact on the wave of performances with feminist background.

[[Carolee Schneemann]] work in 1963, ''Eye Body'', already had been a prototype of performance art. Schneemann in 1975 drew on with innovative solo performances, like ''Interior Scroll'', showing the female body as an artistic medium.

In the mid seventies, behind the iron curtain, in the Eastern European capitals: Budapest, Kraków, Belgrade, Zagreb, Novi Sad and other cities, the performing art was flourishing. Against the political and social control, emerged [[Orshi Drozdik]] performance series, titled ''Individual Mythology'' 1975/77 and the ''NudeModel'' 1976/77. Critical of the patriarchal discourse of art and the equally patriarchal state forced "emancipation program", pioneering feminist point of view on both, made her forerunner in the 70s political and artistic environment.

In 1976, [[HA Schult]] filled [[Piazza San Marco|St. Mark's Square]] in [[Venice]] with old newspapers in an overnight action he called ''Venezia vive.''&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Battcock and Robert Nickas, ''The Art of Performance: A Critical Anthology'' (Boston, MA: E.P. Dutton, 1984), pp. 330-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Wines, ''De-Architecture'' (New York: Rizzoli International, 1987), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1977 performance, "Crash", the same artist let a [[Cessna]] crash into the garbage dump on [[Staten Island]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Art in the Seventies'' (Cornell University Press, 1980), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance art, because of its relative transience, by the 1970s, had a fairly robust presence in the [[avant-garde]] of [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, especially [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

== 1980s ==
[[File:Intervention-58-02.jpg|thumb|[[Jocelyn Maltais]] in ''Intervention 58'', 1980]]
Until the 1980s, performance art had been demystifying virtuosity. Now it began to embrace technical brilliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Banes | first1 = Sally | title = Subversive expectations: performance art and paratheater in New York, 1976–85 | publisher = The University of Michigan Press | year = 1998 | location = New York, New York | pages = 120, 1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DdrVYfkAm6IC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=1980s+performance+art&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=1980s%20performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-23 | isbn = 0-472-09678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to ''Presence and Resistance''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Auslander | first1 = Philip | title = Presence and Resistance: Postmodernism and Cultural politics in Contemporary American Performance | publisher = University of Michigan Press | year = 1992 | location = Ann Arbour | pages = 64–65, 78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Philip Auslander]], dance critic [[Sally Banes]] writes "... by the end of the 1980s, performance art had become so widely known that it no longer needed to be defined; [[mass culture]], especially television, had come to supply both structure and subject matter for much performance art; and several performance artists, including [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Spalding Gray]], [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Willem Dafoe]], and [[Ann Magnuson]], had indeed become crossover artists in mainstream entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Banes | first1 = Sally | title = Subversive expectations: performance art and paratheater in New York, 1976–85 | publisher = The University of Michigan Press | year = 1998 | location = New York, New York | pages = 10, 1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DdrVYfkAm6IC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=1980s+performance+art&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=1980s%20performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-23 | isbn = 0-472-09678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that many performances are held within the circle of a small art-world group, [[RoseLee Goldberg]] notes in ''Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present'' that "performance has been a way of appealing directly to a large public, as well as shocking audiences into reassessing their own notions of art and its relation to culture. Conversely, public interest in the medium, especially in the 1980s, stems from an apparent desire of that public to gain access to the art world, to be a spectator of its ritual and its distinct community, and to be surprised by the unexpected, always unorthodox presentations that the artists devise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0500203393|title=Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present|first=Roselee|last=Goldberg|date=1 June 2001|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the performance art most discussed in the art-world of this decade were a performance by [[Linda Montano]] and [[Tehching Hsieh]] between July 1983 and July 1984, ''Art/Life: One Year Performance'' (Rope Piece), and [[Karen Finley]]'s ''I'm an Ass Man'' 1987.

Until the decline of the European eastern block during the late 1980s, performance art had actively been rejected by most communist governments. With the exception of Poland and Yugoslavia, performance art was more or less banned in countries where any independent public event was feared. In the GDR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Latvia it happened in apartments, at seemingly spontaneous gatherings in artist studios, in church-controlled settings, or covered as another activity, like a photo-shooting. Isolated of the western conceptual context, in different settings it could be like a playful protest or like a bitter comment, using subversive metaphors to express dissent with the political situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://perfomap.de/current/kart/reclaiming-the-invisible | title = Reclaiming the Invisible Past of Eastern Europe | accessdate = 2011-03-23 | last = Zajanckauska | first = Zane | author2 = Interview with Ieva Astahovska | publisher = map - media archive performance | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110416151339/http://perfomap.de/current/kart/reclaiming-the-invisible | archivedate = 2011-04-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1982, [[Hedwig Gorski]] designated the term [[performance poetry]], to distinguish her text-based vocal performances from performance art, especially the work of performance artists, such as Laurie Anderson, who worked with music at that time. Performance poets relied more on the rhetorical and philosophical expression in their poetics than performance artists, who arose from the visual art genres of painting and sculpture.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

From 1981 to 1994, the Dutch visual artist [[PINK de Thierry]] created what she came to call meta-performances: a conceptual mix of intervention art in public space, performance art—interacting with an audience, installation art—utilizing large structures to perform in or with, and media art—photography and film to register and exhibit.

While the [[Soviet bloc]] disintegrated, formerly repressed activities of performance artists like [[György Galántai]] in Hungary, or the Collective Action Group in Russia, became better known. Young artists from all over the former Eastern bloc, including Russia, turned to performance. Performance art at about the same time appeared in Cuba, the Caribbean and China. Chinese performance artists like [[Zhang Huan]] had been performing underground since the late 1980s. In the early 1990s [[Chinese performance art]] already was acclaimed in the international art scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Montano | first1 = Linda M. | title = Performance artists talking in the eighties | publisher = University of California Press Berkeley | year = 2000 | location = Los Angeles, London | pages = 479, 1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5Bl6wm-cV_oC&amp;pg=PA479&amp;dq=performance+art+1990s&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-31 | isbn = 0-520-21022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In these contexts performance art became a critical new voice with a social force similar to that found in Western Europe, the United States and South America in the 1960s and early 1970s. It should be emphasized that the eruption of performance art in the 1990s in Eastern Europe, China, South Africa, Cuba, and elsewhere should never be considered either secondary to or imitative of the West."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Montano | first1 = Linda M. | title = Performance artists talking in the eighties | publisher = University of California Press University of California Press Berkeley | year = 2000 | location = Los Angeles, London | pages = 479, 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5Bl6wm-cV_oC&amp;pg=PA479&amp;dq=performance+art+1990s&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-31 | isbn = 0-520-21022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1996, [[HA Schult]] has installed one thousand life sized "Trash People" made from garbage as "silent witnesses to a consumer age that has created an ecological imbalance worldwide". They travelled to [[Moscow]]'s [[Red Square]] (1999), the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids of Giza]] (2002) and the [[Great Wall of China]] (2001).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IaIwmEh-OpsC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Carlos Rojas, ''The Great Wall: A Cultural History''] (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. 163-64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ina-Maria Greverus and Ute Ritschel, eds., ''Aesthetics and Anthropology: Performing Life, Performed Lives'' (Berlin: LIT Verlag, 2009), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kim Levin]], ''ARTnews'', volume=6, 2011, pp. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the western world in the 1990s, even sophisticated performance art became part of the cultural mainstream: performance art as a complete artform gained admittance into art museums and became a museal topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Targ Brill | first1 = Marlene | title = America in the 1990s | publisher = Lerner Publishing Group | year = 2009 | pages = 93, 1 | location = Minneapolis | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BNXeIFQScocC&amp;dq=performance+art+1990s&amp;q=performance#v=snippet&amp;q=performance&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-31 | isbn = 978-0-8225-7603-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the decade, computer-aided forms of performance art began to take place.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Nate (2009), [https://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/09/horrifically-bad-software-demos-become-performance-art.ars "Horrifically bad software demo becomes performance art"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 2003, Tate Modern in London has had a curated programme of live art and performance and in 2012 The Tanks at Tate Modern were opened: the first dedicated spaces for performance, film, and installation in a major modern and contemporary art museum.

From March 14 to May 31, 2010, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] held a major retrospective and performance recreation of [[Marina Abramović]]'s work, the biggest exhibition of performance art in MoMA's history.&lt;ref&gt;Kino, Carol (March 10, 2010).

'''Peripeteia''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɛr|ə|p|ᵻ|ˈ|t|aɪ|.|ə}} ({{lang-el|περιπέτεια}}) is a reversal of circumstances, or turning point. The term is primarily used with reference to works of literature. The Anglicized form of ''peripeteia'' is '''peripety'''.

==Aristotle's view==
[[Aristotle]], in his [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]], defines peripeteia as "a change by which the action veers round to its opposite, subject always to our rule of probability or necessity." According to [[Aristotle]], peripeteia, along with discovery, is the most effective when it comes to [[drama]], particularly in a [[tragedy]]. He wrote that "The finest form of Discovery is one attended by Peripeteia, like that which goes with the Discovery in [[Oedipus]]...".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Poetics]], 1452a&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle says that peripeteia is the most powerful part of a plot in a tragedy along with discovery. A peripety is the change of the kind described from one state of things within the play to its opposite, and that too in the way we are saying, in the probable or necessary sequence of events. There is often no element like Peripeteia; it can bring forth or result in terror, mercy, or in comedies it can bring a smile or it can bring forth tears (Rizo). This is the best way to spark and maintain attention throughout the various form and genres of drama "Tragedy imitates good actions and, thereby, measures and depicts the well-being of its protagonist. But in his formal definition, as well as throughout the Poetics, Aristotle emphasizes that" ... Tragedy is an imitation not only of a complete action, but also of events inspiring fear or pity" (1452a 1); in fact, at one point [[Aristotle]] isolates the imitation of "actions that excite pity and fear" as "the distinctive mark of tragic imitation" (1452b 30). Pity and fear are effected through reversal and recognition; and these "most powerful elements of emotional interest in Tragedy-Peripeteia or Reversal of the Situation, and recognition scenes-are parts of the plot (1450a 32). has the shift of the tragic protagonist's fortune from good to bad, which is essential to the plot of a tragedy. It is often an ironic twist. Good uses of Peripeteia are those that especially are parts of a complex plot, so that they are defined by their changes of fortune being accompanied by reversal, recognition, or both" (Smithson).

Peripeteia includes [[character arc|changes of character]], but also more external changes.  A character who becomes rich and famous from poverty and obscurity has undergone peripeteia, even if his character remains the same.

When a character learns something he had been previously ignorant of, this is normally distinguished from peripeteia as [[anagnorisis]] or discovery, a distinction derived from Aristotle's work.

Aristotle considered anagnorisis, leading to peripeteia, the mark of a superior tragedy.  Two such plays are ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', where the oracle's information that Oedipus had killed [[Laius|his father]] and married [[Jocasta|his mother]] brought about his mother's death and his own blindness and exile, and ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'', where Iphigenia realizes that the strangers she is to sacrifice are her brother and his friend, resulting in all three of them escaping Tauris. These plots he considered complex and superior to simple plots without anagnorisis or peripeteia, such as when Medea resolves to kill her children, knowing they are her children, and does so. Aristotle identified ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' as the principal work demonstrating peripety.  (See Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.)

==Examples==

===''Oedipus Rex''===
In Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', the peripeteia occurs towards the end of the play when the Messenger brings Oedipus news of his parentage.  In the play, Oedipus is fated to murder his father and marry his mother.  His parents, Laius and Jocasta, try to forestall the oracle by sending their son away to be killed, but he is actually raised by Polybus and his wife, Merope, the rulers of another kingdom.  The irony of the Messenger’s information is that it was supposed to comfort Oedipus and assure him that he was the son of Polybus. Unfortunately for Oedipus, the Messenger says, "Polybus was nothing to you, [Oedipus] that’s why, not in blood" (Sophocles 1113).  The Messenger received Oedipus from one of Laius’ servants and then gave him to Polybus.  The plot comes together when Oedipus realizes that he is the son and murderer of Laius as well as the son and husband of Jocasta.  Martin M. Winkler says that here, peripeteia and [[Anagnorisis|anagnôrisis]] occur at the same time "for the greatest possible impact" because Oedipus has been "struck a blow from above, as if by fate or the gods. He is changing from the mighty and somewhat arrogant king of Thebes to a figure of woe" (Winkler 57).

===Conversion of Paul on the road to Damascus===
{{main|Conversion of Paul}}
The instantaneous conversion of Paul on the road to Damascus is a classic example of ''peripeteia'', which [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] presented in his ''Life of Constantine'' as a pattern for the equally revelatory conversion of [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. Modern biographers of Constantine see his conversion less as a momentary phenomenon than as a step in a lifelong process.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Paul Stephenson, ''Constantine, Roman Emperor, Christian Victor'' 2010: the ''trope'' of peripaty is discussed in "Constantine's Conversion", pp168f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Three Apples===
In "[[The Three Apples]]", a medieval ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', after the murderer reveals himself near the middle of the story, he explains his reasons behind the murder in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], which begins with him going on a journey to find three rare apples for his wife, but after returning finds out she cannot eat them due to her lingering illness. Later at work, he sees a slave passing by with one of those apples claiming that he received it from his girlfriend, a married woman with three such apples her husband gave her. He returns home and demands his wife to show him all three apples, but she only shows him two. This convinces him of her [[infidelity]] and he murders her as a result. After he disposes of her body, he returns home where his son confesses that he had stolen one of the apples and that a slave, to whom he had told about his father's journey, had fled with it. The murderer thus realizes his guilt and regrets what he has just done.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second use of peripety occurs near the end. After finding out about the culprit behind the murder, the protagonist [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] is ordered by [[Harun al-Rashid]] to find the [[tricky slave]] within three days, or else he will have Ja'far executed instead. After the deadline has passed, Ja'far prepares to be executed for his failure and bids his family farewell. As he hugs his youngest daughter, he feels a round object in her pocket, which is revealed to be the same apple that the culprit was holding. In the story's twist ending, the daughter reveals that she obtained it from their slave, Rayhan. Ja'far thus realizes that his own slave was the culprit all along. He then finds Rayhan and solves the case, preventing his own execution. That was a [[plot twist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''plot device''', or '''plot mechanism''', {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} is any [[narrative technique|technique]] in a [[narrative]] used to move the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Pfeil|title=Another Tale to Tell: Politics and Narrative in Postmodern Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18mRgWs-ptEC&amp;pg=PA267|accessdate=27 July 2013|year=1990|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-86091-992-6|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contrived or arbitrary plot device may annoy or confuse the reader, causing a loss of the [[suspension of disbelief]]. However a well-crafted plot device, or one that emerges naturally from the setting or characters of the story, may be entirely accepted, or may even be unnoticed by the audience.

== Examples of stories using plot devices ==
Many stories, especially in the fantasy genre, feature an object or objects with some great power. Often what drives the plot is the hero's need to find the object and use it for good, before the villain can use it for evil, or if the object has been broken by the villains, to retrieve each piece that must be gathered from each antagonist to restore it, or, if the object itself is evil, to destroy it. In some cases destroying the object will lead to the destruction of the villain. In the [[Indiana Jones]] film series, Jones is always on the hunt for some mystical artifact. In ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', he is trying to retrieve the [[Ark of the Covenant]]; in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', Jones is on a search for the [[Holy Grail]]. This plot device is also used in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale of "[[The City of Brass]]," in which a group of travelers on an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] expedition journeys across the [[Sahara]] to find a brass vessel that [[Solomon]] once used to trap a [[Genie|jinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=148–9 &amp; 217–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00141540|title=An Allegory from the Arabian Nights: The City of Brass|first=Andras|last=Hamori|journal=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]|volume=34|issue=1|year=1971|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=9–19 [9]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several books in the [[Harry Potter]] series orient around a certain object. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', Harry believes there is a magical stone in [[Hogwarts]] with special powers. [[Lord Voldemort]] needs this stone to bring back his body, and Harry looks for the stone first to prevent Voldemort's return.

The [[One Ring]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' has been labeled a plot device, since the quest to destroy it drives the entire plot of the novel. However, as [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]] puts it: "Tolkien, on the whole, gets away with the trick by minimizing the arbitrariness of the ring's plot-power and putting more stress than his imitators on the way the ring's power moulds the character of its wielder and vice-versa."&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;

== Examples ==

=== The MacGuffin ===
{{main|MacGuffin}}
A MacGuffin is a term, popularized by [[film director]] [[Alfred Hitchcock]], referring to a plot device wherein a character pursues an object, though the object's actual nature is not important to the story. Another object would work just as well if the characters treated it with the same importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VP_DGfInVBcC&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=MacGuffin+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=MacGuffin%20definition&amp;f=false | title = A Year of Hitchcock: 52 Weeks with the Master of Suspense | isbn = 9780810863897 | last1 = McDevitt | first1 = Jim | last2 = Juan | first2 = Eric San | date = 2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the MacGuffin, Alfred Hitchcock stated, "In crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is most always the papers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/MacGuffin
 |title=The Alfred Hitchcock Wiki
 |accessdate=2018-06-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts with, for example, the One Ring (from [[The Lord of the Rings]]), whose very nature is essential to the entire story.

MacGuffins are sometimes referred to as ''plot coupons'' (especially if multiple ones are required) as the protagonist only needs to "collect enough plot coupons and trade them in for a [[dénouement]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Mark | edition = illustrated | year = 2007 | title = Designing character-based console games | publisher = | page = 69 | isbn = 1584505214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]].&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]]|title=The Well-tempered Plot Device|url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/plotdev.html}}''In normal usage, when people talk of a plot device they mean something in the story that's just a little bit too obviously functional to be taken seriously.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deus ex machina ===
{{main|Deus ex machina}}
The term ''deus ex machina'' is used to refer to a narrative ending in which an improbable event is used to resolve all problematic situations and bring the story to a (generally happy) conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deus%20ex%20machina |title=deus ex machina |work=Merriam Webster Online |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin phrase "[[deus]] ex machina" has its origins in the conventions of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] tragedy, and refers to situations in which a [[mechane]] (crane) was used to lower actors playing a [[god]] or gods onto the stage at the end of a play.

The Greek [[Tragedy|tragedian]] [[Euripides]] is notorious for using this plot device as a means to resolve a hopeless situation. For example, in Euripides' play ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', the [[eponymous]] heroine agrees to give up her own life to Death in exchange for sparing the life of her husband, Admetus. In doing so, however, she imposes upon him a series of extreme promises. Admetus is torn between choosing death or choosing to obey these unreasonable restrictions.{{which | date = July 2013}} In the end, though, [[Heracles]] shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and freeing Admetus from the promises. Another example of a ''deus ex machina'' is [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D7eOal3UhFcC&amp;pg=PT24&amp;dq=%22Deus+ex+machina%22+gandalf+the+hobbit | title = Tolkien's Art: A Mythology for England | isbn = 0813138094 | last1 = Chance | first1 = Jane | date = 2001-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of seemingly limitless magical capabilities, he rescues the other main characters from all sorts of troubles. The first person known to have criticized the device was [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/classics/resources/poetics/poettran.htm
 |title=Aristotle's Poetics, adapted from the translation by S.H. Butcher
 |accessdate=2007-10-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shoulder angel ===
{{main|Shoulder angel}}
A shoulder angel is a plot device&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iyYGbs_QLioC&amp;pg=PT47&amp;dq=%22Shoulder+angel%22+fiction | title = Hatch's Plotbank | date = 2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for either dramatic or humorous effect in animation and comic strips (and occasionally in live-action television). The angel represents conscience and is often accompanied by a shoulder devil representing temptation. They are handy for easily showing inner conflict of a character. Usually, the angel is depicted on (or hovering near) the right shoulder and the devil or demon on the left, as the left side traditionally represents dishonesty or impurity (see [[Left-handedness#Negative associations of language|Negative associations of left-handedness in language]]). The Shoulder Angel and Shoulder Devil are both derived from the concept of the [[id, ego and super-ego]] in [[Psychoanalysis]], with the person in the center of the dispute being the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] between the [[super-ego]] Angel and the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]] Devil.

=== Red herring ===
{{main|Red herring}}
The function of a red herring is to divert the audience's attention away from something significant. Red herrings are very common plot devices in mystery, horror, and crime stories. The typical example is in [[whodunit]]s, in which facts are presented so that the audience is tricked into thinking that a given character is the murderer, when it is actually another character.

=== Plot voucher ===
{{See also|Chekhov's gun}}

A ''plot voucher'', as defined by Nick Lowe,&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; is an object given to a character (especially to the protagonist) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object. An example of a plot voucher is a gift received by a character, which later impedes a deadly bullet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8002">A '''poker dealer''' distributes [[Playing card|cards]] to players and manages the action at a [[poker]] table.

==Professional dealers==
Any [[casino]] with a poker room must hire a staff of dealers.  Casinos generally pay dealers [[minimum wage]].  However, a dealer's primary source of income is not salary, but [[tip (gratuity)|tip]]s from players.  Tip income may be substantial for dealers who can deal hands quickly and efficiently. (In some countries e.g., in Sweden, where all the casinos are owned by the state, Dealers and other casino personnel may not accept tips from players. This rule is complied with strictly.)

To become employable by a casino, applicants without prior experience are typically required to complete a 4-6 week training program at a dealing school.  Dealing in a casino may require working late hours and remaining seated for long periods of time.  Dealers also commonly work [[holiday]]s, since these are especially busy days for casinos.  Having to deal with difficult individuals may be another drawback to dealing at a casino&amp;mdash;some players are [[Verbal abuse|abusive]] to dealers.

[[Poker tournament|Major poker tournaments]] also hire dealers.  For a given tournament stop, the tournament coordinator will hire dealers on contract for the duration of the tournament, which may be a few days to a few weeks.  [[Room and board]] may or may not be provided by the tournament management; the dealer is typically responsible for his own travel expenses.

==Mechanics of dealing==
Dealers must be proficient in [[Shuffle|shuffling]] the deck, distributing the cards to the players, and, if required by the game being dealt, turning up the [[community card]]s in the center of the table.    There are two methods of distributing the cards, "American"-style and "European"-style.

===Shuffling===
To shuffle the cards, the dealer follows a sequence defined by the casino.  First all cards are spread out on the table and pushed around randomly.  This is called "scrambling" or "washing" the cards.  Then the cards are collected and squared into a deck.  At this point a typical shuffling sequence might be: riffle, riffle, box, riffle.  Professional dealers always keep both halves of the deck very low to the table while shuffling. Some casinos have automatic shufflers built into the table that shuffle a different deck of cards while the previous hand is being played, which speeds up the game. 

Finally, a cut card is placed on the table and the deck is [[Cut (cards)|cut]] onto the card.  The cut card is held on the bottom of the deck for the entire hand, to keep the bottom card from being exposed.

===American-style dealing===
In American-style dealing, the deck is held in one hand, and the dealer uses the thumb of their deck hand to slide the top card of the deck toward their pitching hand.  The pitching hand clasps the card between the thumb and index finger while at the same time the mid-point of the card touches the face (nail) of the middle finger.  It is the extension of the middle finger that 'pitches' the card off the top of the deck and a 'whoosh' should be heard as each card exits the top of the deck.

The ability to pitch cards accurately is critical, since the cards must be delivered in a way that players at the table can not see the undersides of the cards.  

===European-style dealing===
European-style dealers touch only the top of each card being dealt.  The card is pushed off the top of the deck to the table surface in front of the dealer.  The dealer then propels the card toward the recipient, usually imparting some spin to the card to encourage sliding.

===Burning and turning===
Before dealing a community card, the top card off the deck is [[Burn card|burned]], or discarded.  The rationale for burning is that the top card on the deck is visible to players during the previous betting round, so that a [[Cheating in poker|cheat]] might be able to spot a mark on the top card and therefore gain an advantage on his opponents.

When burning, the deck must be held low and the burn card kept level with the table surface.  Casinos watch carefully to make sure a dealer does not "flash", or inadvertently expose, the burn cards to players at the table.

In [[community card poker|flop]] games, the three community cards comprising the [[flop (poker)|flop]] are turned up simultaneously, never one at a time.

==Responsibilities during a hand==
Dealers control the action during a hand.  This may include prodding players to act, verbally announcing actions of players to the rest of the table, and correcting players who act out of turn.

Dealers also must manage the [[Pot (poker)|pot]].  The dealer must verify the amount of bets and raises by players, collect folded hands, maintain side pots, and read players' hands at showdown to identify the winner or winners.  In games with a [[rake (poker)|rake]], the dealer also must keep track of the amount of money in the pot and remove the appropriate amount for the house.

At times the dealer needs to communicate with the floor, or other casino staff.  Some casinos equip the dealers with a [[Headphones|headset]] or [[walkie-talkie]] for this purpose, while in other casinos the dealer must shout over the ambient noise.  The following table shows some common calls a dealer may make, and their meanings:

:{| class="wikitable" width="100%"
! align="left" | Call !! align="left" | Meaning
|-
| {{nowrap|"Floor" or "Decision"}} || Requests the floor manager to come to resolve a dispute.
|-
| "Seat open" || Announces that a player has left the game and a seat is now available.
|-
| "Player in" || Notifies the floor or brush that a vacant seat has been filled.
|-
| "Players checks" || Requests a chip runner to retrieve chips for a player.
|-
| "Fill" || Requests a chip runner to bring chips to fill the dealer tray.  This tray must be kept full of low denomination chips in a high limit game, so that change may be made in the pot so that the rake may be taken out.
|-
| "Set up" || Requests replacement decks be brought to the table.
|-
| "Pick up" ||  For cash games, used when an absent player's chips should be removed from the table to free the seat.  Also, for single-table [[Satellite tournament|satellites]], used to request the staff to come collect the cash entry fees from the table.
|-
| "Playover" || Alerts the floor that a new player will be playing in a seat taken by an absent player, until the absent player returns.  Usually a "playover box" or some other object is used to separate the seated player's money and chips from those of the person playing over.
|-
| "Winner" ||  Used in single-table satellites to announce that the game has completed and the prize is to be paid.
|-
| "Brush" || Calls the floor to deal with a game participation problem, for example if a game must be broken due to insufficient players.
|-
| {{nowrap|"Service" or "Cocktails"}} || Alerts the floor that a player wants a beverage and/or food.
|-
|}

==Online dealing==
[[Online poker]] sites use [[Random number generation]] (RNGs) when dealing cards. A successful RNG distributes cards in an unpredictable and random way.

: ''For current events, see [[Portal:Current events]]''

The term "'''present-day'''" (as an adjective) or "'''present day'''" (as a noun) is used to describe the approximate period of [[time]] that surrounds the [[present]]. Depending on the context, this period may be as narrow as referring to the immediate moment, or as broad as referring to the current [[year]] or [[decade]]. In general the term is used to refer to the [[wiktionary:contemporary|contemporary]] [[era]] at the time it is used.

== Media ==
When used in [[fiction|fictional]] or [[non-fiction|non-fictional]] media such as [[book|books]], [[film]], or [[television]], the term "present-day" is typically used to identify the time-period in which the depicted events are taking place, in one of the following ways:
#The events depicted take place at the literal time that the media is being viewed or read; in this case, the period referred to is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and depends upon when the media is experienced;
#The events depicted take place at the exact date in history when the media was published;
#The events depicted take place during the [[era]] during which the media was published, where the era may be identified in a way relevant to the rest of the elements in the media.{{vague|date=February 2015}}

Setting a fictional work in the "present-day" can have many intended effects on viewers or readers. In many cases it is a [[plot device]] used to engage the audience more quickly as the events are happening in a context that they can understand. In some cases, the intention is that portrayed events are to be understood as ''genuinely happening'' "right now"; the audience is meant to deliberately play into this [[suspension of disbelief]]. Many popular [[soap opera]]s are set in the present day, such as the [[England|English]] [[television series]] ''[[EastEnders]]''. Other more fanciful productions are also set in the present day to maintain intrigue in an audience, such as [[Stargate]] or [[X-Men]].

The use of the term "present-day" can also detract from media as, in the case of movies and books, it directly reveals the age of the media. For example, the movie, [[The Terminator]], has a title card near the beginning labelling it as taking place in the present day, even though the events are shown to occur in 1984 which was true to the initial release of the movie. This can have the effect of making the movie or book a lot less believable because it is labelled as the present day but the technologies and modern culture in the media effectively display the past and not the present, nullifying the effectiveness of the term 'present day'.

A '''prosumer''' is a person who [[Consumption (economics)|consumes]] and [[Production (economics)|produces]] a [[Product (economics)|product]]. It is derived from "prosumption", a [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com era]] business term meaning "production by consumers". These terms were coined in 1980 by American [[Futurism|futurist]] [[Alvin Toffler]], and were widely used by many technology writers of the time. Today it generally refers to a person using [[commons-based peer production]].

"Prosumer" is also a trade term, used from a business perspective, for high-end electronic devices (such as [[digital camera]]s), meaning a price point between "professional" and "consumer" devices.

==Definitions and origins==

This blurring of the roles of consumers and producers has its origins in the cooperative [[self-help]] movements that sprang up during various economic crises e.g. the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s.

=== General meanings of "prosumer" (no relationship to the business term "prosumption") ===
*Enthusiasts who buy products (almost always technical) that fall between professional and consumer grade standards in quality, complexity, or functionality. Prosumer also commonly refers ''to those products''.
*Semiprofessional.
*"Prosumer" is a well-accepted category for camcorders, digital cameras, VCRs, "and other video playthings."&lt;ref&gt;Its usage grew when "it became associated with the video equipment market." http://www.wordspy.com/words/prosumer.asp&lt;/ref&gt; These advanced product features and higher prosumer expectations lend themselves to increased customizing in Toffler's product-improvement sense (see the next section).

=== Producer and consumer ===
[[Marshall McLuhan]] and Barrington Nevitt suggested in their 1972 book ''Take Today'', (p.&amp;nbsp;4) that with electric technology, the consumer would become a producer. In the 1980 book, ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler book)|The Third Wave]]'', [[futurologist]] [[Alvin Toffler]] coined the term "prosumer" when he predicted that the role of producers and [[consumer]]s would begin to blur and merge (even though he described it in his book ''Future Shock'' from 1970). Toffler envisioned a highly saturated [[marketplace]] as [[mass production]] of [[standardization|standardized]] products began to satisfy basic consumer demands. To continue growing [[Profit (economics)|profit]], businesses would initiate a process of [[mass customization]], that is the mass production of highly customized products.

However, to reach a high degree of customization, consumers would have to take part in the production process especially in specifying [[design]] requirements. In a sense, this is merely an extension or broadening of the kind of relationship that many affluent clients have had with professionals like [[architect]]s for many decades. However, in many cases architectural clients are not the only or even primary end-consumers, a distinction touched upon in the [[Humanity+|H+ Magazine]] essay 'Prosumption Architecture: The Decentralization of Architectural Agency as an Economic Imperative'.&lt;ref&gt;Lorimer, A. 'Prosumption Architecture: The Decentralization of Architectural Agency as an Economic Imperative', H+ Magazine, 2014, [online] http://hplusmagazine.com/2014/01/13/prosumption-architecture-the-decentralisation-of-architectural-agency-as-an-economic-imperative/ [04/02/14]&lt;/ref&gt;

Toffler has extended these and many other ideas well into the 21st-century. Along with more recently published works such as ''[[Revolutionary Wealth]]'' (2006),  we can recognize and assess both the concept and fact of the ''prosumer'' as it is seen and felt on a worldwide scale. That these concepts are having global impact and reach, however, can be measured in part by noting in particular, Toffler's popularity in [[China]]. Discussing some of these issues with [[Newt Gingrich]] on [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[After Words]]'' program in June 2006, Toffler mentioned that ''The Third Wave'' is the second ranked bestseller of all time in China, just behind a work by [[Mao Zedong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.trumix.com/podshows/521309 |title= C-SPAN - After Words created. Toffler interviewed by Gingrich Episode
 |publisher   = [[C-SPAN]] |date = June 6, 2006 |accessdate  = December 5, 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090126051635/http://www.trumix.com/podshows/521309 |archivedate = January 26, 2009 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Tapscott]] reintroduced the concept in his 1995 book ''The Digital Economy.''

Despite several decades of usage, the term only recently began to receive full theoretical elaboration.  [[George Ritzer]] and Nathan Jurgenson, in a widely cited article, claim that prosumption has become a salient characteristic of [[Web 2.0]].  Prosumers create value for companies without receiving wages.

Mass customization has not taken place in most areas of the economy. Mass customization has ruled the food &amp; beverage industry for years. Look at how many choices we are faced with in the grocery stores and supermarkets. Brand extension and dilution are ways companies have sold more under various names, giving us thousands of choices. Most consumption continues to be passive as critics of [[television]], [[sound recording|recorded]] music, and [[fast food]] would argue. Indeed, people are generally uninterested in going to the effort of customizing the myriad products that comprise modern consumer culture. In ''The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less'', [[Barry Schwartz (psychologist)|Barry Schwartz]] argues that [[diminishing returns]] from a [[confusion|confusing]] abundance of consumer choice is producing [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and dissatisfaction.&lt;sup&gt;[[#External links|3]]&lt;/sup&gt; Still, one key area of high-customization ''is'' taking place: highly involved hobbyists.

In the digital and online world, Prosumer is used to describe today's online buyers because not only are they consumers of products, but they are able to produce their own products such as, customised handbags, jewellery with initials, jumpers with team logos etc.

In the field of renewable energy, prosumers are households or organisations which at times produce surplus fuel or energy and feed it into a national (or local) distribution network; whilst at other times (when their fuel or energy requirements outstrip their own production of it) they consume that same fuel or energy from that grid. This is widely done by households by means of PV panels on their roofs generating electricity. Such households may additionally make use of battery storage to increase their share of self-consumed PV electricity, referred to as prosumage in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schill|first=Wolf-Peter|last2=Zerrahn|first2=Alexander|last3=Kunz|first3=Friedrich|date=2017-06-01|title=Prosumage of solar electricity: pros, cons, and the system perspective|url=https://doi.org/10.5547/2160-5890.6.1.wsch|journal=Economics of Energy &amp; Environmental Policy|language=English|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.5547/2160-5890.6.1.wsch|issn=2160-5882}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green Iain Staffell|first=Richard|date=2017-06-01|title='Prosumage' and the British Electricity Market|url=https://doi.org/10.5547/2160-5890.6.1.rgre|journal=Economics of Energy &amp; Environmental Policy|language=English|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.5547/2160-5890.6.1.rgre|issn=2160-5882}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also done by businesses which produce biogas and feed it into a gas network while using gas from the same network at other times or in other places. The European Union’s Nobel Grid project, which is part of their Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, uses the term in this way for example.

With customization focused on [[leisure]] pursuits, Toffler's initial combination has been largely supplanted by a second pair of blurring roles: that of the [[professional]] and consumer. In particular, [[hobby]]ists have become ever-more demanding in the pursuits of their hobbies, often rising above the level of dilettante (an amateur, someone who dabbles in a field out of casual interest rather than as a profession or serious interest) to the point of commanding skills equal to that of professionals. Key examples of such hobbies are:
*[[home improvement]] as illustrated by the rise of [[hardware store]]s such as [[Home Depot]]
*[[cooking]] as illustrated by creation of entirely new [[cable television]] channels entirely dedicated to the culinary arts such as The Food Channel or [[Food Network]]
*[[photography]] as illustrated by [[camcorder]]s and still [[camera]]s that are often on par with equipment used by professionals

This ''professional'' slant of the prosumer term is most common in photography which is a field that highlights prosumer [[Fads and trends|trends]]. Access to professional-level equipment and skills is made possible by combination of factors such as:
*high [[disposable income]]s by some sectors of the population
*increased leisure time, again, for some sectors of the population
*[[deflation (economics)|continuously falling prices]] of ever more advanced products (especially electronics)
*media geared towards amateurs and hobbyists:
**beginning in the 1980s with the advent of [[desktop publishing]], a growing profusion of [[magazine]]s to satisfy specialized interests
**beginning in the mid-1990s with the advent of the [[Internet]], an even wider range of [[website]]s with [[internet forum|online forum]]s to pool experience
*Pertaining to electronics; are considered to be "on the fence" as a product of lower quality than a professional product, and higher quality (sometimes in the form of [[wikt:bells and whistles|bells and whistles]]) than a consumer product. Some examples include:
** Digital camcorders
** Still cameras
** [[High-definition television|HDTV]]s
Toffler’s Prosumption was well described and expanded in economic terms by Philip Kotler, he saw Prosumer/Prosumption as a new challenge for marketers.&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, Philip. (1986). Prosumers: A New Type of Customer. Futurist(September–October), 24-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Kotler anticipated that people will also want to play larger role in designing certain goods and services they consume, furthermore modern computers will permit them to do it. He also described several forces that would lead to more prosumption like activities, and to more sustainable lifestyles, that topic was further developed by Tomasz Szymusiak in 2013 and 2015 in two marketing books.&lt;ref&gt;Szymusiak T., (2013). Social and economic benefits of Prosumption and Lead User Phenomenon in Germany - Lessons for Poland [in:] Sustainability Innovation, Research Commercialization and Sustainability Marketing, Sustainability Solutions, München. {{ISBN|978-83-936843-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Szymusiak T., (2015). Prosumer – Prosumption – Prosumerism, OmniScriptum GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Düsseldorf. {{ISBN|978-3-639-89210-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-corporate producer and consumer===
{{Anarchism sidebar |Economics}}
Yet a third meaning or usage of prosumer is springing up, especially among some [[activist]] groups. That is, the producer and consumer roles are being combined so as to ''exclude'' (or at least diminish) the role of the [[corporation|corporate]] producer; thus, rather than generating higher corporate profits from [[value-add]]ed products, producers would, at best, be reduced to supplying lower-profit [[commodity]] inputs. Indeed, the more consumer-oriented prosumer spin is irrelevant to many people with diminished disposable income caused by various economic trends such as [[globalization]], [[automation]], and [[wealth concentration]].

=== Prosumer from company perspective ===
A fourth view of the Prosumer is from the companies' perspective; that is, companies that open up their processes to the end-user, integrating them as prosumers for shared benefits. Such motivated enthusiasts can be, for instance, brought into a company's R&amp;D. Other benefits might include strengthened customer relations and faster feedback cycles.
Companies and individuals are increasingly utilizing and involving the [[end-user]]s to develop final products and services. In some instances, end-users are creating products on their own, without the interference from (or assistance of) third parties (i.e. companies, organizations, etc.). For example, [[Lego Mindstorms]] allows users to download software from Lego's website so that the users can edit and update software as they wish.

===Prosumption===
In their 2006 book ''[[Wikinomics|Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything]]'', [[Don Tapscott]] and Anthony D. Williams use the related term of prosumption (production/consumption; also coined by Toffler) to refer to the creation of products and services by the same people who will ultimately use them.

== Impact and reception ==

===Adoption===
Identifiable trends and movements outside of the mainstream economy that have adopted prosumer terminology and techniques include:
*a ''Do It Yourself'' ([[DIY]]) approach as a means of economic self-sufficiency or simply as a way to survive on diminished income
*the [[open source software]] movement creates software on their own, prime example is the successful [[operating system]] [[Linux]] which now dominates the server domain
*[[Fablab]] movement, self-fabrication capabilities especially [[3d printing]]
*the [[voluntary simplicity]] movement that seeks personal, social, and environmental goals through prosumer activities such as:
**growing one's own food
**repairing clothing and appliances rather than buying new items
**playing musical instruments rather than listening to recorded music
*use of new media-creation and distribution technologies to foster independent, open, non-profit, "consumer-to-consumer" media and cultures (see [[Wikipedia]], [[Independent Media Center|Indymedia]], most of [[Creative Commons]]); many involved in independent media reject [[popular culture|mass culture]] generated by [[concentration of media ownership|concentrated corporate media]]
*self-sufficient [[barter (economics)|barter]] networks, notably in [[developing nations]], such as Argentina's [[Red Global de Clubes de Trueque Multirecíproco|RGT]] have adopted the term prosumer&lt;sup&gt;[[#External links|4]]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Influence on a company's R&amp;D budget ===
A fourth view of the ''prosumer'' is as one who is aware:
* the fact that the whole wealth of a company (including profits, interests, ads, wages, investments, etc. plus waste, losses, taxes, fines, etc.) comes from the retail prices paid by generations of common consumers
* in a non-(quasi-)[[Perfect concurrence|perfect concurrence]] market, all prices are not equitable prices, they are influenced by some violence on wants in the strength rate between demand and supply, the difference between cost and price is the measurement of violence on wants
* the sense of existence itself of the whole economy is to serve the consumer
* retail price payers, or common consumers of the same product (or of different products sold by the same retailer company, or users of the same branch of a supplying line) can:
** decide together as consumers
** join, communicate, organize both locally or via the Internet, so that they can publish petitions offering the company:
*** ways to improve a product and its supply service
*** ways to help the company stop wasting its main resource, its consumers
*** how to improve the marketing (as often oligopolistic marketing is "hostile marketing", exploiting and manipulating retail price payers)
*** ways to improve positive motivations to work
** influence the R&amp;D spending of a company in ways which directly benefit them;
For example, a manufacturer of widgets has a customer who changes their requirements, asking that all their widgets sing. This customer is important enough that losing them would seriously hurt the company's bottom line. Based on this customer's request, the company direct a portion of its R&amp;D budget to address this requirement. While the customer didn’t make the changes directly, they did influence the company's design requirements. This arrangement has positive effects for both parties;

for the customer
* immediate access to the new technology
* technology that meets their specific requirements
for the company
* a strengthened relationship with the customer
* a demonstration of willingness to keep their customers satisfied
* a new feature/product/service they can market to other customers

'''''Sasuke''''' (サスケ; stylized in Japan as '''''SASUKE''''') is a Japanese [[sports entertainment]] [[television special]] in which 100 competitors attempt to complete a four-stage [[obstacle course]]. An edited version, named '''''Ninja Warrior''''', is screened in at least 18 other countries.

{{TOC limit|2}}

==Development==
Recorded on location at [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|Midoriyama]] studio in [[Yokohama]], it airs on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] between [[Japanese television drama]] seasons. The show's name ''Sasuke'' is named after [[Sarutobi Sasuke]], a fictitious character in Japanese storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jamison|first1=Leslie|title=The Great American Obstacle Course|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-great-american-obstacle-course|accessdate=19 August 2017|publisher=The New Yorker|date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each three-hour special (with the exception of ''Sasuke'' 24 which lasted 5 {{frac|1|2}} hours) covers an entire competition; there are normally 100 participants. There have been 35 specials produced, approximately one new special per year (twice per year before Monster9's bankruptcy, now reduced to once per year since 2012, except in 2017). The show is produced by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] and is one of the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] of {{Nihongo|''[[Kinniku Banzuke|Muscle Ranking]]''|筋肉番付|Kinniku Banzuke}}, another sports entertainment competition, which aired on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] under the name ''[[Kinniku Banzuke|Unbeatable Banzuke]]''. Until the 10th competition, ''Sasuke'' was broadcast as a special part of ''Muscle Ranking'', but it became an independent program when ''Muscle Ranking'' was discontinued. The first competition was held indoors, marking the only time ''Sasuke'' did not take place outside. Competitions generally start in the daytime and continue until completed regardless of weather or darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Corkill, Edan, [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20110930r1.html "Average Joes become champions on 'Sasuke'"]. ''[[Japan Times]]''. September 30, 2011. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; After Monster9's bankruptcy in November 2011, all rights to the show fell completely into the hands of its broadcaster, Tokyo Broadcasting System. Following their acquisition of all rights to ''Sasuke'', TBS renamed the show '''''Sasuke Rising''''' for the 28th, 29th and 30th editions, but have since reverted to the original name. TBS renamed the show once again '''''Sasuke Ninja Warrior''''' since the 35th edition.

Applicants are interviewed or auditioned and trial rounds are held to test their physical ability until the field is narrowed to 100 competitors. ''Sasuke'' consists of four stages of increasing difficulty; competitors must complete a stage to advance. Before the 18th tournament, a 1,200-meter run was held in order to determine the competitors' starting positions. Each competition is taped prior to the air date, edited for time, and broadcast as a three-hour show. Exceptions may be made as in ''Sasuke'' 24's case should TBS decide the broadcast should go over three hours, but this is a rare exception.

In its 35 seasons, all four stages of the course were only completed a total of five times, by four different competitors. These were [[:ja:秋山和彦|Kazuhiko Akiyama]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neatorama.com/2007/01/16/makoto-nagano/] April 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in the 4th competition (1999), [[Makoto Nagano]] in the 17th competition (2006), [[Yuuji Urushihara]] in the 24th (2010) and 27th (2011) competitions,&lt;ref&gt;"Yuuji Urushihara does it again" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWdY38IfTE] ''Youtube'', 11/6/2011&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yusuke Morimoto]] in the 31st competition (2015).

===Popularity===
The popularity of ''Sasuke'' has led to the creation of a number of spin-off shows and international versions of the show. ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'', perhaps the most well-known spin-off, is a version of ''Sasuke'' restricted to female competitors with an emphasis on speed, balance, and stability.

''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' is the United States version of the show. Originally integrated with ''Sasuke'' (with American finalists participating on the ''Sasuke'' course in Japan), it was at one point the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network's highest rated show.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Gary. [https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2010-12-07-ninja07_ST_N.htm "Americans latch onto G4's intense 'Ninja Warrior'"]. ''[[USA Today]]''. December 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As of season 4, ''American Ninja Warrior'''s popularity has allowed it to move to the [[NBC]] network and expand as a stand-alone spin-off with a full replica course in Las Vegas, although Americans have continued to enter ''Sasuke'' even after the inception of ''ANW''.

Other international versions of the format have aired in India, Singapore, Malaysia, Turkey, Sweden, Denmark, [[Ninja Warrior UK|United Kingdom]], Bahrain, China, [[Sasuke Ninja Warrior Indonesia|Indonesia]], Russia and Vietnam, with versions also launching in France ([[TF1]]), Germany ([[RTL Television|RTL]]), Italy (NOVE of [[Discovery Networks]]) in 2016, and Israel ([[Keshet Media Group]]) . An [[Australian Ninja Warrior|Australian version]] launched on [[Nine Network]] in July 2017. [[Netflix]] also started airing ''[[Ultimate Beastmaster]]'', broadcast in six different languages in 2017, a ''Sasuke'' inspired show.

==Competitors==
The show hosts a broad spectrum of participants. While most are from Japan, national television personalities and Olympians from other countries, including the US, [[Bulgaria]], China and Korea, have taken part in the competition. Some of the more enthusiastic competitors dress up in costumes, bring props to the starting stage, or show off some of their talents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Sasuke All-Stars===
The Sasuke All-Stars were a group of six favored competitors, established by the TBS network, originally thought to be the most likely to clear all four stages. It included two of the men to complete the ''Sasuke'' course, Kazuhiko Akiyama (1999, 4th tournament) and Makoto Nagano (2006, 17th tournament). The membership of the All-Stars has remained unchanged despite other successful competitors in later tournaments, notably, Yuuji Urushihara who completed the course in the 24th and 27th tournaments. The All-Stars were officially 'retired' in the 28th tournament. Two of them continue to compete independently, and are now referred to as 'former All-Stars'.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The six consisted of:
*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kazuhiko Akiyama|ja|3=秋山和彦}}''', a crab fisherman and massage therapist. He is known for being the first contestant to ever achieve total victory. He has not been able to repeat his success, being hindered by an eye condition known as degenerative [[retinitis]] that has been affecting him for years. Overall, he has competed 20 times and has been officially retired since ''Sasuke'' 28 in 2012. An offer was made for Akiyama to return for the 30th anniversary tournament in 2014, but he declined and has remained retired since.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

†&amp;nbsp;– Nagano touched the top of the Shin-Cliffhanger after swinging from the second to the third ledge. He disqualified himself, admitting his error and bowing out after he reached the next platform.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; – Nagano was allowed a second attempt at the First Stage due to a malfunction of the Slider Jump.

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Toshihiro Takeda|ja|3=竹田敏浩}}''', a [[firefighter]]. Known for reaching the Third Stage more than anyone else. He can usually be seen wearing his trademark orange firefighter pants and dark blue shirt, though he changed his trademark clothes since ''Sasuke'' 30 after he quit his firefighter job. However, he is the only All-Star that hasn't made it to the Final Stage yet. Overall, he has competed 26 times and continues to compete to this day. The only times he didn't appear were in ''Sasuke'' 26 and ''Sasuke'' 27, thus avoiding any risk affecting his new job as a Helicopter Rescue Jumper.

†&amp;nbsp;– Takeda had no number in the 18th tournament. He was around the 86th person to run the course.

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Shingo Yamamoto|ja|3=山本進悟}}''', a [[gas station]] manager. Only person never to miss a single tournament. He is also the only person to have attempted the first and second version of the Final Stage in ''Sasuke'' 3 and ''Sasuke'' 7. He can be seen wearing his trademark gas station uniform shirt and cap (always with Esso/Mobil branding); he has only competed without it seven times (the 1st, 4th, and 28th since he changed his job). He continues to compete to this day.

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Bunpei Shiratori|ja|3=白鳥文平}}''', a government worker in the Health and Service department. He is also known for building obstacles in his backyard (over 13 of them, in fact), and many competitors have visited his home to train on the 'Shiratori Shrine' (However, as of ''Sasuke'' 30, it has been demolished). He has competed the least of the All-Stars: only 12 times due to chronic back and neck pains that have continued to plague him for years. Despite having only competed once since ''Sasuke'' 21, he is not officially retired and has not ruled out the possibility of returning should his health permit it, although this is unlikely.

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Katsumi Yamada|ja|3=山田勝己}}''', a steel worker known as "Mr. ''Sasuke''" or "Mr. ''Ninja Warrior''". He was once thought to be the one most likely to complete the entire course by the tournament's producers, but has not passed the First Stage in thirteen years, since tournament 12. He has "retired" from ''Sasuke'' on three separate occasions following the 12th, 24th and 28th tournaments, but returned each time nonetheless. He was given the nickname "Mr. ''Sasuke''" because he was once thought to be the most likely competitor to clear all four stages, but hasn't passed the First Stage since ''Sasuke'' 12. Overall, he has competed 27 times, second only to Yamamoto Shingo, but has been barred from competing since ''Sasuke'' 30 in 2014. However, on a broadcast of Nico Nico in December 2016, Inui Masato revealed to the chat that Katsumi Yamada will be allowed to return as it is the 20th anniversary of the show since it began airing in 1997, should he be healthy enough to compete.&lt;ref&gt;"Sasuke 3 Review: Keep Rolling, Rolling, Rolling Log: Final Stage Podcast Episode 21" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7ZxYq3TYak] ''Youtube'', January 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was disqualified, he did manage to clear the 2nd Stage with 3.4 seconds remaining.

===Sasuke New Stars (Shin Sedai)===
The Sasuke New Stars (in contrast to the All stars) are new younger competitors who have made a name for themselves on the recent editions of the course. "Shin Sedai" or New Stars became famous since ''Sasuke'' 17, after Shunsuke Nagasaki made it to the Final Stage.  There was a brief hiatus before the term was re-popularized in ''Sasuke'' 22 when Yuuji and Kanno made it to the Third Stage.  Membership in the New Stars has included the following:

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Shunsuke Nagasaki|ja|3=長崎峻侑}}''', a trampolinist. He is considered one of the most promising of recent competitors.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} This skilled trampolinist, who is called "Prince of the Trampoline", has won several medals in the Trampoline World Cups and Doha Asian Games. He made his debut in ''Sasuke'' 14. He is the first to be called one of the "Shin Sedai" in ''Sasuke'' 17, however, he made his first Final Stage appearance in ''Sasuke'' 17 in 19 years, the second youngest to reach the Final Stage. He failed the First Stage in ''Sasuke'' 19; after that he didn't compete for six years. In 2012 he retired from athletics. He made his comeback on ''Sasuke'' 29, however he timed out on the Passing Wall. He failed the Crazy Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 30. He timed out in the Lumberjack Climb in ''Sasuke'' 31 but his run was all cut. He failed the Flying Bar in ''Sasuke'' 32 and failed it again in ''Sasuke'' 33. Surprisingly, he failed the Spider Walk in ''Sasuke'' 34. He failed the Spider Drop in ''Sasuke'' 35, the first time he failed the Second Stage for the two consecutive times. This meant that Nagasaki was eliminated at the Second Stage in consecutive tournaments for the first time. As of 2018, Nagasaki has completed the First Stage eleven times (five consecutively), the Second Stage seven times (four consecutively), and the Third Stage once.

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Yuuji Urushihara|ja|3=漆原裕治}}''', a [[shoe]] salesman, an Unlimited Cliffer member No. 3.{{clarify|date=May 2017}} He spent upwards of five years trying to qualify through the ''Sasuke'' Trials. Finally, he qualified for ''Sasuke'' 21, and in the next tournament became the first competitor to reach Shin-''Sasuke''{{'s}} Final Stage. He got his Final Stage attempt in ''Sasuke'' 22, but he failed it close to the button. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he became the third person to achieve Kanzenseiha, and in ''Sasuke'' 27, he went on to become the only person to achieve it twice. In ''Sasuke'' 28, he failed the Crazy Cliffhanger. In ''Sasuke'' 29, he failed the Backstream. In ''Sasuke'' 30, he timed out on the Wall Lifting. In ''Sasuke'' 31, he took more time to clear the Tackle and timed out on the Soritatsu Kabe. In ''Sasuke'' 32, he was one of the notable competitors who failed on the new obstacle Double Pendulum when he failed the transition to the red sandbag. In ''Sasuke'' 33, he surprisingly failed Rolling Hill. He made a good transition from Quad Steps to the Rolling Hill, but he lost his balance in the middle of the Rolling Hill. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he declared that if he failed the First Stage again, he would retire. Then the results show that he cleared the First Stage, but he struggled in Reverse Conveyor and timed out there. In SASUKE 35, he cleared the first few obstacles with ease, including the new Dragon Glider, but eventually timed out on the Soritatsu Kabe due to the reduced time limit and exhaustion.

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Yoshiyuki Okuyama|ja|3=奥山義行}}''', a former 200&amp;nbsp;m run Japan representative of the 1991 World Championships in Athletics. He currently works as a sports gym instructor and occasionally competes in amateur motorbike races as shown in ''Sasuke'' 24. He has competed in nine ''Sasuke'' tournaments and is one of the most consistent competitors, making it to the Third Stage six times and almost achieving kanzenseiha in ''Sasuke'' 24. Okuyama considers ''Sasuke'' his personal Olympics, and trains non-stop for the competition. However he failed the Backstream in ''Sasuke'' 29, ending his Third Stage appearance record.

*'''Yusuke Suzuki''', a PE teacher in a junior high school in Kanagawa. He competed five times. He competed since ''Sasuke'' 16 but his run was all cut. After a seven-year hiatus, he competed in ''Sasuke'' 28, he failed the Spin Bridge and the second wall of the Ni Ren Soritatsu Kabe in ''Sasuke'' 30. He also competed in ''Sasuke'' 31 but his run was completely cut. He returned for ''Sasuke'' 32 wearing number 66, and completed the First Stage for the first time with just 2.12 seconds remaining. He then went on to clear the Second Stage, becoming one of eight to do so, with 9.59 seconds remaining. However, his first attempt on the Third Stage was a struggle. On the first transition of the Drum Hopper he slipped and nearly fell, and only just managed to reposition himself, while the other transitions showed signs of unease. His strength was sapped for the next obstacle, the Flying Bar, where he failed the first transition after the bar did not reach the second set of rungs. In his fluff piece for ''Sasuke'' 32, it was falsely stated that he had failed the First Stage four times, when in fact he had competed for the first time in four tournaments beforehand. In ''Sasuke'' 33, his run was digested but he failed the Double Pendulum. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he failed the Sidewinder Kai. He was unable to repeat his performance from the previous tournament as he had a surprising fall on the Fish Bone in ''Sasuke'' 35.

===Athletes===
World-class athletes, including Olympians, have attempted ''Sasuke'':

====Japanese athletes====

Several Japanese athletes have competed in ''Sasuke'' over the years, including professional team [[Team handball|handball]] player [[Daisuke Miyazaki]], who was featured in the 20th, 21st, 22nd and 26th competitions. In his debut, the 20th competition, he failed on the Halfpipe Attack. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 21, where he made it all the way to the Third Stage Devil Steps. In ''Sasuke'' 22, he timed out on the Net Climb in Stage 1, and in ''Sasuke'' 26, he failed the First Stage Rolling Escargot.

After the 27th competition, three Japanese Olympians competed: [[Tomoko Hagiwara]], [[Koki Sakamoto]], and [[Daisuke Nakano]]. Hagiwara competed in the 28th competition, but she failed the Quintuple Step. She also competed in the 29th competition, but she failed the Hedgehog. Sakamoto competed in the 28th competition, wearing #95 (the highest number for non all-stars that tournament), but he timed out on the second Warped Wall. Nakano competed in the 29th competition, but he failed the Jump Hang Kai, while trying to grab both nets.

====American athletes====
Various American athletes, including Olympic [[gymnastics|gymnasts]] (and twin brothers) [[Paul Hamm|Paul]] and [[Morgan Hamm]], have competed in ''Sasuke''. Paul made it to the Second Stage in the 14th and 16th competitions but failed to make it further&amp;nbsp;– in the 14th, he cleared Wall Lifting but forgot to hit the button at the end before time ran out, and in the 16th, he was eliminated by the Metal Spin. He competed in the 15th competition as well, but he failed to make it past the First Stage's Warped Wall. Morgan timed out in the First Stage before he could attempt the Rope Climb in the 14th competition, but he made it to the Third Stage in the 15th, failing on the Curtain Cling. In the 16th competition, he failed the First Stage's Warped Wall.

[[Decathlon|Decathlete]] [[Paul Terek]] competed four times in total. He first appeared in the 17th competition, making it to the Third Stage before failing the Cliffhanger. The announcer pointed to his immense size (6 foot 3 and 215 pounds) as a barrier to his advancement. After earning the title of ''Pro Sportsman No. 1'' in 2007, Terek appeared in the 19th competition but failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider. He helped G4 oversee the 2nd ''American Ninja Challenge'' competition in early 2008, but he did not compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th competition due to his training for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing (though he eventually had to drop out of the running for the Olympics after suffering a torn meniscus in his left knee). He made his return to ''Sasuke'' in the 22nd competition but failed on a new obstacle in the First Stage, the Slider Jump. He failed the same obstacle in ''Sasuke'' 24. In 2010, Paul Terek announced his retirement from international competition, so it is likely he will never compete again.

[[Henry Cejudo]], gold medal-winning [[freestyle wrestling|wrestler]] at the [[2008 Olympic Games]] in Beijing, competed in the 21st competition, but failed the First Stage's Halfpipe Attack.

Levi Meeuwenberg, a [[Freerunning|free runner]] from G4's ''American Ninja Challenge 2'', first competed in ''Sasuke'' 20, where he was one of only three people to clear the First Stage and the only person to clear the Second Stage. He cleared Stage 2 with a record time of 38.5 seconds left. He failed the Third Stage's Shin-Cliffhanger. In the 21st competition, he failed the Salmon Ladder in the Second Stage; in the 22nd, he failed the new Slider Jump; in the 23rd, he made it back to the Third Stage but failed the Shin-Cliffhanger again. He missed the 24th competition but returned for the 25th, where he failed the first obstacle of the Second Stage, the Slider Drop. However, he couldn't compete in the 26th competition after breaking his wrist while participating in ''[[Jump City: Seattle]]'', a televised professional parkour tournament.

Levi did not compete in ''American Ninja Warrior'' 3 to try to earn a spot for ''Sasuke'' 27 because of a big movie scene that came up for him during the time of the tryouts.

Levi however did compete ''American Ninja Warrior'' 4, however he failed the Quad Steps (Godantobi in Japanese), the very first obstacle. It was clear he was very tired as he had flown in from the Philippines hours beforehand and tried to rush.

He has not competed in ''American Ninja Warrior'' ever since. It is known that he stopped free running altogether, and became a farmer instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About - Realeyes Permaculture Homestead |url=https://realeyeshomestead.com/about/ |website=Realeyes Permaculture Homestead |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the four times he completed the First Stage, he had the fastest time out of everyone who finished Stage 1.

He also participated in ''American Ninja Challenge'' and then became an ''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' stalwart once NBC and G4/Esquire created an entire American-based ''Sasuke'' competition. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 30 (reaching the Third Stage), after he won the ''Sasuke'' Asean Open Cup 2013 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (where he achieved a gold medal in overall stages) and ''ANW'' Season 7 and 8 (where he is to compete in the Vegas Finals) in the space of a calendar year. He competed again in ''Sasuke'' 31 and failed the Crazy Cliffhanger. He made his fourth appearance in ''Sasuke'' 32; he is the first person ever to beat the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger and the third American to clear the Japanese Cliffhanger, after Travis Allen Schroeder in ''Sasuke'' 4 and [[Kane Kosugi]] in ''Sasuke'' 8, but he failed the next obstacle Vertical Limit Kai. In ''Sasuke'' 33, he failed the second trial on the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger, due to timing problems on the moving ledge. He fell at the same place just like the last tournament in ''Sasuke'' 34. He managed to clear the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger, the second time he cleared it. Unfortunately, he failed on the first ledge of the Vertical Limit, he managed to get hold of the ledge and made it halfway before falling in ''Sasuke'' 35.

====Bulgarian athletes====
[[Bulgaria]]n gymnast and six-time Olympian (1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012) [[Yordan Yovchev]] (spelled on G4 as '''Jordan Jovtchev''') first competed in the 8th competition. During that competition he reached the Final Stage but became the first competitor to suffer a 15-second timeout on the initial Spider Climb portion, falling when it spread apart. Rain and a two-second late start also hurt his performance. He made it to the Third Stage three more times in competitions 12, 14, and 16, failing the Cliffhanger each time. He competed in the 15th competition but failed the Warped Wall in the First Stage. He later came back to compete in ''Sasuke'' 20, where he failed the Warped Wall again. He also competed in ''Sasuke'' 23, where he managed to pass all of the other obstacles but sadly timed out on the final rope ladder.

====Taiwanese athletes====
*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Lee En-Chih|ja|3=リー・エンチ}}''' (who was incorrectly listed as ''Lee Yen Chi'' in the US version and was mistakenly called ''Lee Enchi'' or ''Li En Zhi'' for years), is a professional rock climber from Taiwan. In his first attempt in ''Sasuke'' 17, he cleared the First Stage but failed the Second Stage's Metal Spin. In ''Sasuke'' 18, he failed the Jumping Spider in the First Stage. After a two-tournament absence, he competed in ''Sasuke'' 21 and was one of only nine competitors to make it to the Second Stage, timing out on Wall Lifting. In ''Sasuke'' 22, he was one of four people to make it to the Third Stage, ultimately failing the Shin-Cliffhanger. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he failed the Second Stage's Metal Spin. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he made it to the Final Stage for the first time but timed out 19 meters away. Li became the third foreigner to reach the Final Stage since [[Yordan Yovchev]] and [[Kane Kosugi]] in ''Sasuke'' 8. In ''Sasuke'' 25, he went to the Third Stage, but he failed the Ultimate Cliffhanger. He made it back to the Ultimate Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 26, but again failed there.  In ''Sasuke'' 25 and 26, Li finished first overall, becoming the only foreigner to have progressed further than any competitor in consecutive tournaments. After making it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger two times, it looked as if Li would go all the way in ''Sasuke'' 27. However, he shocked many when he failed the Step Slider in Stage 1. This was his earliest defeat ever, and first time failing Stage 1 since ''Sasuke'' 18. He failed the First Stage yet again in ''Sasuke'' 28, on the Spinning Bridge. He finally cleared the First Stage again in ''Sasuke'' 29, but timed out on the Passing Wall, on the Second Stage. He failed the Crazy Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 30. He decided to retire from ''Sasuke'' due to replacement by Taiwan representatives. Since ''Sasuke'' 31, his fellow Liao Long Zhun fully ruled the Taiwan representatives. He is also the only foreigner to clear Stage One six times in a row (''Sasuke'' 21–26).

Actor [[Ryosuke Yamamoto (actor)|Ryosuke Yamamoto]] competed in ''Sasuke'' 30 and ''Sasuke'' 31. He never completed the First Stage, failing in Jump Hang Kai in ''Sasuke'' 30.

===Japanese comedians===
Several Japanese comedians have taken part in ''Sasuke'', including {{Interlanguage link multi|Akira Omori|ja|3=大森晃|lt=Akira Omori}} ("The Monkey"), [[Koriki Choshu]] ("the most famous gut in Japan" and 2nd on G4's Craziest Contestants Poll), [[Passion Yara]] ("screaming wacko" and 5th on G4s craziest contestants poll), [[Masaki Sumitani]] ("Razor Ramon H.G." or "Hard Gay"), [[Yoku Hata]] ("Guitar Samurai"), [[Tetsurō Degawa]], and {{Interlanguage link multi|Kinnikun Nakayama|ja|3=なかやまきんに君}}. Most of these compete for entertainment value and do not represent serious challenges&amp;nbsp;– for example, Choshu's only accomplishment was being the first person to clear the Rope Glider in the 18th competition. However, some have seen success. Omori made it to the Final Stage three times in a row (1st–3rd competitions), a record that is shared with ''Sasuke'' all-star [[Makoto Nagano]], but since then he has not been able to clear the First Stage. Nakayama made it to the Second Stage in the 9th and 11th competitions; in the 9th, Nakayama failed the Spider Walk, and in the 11th, he missed hitting the Second Stage's final button by a split-second. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 27. He had footage showing himself training for the new course. He wore #30, and despite his training, he failed the Rolling Escargot when he could not get enough momentum to get the structure spinning, and fell into the water when trying to restart the obstacle. He got revenge on it in the 28th tournament, but timed out on the second Warped Wall. In the 29th tournament, he almost cleared the First Stage for the first time in 10 years, but ultimately, timed out at the top of the Rope Ladder. Recent comedians include [[Yoshio Kojima]], who competed in five competitions (22, 24, 26–28), where he failed at the Log Grip twice, Hazard Swing, Step Slider, and Rolling Escargot respectively. Funnyman [[Masumi Yagi]] was featured in the 26th competition but failed on the Step Slider. Cocky comedian [[Eiko Kano]] (aka "Mr. Narcissus") was featured in the 25th competition and failed at the Dome Steps, but got past the first obstacle in the 26th competition and failed at the Rolling Escargot.

Penalty comedian{{clarify|reason=In English, penalties aren't funny.|date=June 2018}} {{Interlanguage link multi|Wakky|ja|3=ワッキー}} competed nine times in ''Sasuke''. He debuted in ''Sasuke'' 20 and failed the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 21 and 22, he failed the Jumping Spider. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he got revenge on both the Jumping Spider and the Halfpipe Attack, only to fail the Slider Jump. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he failed the Halfpipe Attack again. He returned for ''Sasuke'' 27 and cleared the First Stage for the first time. In the Second Stage, he failed the Double Salmon Ladder. In ''Sasuke'' 28, he timed out on the Rope Ladder. He advanced to the Second Stage in ''Sasuke'' 29 and 30, but failed the Swap Salmon Ladder.

===Other notable competitors===
65-year-old Minoru Kuramochi, known as "the Octopus" because he usually brings an octopus with him, is the owner of the Edokko Izakaya octopus bar in Tokyo and is one of the oldest competitors. He has competed several times, never making it very far into the First Stage. Despite this, he seems to be a fan favorite. In the 20th competition's preview special, he welcomed the G4 American Ninja Challengers to his bar, served them his special octopus meal, and showed off his physical skills to them. He is No. 4 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 26, where he managed to make it to the Rolling Escargot. He got further than in ''Sasuke'' 19, when he timed out on the Pole Maze.

Toyohisa Ijima, a martial arts dance instructor and former member of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]], competed in the first several tournaments. He is known as the "Japanese Bruce Lee" because of his resemblance to the [[Bruce Lee|late action star]], which extends to dressing and acting like him. He has only made it past the First Stage in the 1st tournament; in the 11th tournament, he missed hitting the final button on the Rope Climb by a split second because he had wasted time posing for the crowd after completing each obstacle. He is No. 3 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll.

45-year-old Katsuhide Torisawa is a former weightlifter who has competed in every single Shin-''Sasuke'' tournament (except ''Sasuke'' 22), starting with ''Sasuke'' 18. He always displays his strength before his run; he has brought a barbell and lifted it over his head multiple times, ripped off his shirt, and crushed an apple and full cans of beer with one hand, and also snapped a baseball bat in half. He has never cleared the First Stage.

===Women in ''Sasuke''===
The first woman to have completed the First Stage is former ''[[Super Sentai]]'' stuntwoman [[Chie Tanabe|Chie Nishimura]], who did so in the 2nd tournament.&lt;ref&gt;In that tournament, her last name was listed as Tanabe because at the time she was single.&lt;/ref&gt; She attempted the Second Stage's Spider Walk in a non-optimal fashion, because her legs were too short to reach across the obstacle the proper way, and failed. She also competed in ''Sasuke'' 3 but failed the Rolling Log. She hasn't competed in ''Sasuke'' since.

[[:jp:遊佐雅美|Masami Yusa]] (G4 mislists her first name as "Miyabi" in some tournaments), a [[Beach Flags (sport)|beach flags]] champion, has competed eight times. She debuted in ''Sasuke'' 6, but failed the Barrel Climb. In the ''Sasuke'' 13 trials, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang, although she timed out there. During the actual competition, she was able to grab on to the redesigned Jump Hang, but she misjudged her jump, slammed face-first onto the platform, and fell into the water; this failure earned her a "Warrior Wipeout" during G4's broadcasting of this tournament. In ''Sasuke'' 14, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang and the Crooked Wall in competition, but she ultimately timed out on the Warped Wall.

All three women who achieved ''kanzenseiha'' on ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'' ''(Women of Ninja Warrior)'', the female equivalent of ''Sasuke'', have also competed in ''Sasuke'' itself, though none have cleared Stage 1. All are also acrobats who worked with Muscle Musical.

* Ayako Miyake, who achieved ''Kunoichi'' total victory three straight times ''(Kunoichi 4–6)'', has also competed in ''Sasuke'' twice, going out in Stage 1 both times – the Sandan Rolling Maruta in ''Sasuke'' 17 and the Jumping Spider in ''Sasuke'' 18.

* ''Kunoichi 8'' champion Rie Komiya, who is a broadcaster and model as well as an acrobat, has competed several times. She first competed in ''Sasuke'' 22, where she was disqualified on the Jumping Spider for falling into the safety mat just after the trampoline. She got her revenge in ''Sasuke'' 23, but she fell on the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 24, she surprised many by failing the Log Grip. She did not compete in ''Sasuke'' 25, but did compete in ''Sasuke'' 26, and failed the Rolling Escargot and she competed again in ''Sasuke'' 27, where she failed the Rolling Escargot again.

* Satomi Kadoi, the other ''Kunoichi 8'' champion, competed in ''Sasuke'' 27 and failed the Halfpipe Attack.

American gymnast [[Kacy Catanzaro]], who famously became the first woman in the world to clear both the Warped Wall and the Salmon Ladder during ''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' qualifiers in Dallas in 2014, traveled to the original Mt. Midoriyama for ''Sasuke'' 32 and cleared the Warped Wall at the second attempt before narrowly timing out.

Another American woman and ''American Ninja Warrior'' standout, stuntwoman [[Jessie Graff]] – the first woman to complete Stage 2 in Las Vegas (''ANW All-Stars'') – was one of the two invited US entrants including Drew Drechsel in ''Sasuke'' 34 the next year. She became only the second woman in ''Sasuke'' history after Nishimura to complete the First Stage, doing so with 14.5 seconds left on the clock (which would have been under the limit set for the male competitors as well; the female competitors were given an extra 10 seconds.) She then surprised everyone once again when she managed to complete Stage 2 with 4.4 seconds left on the clock, becoming the very first woman to ever clear the Second Stage in ''Sasuke''. In Stage 3, Graff started strongly, completing the first three obstacles in good form. However, despite her determination, she failed the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she attempted the first jump from the first to the second ledge and was unable to hold on. However, having impressed the onlookers, she was invited back for the following tournament.

===American Ninja Challenges===
{{Main article|American Ninja Challenge}}
In fall 2007, the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network held a contest called the ''American Ninja Challenge'', whose grand prize was a trip to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 19th competition. Ten semifinalist videos were selected on August 3 via internet poll to determine three finalists who would appear on G4's ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'' on August 28–30 to demonstrate their ''Ninja Warrior'' skills. On August 31, [[Michigan State University]] Economics student Colin Bell and the runner-up, [[Greenville, South Carolina]] native Brett Sims, were both selected, and they became the subjects of an hour-long G4 special on November 14 during G4's ''Ninjafest''. Ultimately, both Colin and Brett qualified for the course thanks to their impressive physical abilities, but they both failed the Jumping Spider.

The second contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 2'' on May 18, 2008. Levi Meeuwenberg of [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and Brian Orosco of San Francisco, California were both chosen to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th tournament; both are [[Parkour|free runners]]. They competed alongside surprise guest Brett Sims, who was given the opportunity to return by G4. Sims failed the First Stage's Warped Wall, while Orosco failed the Flying Chute. Meeuwenberg, however, made it to the Third Stage before he ultimately failed the Shin-Cliffhanger. In that tournament, he was the last man standing.

The third contest by G4 wrapped up in August 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 3'' on November 12, 2008. Viewers voted for their favorite competitors, the top three of whom would be flown to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 21st tournament. The winners were Brian Orosco (who qualified with a different video), gymnast Mark Witmer of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and free runner/stuntwoman Luci Romberg&amp;nbsp;– the first woman to qualify&amp;nbsp;– of [[Valley Village, California]]. They joined ''American Ninja Challenge'' 2 winner Levi Meeuwenberg and both hosts from ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'', [[Olivia Munn]] and [[Kevin Pereira]], to compete in ''Sasuke'' 21. In that tournament, Munn failed the Sextuple Step, while Pereira's run ended after his feet hit the water on the Log Grip; on the TBS broadcast, Munn's run was shown only in part while Pereira's run was cut completely. Romberg failed the Halfpipe Attack, while Witmer failed the Log Grip due to a severe [[ulnar nerve]] injury that he suffered while warming up. Orosco completed the First Stage with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock but failed the Second Stage's Salmon Ladder. Meeuwenberg cleared Stage 1 with the fastest time, with 21.5 seconds remaining, but similarly failed the Salmon Ladder.

The fourth contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2009 and aired on June 21, 2009 on G4 as part of ''Ninjafest 4''. The competitors' videos were judged by ''Attack of the Show''{{'s}} Olivia Munn. The winner, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], was joined by Munn and previous competitors Levi Meeuwenberg and Luci Romberg. Munn failed the new Circle Hammer in the First Stage; Romberg failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider; Campbell timed out on the final First Stage obstacle, the Rope Ladder, and later told the sideline reporter that he "underestimated the cardio" involved in the course. Meeuwenberg failed a new First Stage obstacle, the Slider Jump.

In the summer of 2017 [[Jessie Graff]] went on to compete in ''Sasuke'' 34, wearing number #87. She made an impressive mark becoming the second woman in the show's history to clear Stage 1. She also kept the streak going when she became the first woman ever to clear Stage 2. During her Stage 3 run she showed great upper body strength on the course, getting through the first three obstacles, she made it to the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she failed the jump from the first ledge to the second ledge.

==Results==

==List of ''Sasuke'' stages and obstacles==

===Stage 1===
One hundred participants are given the opportunity to attempt the First Stage, a course which primarily tests one's speed. The object is to hit the [[buzzer]] at the end of the course before the allotted time expires. If a competitor goes out of bounds or comes into contact with the water in any of the pits below the course, he or she is disqualified from the competition.

Typically, 85 to 90 of the 100 original entrants are eliminated in this stage. However, in the 4th competition, a record 37 of the original 100 competitors made it past the First Stage. After the 4th, 17th, 24th, and 27th competition, the First Stage was thoroughly redesigned to be much more difficult and prevent large numbers of people from moving on. In fact, a G4 special inside the making of the 18th ''Sasuke'' competition revealed that the redesign of the First Stage for the 18th competition was done with the intention of seeing all 100 challengers fail it. This did not happen, however, and that has only spurred the production team on to make this and all stages to follow even harder.

That goal was almost met in the 19th competition, where much to everyone's surprise, only two competitors cleared the First Stage (neither of the two being ''Sasuke'' All-Stars), a record in ''Sasuke'' history. (The only time something similar has happened was in the first ''Kunoichi'', where again, only two competitors cleared the First Stage.) Executive producer Ushio Higuchi said in interviews later that even he was surprised at the results, anticipating that around 10 to 12 people would survive in spite of the production team's attempts at making the First Stage unbeatable.

'''+''' — This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.

&lt;div class="references-small;" &gt;
{{note|1|1}} Although the names of the obstacles were different from the second tournament, the obstacles were still the same.

{{note|2|2}} TBS officially considers that they are two different obstacles as their two names "{{lang|ja|フリークライミング}}"(Free Climbing) and "{{lang|ja|�?登り}}"(Wall Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. However, ''Ninja Warrior'' has referred to the Free Climbing/Wall Climb combination as the "Mountain Climb" in subtitles.

{{note|3|3}} This Hill Climb is completely different from the one that would later become the Warped Wall after the 4th competition.

{{note|4|4}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "Prism See-Saw" is called the "Prism Tilt" in subtitles. But the Japanese announcer calls it the "Prism See-Saw."

{{note|5|5}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "Cross Bridge" is called the "Bridge of Blades" in subtitles. But the Japanese announcer calls it the "Cross Bridge."

{{note|6|6}} Although referred to as the Jump Hang, the obstacle in the 13th competition consisted of many ropes hanging vertically, completely different from the rope net used in all other competitions. Some call it the "Rope Hang," but that name is erroneous.

{{note|7|7}} The Rope Ladder's name and obstacle symbol was not shown in ''Ninja Warrior's'' obstacle chart in the 18th due to lack of room for TV screening. However, in the 19th they had the Rope Ladder and NOT the Tarzan Rope. The Japanese announcer still calls the last two obstacles by their official names.

{{note|8|8}} As of the 22nd competition, G4 has referred to the Tarzan Rope/Rope Ladder combination as the "Final Climb".

{{note|9|9}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', The X-Bridge is called the ''Bridge of Blades'' in subtitles just like the Cross Bridge.

{{note|10|10}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "Tackle" is called the "Triple Tackle" in the UK English dub. 

{{note|11|11}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "TIE Fighter" is called the "Prop Slider" in the UK English dub due to not having the rights from the Star Wars franchise to use a name associated with a Star Wars character. 
&lt;/div&gt;

===Stage 2===
Those with enough skill to complete Stage One then take on an even more grueling set of obstacles in Stage Two. 283 competitors have reached the Second Stage. Like Stage One, the obstacles alter throughout the competitions, but all hold to the same principle: if the competitor makes a single mistake they fall into the water below. The obstacles determine the time limit, and it is usually between 50 and 100 seconds.

Unlike the First Stage, which has always required the competitors to hit a buzzer at the end of the course to stop the clock and pass the course, the Second Stage did not have a buzzer at its end until the 8th competition. Before then, the competitors simply walked through an open gate to stop the clock.  From the 8th competition onward, the buzzer opens the gate. If the competitor breaks the gate open without hitting the button, they are disqualified. In addition, the course judges can hold the gates closed if a competitor committed a foul earlier in the Second Stage that would result in their disqualification, such as using the Chain Reaction gloves on the Spider Walk as "Mr. ''Sasuke''" Katsumi Yamada had done in the 12th competition.

On average, 10 to 15 competitors attempt the Second Stage on each competition. A record 37 competitors attempted the Second Stage during the 4th competition. Also during the 4th competition, a record 11 competitors cleared the Second Stage. During the 5th competition, however, only three men made it to the Second Stage due to new, tougher obstacles in the First Stage. In the 19th competition, neither of the two qualified competitors cleared the circuit (a fall and a timeout on the Salmon Ladder), marking the earliest end of a ''Sasuke'' competition.

'''+''' — This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.

&lt;div class="references-small;"&gt;
{{note|10|10}} The Moving Walls and Spider Climb are actually included in the Spider Walk, but TBS officially considers that they are three different areas as their three names "{{lang|ja|スパイダーウォーク}}" (Spider Walk), "{{lang|ja|動�??�?}}" (Moving Walls) and "{{lang|ja|スパイダークライム}}" (Spider Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. ''Ninja Warrior'' just sees them as a single obstacle and calls it "Spider Walk".

{{note|11|11}} The onscreen Japanese graphics "{{lang|ja|五連�?ンマー}}" reveal this obstacle's real name as "Five Continuous Hammers". On ''Ninja Warrior'', this obstacle is referred to as the Hammer Dodge.

{{note|12|12}} In those competitions there are two "Moving Walls" in the Spider Walk, but TBS does not officially call them independent obstacles, and just considered the whole Spider Walk as one obstacle only.

{{note|13|13}} After the 27th tournament, there was one bridge (with four chains) instead of two.
&lt;/div&gt;

===Third Stage===
The Third Stage has no time limit, allowing contestants to go at their own pace. Contestants are allowed a few seconds of rest between obstacles during which they can apply "sticky spray" to improve their grip. While the first two stages focus on speed and agility, this course almost exclusively tests one's upper body strength and stamina.

Out of 3,000 total competitors and 283 Second Stage competitors, 139 have attempted the Third Stage. The Third Stage is so grueling that, on average, someone passes it only every other competition. Only 22 individuals have ever passed it, and only six have passed it more than once, namely Akira Omori, Shingo Yamamoto, Makoto Nagano, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, and Yusuke Morimoto.

'''+''' — This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.

&lt;div class="references-small;" &gt;
{{note|15|15}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "Pole Bridge" is called the "Pillar Path" in subtitles. But the English version and the Japanese announcer call them the "Pole Bridge."

{{note|16|16}} The onscreen Japanese graphics ({{lang|ja|�?山}}) reveal this obstacle's real name as "Pincushion"; on ''Ninja Warrior,'' it's called "Eye of the Needle."

{{note|17|17}} The onscreen Japanese graphics ({{lang|ja|�?ングムーブ}}) reveal this obstacle's real name as "Hang Move"; on ''Ninja Warrior,'' it's called "Chain Swing".

{{note|18|18}} ''Ninja Warrior'' calls the "Pole Jump" the "Super Vault."

{{note|19|19}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "Climbing Bars" are called the "Bridge of Destiny" in subtitles. But the English version and the Japanese announcer call them the "Climbing Bars," one of the many [[gairaigo]] (words borrowed from [[English language|English]]) used to describe ''Sasuke'' obstacles.

{{note|20|20}} In the 19th and 20th this obstacle was the Sending Climber, but in the 21st they changed the obstacle and the name to Hang Climbing. G4 calls it Ascending Climb.

{{note|21|21}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "Lamp Grasper" is called the "Globe Grasp" in subtitles. But the Japanese announcer calls it the "Lamp Grasper."

{{note|22|22}} The Kudari Lamp Grasper is also called the Descending Lamp Grasper. G4 continues to call it the "Globe Grasp."

{{note|23|23}} The Vertical Limit Kai was modified to have three separate sections instead of two.
&lt;/div&gt;

===Final Stage===
To date, the Final Stage has known six forms. Each of these share a single, common goal: to scale the tower and reach the button at the top before time expires. If the competitor does not reach the top platform in time, the rope is cut and the competitor falls (they are caught by a safety line). Starting from the 18th competition, the rope is no longer cut. Reaching the top is referred to as ''kanzenseiha'' ({{lang|ja|完全制覇}}), translated roughly as "complete domination", and rendered on ''Ninja Warrior'' as "total victory". The Final Stage's time limit is between 30 and 45 seconds.

Of all the competitors to attempt to claim victory, only 24 have been admitted to the Final Stage, and only six of them have gotten there more than once (Akira Omori in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd competitions, Shingo Yamamoto in the 3rd and 7th, Makoto Nagano in the 11th, 12th, 13th, his victory in the 17th competition and in the 23rd competition, Yuuji Urushihara in the 22nd and his victories in the 24th competition and 27th, Ryo Matachi in the 27th competition and 30th, Yusuke Morimoto's victory in the 31st competition and in the 35th competition). Currently there are only four victors: Kazuhiko Akiyama defeated ''Sasuke'' in the 4th competition, Makoto Nagano in the 17th, Yuuji Urushihara in the 24th and in the 27th, and Yusuke Morimoto in the 31st.

The original Final Stage consisted of climbing a 15 meter (49&amp;nbsp;ft) rope. The contestant must start climbing from a seated position.

The second version of the Final Stage was unveiled in the 7th competition, when Shingo Yamamoto became the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was increased to {{convert|22.5|m|ft}}.  It consists of a {{convert|12.5|m|ft}} Spider Climb followed by a {{convert|10|m|ft}} Rope Climb.  After 15 seconds, the walls of the Spider Climb spread apart. This ensnared [[Yordan Yovtchev]] during the 8th competition, when he failed to complete the Spider Climb before it began spreading, and fell off the tower.

The third version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 22nd competition, when Yuuji Urushihara was the first to try it. The height of the tower remained mostly the same as the second version of the Final Stage, but two new obstacles were used: a {{convert|13|m|ft|adj=on}} "Heavenly Ladder" and a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} "G Rope." The time limit was increased to 45 seconds, then reduced to 40 seconds in the 23rd competition. Competitors are not dropped due to the Heavenly Ladder being in the way.

The fourth version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 27th competition, when Ryo Matachi was the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was reduced to 20 meters and consisted of a 20 meter (66&amp;nbsp;ft) Rope Climb similar to the first version of the Final Stage, but with a 5 meter height difference. The time limit stayed at 40 seconds. Unlike the first version of the Final Stage, competitors started at a standing position instead of a seated position.

The fifth version of the Final Stage was briefly seen in Stage 3 and in a trailer of ''Sasuke Rising''. Its design was similar to that of the fourth version of the Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb. Unlike its predecessor, this version is 4&amp;nbsp;m taller, and the competitors would have likely climbed up the rope in a seated position. The time limit would have likely been 35 seconds, as Urushihara may have cleared this particular version with one second left. It was used for only one tournament.

For the sixth version, with the removal of the previous version of the Final Stage, it was not unusual to see a change similar to that of the 18–24 version from the Metal Ladder to the Heavenly Ladder. The previous Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb was thrown out all together and the return of the 7–17 Final Stage took its place. The Spider Walls seem to take up less space this time, and the Rope Climb appears to take up more. Nevertheless, the height of the tower has once again increased, this time to 24&amp;nbsp;m. The Spider Climb (スパイダークライム) appears to be the same as its predecessor, at 12.5&amp;nbsp;m, while the Rope Climb (綱登り) was slightly modified in length at 11.5&amp;nbsp;m from that of its original predecessor, at 10&amp;nbsp;m. The time limit is likely to stay the same at 30 seconds, though a 35 second Final Stage is not out of the question.

The prize for completing the Final Stage was [[Japanese yen|¥]]2,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|2000000|JPN}}). The prize has now increased to [[Japanese yen|¥]]4,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|4000000|JPN}}) since the completion of the 17th tournament. In the 24th tournament a [[Nissan Fuga]] was also a prize if anyone could complete the Final Stage.

Typically, only one or two people make it to the Final Stage, if any make it at all. However, both the 3rd and 24th competitions saw a record five competitors attempt the Final Stage. After the 4th competition, though, the Final Stage was only achieved on average every other tournament.

&lt;div class="references-small;" &gt;
{{note|24|24}} According to the Sasuke Mania Official Site, the official Japanese names for the ropes in 1st–4th, 5th–17th, and 25th–27th are "{{lang|ja|15m綱登り}}", "{{lang|ja|10m綱登り}}" and "{{lang|ja|20m綱登り}}" respectively, in which "{{lang|ja|綱登り}}" means "Rope Climb". ''Ninja Warrior'' just calls them "Rope Climb", without the length of the ropes.

{{note|25|25}}  If the "Spider Climb" is not completed in fifteen seconds, the walls start to slide back, making it harder to traverse, and finally impossible if not completed soon after.

&lt;/div&gt;

===United States===
{{further information|American Ninja Warrior}}
The program previously aired on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] in the United States under the name '''''Ninja Warrior'''''. Each episode now lasts thirty minutes and it also includes some minor changes in the on-screen graphics. Throughout the episode, there's the "Ninja Killer" (for the obstacle that took out the most competitors) and "Warrior Wipeout" (honors the best wipeout) segments. The Japanese [[play-by-play]] commentary and interviews with the competitors have English [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], while the competitor profiles, [[Instant replay|replays]], and introductions were [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by [[voice actor]] [[Dave Wittenberg]].

The show became the highest rated program on the network since its debut. Aside from a few sporadic occurrences, reruns of ''Ninja Warrior'' stopped airing regularly sometime in December 2012 in wake of G4 slated to be rebranded as the [[Esquire Network]] on September 23, 2013. The last four episodes to air on G4 appeared as a two-hour block on April 10, 2013. It is unknown if ''Ninja Warrior'' would return to the network's schedule or if some other channel would acquire the series. Commercials on G4 show ''American Ninja Warrior'' to air on G4 in July, marking it the last program being advertised on the network as a G4 program, and not an Esquire channel presentation.

As of August 3, 2016, an article released by ''USA Today'' says that "Esquire has obtained rights to 27 Ninja Warrior tournaments...along with all eight Kunoichi spinoff contests that feature only women contestants." and that they "...will return as a 63 hour Labor Day weekend marathon (Sept. 3, 7 a.m. ET/PT) in Japanese, with English subtitles." Whether this is referring to the original broadcasts or the G4 broadcasts is unknown right now due to little notice, but it seems to lean toward the G4 broadcasts. They also stated that "Additional newer tournaments of the series, never seen in the U.S., will debut next year."

====''American Ninja Warrior''====

{{main article|American Ninja Warrior}}
The popularity of the ''American Ninja Challenge'' has led G4 to produce a version of the series featuring American contestants called ''American Ninja Warrior'', which is produced by Pilgrim Films and Television, Inc and is currently hosted by [[Akbar Gbaja-Biamila]] and [[Matt Iseman]]. Auditions on G4's website ended on August 18, 2009. Open tryouts were held in Los Angeles on August 29 and 30, 2009, and were taped for the show, with ten finalists competing on the 23rd tournament of the original Ninja Warrior course in Japan in September 2009. The eight-episode series began airing on December 12, 2009.

The qualifying round consists of over 300 competitors, running an obstacle course strongly influenced by ''Sasuke''{{'s}} First Stage. The course consists of the Quintuple Step, a Rope Swing, the Jumping Spider, a modified version of the Pipe Slider, and a much smaller Warped Wall. The preliminaries used a leader board, and the 30 fastest times moved on to the semi-finals, which included the preliminary course plus three obstacles, the Tarzan Jump, the Jumping Bars, and a Net Climb.

''American Ninja Warrior'' aired only the American finalists during the ''Sasuke'' obstacle course. The Japanese competitors were later aired on April 10, 2010.

A second season was cast on G4's website as of April 10, 2010 and aired in hour long specials starting December 8, 2010. The top 10 contestants would participate in ''Sasuke'' 26. Three episodes were run for the first two weeks. The first three episodes covered the opening round of the competition; the fourth covered the semifinals.  This was followed by four days of a "boot camp" where the fifteen winners of the semifinals were divided into three five-man teams and put through several different Pressure Challenges, with the losing team having to complete a punishment while the other two teams got extra training time on models of some of the ''Sasuke'' obstacles (The Warped Wall, Double Salmon Ladder, Balance Tank, and Circle Slider).  The teams would then run through a grouping of the obstacles with some sort of hindrance (usually carrying something heavy between obstacles). The teams with the worst time would be forced to send two members to an elimination challenge, with the losing person forced to leave.

After boot camp, the ten final winners traveled to the ''Sasuke'' course to compete. Once again, only the American competitors were aired during the special, with the rest of the ''Sasuke'' competition to air later. The most successful of the American competitors in the past, Levi Meeuwenberg, withdrew from the competition due to a fractured wrist, giving his spot to Adam LaPlante. Five members failed in the First Stage: Patrick Cusic and former ''[[American Gladiators]]'' champion and gladiator [[Evan Dollard|Evan "Rocket" Dollard]] both fell from the new Rolling Escargot obstacle, LaPlante fell on the Halfpipe Attack and Adam Truesdell fell from the Giant Swing, a new variation of the Jump Hang, the only one out of all 100 competitors to do so in the whole tournament. In addition, veteran Shane Daniels once again timed out on the Cargo Net. In the Second Stage, four of the remaining five cleared, while Travis Furlanic fell on the Balance Tank, an obstacle he struggled on during boot camp. In the Third Stage, Paul Kasemir failed the Doorknob Grasper. Brent Steffensen made it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger before falling into the water. [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], despite having the fastest times of all the competitors to compete (finishing the Second Stage with over 24 seconds left) failed at the Ultimate Cliffhanger as well. Brian Orosco fell at the very first obstacle, the Roulette Cylinder, which he had passed easily in the previous competition. While the $250,000 prize went unclaimed, ''Sasuke'' 26 was the start of a successful showing by a collection of American competitors.

The third season of ''American Ninja Warrior'' debuted on July 31 on G4, again with 300 competitors at the tryouts in Venice Beach. While many top competitors were absent including Levi Meeuwenberg, Rich King and Luci Romberg, a talented crop of new competitors took their place including Denver Broncos wide receiver Matt Willis, who finished the course but did not qualify for boot camp. Other notable competitors who failed to advance to boot camp included two-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Shane Daniels, season two veterans [[Evan Dollard|Evan "Rocket" Dollard]], Adam Truesdell, Adam LaPlante and Patrick Cusic, top first round qualifiers from the previous season Trevor Vaughn and David Money, and former world freerunning champion Tim Shieff. In addition, professional freerunner and ''[[Survivor: China]]'' competitor Michael "Frosti" Zernow ranked in the top fifteen and was invited to boot camp, but injured himself and was replaced with fellow ''Jump City: Seattle'' competitor Jake Smith. Other competitors from ''Jump City'' who advanced to boot camp also included Brian Orasco, Drew Dreschel and David "Young Flip" Rodriguez. The level of competition in boot camp was noticeably higher in the third season, as competitors were only given one attempt at each obstacle in challenges, leading to a large increase in time penalties. Promising competitors Dustin Rocho, Brandon Douglass, Alan {{Not a typo|Connealy}}, second-seeded qualifier Chris Wilczewski and five-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Brian Orosco all saw their ''Sasuke'' dreams come to an end at boot camp.

Of the ten who advanced to ''Sasuke'', nine easily cleared the First Stage. The only exception was Dreschel, who injured his knee landing on the Halfpipe Attack, and despite a valiant attempt at the Warped Wall, was unable to put any weight on his leg and stated on his Facebook that he will not be available for ''Sasuke'' 28. The high hopes of the remaining nine took a major hit in the Second Stage, as five more were eliminated including Rodriguez on the Slider Drop, Smith on the Double Salmon Ladder, and newcomer Travis Rosen and veterans Travis Furlanic and Brent Steffensen on the Metal Spin. The remaining four competitors made it to the Third Stage only to be outdone by the Ultimate Cliffhanger. Ryan Stratis failed to make the fourth ledge while James McGrath and fan favorite Paul Kasemir failed the transition to the fifth ledge. The last competitor, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]] almost made it through the entire obstacle but on the final ledge his grip gave out. Even though no one earned a $500,000 [[K-Swiss]] Endorsement Deal, the competitors at ''Sasuke'' 27 were by far the strongest group of Americans to date. The final episode of the third season aired on NBC on August 29, 2011 as a two-hour special in prime-time.

A fourth season of the program began airing on May 20, 2012 and the show aired on both G4 and NBC for the Regionals and the Championship with the grand prize of $500,000 and the coveted ''American Ninja Warrior'' title. The entire format was changed as well&amp;nbsp;– regional qualifiers in different parts of the country were aired and the Mt. Midoriyama course was recreated just off the Las Vegas Strip for the national finals. The regional qualifiers would narrow its selections down to 30 contestants who finished its qualifying course in the fastest time as well as the contestants who finished the furthest the fastest. Qualifying obstacles would include common Stage 1 obstacles such as the Quintuple Steps and the Warped Wall, but its contents would change from city to city. The 30 contestants were then cut in half in the regional finals where the course would extend to include common Stage 2 and Stage 3 obstacles such as the Salmon Ladder, Cliffhanger and Body Prop. The 90 contestants who qualified (including wild cards) earned tickets to Las Vegas to challenge Mt. Midoriyama.

The show returned for its fifth season on July 1, 2013 in the same format. This season, if a contestant were to finish the course, that player would be guaranteed a spot in the next round. The show returned once again for its sixth season on May 25, 2014 on both NBC and [[Esquire Network]] with the same rules as in previous seasons. NBC has renewed the show for its seventh season in 2015 with the grand prize now doubled to $1,000,000. So far, it has produced, among other things, the endorsement of Makoto Nagano, the first American to complete the Ultimate Cliffhanger (Brent Steffensen in 2012), the first woman to complete the Salmon Ladder (Kacy Catanzaro in 2014), the first woman to complete the Jumping Spider (Meagan Martin, also in 2014), the first two Americans to achieve Total Victory (Isaac Caldiero and Geoff Britten on the same night in 2015) and the first female to complete Stage 1 of Mt. Midoriyama in Las Vegas (Jessie Graff in 2016, who also became the first female to complete Stage 2 of the original Mt. Midoriyama in 2017 during ''Sasuke'' 34.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sirsvk1OSg Jessie Graff – ''Sasuke'' 34 Stage 2] YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;) The network has renewed the show once again for its eighth season in 2016 with new qualifying cities including [[Los Angeles]] and [[Oklahoma City]]. The network has renewed the show for its ninth season in 2017 with three new cities: [[San Antonio]], [[Daytona Beach]], and [[Cleveland]]. The tenth season of the show began airing on May 30, 2018 with returning cities and a $10,000 bonus for finishing the Mega Warped Wall.

=====''USA vs Japan''=====
{{hatnote|Full details in the [[American Ninja Warrior#USA vs Japan .282014-Present.29|American Ninja Warrior]] article}}

In 2014, the first ''Sasuke''-based team competition was started, pitting five ''Sasuke'' All-Stars and New Stars representing Japan against five ''American Ninja Warrior'' stars representing the United States in what was dubbed by some as the inaugural ''Sasuke''/''Ninja Warrior'' world championship. The first meeting took place at the Mt. Midoriyama reconstruction in Las Vegas and was first broadcast in America on January 13, 2014 on NBC, with a second meeting already scheduled for the original Mt. Midoriyama in [[Aoba-ku, Yokohama|Aoba-ku]] in 2015.

At the first match in Las Vegas, Team Japan was composed of Shingo Yamamoto, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, Hitoshi Kanno and Kazuma Asa from ''Sasuke'', while Team USA was composed of Brent Steffensen, Paul Kasemir, James McGrath, Travis Rosen and Brian Arnold from ''American Ninja Warrior''. The match was composed of four rounds&amp;nbsp;– one on each stage, with each round being a best-of-five of one-on-one races and each competitor running once per stage until the stage outcome was decided. Stage 1 was worth one point, Stage 2 worth two points and Stage 3 worth three, with the tiebreaker being the Final Stage tower. Despite the Japanese boasting superior experience and pedigrees (no Team USA member had completed Stage 3, either in Yokohama or Las Vegas), the Americans pulled off a stunning 6–0 win that included only one Japanese one-on-one race win (Matachi against Arnold on Stage 3.)

[[File:Femdom at Eros Pyramide.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|Live sex show at [[Eros Pyramide]], Austria, 2009]]
A '''sex show''' is a form of live [[performance]] that features one or more performers engaging in some form of [[sexual activity]] on stage for the entertainment or sexual gratification of spectators. Performers are paid either by the spectators or by the organisers of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.celebrity-mania.com/news/view/00005096.html |title=Dita Von Teese Got Her Unpaid Fee From Erotica Limited |publisher=Celebrity-mania.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113204801/http://www.celebrity-mania.com/news/view/00005096.html |archivedate=2012-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/uks-parliament-hosts-erotica-event/story-fn3dxix6-1225933252775 |title=UK parliament hosts erotica event |publisher=Theaustralian.com.au |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A performance would involve an actual or simulated [[autoeroticism|autoerotic]] performance or sexual activity with another performer. The performance can be on a theater style, or it can be in a [[peep show]] style. An increasingly popular form of sex show is a [[webcam]] performance in which the viewer is able to view and interact with [[webcam model]]s in real time.

Sex shows are distinguished from entertainment such as [[striptease]], [[pole dancing]] or [[lap dance]], which do not involve sexual activity other than undressing and dancing nude or semi-nude. Sexual activity at sex shows is also distinguished from regular [[prostitution]] in that the performers usually engage in sex acts only with other performers and not with spectators or paying customers. Sex shows can overlap with other sectors of the [[sex industry]]. For example, a [[strip club]] may also offer live sex performances, and a prostitute may offer to perform sex acts with another prostitute for the gratification of a patron.

==Locations==
In [[Havana]], Cuba in the 1950s there were sex shows and live pornographic theaters such as the Shanghai Theater and the Tokyo Cabaret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WBvTDQAAQBAJ|title=Inside Cuba: The History, Culture, and Politics of an Outlaw Nation|first1=John|last1=Miller|first2=Aaron|last2=Kenedi|year=2003|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=9781569244845|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English novelist [[Graham Greene]], writing in his autobiography ''[[Ways of Escape]]'', described: "the Shanghai Theatre where for one dollar and twenty-five cents one could see a nude cabaret of extreme obscenity with the bluest of blue films in the intervals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nAVRDQAAQBAJ|title=Havana: A Subtropical Delirium|first=Mark|last=Kurlansky|year=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|isbn=9781632863935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s the [[Laos|Laotian]] capital [[Vientiane]] was famous for sex shows at [[ping pong show]] bars during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=FandD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Laos/sub5_3b/entry-2961.html |title=Sex in Laos |author=Jeffrey Hays |date=2008 |website=Facts and Details |publisher= |access-date=21 September 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travel writer [[Paul Theroux]] described a bar in 1973 Vientiane thus: “Your eyes get accustomed to the dark and you see the waitress is naked. Without warning she jumps on the chair, pokes a cigarette into her vagina and lights it, puffing it by contracting her uterine lungs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Theroux |first= Paul |date=1975 |title=The Great Railway Bazaar |location= |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |page= |isbn=978-0141189147}}&lt;/ref&gt; British journalist [[Christopher Robbins]] wrote that ''The White Rose'', a famous Vientiane bar during the war, featured floor shows in which women used their vaginas to smoke cigarettes and fling ping pong balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Robbins |first= Christopher |date=1978 |title=Air America |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn=978-1908059017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Reeperbahn]], the red-light district of [[Hamburg]], several sex theatres (''Salambo'', ''Regina'', ''Colibri'', ''Safari'') were once located in the ''{{lang|de|[[Große Freiheit]]}}'' ("Great Freedom") street. They showed live sex acts on stage, but by 2007 the ''Safari'' was the only live sex theatre left in Germany,&lt;ref name=indep&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/death-of-the-reeperbahn-hamburgs-streets-of-shame-799034.html|title=Death of the Reeperbahn: Hamburg's streets of shame|newspaper=The Independent|date=21 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that closed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.abendblatt.de/hamburg/hamburg-mitte/article124554323/Kiezclub-Safari-schliesst-nach-50-Jahren-seine-Tueren.html|title=Kiezclub Safari schließt nach 50 Jahren seine Türen|first=Daniel|last=Schaefer|date=5 February 2014|newspaper=Hamburger Abendblatt|language=de|trans-title=Neighborhood Club Safari Closes its Doors after 50 Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[red light district]] of [[De Wallen]] in [[Amsterdam]] there are three main venues for sex shows: a [[Host and hostess clubs|hostess bar]] called the ''Bananen Bar'', and the ''Moulin Rouge'' and ''Casa Rosso'' theatres which feature on-stage sex acts and variations on the ping pong show. In Thailand, locations like [[Patpong]] in [[Bangkok]], [[Walking Street, Pattaya]], Bangla Road in [[Phuket]] and Ta Pae Gate in [[Chiang Mai]] have numerous venues hosting ping-pong shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Sex Tourism Landscapes|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QiUlDwAAQBAJ|first=Erin|last=Sanders-McDonagh|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2016|isbn=9781317601159|p=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bangkok-nightlife.com/bkk-nightlife-guide/|title=Bangkok Nightlife 2018 (UPDATED!)|work=Bangkok-Nightlife.com|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
Sex shows are subject to varying laws such as licensing requirements and locations are subject to local zoning regulations.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., in the United Kingdom, sex establishments require a 
[http://www.winchester.gov.uk/Business/LicencesAndStreetTrading/SexEstablishmentLicence/ Sex Establishment Licence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119082102/http://www.winchester.gov.uk/Business/LicencesAndStreetTrading/SexEstablishmentLicence/ |date=2010-11-19 }} from the City Council under the ''Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act'' 1982, and a premises licence under the ''Licensing Act'' 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions regard a sex show as prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;news.com.au: [http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/coffee-shop-girls-face-charges-over-sex-shows/story-e6frfq80-1225827686559 Coffee shop girls face charges over sex shows] February 08, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The content of a sex show may also be subject to national and local [[obscenity]] and other laws. Some areas allow striptease, but no sexual activity, others may allow only simulated sexual activity or autoerotic activity, while others allow anything that is legal in recorded pornography to be performed live.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Generally, as of 2010, autoerotic activity is the most common legally-available kind of live sexual activity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In some cities and countries throughout the world, live sexual activity between multiple performers are legal. Webcam performances are largely unregulated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1279">'''Showmanship''', concerning artistic performing such as in [[Theatre]], is the skill of performing in such a manner that will appeal to an audience or aid in conveying the performance's essential theme or message. 

For instance, the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[stage magician]] [[Doug Henning]] used many classic illusions in his magic show. However, he made the old material seem new by rejecting the old stylistic cliches of the art (such as wearing [[formal wear]]), and by presenting them with a childlike exuberance that respected the audience's intelligence.

Profitable showmanship frequently appeals to [[pathos]]. Showmen aim to display goods with tact in order to sell an object or a show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QVNfe0PQUPEC|title = Profitable Showmanship|last = Goode|first = Kenneth|date = 2008-10-01|publisher = Read Books|isbn = 9781443745628|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies producing drama and entertainment claim that displaying fairness  is necessary.&lt;ref name="lib"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/dspace/bitstream/1892/6839/1/b15025135.pdf|title=Summit &amp;#124; SFU's Institutional Repository|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film ''[[10 Cloverfield Lane]]'' was not originally scripted with any connection to ''[[Cloverfield]]''. When the film was acquired by [[Bad Robot Productions]], producer [[J. J. Abrams]] recognized a common element of a giant monster attack between the two films, and chose to market ''10 Cloverfield Lane'' as a spiritual successor to ''Cloverfield'' to help bring interest to the newer film, and allowing him to establish a franchise he could build upon in future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hot-new-movie-catchphrase-call-875626 | title = Hot New Movie Catchphrase: Call It a "Spiritual Successor," Not a Sequel | first1 = Pamela | last1 = McClintock | first2= Borys |last2= Kit | date = March 17, 2016 | accessdate = May 4, 2017 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In video games ==
One example of a spiritual sequel resulting from legal issues is ''[[Dark Souls]]'' by [[From Software]], inspired by ''[[Demon's Souls]]'' by the same studio. The rights for ''Demon's Souls'', an exclusive title for the [[PlayStation 3]], was held by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], preventing From Software from making a successor on other platforms, leading them to create a new property with similar gameplay mechanics for the [[Xbox 360]] and other platforms.&lt;ref name="lee et al"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/02/10/shuhei-yoshida-interview.aspx | title = Sony Talks The Last Guardian, Demon's Souls, And The Vita Launch | first = Jim | last = Reilly | date = February 10, 2012 | accessdate = May 3, 2017 | work = [[Game Informer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] as a spiritual sequel to their licensed title ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]''. Rare had planned to develop a sequel to ''GoldenEye'' but lost the license as they were outbid by [[Electronic Arts]]. The developers still wanted to complete another spy-based title and developed ''Perfect Dark'' with a new story but with similar mechanics to ''GoldenEye''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=28 December 2015 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/learn-how-perfect-dark-came-to-be-in-this-behind-t/1100-6433378/ |title=Learn How Perfect Dark Came to Be in this Behind-the-Scenes Video |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |author=Eddie Makuch |date=December 26, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6e7WEzauc?url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/learn-how-perfect-dark-came-to-be-in-this-behind-t/1100-6433378/ |archivedate=December 28, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=11 February 2011 |url=http://uk.ign64.ign.com/articles/068/068109p1.html |title=Perfect Dark Interview |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=May 14, 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316142941/http://uk.ign64.ign.com/articles/068/068109p1.html |archivedate=March 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- DO NOT ADD MORE EXAMPLES! --&gt; 
All [[Final Fantasy]] games in the original series are spiritual successors of the original game rather than being sequels. The first proper story sequel was [[Final Fantasy X-2]].

''[[BioShock]]'' is one such example as a spiritual successor to ''[[System Shock 2]]''. ''System Shock 2'' was the first title developed by [[Irrational Games]], a studio founded by [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]], and while the game was met with critical acclaim, it was considered a commercial failure. Levine attempted to pitch a sequel to ''System Shock 2'' but their publisher [[Electronic Arts]] declined due to poor sales of ''System Shock 2''. After several years and other projects at Irrational, as well as being acquired by a new publisher [[2K Games]], Levine wanted to develop a game with the free-form narrative of ''System Shock 2'', which ultimately became the game ''BioShock''.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-04-17-the-true-story-of-bioshock | title = Rapture leaked: The true story behind the making of BioShock | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] | date = April 17, 2014 | accessdate = April 22, 2014 | first = Simon | last = Parkin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edge history"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-bioshock/ | title = The Making Of: BioShock | date = July 23, 2012 | accessdate = November 1, 2016 | work = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531030452/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-bioshock/ | archivedate=May 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]'' was considered a spiritual successor to ''[[Ico]]'' by the lead director of both games [[Fumito Ueda]]; Ueda did not want to necessarily make the connection between the games one of a [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] narrative, but that both had similar narrative themes and elements that he wanted players to interpret on their own.&lt;ref name="colossalcreation"&gt;{{cite web |author1=McNamara, Andy  |author2=Berghammer, Billy  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2006 | title=Colossal Creation: The Kenji Kaido and Fumito Ueda Interview | url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200602/N06.0216.1853.30213.htm | work=Game Informer | accessdate=July 9, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060903065641/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200602/N06.0216.1853.30213.htm |archivedate = September 3, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent example of a video game spiritual successor is the 2017 game ''[[Yooka-Laylee]]'', which is considered a spiritual successor to the [[Banjo-Kazooie (series)|''Banjo-Kazooie'' series]]. ''Yooka-Laylee'' was developed by [[Playtonic Games]], which consists of former employees of [[Rare (company)|Rare]]; the company that developed the games in the ''Banjo-Kazooie'' series. Another recent example of a video game spiritual successor is [[Two Point Hospital]] by [[Two Point Studios]], which is a spiritual successor to [[Theme Hospital]] by [[Bullfrog Productions]].

'''''SpongeBob SquarePants''''', also simply referred to as '''''SpongeBob''''', is an American [[Animated series|animated television series]] created by [[marine science]] educator and [[animator]] [[Stephen Hillenburg]] for [[Nickelodeon]]. The series chronicles the adventures and endeavors of [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|the title character]] and his various friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The series' popularity has made it a [[media franchise]], as well as the highest rated series to ever air on Nickelodeon, and the most distributed property of [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks]].&lt;!--It has never been produced by Nelvana, or Teletoon outside of the United States. Any removal of that will be considered vandalizing.--&gt; As of late 2017, the media franchise has generated $13 billion in merchandising revenue for Nickelodeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Deb |first=Sopan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/theater/spongebob-squarepants-the-broadway-musical-nickelodeon.html |title=With a Singing SpongeBob, Nickelodeon Aims for a Broadway Splash |work=[[New York Times]] |date=November 27, 2017 |accessdate=November 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the ideas for the series originated in an unpublished educational comic book titled ''The Intertidal Zone'', which Hillenburg created in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/walker-v-viacom-international|title=Casetext|publisher=|accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began developing ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' into a television series in 1996 upon the cancellation of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', and turned to [[Tom Kenny]], who had worked with him on that series, to voice the title character. SpongeBob was originally going to be named SpongeBoy, and the series was to be called ''SpongeBoy Ahoy!'', but both of these were changed, as the name was already trademarked.

Nickelodeon held a preview for the series in the United States on May 1, 1999, following the television airing of the [[1999 Kids' Choice Awards]]. The series officially premiered on July 17, 1999. It has received worldwide critical acclaim since its premiere and gained enormous popularity by its second season. A feature film, ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]'', was released in theaters on November 19, 2004, and [[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water|a sequel]] was released on February 6, 2015. In 2018, the series began airing its [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 12)|twelfth season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=VincentWaller72 |number=860648340857380864 |date=May 5, 2017 |title=It is OFFICIAL!!! SpongeBob Season 12!!!! #SpongeBobSquarePants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series has won a variety of awards, including six [[Annie Award]]s, eight [[Motion Picture Sound Editors#Golden Reel Awards|Golden Reel Awards]], four [[Emmy Award]]s, 15 [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards|Kids' Choice Awards]], and two [[British Academy Children's Awards|BAFTA Children's Awards]]. Despite its widespread popularity, the series has been involved in several public controversies, including one centered on speculation over SpongeBob's intended sexual orientation. In 2011, a newly described species of fungus, ''[[Spongiforma squarepantsii]]'', was named after the cartoon's title character. A [[SpongeBob SquarePants (musical)|Broadway musical]] based on the series opened in 2017 to critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gold |first=Michael |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/arts/spongebob-tony-nominations.html |title=Before the Tonys, SpongeBob Seized the Culture With Memes |work=[[New York Times]] |date=May 2, 2018 |accessdate=May 3, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series revolves around its [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|title character]] and his various friends. SpongeBob SquarePants is an energetic and optimistic [[sponge|sea sponge]] who physically resembles a rectangular [[sponge (material)|kitchen sponge]]. He lives in a submerged [[pineapple]] with his pet [[sea snail|snail]] [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters#Gary the snail|Gary]] (who meows like a cat) and has a childlike enthusiasm for life - which carries over to his job as a [[fry cook]] at a [[fast food restaurant]] called the [[Krusty Krab]]. SpongeBob's favorite pastimes include "jellyfishing" (which involves catching [[jellyfish]] with a net in a manner similar to [[butterfly catching]]) and blowing soap bubbles into elaborate shapes.

Living two houses down from SpongeBob is his best friend [[Patrick Star]], a dim-witted yet friendly pink [[starfish]] who resides under a rock. Despite his mental setbacks, Patrick still sees himself as intelligent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Squidtastic Voyage|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=4|number=75a|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=October 6, 2006|credits=Writers: [[Luke Brookshier]], Tom King, Dani Michaeli}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Squidward Tentacles]], SpongeBob's next-door neighbor and co-worker at the [[Krusty Krab]], is an arrogant and ill-tempered [[octopus]], who lives in an Easter Island [[moai]]. He enjoys playing the [[clarinet]] and painting self-portraits, but hates his job as a [[cashier]] and bemoans living in-between SpongeBob and Patrick, due to their childish nature. The owner of the Krusty Krab is a miserly red [[crab]] named [[Mr. Krabs]] who talks like a [[sailor]] and runs his restaurant as if it were a [[pirate ship]]. Mr. Krabs is a single parent with one teenage daughter, a [[sperm whale]] named [[Pearl Krabs|Pearl]], to whom he wants to pass down his riches. Pearl does not wish to continue her father's business and would rather spend her time listening to [[pop music]] or working at the local [[shopping mall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicksplat.com/Tvshows/Characters/Nicktoons/Spongebob_squarepants/pearl.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040812015604/http://www.nicksplat.com/Tvshows/Characters/Nicktoons/Spongebob_squarepants/pearl.html|archivedate=August 12, 2004|title=''SpongeBob SquarePants'' at NickSplat|work=[[Nickelodeon (Asia)|Nickelodeon Asia]]|publisher=[[Viacom International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another friend of SpongeBob is [[Sandy Cheeks]], a thrill-seeking and athletic [[squirrel]] from [[Texas]], who wears an air-filled [[diving suit]] to breathe underwater.&lt;ref name="meet-the-gang"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickelodeon.com.au/fullynick/tvshows/shows/spongebob-squarepants-show|title=''SpongeBob SquarePants'': Meet the Gang! |work=[[Nickelodeon (Australia and New Zealand)|Nickelodeon Australia]]|publisher=[[Viacom International]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310224329/http://www.nickelodeon.com.au/fullynick/tvshows/shows/spongebob-squarepants-show|archivedate=March 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lives in an [[oak tree]] entrapped in a clear glass dome locked by an airtight, hand-turned seal and is an expert in [[karate]], as well as a [[scientist]].

Located across the street from the Krusty Krab is an unsuccessful rival restaurant called the Chum Bucket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Komputer Overload|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=6|number=118b|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=March 19, 2009|credits=Writers: [[Aaron Springer]], Richard Pursel}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is run by a small green [[copepod]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-82792771.html|title=Stephen Hillenburg created the undersea world of SpongeBob|date=February 12, 2002|newspaper=[[Orange County Register]]|last=Wilson|first=Amy|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; named [[Plankton and Karen#Plankton|Plankton]] and his talking supercomputer sidekick, [[Plankton and Karen#Karen|Karen]].

SpongeBob is Mrs. Puff's most diligent student and knows every answer to the oral exams he takes, but he panics and crashes whenever he tries to drive a real boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/medien/spongebob-das-kind-im-schwamme/1209130.html|title=SpongeBob: Das Kind im Schwamme|work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|publisher=[[Dieter von Holtzbrinck]]|date=December 4, 2008|last=Sichtermann|first=Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Mrs. Puff endures one of SpongeBob's crashes or is otherwise frightened, she puffs up into a ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nickelodeonuniverse.com/character/mrs-puff/|title=Mrs. Puff at Nickelodeon Universe|work=[[Mall of America]]|publisher=[[Triple Five Group]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606214926/http://nickelodeonuniverse.com/character/mrs-puff/|archivedate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special episodes of the show are hosted by a [[live action]] pirate named [[Patchy the Pirate|Patchy]] and his pet parrot [[Potty the Parrot|Potty]], whose segments are presented in a [[dual narrative]] with the animated stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Critic's corner|author=Bianco, Robert|date=March 21, 2003|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|page=12E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patchy is portrayed as the president of a fictional ''SpongeBob'' fan club, and his greatest aspiration is to meet SpongeBob himself. Potty likes to make fun of Patchy's enthusiasm and causes trouble for him while he tries to host the show. An unseen figure called the French Narrator often introduces episodes and narrates the [[intertitle]]s as if the series was a nature documentary about the ocean. His role and distinctive manner of speaking are references to the oceanographer [[Jacques Cousteau]].

Other recurring characters appear throughout the series, such as the muscular lifeguard of Goo Lagoon, [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters#Larry the Lobster|Larry the Lobster]]; a pirate [[Ghost|specter]] known as the [[Flying Dutchman (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Flying Dutchman]]; and retired superheroes [[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy]], who are idolized by SpongeBob and Patrick.

===Setting===
[[File:Bikini Atoll.png|thumb|right|alt=A blue colored image of an atoll.|[[Bikini Atoll]], a coral reef in the Pacific Ocean. Nickelodeon has named this as the real-world location of Bikini Bottom.]]
The series primarily takes place in the [[benthic]] underwater city of Bikini Bottom, which is located in the [[Pacific Ocean]] beneath the real-life [[coral reef]] known as [[Bikini Atoll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vimn.com/press/nicktoons/series/spongebob-squarepants-0|title=Nickelodeon UK &amp; Ireland Press Centre: ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' Programme Information|work=[[Nickelodeon]]|author=Viacom International|access-date=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LADN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="QSR"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.qsrmagazine.com/articles/news/story.phtml?id=3354 |title=Burger King ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' |accessdate=August 19, 2010 |work=QSR Magazone |date=June 7, 2001 |author=QSR Staff |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021075539/http://www.qsrmagazine.com/articles/news/story.phtml?id=3354 |archivedate=October 21, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Tom Kenny confirmed that the fictitious city was named after Bikini Atoll, but denied an Internet fan theory that connected the series' characters to actual [[Nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll|nuclear testing that occurred in the atoll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradley|first=Bill|date=February 10, 2015|title=SpongeBob SquarePants Answers 7 Big Questions And Debunks 1 Popular Theory|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/07/spongebob-squarepants-theory_n_6627556.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The citizens are mainly multicolored fish who live in buildings made from ship funnels and use "boatmobiles", amalgamations of cars and boats, as a mode of transportation. Recurring locations within Bikini Bottom include the neighboring houses of SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward; two competing restaurants, the Krusty Krab and the Chum Bucket; Mrs. Puff's Boating School, which includes a driving course and a sunken [[lighthouse]] building; the Treedome, an oxygenated glass enclosure where Sandy lives; Shady Shoals Rest Home; a [[seagrass meadow]] called Jellyfish Fields; and Goo Lagoon, a popular beach hangout.

When the crew began production on the pilot, they were tasked with designing the stock locations where "the show would return to again and again, and in which most of the action would take place, such as the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob's pineapple house".&lt;ref name=PittengerHA&gt;{{cite news | author = Pittenger, Kenny | title = The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' | work = [[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17 | year = 2010 | accessdate = September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the series was "to keep everything nautical", so the crew used a great amount of rope, wooden planks, ships' wheels, netting, anchors, boilerplates, and rivets in creating the show's setting. Transitions between scenes are marked by bubbles filling up the screen, accompanied by the sound of water rushing.&lt;ref name=PittengerHA/&gt;

The series features "sky flowers" as a main setting material.&lt;ref name=PittengerHA/&gt; They first appeared in the pilot and have since become a common feature throughout the series.&lt;ref name=PittengerHA/&gt; When series background designer Kenny Pittenger was asked what they were, he answered, "They function as clouds in a way, but since the show takes place underwater, they aren't really clouds. Because of the [[tiki]] influence on the show, the background painters use a lot of pattern."&lt;ref name=PittengerHA/&gt; Pittenger said that the sky flowers were meant to "evoke the look of a flower-print Hawaiian shirt".&lt;ref name=PittengerHA/&gt;

==Production==
===Development===

====Early inspirations====
[[File:Ocean Institute, aerial shot, cropped.png|thumb|left|Before creating ''SpongeBob SquarePants'', Stephen Hillenburg taught marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] (located in [[Dana Point, California]]).&lt;ref name="Ocean Institute" /&gt;]]
Series creator [[Stephen Hillenburg]] first became fascinated with the ocean as a child. He also began developing his artistic abilities at a young age. Although these two interests would not overlap with each other for a long time—the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him—Hillenburg pursued both during college, receiving a major in [[marine biology]] and a minor in art. After graduating in 1984, he joined the [[Ocean Institute]], an organization in [[Dana Point, California]], dedicated to educating the public about [[marine science]] and [[maritime history]].&lt;ref name="Ocean Institute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocean-institute.org/|title=Welcome to the Ocean Institute|work=ocean-institute.org|accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"&gt;{{cite interview |people = [[Thomas F. Wilson|Wilson, Thomas F.]](Interviewer); Hillenburg, Stephen (Interviewee) |date = May 29, 2012 |title = Big Pop Fun #28: Stephen Hillenburg, Artist and Animator–Interview |url=http://ec.libsyn.com/p/d/9/8/d98c6fd6cc81f188/BPF28_Stephen_Hillenburg_artist_and_animator.mp3?d13a76d516d9dec20c3d276ce028ed5089ab1ce3dae902ea1d01c08031d1c85f7cb2&amp;c_id=4560686 |format = mp3 |medium = Podcast|publisher = [[Nerdist Industries]] |accessdate = December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hillenburg was there, his love of the ocean began to influence his artistry. He created a precursor to ''SpongeBob SquarePants'': a comic book titled ''The Intertidal Zone'', which was used by the institute to teach visiting students about the [[Tide pool#Life in the tide pool|animal life of tide pools]].&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt; The comic starred various [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] sea lifeforms, many of which would evolve into ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' characters.{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=9}} Hillenburg tried to get the comic professionally published, but none of the companies that he sent it to were interested.&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt;

====Conception====
While working as a staff artist at the Ocean Institute, Hillenburg entertained plans of eventually returning to college for a master's degree in art. Before this could materialize, he attended an animation festival, which inspired him to make a slight change in course. Instead of continuing his education with a traditional art program, Hillenburg chose to study experimental animation at the [[California Institute of the Arts]].&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun" /&gt; His thesis film, ''Wormholes'', is about the theory of relativity.&lt;ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''"&gt;{{cite AV media|last1=Hillenburg|first1=Stephen|last2=Murray|first2=Joe|last3=Drymon|first3=Derek|last4=Coleman|first4=Eric|last5=Hecht|first5=Albie |date=2003|title=The Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''. ''SpongeBob SquarePants'': The Complete First Season| medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was screened at festivals, and at one of these, Hillenburg met [[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]], creator of the popular [[Nickelodeon]] animated series, ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]''. Murray was impressed by the style of the film and offered Hillenburg a job.&lt;ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons"&gt;{{Harvard citation|Neuwirth|2003|page=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillenburg joined the series as a director and later, during the [[Put to Pasture/Future Schlock|fourth season]], he took on the roles of producer and [[creative director]].{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=9}}&lt;ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TrainorMurray"&gt;{{cite interview|subject=Joe Murray|interviewer=Lisa Kiczuk Trainor|title=Lisa (Kiczuk) Trainor interviews Joe Murray, creator of Rocko's Modern Life|url=http://www.title14.com/rocko/contributors/murray.html|work=The Rocko's Modern Life FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Olson]], one of the writers for ''Rocko's Modern Life'', read ''The Intertidal Zone'' and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series. However, he realized that if he ever did, this would be the best approach.&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''" /&gt;{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=10}} He began to further develop some of the characters from ''The Intertidal Zone'', including the comic's "announcer", Bob the Sponge.&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun" /&gt; He wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time, which he felt were exemplified by [[Buddy comedy|buddy comedies]] such as ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]''. As a result, Hillenburg decided to focus on a single main character: the "weirdest" sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge.&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun" /&gt; ''The Intertidal Zone{{'}}''s Bob the Sponge resembles an actual sea sponge, and at first, Hillenburg continued to utilize this design.&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons" /&gt;{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=31}} In determining the new character's behavior, Hillenburg drew inspiration from innocent, childlike figures that he enjoyed, such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[Jerry Lewis]], and [[Pee-wee Herman]].&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons" /&gt;{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=30}}&lt;ref name=DrymonHA&gt;{{cite news |author=Drymon, Derek |title=The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' |work=[[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17 |year=2010 |accessdate=September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KennyHA"&gt;{{cite news |author=Kenny, Tom |title=The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' |work=[[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17 |year=2010 |accessdate=September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then considered modeling the character after a kitchen sponge and realized that this idea would perfectly match the character's square personality.&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons" /&gt; Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Pearl, and Squidward were the first other characters Hillenburg created for the show.&lt;ref name="BoytoBob"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=From Boy to Bob|magazine=[[Nickelodeon Magazine|Nick Mag Presents: SpongeBob SquarePants]]|publisher=[[Viacom International]]|date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To voice the central character of the series, Hillenburg turned to [[Tom Kenny]], whose career in animation had started alongside Hillenburg's on ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]''. Elements of Kenny's own personality were employed in further developing the character.&lt;ref name="Excitable"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/03/17/Xpress/SpongeBob__the_excita.shtml |title=SpongeBob: the excitable, absorbent star of Bikini Bottom|last=Orlando|first=Dana|date=March 17, 2003|newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times|St Petersburg Times]]|accessdate=November 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radio"&gt;{{cite video|people=Farhat, Basima (Interviewer) |date=December 5, 2006 |title=Tom Kenny: Voice of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''&amp;nbsp;– Interview |url=http://www.thepeoplespeakradio.net/archives/mp3/tps-2006-12-05-kenny.mp3 |format=mp3 |medium=Radio production |publisher=The People Speak Radio |accessdate=November 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724101824/http://www.thepeoplespeakradio.net/archives/mp3/tps-2006-12-05-kenny.mp3 |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Hillenburg wanted to use the name SpongeBoy—the character would have had no last name, and the series would have been called ''SpongeBoy Ahoy!''{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=31}}&lt;ref name="Radio" /&gt; However, the Nickelodeon legal department discovered—after voice acting had been completed for the original seven-minute pilot episode—that the name "SpongeBoy" was already in use for a mop product.&lt;ref name="Radio" /&gt; A character of the same name was also already trademarked by ''[[Flaming Carrot Comics]]'' creator [[Bob Burden]].&lt;ref name=OralHistory /&gt; In choosing a replacement name, Hillenburg felt that he still had to use the word "Sponge", so that viewers would not mistake the character for a "Cheese Man". He settled on the name "SpongeBob". "SquarePants" was then chosen as a family name after Kenny saw a picture of the character and remarked, "Boy, look at this sponge in square pants, thinking he can get a job in a fast food place."{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=30}} Hillenburg loved the phrase upon hearing Kenny say it and felt that it would reinforce the character's nerdiness.{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=30}}{{sfn|Neuwirth|2003|page=51}}

====Assembling the crew====
[[Derek Drymon]], who served as [[creative director]] for the first three seasons, has said that Hillenburg wanted to surround himself with a "team of young and hungry people".&lt;ref name="DrymonHA"/&gt; Many of the major contributors to ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' had previously worked with Hillenburg on ''Rocko's Modern Life'': this included Drymon, [[art director]] [[Nick Jennings (artist)|Nick Jennings]], [[supervising director]] [[Alan Smart]], writer / voice actor [[Mr. Lawrence|Doug Lawrence]] (often credited as Mr. Lawrence), and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]], who helped develop the [[series bible]].&lt;ref name="DrymonHA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KennyHA"/&gt;

Although Drymon would go onto have a significant influence on ''SpongeBob SquarePants'', he was not initially offered a role on the series. As a late recruit to ''Rocko's Modern Life'', he had not established much of a relationship with Hillenburg before ''SpongeBob'''s conception. Hillenburg first sought out Drymon's storyboard partner, [[Mark O'Hare]] - but O'Hare had just created the soon-to-be syndicated comic strip, ''[[Citizen Dog (comic)|Citizen Dog]]'',&lt;ref name="DrymonHA"/&gt; and while he would later join ''SpongeBob'' as a writer,&lt;ref name="O'HareHA"&gt;{{cite news | author = O'Hare, Mark | title = The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' | work = [[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17 | year = 2010 | accessdate = September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; lacked the time to get involved with both projects at the outset.&lt;ref name="DrymonHA"/&gt; Drymon has said, "I remember Hillenburg's bringing it up to Mark in our office and asking him if he'd be interested in working on it...I was all ready to say yes to the offer, but Steve didn't ask; he just left the room. I was pretty desperate...so I ran into the hall after him and basically begged him for the job. He didn't jump at the chance."&lt;ref name="DrymonHA"/&gt; Once Hillenburg had given it some thought and decided to bring Drymon on as creative director, the two began meeting at Hillenburg's house multiple times a week to develop the series. Drymon has identified this period as having begun in 1996, shortly after the end of ''Rocko's Modern Life''.&lt;ref name="DrymonHA"/&gt;

Jennings was also instrumental in ''SpongeBob'''s genesis.&lt;ref name="ColemanHA"&gt;{{cite news | author = Coleman, Eric | title = The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' | work = [[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17 | year = 2010 | accessdate = September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenny has called him "one of SpongeBob's early graphics mentors".&lt;ref name="KennyHA"/&gt; On weekends, Kenny joined Hillenburg, Jennings, and Drymon for creative sessions, in which they captured ideas on a tape recorder.&lt;ref name="KennyHA"/&gt; Kenny performed audio tests as SpongeBob during these sessions, while Hillenburg enacted voices for the other characters.{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=31}}&lt;ref name="KennyHA"/&gt;

Hill contributed scripts for several first-season episodes (including the pilot)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Help Wanted|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=1|number=1a|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=May 1, 1999|credits=Writers: Stephen Hillenburg, Derek Drymon, Tim Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Reef Blower|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=1|number=1b|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=May 1, 1999|credits=Writers: Stephen Hillenburg, Derek Drymon, Tim Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Bubble Stand|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=1|number=2a|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=July 17, 1999|credits=Writers: Ennio Torresan, Erik Wiese, Stephen Hillenburg, Derek Drymon, and Tim Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Jellyfishing|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=1|number=3a|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=July 31, 1999|credits=Writers: Steve Fonti, Chris Mitchell, Peter Burns, and Tim Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was offered the role of [[story editor]], but turned it down - he would go on to pursue a career as a family film director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tribute.ca/people/tim-hill/3103/|title=Tim Hill biography|work=tribute.ca|publisher=[[Tribute (magazine)|Tribute]]|accessdate=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skylighttheatrecompany.com/about-us/our-artists/536-tim-hill-the-owners-closet.html|title=About - Our Artists - Tim Hill|work=Skylight Theatre Company|accessdate=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his stead, Pete Burns was brought in for the job.

====Pitching====

|quote=The execs from Nickelodeon flew out to [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], and we [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] it to them from the [[storyboard]]s. We had squeezy toys, wore Hawaiian shirts and used a boom box to play the [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]] song ['[[Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight]]'] that comes on in the third act.  We really went all out in that pitch because we knew the pilot lived or died by if the execs laughed.  When it was over, they walked out of the room to discuss it.  We figured they would fly back to New York and we'd hear in a few weeks.  We were surprised when they came back in what seemed like minutes and said they wanted to make it.

In 1997, while pitching the cartoon to Nickelodeon executives, Hillenburg donned a Hawaiian shirt, brought along an "underwater [[Vivarium|terrarium]] with models of the characters", and played Hawaiian music to set the theme. The setup was described by Nickelodeon executive [[Eric Coleman (producer)|Eric Coleman]] as "pretty amazing".&lt;ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''"/&gt; When they were given money and two weeks to write the pilot episode "[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]",&lt;ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''"/&gt; Derek Drymon, Stephen Hillenburg, and Nick Jennings returned with what was described by Nickelodeon official [[Albie Hecht]] as, "a performance [he] wished [he] had on tape".&lt;ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''"/&gt; Although executive producer Derek Drymon described the pitch as stressful, he said it went "very well".&lt;ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''"/&gt; [[Kevin Kay]] and Hecht had to step outside because they were "exhausted from laughing", which worried the cartoonists.&lt;ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''"/&gt;

In an interview, [[Cyma Zarghami]], the current president of Nickelodeon, said, "their [Nickelodeon executives'] immediate reaction was to see it again, both because they liked it and it was unlike anything they'd ever seen before".&lt;ref name="Huffington"/&gt; Zarghami was one of four executives in the room when ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' was screened for the first time.&lt;ref name="Huffington"/&gt;

===Executive producers and showrunners===
{{quote box|align=left|width=24em|style=max-width:40%
|quote=It reached a point where I felt I'd contributed a lot and said what I wanted to say. At that point, the show needed new blood, and so I selected Paul [Tibbitt] to produce.

Series creator Stephen Hillenburg has served as the executive producer over the course of the series' entire history and functioned as the [[showrunner]] from the series' debut in 1999 until 2004. The series went on [[hiatus (television)|hiatus]] in 2002, after Hillenburg halted production to work on a feature film of the series, ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]''.&lt;ref name=OralHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|title=The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''|date=September 21, 2012|accessdate=August 23, 2013|work=[[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]]|author=Heintjes, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the film was finalized and the third season finished, Hillenburg resigned as the series' showrunner. Although he no longer had a direct role in the production of the series, he still maintained an advisory role and reviewed each episode.&lt;ref name=Huffington&gt;{{cite news|last=Bauder|first=David|title=SpongeBob Turns 10 Valued At $8 Billion|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/14/spongebob-turns-10-valued_n_231304.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=May 22, 2013|date=July 13, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208163834/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/14/spongebob-turns-10-valued_n_231304.html|archivedate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nickelodeon's 'SpongeBob SquarePants' Reaches A Milestone: 10 Years|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/nickelodeons-spongebob-squarepants-reaches-a-milestone-10-years_article_20514|work=Access Hollywood|accessdate=May 25, 2013|date=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the film was completed, Hillenburg intended it to be the [[series finale]], "so [the show] wouldn't [[jump the shark]]." However, Nickelodeon wanted more episodes,&lt;ref name="HendersonHA"&gt;{{cite news | author = Henderson, Sam | title = The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' | work = [[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17 | year = 2010 | accessdate = September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; so Hillenburg appointed [[Paul Tibbitt]], who previously served on the show as a writer, director, and storyboard artist, to take over his role as showrunner and produce further seasons.&lt;ref name=Tibbitt&gt;{{cite web|last=Fletcher|first=Alex|title=Paul Tibbitt ('SpongeBob SquarePants')|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/interviews/a312387/paul-tibbitt-spongebob-squarepants.html|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=May 25, 2013|date=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillenburg considered Tibbitt one of his favorite members of the show's crew,&lt;ref name=Hilleburg1&gt;{{cite video | people=Hillenburg, Stephen|date=2009|title=The First 100 Episodes&amp;nbsp;— Square Roots: The Story of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''|medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "totally trusted him".&lt;ref name=Childhood/&gt;

===Writing===
According to writer [[Luke Brookshier]], "''SpongeBob'' is written differently than many television shows".&lt;ref name=Producing&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Luke Brookshier, ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' Storyboard Director|url=http://www.4mations.tv/2009/09/interview-with-luke-brookshier-spongebob-squarepants-storyboard-director/|publisher=4Mations|accessdate=May 23, 2013|date=September 23, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323112314/http://www.4mations.tv/2009/09/interview-with-luke-brookshier-spongebob-squarepants-storyboard-director/|archivedate=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial storylines are created by a team of five outline and premise writers. A two-page outline is then developed by [[storyboard artist]]s into a full episode—jokes and dialogue are added during this stage.&lt;ref name="OralHistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Producing/&gt; Unlike most of its contemporaries, ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' does not use [[Screenplay|written scripts]].&lt;ref name="Producing"/&gt;&lt;ref name=StevenB&gt;{{cite web|last=Zahed|first=Ramin|title=Bikini Bottom Confessions|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/bikini-bottom-confessions/|work=Animation|accessdate=May 28, 2013|date=July 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brookshier has likened this [[storyboard]]ing process to how cartoons were made "in the early days of animation."&lt;ref name="Producing"/&gt;

The decision to eschew scripts for storyboards is one that Hillenburg made early on in the series' development.&lt;ref name="OralHistory"/&gt; ''Rocko's Modern Life'' had also used storyboarding, and having worked on that series, Hillenburg felt strongly about adopting the process for ''SpongeBob SquarePants''—even though Nickelodeon was beginning to show a greater preference for script-driven cartoons.&lt;ref name="DrymonHA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WieseHA&gt;{{cite news |author=Wiese, Erik |title=The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' |work=[[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17 |year=2010 |accessdate=September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer for the series, [[Merriwether Williams]], described in an interview that she and Mr. Lawrence would write a draft for an episode in an afternoon and be done at 4 o'clock.&lt;ref name="WilliamsHA"/&gt;

The writing staff often used their individual life experiences for inspirations to come up with the storylines of the series' episodes.&lt;ref name=DrymonHA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Childhood&gt;{{cite news|last=Cavna|first=Michael|title=The Interview: 'SpongeBob' Creator Stephen Hillenburg|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2009/07/_tom_kenny_who_voices.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=May 25, 2013|date=July 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the episode "[[Sailor Mouth]]", in which SpongeBob and [[Patrick Star|Patrick]] learn [[profanity]],&lt;ref name=Childhood/&gt; was inspired by [[creative director]] Derek Drymon's experience of getting in trouble as a child for using [[Fuck|the f-word]] in front of his mother.&lt;ref name=DrymonHA/&gt; Drymon said, "The scene where Patrick is running to [[Mr. Krabs]] to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life".&lt;ref name=DrymonHA/&gt; The end of the episode, in which Mr. Krabs uses even more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was inspired "by the fact that my [Drymon's] mother has a sailor mouth herself".&lt;ref name="DrymonHA"/&gt; The idea for the episode "The Secret Box" also came from one of Drymon's childhood experiences.&lt;ref name=Childhood/&gt;&lt;ref name=WilliamsHA&gt;{{cite news |author=Williams, Merriwether |title=The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' |work=[[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]]#17 |year=2010 |accessdate=September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillenburg explained, "Drymon had a secret box [as a kid] and started telling us about it. We wanted to make fun of him ''and'' use it."&lt;ref name=Childhood/&gt;

Almost every episode is divided into two 11-minute segments. Hillenburg explained that "[I] never really wanted to deliberately try to write a half-hour show".&lt;ref name=Childhood/&gt; He added, "I wrote the shows to where they felt right".&lt;ref name=Childhood/&gt; Each 11-minute segment takes about five months to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/VincentWaller72/status/639616200775888896|title=Vincent Waller on Twitter|publisher=|accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/VincentWaller72/status/726440072145334273|title=Vincent Waller on Twitter|publisher=|accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''SpongeBob SquarePants'' features the voices of [[Tom Kenny]], [[Bill Fagerbakke]], [[Rodger Bumpass]], [[Clancy Brown]], [[Mr. Lawrence]], [[Jill Talley]], [[Carolyn Lawrence]], [[Mary Jo Catlett]], and [[Lori Alan]]. Most one-off and background characters are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]], [[Sirena Irwin]], [[Bob Joles]], [[Mark Fite]] and [[Thomas F. Wilson]].

Kenny voices ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' and a variety of other characters, including SpongeBob's pet snail Gary and the French narrator. He also physically portrays Patchy the Pirate in live-action segments of most special episodes. Kenny previously worked with Stephen Hillenburg on ''Rocko's Modern Life'' and, when Hillenburg created ''SpongeBob SquarePants'', he approached Kenny to voice the main character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/03/17/Xpress/SpongeBob__the_excita.shtml|title=SpongeBob: the excitable, absorbent star of Bikini Bottom|last=Orlando|first=Dana|date=March 17, 2003|publisher=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]|accessdate=November 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenny originally used the voice of SpongeBob for a minor character on ''Rocko''.&lt;ref name="Radio"/&gt; He forgot how to perform the voice initially and did not intend to use it afterward.

He said to Nickelodeon executives, "That's it—I don't want to hear anybody else do the voice.

Squidward Tentacles is voiced by Rodger Bumpass, who describes Squidward as "a very nasally, monotone kind of guy."

===Animation===
Approximately 50 people work together in animating and producing an episode of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''.&lt;ref name=Producing/&gt; Throughout its run, production of the series has been handled domestically at [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]] in [[Burbank, California]], while the finished animation has been created overseas at [[Rough Draft Studios]] in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name=Childhood/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richmond |first=Ray |title=Special Report: Animation |url=http://www.roughdraftstudios.com/press/press_20040115.html |work=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=May 22, 2013 |date=January 15, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310222309/http://www.roughdraftstudios.com/press/press_20040115.html |archivedate=March 10, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Storyboarding for each episode is done by the crew in California. The storyboards are then used as templates by the crew in Korea,&lt;ref name=Childhood/&gt; who animate by hand, color [[cel]]s on computers, and paint backgrounds. Episodes are finished in California, where they are edited and have music added.&lt;ref name=Producing/&gt; Every season, character designs are updated or modified to solve technical issues in the animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tibbitt |first=Paul |title=paultibbitt: @gozarfan chars r updated every ... |url=https://twitter.com/paultibbitt/status/410095456207654915 |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=December 15, 2013 |date=December 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LsVIk4v9?url=https://twitter.com/paultibbitt/status/410095456207654915 |archivedate=December 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first season, the series used [[cel animation]].&lt;ref name="Tibbitt" /&gt; A shift was made the following year to [[digital ink and paint]] animation.&lt;ref name="Tibbitt"/&gt; In 2009, executive producer [[Paul Tibbitt]] said "The first season of ''SpongeBob'' was done the old-fashioned way on cells, and every cell had to be part-painted, left to dry, paint some other colors. It's still a time-consuming aspect of the process now, but the digital way of doing things means it doesn't take long to correct".&lt;ref name="Tibbitt"/&gt;

In 2008, the crew shifted to using [[Cintiq|Wacom Cintiqs]] for the drawings instead of pencils. The [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 5)|fifth season]] episode "[[Pest of the West]]" was the first episode in the series to which the crew applied this method. Series background designer Kenny Pittenger said, "The only real difference between the way we draw now and the way we drew then is that we abandoned pencil and paper during the fifth season".&lt;ref name="PittengerHA"/&gt;  The crew began the shift while they were working on the episode. Pittenger said, "It was while we were working on 'Pest of the West', one of the half-hour specials, that we made the switch ... did you notice?"&lt;ref name="PittengerHA"/&gt; The shift to Wacom Cintiqs let the designers and animators draw on computer screens and make immediate changes or undo mistakes.  Pittenger said, "Many neo-Luddites—er ... I mean, many of my cohorts—don't like working on them, but I find them useful. There's no substitute for the immediacy of drawing on a piece of paper, of course, but digital nautical nonsense is still pretty fun".&lt;ref name="PittengerHA"/&gt;

|quote=[The music has gone] from mostly [[Sea shanty|sea shanties]] and Hawaiian music à la [[Roy Smeck]] meets [[Pee-wee Herman]]—still the main style for the show—in the early episodes, but it now includes [[film noir]], ''[[West Side Story]]'' to [[Henry Mancini|[Henry] Mancini]], [[Jerry Goldsmith]] and [[Steven Spielberg|[Steven] Spielberg]]. There's Broadway-type scores and plain old goofy, loopy, weird stuff. I try to push the envelope on this show without getting in the way of the story, and I try to push it up and way over the top when I can get away with it, all the time keeping it as funny and ridiculous as possible.

The [[SpongeBob SquarePants theme|theme song]] was composed by Mark Harrison and Blaise Smith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/spongebob-squarepants-theme-mt0033331163|title=SpongeBob SquarePants Theme|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the lyrics to the song were written by series creator Stephen Hillenburg and the series' original creative director Derek Drymon. The melody was inspired by the sea shanty "[[Blow the Man Down]]".&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons" /&gt; An old [[oil painting]] of a pirate is used in the opening sequence. It has been dubbed "Painty the Pirate", and according to Tom Kenny, Hillenburg found it in a thrift shop "years ago".&lt;ref name="Radio" /&gt; [[Patrick Pinney]] gives voice to Painty the Pirate, singing the theme song as the character.&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons" /&gt; Hillenburg's lips were imposed onto the painting and move along with the lyrics.&lt;ref name="Radio" /&gt; Kenny joked that this is "about as close of a glimpse as most ''SpongeBob'' fans are ever going to get of Steve Hillenburg", because of Hillenburg's private nature.&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons" /&gt;

Steve Belfer, one of Hillenburg's friends from CalArts, wrote and performed the music that is played over the end credits.&lt;ref name="DrymonHA" /&gt; This theme includes [[ukulele]] music, per Hillenburg's request.&lt;ref name="DrymonHA" /&gt; Drymon said, "It's so long ago, it's hard to be sure, but I remember Hillenburg having the Belfer music early on, maybe before the pilot".&lt;ref name="DrymonHA" /&gt;

The series' [[Music editor (filmmaking)|music editor]] and main composer is Nicolas Carr.&lt;ref name=CarrHA /&gt; After working with Hillenburg on ''Rocko's Modern Life'', Carr struggled to find a new job in his field. He had been considering a career change when Hillenburg offered him the job. The first season's score primarily featured selections from the [[APM Music|Associated Production Music Library]], which Carr has said includes "lots of great old corny Hawaiian music and big, full, dramatic orchestral scores."&lt;ref name=CarrHA /&gt; ''Rocko's Modern Life'' also used music from this library. It was Hillenburg's decision to adopt the approach. The selections for ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' have been described by Carr as being "more over-the-top" than those for ''Rocko's Modern Life''.&lt;ref name=CarrHA /&gt;

Hillenburg also felt that it was important for the series to develop its own music library, consisting of scores that could be reused and re-edited throughout the years. He wanted these scores to be composed by unknowns, and a group of twelve was assembled. They formed "The Sponge Divers Orchestra", which includes Carr and Belfer. This group went on to provide the majority of the music for later seasons, although Carr still draws from the Associated Production Music Library, as well as another library that he founded himself—Animation Music Inc.&lt;ref name=CarrHA /&gt;

Nickelodeon began celebrating the 10th anniversary of the series on January 18, 2009 with a live cast reading of the episode "SpongeBob vs. The Big One".

In 2012, however, it was reported that the series' ratings were declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sorry, SpongeBob: Disney Channel Knocks Nick From Top Ratings Perch|url=http://www.thewrap.com/tv/article/nickelodeon-ratings-disney-tops-kids-rival-key-category-first-time-36612|work=The Wrap|accessdate=May 26, 2013|date=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lieberman|first=David|title=Nickelodeon's Ratings Decline Is No "Blip"; Is Viacom Or Nielsen To Blame?|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/11/nickelodeons-ratings-decline-is-no-blip-is-viacom-or-nielsen-to-blame/|publisher=Deadline.com|accessdate=May 26, 2013|date=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching ''SpongeBob'' at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]]. ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' business writer [[John Jannarone]] suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the series might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon's overall ratings.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news|last=Jannarone|first=John|title=Viacom's SpongeBob Crisis|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303990604577370510139597158|accessdate=May 26, 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media analyst Todd Juenger directly attributes the decline in Nickelodeon's ratings to the availability of streaming video content on services like [[Netflix]], a provider of [[video on demand|on-demand]] Internet [[streaming media]].&lt;ref name=THRGardner&gt;{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Eriq|title=Analyst: Nickelodeon Might Be in Danger of Being Dropped by Some TV Distributors|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/nickelodeon-viacom-336290|work=HollywoodReporter.com|accessdate=December 5, 2013|date=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philippe Dauman]], the president and CEO of [[Viacom]], contradicted the notion, saying he did not think "the limited amount of Nick library content on Netflix ... has had a significant impact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Szalai|first=Georg|title=Viacom CEO Defends Nickelodeon's Netflix Deal Again|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/viacom-ceo-philippe-dauman-defends-nickelodeons-netflix-ratings-319904|accessdate=May 26, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Szalai|first=Georg|title=Viacom CEO: Netflix Content Is Not Hurting Nickelodeon Ratings|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/viacom-ceo-netflix-content-not-hurting-nickelodeon-ratings-philippe-dauman-286605|accessdate=May 26, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Nickelodeon spokesman said ''SpongeBob'' is performing consistently well and remains the number one rated animated series in all of children's television.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; He added, "There is nothing that we have seen that points to ''SpongeBob'' as a problem".&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; Dauman blamed the drop on "some ratings systemic issues" at Nielsen, citing extensive set-top-box data that "does in no way reflect" the Nielsen data.&lt;ref name=THR&gt;{{cite news|last=Szalai|first=Georg|title=Viacom CEO: Netflix Content Is Not Hurting Nickelodeon Ratings|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/viacom-ceo-netflix-content-not-hurting-nickelodeon-ratings-philippe-dauman-286605|accessdate=May 26, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juenger noted that ''SpongeBob'' could affect the ratings of other Nickelodeon programming because children often change channels to find their favorite programs, then stay tuned into that network.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; Nickelodeon recently reduced its exposure in television. In the first quarter of 2012, the network cut back on the number of episodes it aired by 16% compared with a year earlier.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;

===Critical reception===
''SpongeBob SquarePants'' has received critical acclaim from critics, and it has been noted for its appeal towards different age groups. [[James Poniewozik]] of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] described the title character as "the anti-[[Bart Simpson]], temperamentally and physically: his head is as squared-off and neat as Bart's is unruly, and he has a personality to match—conscientious, optimistic and blind to the faults in the world and those around him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Poniewozik|first=James|title=Soaking Up Attention|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,187600,00.html|work=Time|accessdate=December 27, 2013|date=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Laura Fries of [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'' magazine]], the series is "a thoughtful and inventive cartoon about a hopelessly optimistic and resilient sea sponge ... Devoid of the double entendres rife in today's animated TV shows, this is purely kid's stuff ... However, that's not to say that ''SpongeBob'' is simplistic or even juvenile. It's charming and whimsical, but clever enough to appeal to teens and college-aged kids, as well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fries|first=Laura|title=Review: 'SpongeBob SquarePants'|url=https://variety.com/1999/tv/reviews/spongebob-squarepants-1200458428/|work=Variety|accessdate=December 27, 2013|date=July 14, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Joyce Millman]] said ''SpongeBob'' "is clever without being impenetrable to young viewers and goofy without boring grown-ups to tears. It's the most charming toon on television, and one of the weirdest. And it's also good, clean fun, which makes sense because it is, after all, about a sponge". Millman wrote, "His relentless good cheer would be irritating if he weren't so darned lovable and his world so excellently strange ... Like ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', SpongeBob joyfully dances on the fine line between childhood and adulthood, guilelessness and camp, the warped and the sweet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Millman|first=Joyce|title=TELEVISION/RADIO; The Gentle World Of a Joyful Sponge|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/08/arts/television-radio-the-gentle-world-of-a-joyful-sponge.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 27, 2013|date=July 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Thompson (media scholar)|Robert Thompson]], a professor of communications and director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at [[Syracuse University]], told ''The New York Times'', "There is something kind of unique about [SpongeBob]. It seems to be a refreshing breath from the pre-irony era. There's no sense of the elbow-in-rib, tongue-in-cheek aesthetic that so permeates the rest of American culture—including kids' shows like the ''Rugrats''. I think what's subversive about it is it's so incredibly naive—deliberately. Because there's nothing in it that's trying to be hip or cool or anything else, hipness can be grafted onto it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How to Succeed Without Attitude|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/pop/20020722snapmonday.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 27, 2013|date=July 21, 2002|author=[[Tom Zeller, Jr.|Zeller, Tom Jr.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another interview with ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', he commentated on the show's adult audience: "[On one hand] It's a kind of time machine that transports parents back to when they watched TV in their footie [pajamas].

===Legacy===
[[File:Tahrir Square during 8 February 2011.jpg|thumb|left|200p|After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]], SpongeBob became a fashion trend at the [[Tahrir Square]] ''(pictured)'' and led to the creation of a [[Tumblr]] project called "SpongeBob on the Nile".]]
In July 2009, [[Madame Tussauds]] wax museum in New York launched a wax sculpture of SpongeBob in celebration of the series' 10th anniversary. This made SpongeBob the first animated character to ever receive a statue made entirely out of wax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Snook|first=Raven|title=Yellow fever: SpongeBob figure to debut at Madame Tussauds|url=http://www.timeout.com/new-york-kids/tony-kids-blog/yellow-fever-spongebob-figure-to-debut-at-madame-tussauds|work=Timeout|accessdate=May 23, 2013|date=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Singer|first=Bret|title=SpongeBob Debuts at Madame Tussauds|url=http://www.parentdish.com/2009/07/15/see-spongebob-at-madame-tussauds-for-free/|work=Parent Dish|accessdate=May 23, 2013|date=July 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pendant/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MADAME TUSSAUDS IS BONKERS FOR SPONGEBOB|url=http://www.momtrends.com/2009/07/madame-tussauds-is-bonkers-for-spongebob/|work=Mom Trends|accessdate=May 23, 2013|date=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, a new species of mushroom, ''[[Spongiforma squarepantsii]]'', was described, named after the series' title character.&lt;ref name=Desjardin2011&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Desjardin DE, Peay KB, Bruns TD |title=''Spongiforma squarepantsii'', a new species of gasteroid bolete from Borneo |journal=[[Mycologia]]|doi=10.3852/10-433 |date=May 10, 2011 |pmid=21558499 |volume=103|issue=5|pages=1119–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
====Controversies====
[[File:Dobson-01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[James Dobson]], who accused a promotional video featuring ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' of promoting homosexuality due to a pro-tolerance group's sponsoring the video]]
In 2005, an online video that showed clips from ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' and other children's shows set to the [[Sister Sledge]] song "[[We Are Family (song)|We Are Family]]" to promote [[cultural diversity|diversity]] and [[Toleration|tolerance]] was attacked by an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] group in the United States, because they saw SpongeBob being used to "advocate [[homosexuality]]".&lt;ref name="US right attacks"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4190699.stm | title=US right attacks SpongeBob video | date=January 20, 2005 | accessdate=June 11, 2007 | author=BBC Staff |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=accuse&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/2005-01-22-kids-video_x.htm | title=SpongeBob, Muppets and the Sister Sledge writer suffer criticism | date=January 22, 2005 | accessdate=June 11, 2007 | agency=Associated Press |work=USA Today  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Dobson]] of [[Focus on the Family]] accused the video of promoting homosexuality, due to it being sponsored by a pro-tolerance group.&lt;ref name=accuse /&gt; The incident accentuated questions as to whether or not SpongeBob is gay. Although the character has enjoyed popularity with gay viewers, series creator Stephen Hillenburg had already denied the issue three years earlier, clarifying at the time that he considers the character to be "somewhat [[Asexuality|asexual]]".&lt;ref name="Camp Cartoon Star"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2313221.stm | title=Camp cartoon star 'is not gay' | date=October 9, 2002 | accessdate=June 11, 2007 | author=BBC Staff |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Dobson's comments, Hillenburg reasserted his position, stating that sexual preference does not play a part in what they are "trying to do" with the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1021976,00.html | title=SpongeBob Asexual, Not Gay: Creator | date=January 28, 2005 | accessdate=August 26, 2009 | first=Stephen M. | last=Silverman | work=[[People (magazine)|People]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=22&amp;art_id=vn20050129114540161C803463|title=SpongeBob isn't gay or straight, creator says |date=January 29, 2005|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=November 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Kenny and other production members were distraught that such an issue had arisen.&lt;ref name="Radio"/&gt;

Dobson later stated that his comments were taken out of context and that his original complaints were not with SpongeBob, the video, or any of the characters in the video, but rather with the organization that sponsored the video, the [[We Are Family Foundation]]. Dobson said that the We Are Family Foundation posted pro-gay material on their website, but later removed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20050128/20875.htm|title=Dobson clarifies Pro-Gay SpongeBob Video Controversy|last=Chang|first=Pauline J.|date=January 28, 2005|publisher=[[The Christian Post]]|accessdate=June 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the controversy, John H.

Jeffery P.

A 2011 study conducted at the [[University of Virginia]] and published in the journal ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'' suggested that allowing preschool-aged audiences to watch the series caused short-term disruptions in mental function and attention span due to frequent shot changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lillard | first1 = Angeline | last2 = Peterson | first2 = Jennifer | year = 2011 | title = The Immediate Impact of Different Types of Television on Young Children's Executive Function | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2011/09/08/peds.2010-1919 | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 128| issue = 4| pages = 644–649| doi = 10.1542/peds.2010-1919 | pmid=21911349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rochman|first=Bonnie|title=Study: Fast-Moving Cartoons Like SpongeBob May Impair Kids' Focus|url=http://healthland.time.com/2011/09/12/do-your-kids-find-it-hard-to-focus-after-watching-spongebob-research-bears-that-out/|work=Time|accessdate=May 22, 2013|date=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Nickelodeon executive responded in an interview that the series was not intended for an audience of that age and that the study used "questionable methodology and could not possibly provide the basis for any valid findings that parents could trust".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Study: Some cartoons are bad for children's brains|url=http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/12/study-some-cartoons-are-bad-for-childrens-brains/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=May 22, 2013|date=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Eryn|title=SpongeBob impairs little kids' thinking, study finds|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/12/news/la-heb-spongebob-squarepants-children-brain-20110912|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 22, 2013|date=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several episodes of the series have been subject to controversy as well. In a report titled ''Wolves in Sheep's Clothing'', which documents the increase in potentially violent, profane, and sexual content in children's programming, the [[Parents Television Council]], a [[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]] media group, claimed the [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 2)|season 2]] ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' episode "[[Sailor Mouth]]" was an implicit attempt to promote and [[Satire|satirize]] use of [[profanity]] among children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Kristen Fyfe| title = Wolves in Sheep's Clothing: A Content Analysis of Children's Television| publisher = [[Parents Television Council]]|date=March 2, 2006| url = http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/childrensstudy/childrensstudy.pdf| accessdate = August 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while "[[SpongeBob's Last Stand]]" and "[[Selling Out (SpongeBob SquarePants episode)|Selling Out]]" have received criticism for promoting [[environmentalism]] and [[left-wing politics]] due to their negative portrayal of [[big business]].&lt;ref name="firing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bond|first1=Paul|title=SpongeBob's Firing Sparks Political Debate (Exclusive Video)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/spongebobs-firing-sparks-political-debate-652727|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=May 1, 2017|quote=It's not the first time SpongeBob has waded into social commentary, though usually when it does, it bugs the right and supports the left.

Various publications, such as [[MSN]], ''[[The A.V.

In 2018, ''Vulture'' noted that the most popular [[Internet meme|online memes]] of the series usually focused on episodes from the first three seasons.&lt;ref name="Vulture"/&gt; That same year, ''The A.V.

'''''Star Athletica, LLC v. Varsity Brands, Inc.''''', 580 U.S. ___ (2017), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States]] case in which the Court decided under what circumstances aesthetic elements of "useful articles" can be restricted by [[copyright]] law. The Court created a two-prong "separability" test, granting copyrightability on conditions of separate identification and independent existence. In other words, the aesthetic elements must be identifiable as art if mentally separated from the article's practical use and must qualify as copyrightable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works if expressed in any medium.

The case concerned a dispute between two clothing manufacturers, [[Star Athletica]] and [[Varsity Brands]]. Star Athletica began creating [[cheerleading uniform]]s with [[Stripe (pattern)|stripes]], [[zigzag]]s, and [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] insignia similar to some made by Varsity, produced at a far lower price point. Varsity sued Star Athletica for [[copyright infringement]] and Star Athletica claimed the clothing designs were uncopyrightable because their aesthetic designs were tied so closely to and guided by their utilitarian purposes as uniforms. The Court rejected this argument with a close reading of the statute and established that the clothing designs, as aesthetic elements of the useful article of clothing, could be copyrightable. The Court had declined to hear Star Athletica's follow-up question concerning whether Varsity's specific designs were original enough to be copyrightable, so that part of the case remained unaddressed and Varsity's copyright registrations stood.

The Court's conclusion that aesthetic elements of useful articles, and thereby clothing design elements, could be copyrighted excited [[fashion designer]]s and [[intellectual property]] scholars. Some loved the decision because they saw extending copyright to clothes as parity with other [[creative industries]] that had enjoyed copyrights for much longer. Others denounced the Court's opinion over ambiguities in how to enforce the new rules and because of its potential to end [[Fad|fashion trends]] in generic clothing.

==Background==
===Historical copyrightability and Varsity Brands===
At one time, clothing designs were [[Copyright law of the United States#Works subject to copyright law|not subject to copyright law]], or "uncopyrightable," in the United States. In 1941, the Court heard ''[[Fashion Originators' Guild of America v. FTC]]'', which considered the [[fashion industry]]'s practice of boycotting sale of their "high fashion" works at places that would sell knock-offs made by other companies for lower prices, so-called "style piracy". The court ruled against [[Fashion Originators' Guild of America|the Guild]], saying that this practice of attempting to create a [[monopoly]] outside of the copyright system suppressed [[Free market|free competition]] and violated the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|312|457|1941|name=Fashion Originators' Guild of America v. FTC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, outside fashion, ''[[Mazer v. Stein]]'' established in 1954 that an artistic statue created to adorn a lamp base could be copyrightable separately from the utilitarian lamp under expansions from the [[Copyright Act of 1909]]. The statue's mass-production alongside the lamp did not invalidate that.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|347|201|1954|name=Mazer v. Stein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another barrier to copyrightability in the United States is a certain vague [[Threshold of originality#United States|threshold of originality]] that must be met to be eligible for an intellectual property monopoly like a copyright or [[patent]]. In 1964's ''[[Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co.]]'', the Court agreed with a lower court's ruling that Stiffel's popular lamp design was not original enough to warrant a patent preventing the lamp's sale by [[Sears]], rescinding that restriction and passing the design to the [[public domain]]. The Court's opinion indicated that the same logic would apply to an inappropriate copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|376|225|1964|name=Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], [[United States Congress|Congress]] changed the copyright law to allow copyrighting aesthetic features of "useful articles,"&lt;ref name="HLR"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://harvardlawreview.org/2017/11/star-athletica-l-l-c-v-varsity-brands-inc/ |title=Star Athletica, L.L.C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc. |date=2017-11-04 |website=Harvard Law Review |access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information."&lt;ref name="17USC101"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|101}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move was intended to better incorporate the ''Mazer v. Stein'' ruling&lt;ref name ="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Robert Kastenmeier |author-link=Robert Kastenmeier |url=https://www.copyright.gov/history/law/clrev_94-1476.pdf |date=1976-09-03 |title=House of Representatives Report No. 94-1476 |publisher=United States House of Representatives |page=105 |access-date=2018-07-21 |quote=Section 113 deals with the extent of copyright protection in "works of applied art." The section takes as its starting point the Supreme Court's decision in ''Mazer v. Stein'', 347 U.S. 201 (1954), and the first sentence of subsection (a) restates the basic principle established by that decision.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while clarifying the difference between the copyrightability of "[[applied art]]" and the more traditional, lesser restriction of "[[industrial design]]," the overall combination of features, provided by [[design patent]]s or [[trade dress]]. The Act said "pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features" of useful articles were copyrightable only if "separable" from the utilitarian aspects of the design and capable of existing independently of the article.&lt;ref name="ClaimingDesign"&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Fromer |first=Jeanne C. |last2=McKenna |first2=Mark P. |date=2018-05-30 |title=Claiming Design |journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review |volume=167 |ssrn=3186762}}&lt;/ref&gt; This broad definitional language lead to a proliferation of about ten competing, inconsistent legal tests for that separability,&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ginsburg |first=Jane C. |date=2016-09-01 |title='Courts Have Twisted Themselves into Knots': US Copyright Protection for Applied Art |url=https://lawandarts.org/article/courts-have-twisted-themselves-into-knots-u-s-copyright-protection-for-applied-art/ |journal=The Columbia Journal of Law &amp; the Arts |language=en |location=Rochester, NY |volume=40 |issue=1 |ssrn=2837728}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2016/05/02/supreme-court-dives-into-copyright-fight-over-cheerleader-uniforms/#224b16325244 |title=Supreme Court Dives Into Copyright Fight Over Cheerleader Uniforms |last=Fisher |first=Daniel |date=2016-05-02 |website=Forbes |language=en |access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; a state of affairs criticized for appearing to have judges serve as art critics.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;

Because clothes have both aesthetic and utilitarian features in their designs, they fall under this useful article category; therefore, the shapes and cuts of clothing are not copyrightable. Designs placed on clothing were opened up to the possibility of copyrightability, subject to those tests.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt; Practically, the law was construed to mean that copyrighted two-dimensional designs could be placed on clothing, and fabric pattern sheets could be copyrighted before being cut to make clothing, but an article of clothing's overall color scheme and design could not be copyrighted because it was not capable of existing independently of the final useful article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line--&gt; |date=December 22, 2014 |title=''Compendium of US Copyright Office Practices, Third Edition'' |url=https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/docs/compendium-12-22-14.pdf |publisher=[[United States Copyright Office]] |page=41 |section=924.3(A) Clothing Designs |access-date=July 11, 2018 |quote=Clothing such as shirts, dresses, pants, coats, shoes, and outerwear are not eligible for copyright protection because they are considered useful articles.

Therefore, a fabric or textile design may be registered if the design contains a sufficient amount of creative expression.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[fashion designer]]s bristled under these rules, wondering why other creative industries like [[Film industry|films]] or [[Music industry|music]] were allowed to restrict access to their products with copyright and they were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/business/yourmoney/that-looks-familiar-didnt-i-design-it.html?mtrref=undefined |title=That Looks Familiar.

The Office approved&lt;ref name="ClaimingDesign"/&gt; over 200&lt;ref name=slipop1&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 1.&lt;/ref&gt; of these narrowly-defined copyrights with descriptions like "has a central field of black bordered at the bottom by a gray/white/black multistripe forming a shallow 'vee' of which the left-hand leg is horizontal, while the right-hand leg stretches 'northeast' at approximately a forty-five degree angle." Varsity proceeded to frequently file lawsuits alleging infringement via accusations of very general copying,&lt;ref name="ClaimingDesign"/&gt; intended to stop other companies from releasing competing uniforms. Those competitors regarded these lawsuits as frivolous because the claimed designs were so simple.&lt;ref name="WhoOwnsCheerleaderUniforms" /&gt;

===Star Athletica lawsuit===
[[File:Uniform designs at issue in Star Athletica v Varsity Brands.png|thumb|left&lt;!-- to avoid conflict with the infobox --&gt;|The five cheerleading uniform designs involved in the case]]
Star Athletica was founded in January 2010 as a subsidiary of The Liebe Company. Varsity Brands accused Star Athletica of being created in retaliation for Varsity cancelling a deal with The Liebe Company's sports lettering subsidiary, aided by former Varsity employees knowledgeable about Varsity designs.

In 2014, the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee]] ruled Star Athletica's favor on the grounds that the designs were not eligible for copyright restriction. According to [[United States federal judge|Judge]] [[Robert Hardy Cleland]], a design without the distinctive marks like chevrons and zigzags would not identifiable as cheerleading uniforms, so the designs were not separately identifiable. They were not conceptually separable because the marks, if viewed outside the context of the clothing, would have still evoked the idea of a cheerleading uniform.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Varsity Brands, Inc. v.

The district court's decision was reversed on [[appeal]] by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] with the majority of Judge [[Karen Nelson Moore]] joined by Judge [[Ralph B. Guy Jr.]]. Firstly, Moore said the district court should have deferred to the fact that the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]]'s trained personnel had granted the copyright registrations in the first place. On the questions of the case, Moore evaluated the competing separability tests, but ended up creating a new five-step test for the Circuit's analysis. In short, they found that the designs were copyrightable because  the clothes had the utility of being athletic wear and removing the designs did not affect that utility. She said the design could be separately identifiable because it could be held "side by side" with a blank dress and there would be no utilitarian difference, and it could certainly exist independently because the individual aspects like chevrons could appear in designs on other clothing items. Moore also said that a ruling in favor of Star Athletica would have rendered all paintings uncopyrightable because they decorated the rooms where they hung. Judge [[David McKeague]] dissented because of a disagreement over the application of one of the test's steps. The third step asked the court to determine the useful article's "utilitarian aspects." Instead of the majority's more general assessment of athletic wear, McKeague would have defined the uniforms as clothing the body "in an attractive way for a special occasion" and "identify[ing] the wearer as a cheerleader;" therefore, the aesthetic features could not be separated from the utilitarian to him.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Varsity Brands, Inc. v.

Star Athletica filed to be heard by the United States Supreme Court in January 2016. On May 2, 2016 the Court granted ''[[certiorari]]'' "to resolve widespread disagreement over the proper test for implementing §&amp;nbsp;101's separate-identification and independent-existence requirements."

In their view, copyrighting the uniform designs would unduly stretch Congress's intent to copyright minor detailing on industrial designs like floral engravings on silverware, carvings in the backs of chairs, or prints on t-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Star-Athletica.pdf Brief of Intellectual Property Professors as ''Amicus Curiae''], ''Star Athletica, LLC v.

Varsity received an endorsement from the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]], which believed that extending copyright to clothing designs was critical to prevent exploitative copyists and preserve the United States's rapid rate of expansion in the worldwide fashion industry, representing $370 billion in domestic consumer spending and 1.8 million jobs.&lt;ref name="CouncilBrief"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WhoOwnsCheerleaderUniforms"/&gt; The [[Fashion Law Institute]] shared these interests and advised that a decision to copyright clothing designs would be a proper reading of the ''Mazer v.

In part, the government claimed that the question of a proper separability analysis was unnecessary because, in creating the designs as drawings, Varsity had received a copyright for them and reserved the exclusive ability to reproduce that design however they chose in any medium. They pointed to a concession from Star Athletica that if, hypothetically, Varsity controlled ''[[The Starry Night]]'', Varsity would be able to restrict the printing of the painting on dresses.&lt;ref name="UnitedStatesBrief"&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/15-866_amicus_respondent_united_states.pdf Brief of United States as ''Amicus Curiae''], ''Star Athletica, LLC v.

The government also argued that, in applying the requested conceptual separability analysis, what mattered was that a uniform stripped of the design "remain[ed] similarly useful" when compared to the original.

Star Athletica's lawyers gave the Court examples of how the graphic designs were utilitarian. For instance, the colors and shapes were arranged to create [[optical illusion|optical effects]] like the [[Müller-Lyer illusion]] and deliberately change the cheerleader's appearance to make them appear taller, thinner, and generally more appealing. They considered this distinct from applying a pre-existing two-dimensional image to the uniform because the lines required for those illusions to function needed to be properly located on properly fitted uniforms.&lt;ref name="ViewFromTheCourtroom" /&gt; According to them, people often made those sorts of deliberately utilitarian decisions about their clothing to make themselves look better or happier.&lt;ref name=NYTOct31&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/in-a-copyright-case-justices-ponder-the-fashion-industry.html |title=In a Copyright Case, Justices Ponder the Meaning of Fashion |last=Liptak |first=Adam |publisher=The New York Times |date=October 31, 2016 |website=The New York Times |access-date=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, were those designs placed on another object, such as a lunchbox, they would not be serving that utilitarian purpose anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/303599-justice-weigh-cheerleading-uniform-designs |title=Justices weigh cheerleading uniform designs |last=Balluck |first=Kyle |date=2016-10-31 |website=TheHill |language=en |access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Associate Justice|Justice]] [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], in particular, rejected that line of argument, citing the fact that the examples presented in evidence were two-dimensional works. In her view, it did not matter that the submitted designs were "superimposed" on three-dimensional uniforms&amp;mdash;the designs were submitted in two-dimensional images, so the designs were separated from the uniforms and copyrightable. After all, both parties agreed that the physical, three-dimensional uniform's cut and how it physically framed the body was not copyrightable. They were interested in the colors and aesthetic designs that were applied to the useful article.&lt;ref name=NYTOct31/&gt; She was not comfortable with vagueness she perceived in how Star Athletica wanted the Court to decide when a given two-dimensional design "is what makes an article utilitarian" when that design could conceivably be placed on anything.&lt;ref name="ArgumentAnalysisJusticesWorry"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/11/argument-analysis-justices-worry-about-killing-knockoffs-with-copyright/ |title=Argument analysis: Justices worry about 'killing knockoffs with copyright' |last=Mann |first=Ronald |date=2016-11-01 |publisher=SCOTUSblog |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] felt much the same and added that the designs did more than sit practically on the body because they sent a "particular message" that distinguished it from a blank dress, namely that the wearer was "a member of a cheerleading squad." Receiving this expression leaned him toward thinking of it as copyrightable expression.&lt;ref name=NYTOct31/&gt;

The members of the Court also considered more abstract aspects of the case. For example, it was unclear how a decision in Varsity's favor might affect military-style [[camouflage]] patterns and whether or not they could be restricted if fashion designs were copyrightable. Varsity supported the idea of camouflage copyrights, although Justice [[Elena Kagan]] pointed out the clear utilitarian function of camouflage patterns: concealment. On the industry side, women's fashion alone was a concern worth hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide. Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] speculated that the price of dresses could conceivably double if copyright terms were applied to designs and knock-off brands couldn't compete at lower prices.&lt;ref name=NYTOct31 /&gt; Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and he questioned Varsity over their concerns of monopolization effects, such as a uniform design becoming part of a school's brand identity and compelling them to buy exclusively from Varsity during a century of copyright restriction. In the end, Breyer expressed worry that designers or lawyers might resort to simply copyrighting drawings to sue over the design of any dress or suit.&lt;ref name="ArgumentAnalysisJusticesWorry"/&gt; Sotomayor, formerly a representative of [[Fendi]] in cases brought against knock-offs, wondered aloud if a decision for Varsity would destroy those knock-offs brands, although she was not sure if that would be a bad thing.&lt;ref name="SupremeCourtHearsArguments"/&gt; Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wondered whether it was "the domain of copyright to [restrict] the way people present themselves to the world."&lt;ref name="ArgumentAnalysisJusticesWorry"/&gt;

Breyer also got attention in the media for his aphorism about the purpose of fashion, "The clothes on the hanger do nothing; the clothes on the woman do everything." Kagan thought the sentiment was "so romantic."&lt;ref name="SupremeCourtHearsArguments"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ViewFromTheCourtroom" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTOct31/&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
===Majority opinion===
Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] delivered the majority opinion, which was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices [[Samuel Alito|Alito]], Sotomayor, and Kagan.&lt;ref name ="HLR"/&gt; The Court defined its task as "whether the lines, chevrons, and colorful shapes appearing on the surface of [Varsity Brands'] cheerleading uniforms are eligible for copyright restriction as separable features of the design of those cheerleading uniforms."&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court did not consider whether the designs in the case actually met copyright restriction's threshold of originality.&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2017/03/22/copyrights-supreme-court-star-athletica-v-varsity-brands/id=79767/ |title=Copyrights at the Supreme Court: Star Athletica v. Varsity Brands |last=Quinn |first=Gene  |last2=Brachmann |first2=Steve |date=2017-03-22 |website=IPWatchdog |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas rejected arguments from Varsity and the United States that separability analysis was unneeded,&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt; but also did away with all the lower court tests used previously. Instead, the opinion provided one canonical two-part test based on the statute and the ''Mazer v. Stein'' decision:&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 8-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...an artistic feature of the design of a useful article is eligible for copyright protection if the feature '''(1)''' can be perceived as a two- or three-dimensional work of art separate from the useful article and '''(2)''' would qualify as a protectable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work either on its own or in some other medium if imagined separately from the useful article.&lt;ref name=slipop11&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After applying this test to the cheerleading uniforms, the Court ruled in Varsity's favor that the designs were separable from the useful article and could be copyrighted.&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=slipop10&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The separability analysis started with the admittedly permissive first requirement, identifying the designs as separately identifiable "pictoral, graphical, or sculptural works." The design needed to be able to exist independently, and Thomas concluded that the design did when it appeared in other media, such as the two-dimensional drawings submitted to the Copyright Office. In Thomas's view, this conceptual separation would not necessarily recreate the useful dress because the design's elements like the chevrons could appear on items in different contexts,&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=slipop7-8&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; and they did not conjure uniform even when that context was other items of clothing.&lt;ref name=slipop10/&gt; This analysis moved the consideration away from whether the item left after separation was useful, to solely whether or not the design itself was useful. A feature incapable of being separated was a utilitarian feature anyway, Thomas said.&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=slipop7-8/&gt;

Addressing concerns that this would grant control over more than the design, Thomas pointed out that the separated aesthetic element could not, itself, be a useful article. Someone also couldn't copyright a design and then exert control over its physical representation. A drawing a or small model of a car, copyrighted, could not restrict production of the functional automobile with the same body by a competitor. The car drawing would not suppress a rival car manufacturer in the automobile market, so Varsity's uniform drawing would not suppress Star Athletica in the uniform market because their uniforms could have the same cut.&lt;ref name=slipop7-8/&gt;

The final section of the opinion discussed objections to the decision raised by the parties in their briefs. There were no requirements that there be an equivalent useful article remaining after the design element was conceptually removed or that the removed element be "solely artistic." Thomas said discussions of the blank dress were unnecessary because the statute did not require the remaining work to be useful or "similarly useful," as the government had put it, because all that mattered was if the separated element was a pictorial, graphical, or sculptural work. Thomas said that adopting this requirement would have overruled ''Mazer'' because the reason the statue in that case was considered "applied art" was because the 1909 Act had removed an earlier distinction between aesthetic and useful works of art. That distinction was not reinstated by the 1976 Act, so there was to be no distinguishing between "conceptual" and "physical" separability.&lt;ref name=slipop12-15&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 12-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas further rejected Star Athletica's additional "objective" considerations from preexisting tests, namely that the work be identified as artistic contributions from a designer independent of the utilitarian purpose, and that the work still be marketable without the utilitarian function of the design.&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=slipop15-17&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 15-17.&lt;/ref&gt; These were not within the statute, so Thomas dismissed them, saying that all that mattered was consumer perception and not the design's intent. Finally, regarding the idea that [[Legislative history#United States|Congress's noted reluctance]] to apply copyrightability to useful articles in general, Thomas said that congressional inaction was usually not a significant argument with courts. Thomas found a lot of the discussion moot because copyright could not restrict the cut of the design and copyright coverage was not mutually exclusive from design patenting.&lt;ref name=slipop15-17/&gt;

===Concurrence===
[[File:Attachment to 2017 opinion of Justice Ginsburg in Star Athletica v Varsity Brands.png|thumb|One page of the 11-page appendix to Justice Ginsburg's opinion, which highlighted that the designs were registered with the U.S. Copyright Office as "2-dimensional artwork"]]
Justice Ginsburg wrote an opinion concurring in judgement&amp;mdash;the cheerleading uniform designs were separable&amp;mdash;without joining in the majority's reasoning. The copyrights were not registered for the useful articles of clothing, emphasized Ginsburg. The registrations were for pictoral and graphical works that were then ''reproduced on'' the clothing.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica, LLC v. Varsity Brands, Inc.'', No. 15-866, 580 U.S. ___ (2017), slip op. at 1 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment)&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Copyright Act of 1976 provided copyright claimants "the right to reproduce the work in or on any kind of article, whether useful or otherwise,"&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|17|113|a}}&lt;/ref&gt; the claimant of a pictorial, graphical, or sculptural work's copyright could restrict others from reproducing the work's elements on their separate useful articles. According to her, there was no need for the court to address the separability analysis issue at all.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment).&lt;/ref&gt; To prove her point, Justice Ginsburg attached to her decision several pages of applications submitted by Varsity Brands to the Copyright Office, pointing to their claimed type of work being "2-dimensional artwork" or "fabric design (artwork)."&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 4-14 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the concurrence's notes, Ginsburg mentioned that she also did not take a stand on whether or not Varsity's designs were actually original enough to be copyrightable. Nonetheless, she did refer to a previous case called ''[[Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.]]'' and quoted its conclusion that "the requisite level of creativity [for copyrightability] is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice."&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissent===
Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Kennedy, dissented. While he agreed with much of the majority's reasoning, he disagreed with the framing and application of the majority's test and concluded the design was not separable from the uniform's useful article.&lt;ref name="breyer1"&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 1 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt; Breyer also criticized what he considered vagueness in the majority's test. He thought that, under it, "virtually any industrial design" could be considered separable as soon as it was thought of in terms of art, whether via giving it a picture frame or [[Found art|merely calling the object art]] like a [[Marcel Duchamp]] [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|series]].&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 6-7 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt; Breyer's approach to the problem was to interpret what "identified separately" meant in the context of the statute. His reading was that, to be separable, the design features needed to be either physically separable from the article while leaving the utilitarian object functional or else the design features needed to be conceivably separable without conjuring a picture of the utilitarian object in someone's mind. He returned to ''Mazer v. Stein'' and applied his reasoning to two lamps, one with a [[Siamese cat]] statuette for a pole and one with an brass rod pole and a cat statuette attached elsewhere on its base. When it was elsewhere on the base, it could be physically separable and was therefore copyrightable as a figurine. When the cat was the pole, it couldn't be physically separated, but it could be conceptually separated from the context of the lamp without conjuring the idea of a lamp and was therefore copyrightable as a figurine.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 2-4 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt; Applying his version of the test to the cheerleader uniforms, he found that the design was not physically separable. Further, picturing the design separately would reveal a cheerleader uniform "coextensive with that design and cut", so the design and useful article were not conceptually separable either.&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="breyer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="breyer11"&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 11 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt;

He then considered [[Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Paris)#Pair of shoes|shoes painted by]] [[Vincent van Gogh]] and turned to the examples of Congress's intended targets of copyright in the ''amicus curiae'' brief filed by the Intellectual Property Professors. Breyer found that copyrighting those embellishments was not the same as copyrighting an entire cheerleading uniform design because those examples were conceptually separable while the uniform design was not. He reiterated that van Gogh could certainly have received a copyright to prevent people from reproducing his painting, but the request in ''Star Athletica'' was an injunction against reproducing uniforms and Breyer felt this decision would be equivalent to giving van Gogh a design copyright that could prevent others from producing those shoes.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 4-6 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt; He directly accused Varsity Brands of trying to acquire copyrights in order to "prevent its competitors from making useful three-dimensional cheerleader uniforms by submitting plainly unoriginal chevrons and stripes as cut and arranged on a useful article."&lt;ref name="breyer11"/&gt;

The majority opinion believed Breyer's concerns were not a bar to a design's copyrightability, and neither was Star Athletica's similar idea that the design couldn't be copyrighted because the designs would have the same outline as the useful article. They analogized the uniform's design to a mural on a curved dome, saying that the contour of the dome would not prevent the mural from being copyrightable. They also thought that Breyer's traditional view that a preexisting two-dimensional artwork applied to a portion of the clothing could be copyrighted was contradictory because then the statute would provide copyright restriction to designs that covered part of the clothing surface, but not designs that covered all of it.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 11&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsburg's concurrence agreed on the second point in its notes, and referred to the fact that portions of Varsity's claimed uniform designs do appear on other merchandise like t-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 2-3 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment)&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the dissenting justice studied the state of the fashion industry at the time of the decision. Recent Congresses had rejected 70 bills to extend copyright to cover designs on useful articles, which he interpreted as [[Legislative intent|an unwillingness of lawmakers]] to enact the change. He cited the metrics provided by the Varsity ''amici'' Council of Fashion Designers of America to show that the fashion industry was doing very well for itself without copyright then quoted warnings from [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] against wantonly expanding copyright monopolies. Seeing no pressing need to extend the restriction, he did not want to overstep the bounds of the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]'s [[Copyright Clause]], especially when the available design patents afforded fifteen years of restriction and copyright could offer more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 7-9 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
===Immediate reactions===
Varsity Brands's leadership and supporters were pleased by the decision. Varsity founder Jeff Webb said that it was a win for "the basic idea that designers everywhere can create excellent work and make investments in their future without fear of having it stolen or copied." [[Susan Scafidi]], founder of the Fashion Law Institute, had been involved in with the case from the district court level and lamented that it had to go all the way to the Supreme Court. Still, she praised Thomas's decision as a maintenance of the status quo based on the copyrightability of fabric patterns. Although it was important to her because she believed fashion designers deserved to restrict their valuable designs with copyright, she didn't think it would change things for designers because it was based on the language of the preexisting statute.&lt;ref name="OneYearLater"&gt;{{Cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP41JX8xU2o |title=Star Athletica: One Year Later |date=2018-03-23 |last=The Federalist Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://qz.com/939637/the-supreme-court-ruled-that-varsity-brands-cheerleading-uniform-designs-are-protected-by-copyright-law/ |title=The Supreme Court says the iconic American cheerleading uniform design is protected by copyright law |last=Mejia |first=Zameena |website=Quartz |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puma based the copyright infringement portion of their case on the nine-day-old precedent and said that various Forever 21 shoes included copyrighted elements of similar Puma products. Forever 21, a supplier of knock-offs, had been sued for copyright infringement in the past, but this was among the first times that a company used the argument that, in the case of Puma's [[Rihanna|Fenty]] Fur Slides, their "wide plush fur strap extending to the base of the sandal" was capable of being represented in another tangible medium, and therefore covered by copyright as separable from the shoe itself.

===Case resolution===
The case was passed back to the district court in Tennessee and, in August 2017, the case was settled out of court in favor of Varsity Brands, over Star Athletica's objection, by Star Athletica's insurance company. Star Athletica wanted to press a counter-claim following the Supreme Court's ruling that designs on the uniforms ''could'' be copyrightable with an argument that the ''particular'' Varsity designs in the case ''should not'' be copyrightable due to their simplicity. The settlement precluded that argument and closed the case with prejudice, so the seven years of litigation concluded firmly.&lt;ref name="AnUnsatisfyingEnd"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fashionindustrylaw.com/2017/09/25/star-athletica-an-unsatisfying-end/ |title=Star Athletica: An Unsatisfying End |last=Freeman |first=Helene M. |date=2017-09-25 |website=The Fashion Industry Law Blog |publisher=Phillips Nizer, LLP. |access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Varsity Brands, Inc. v.

===Legal analyses===
[[Columbia Law School]] professor Ronald Mann provided an analysis of the opinion for [[SCOTUSblog]], remarking:

{{quote|What the court does not state expressly in that part of its opinion is that the standard for determining whether a graphic work (for example) is copyrightable is minimal. ... So once the court has said that any design can gain copyright protection if it would be protectable if placed first on a piece of paper, it really has ensured that all but the subtlest graphic designs will be able to gain copyright protection. ... To put [the Court's application of its test to the uniforms (quoted in the [[#Majority opinion|"majority opinion" section]] above)] more bluntly, once we determine that the designs 'hav[e] … graphic … qualities … [and could be] applied … on a painter’s canvas,' the test for copyrightability is met. ... I am sure that my colleagues who study intellectual property will write at length for years to come about the doctrinal nuances of the court’s discussion of the separability requirement, which seems to me a marked shift from most of the prior treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/03/opinion-analysis-court-uses-cheerleader-uniform-case-validate-broad-copyright-industrial-designs/ |title=Opinion analysis: Court uses cheerleader uniform case to validate broad copyright in industrial designs |last=Mann |first=Ronald |date=2017-03-22 |website=SCOTUSblog |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' felt ''Star Athletica'' was an important step towards removing subjectivity from the tests in this area of the law, such as by removing the framing problem that changed the outcome of the analysis based on how the usefulness of the article was defined, evidenced by Judge McKeague. However, the ''Review'' worried that the decision may not fully resolve conflicting lower court rulings because the conflicting majority and dissent were both based on close readings of the statute without enough clearly differentiating examples in the majority to completely discredit the alternative view. A potential contradiction in Thomas's majority opinion may not help on that front that pecerption; specifically, the assertion that surface designs are "inherently separable" from useful articles without being useful articles themselves and the assertion that other clothing bearing the design do not conjure the original useful article. The ''Review'' speculated that "these [[dicta]] imply that the independently existing work can have the shape and look of the article, evoke the same concepts, and even perform the same function and still be separable," and therefore be copyrightable.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt; Indeed, a 2018 disctrict court case, ''Silvertop Assocs., Inc. v. Kangaroo Mfg., Inc.'', ruled that a banana costume's physical features were separable from the costume and copyrightable because they could be painted on a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Silvertop Assocs., Inc. v. Kangaroo Mfg., Inc. |vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court=D.N.J. |date=2018-30-18 |url=https://casetext.com/case/silvertop-assocs-inc-v-kangaroo-mfg-inc |accessdate=2018-08-02 |quote=These features include: a) the overall length of the costume, b) the overall shape of the design in terms of curvature, c) the length of the shape both above and below the torso of the wearer, d) the shape, size, and jet black color of both ends, e) the location of the head and arm cutouts which dictate how the costume drapes on and protrudes from a wearer (as opposed to the mere existence of the cutout holes), f) the soft, smooth, almost shiny look and feel of the chosen synthetic fabric, g) the parallel lines which mimic the ridges on a banana in three-dimensional form, and h) the bright shade of a golden yellow and uniform color that appears distinct from the more muted and inconsistent tones of a natural banana. The Court finds that, if these features were separated from the costume itself and applied on a painter's canvas, it would qualify as a two-dimensional work of art in a way that would not replicate the costume itself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professors Jeanne C. Fromer and Mark P. McKenna were critical of the ambiguity of the decision because the three major stages of litigation resulted in three different majority decisions on three different grounds, with more divergent opinions among the dissents and concurrence. Because the courts allowed Varsity to define extremely narrow copyright restrictions in the registration then sue others like Star Athletica with general descriptions in court filings, they were concerned that this disconnect in requirements would lead to more controversial lawsuits, even outside the realm of useful articles. After all, a model car could be copyrighted as a sculpture, a drawing of that model could be copyrighted, and the claimant could use features of either equally to file copyright claims. Exactly what features of either were actually restricted was left up to debate because the registration's description could diverge almost entirely from the lawsuit's filing, so Fromer and McKenna contended it would be impossible to know what the copyright holder considered restricted before they described it in a lawsuit, let alone before the second party begins the desired copying. Moreover, in the absence of that description, they said it was impossible to perform a separability analysis and determine if the feature was even copyrightable at all before active litigation.&lt;ref name="ClaimingDesign"/&gt;

Sara Benson, a lawyer who agreed with the decision, has wondered if the court's explicit rejection of a copyrightability test that valued artistic effort on the designer's part may harm perception of designers' value to the clients they work for. She mentioned that that test had allowed designers to leverage their creativity for respect and credibility during corporate design processes, and that its removal may have removed some of their negotiating power.&lt;ref name="Benson2018"/&gt;

David Kluft of [[Foley Hoag]] has noted that this new ability to copyright design elements comes paired with criminal penalties if it comes to light that the elements have any utility. If the entity applying for copyright on the design knew about that utility, that would be considered false representation of a material fact in the copyright registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/2018/04/star-athletica-and-the-expansion-of-useful-article-protection-copyright-office-permits-registration-of-automotive-floor-liner/ |title=Star Athletica and the Expansion of Useful Article Protection: Copyright Office Permits Registration of Automotive Floor Liner |last=Kluft |first=David |publisher=Foley Hoag, LLP |date=2018-04-24 |website=Trademark And Copyright Law |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American theater, '''summer stock theatre''' is a [[theater (structure)|theatre]] that presents stage productions only in the summer. The name combines the season with the tradition of staging shows by a resident company, reusing [[repertory|stock]] [[theatrical scenery|scenery]] and [[costume]]s. Summer stock theatres frequently take advantage of seasonal weather by having their productions outdoors or under tents set up temporarily for their use.

Some smaller theatres still continue this tradition, and a few summer stock theatres have become highly regarded by both patrons as well as performers and designers. [[Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] status and pay for actors in these theatres varies greatly. Often viewed as a starting point for professional actors, stock casts are typically young, just out of high school or still in college.

==History==
Summer stock started in 1919-1920s with four theatres: [[The Muny]], St. Louis, Mo. (1919) is the nation's oldest and largest outdoor musical theatre; Manhattan Theatre Colony, first started near [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]] (1927) and moved to [[Ogunquit, Maine]]; the Cape Playhouse, [[Dennis, Massachusetts]] (1927); and the Berkshire Playhouse, [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]] (1928). Many of the theatres of the [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heyday heyday], the 1920s through the 1960s, were in New England. Part of the "straw hat circuit," theatres also were in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, among other states. (There had been earlier summer theatres: the Gardens Theatre, [[Denver]] (1890) and Lakewood Playhouse near Skowhegan, [[Maine]] (1901 for summer), but they were established stock theatres that had then been used as a summer venue.)&lt;ref name=Wilmeth629&gt;Wilmeth, p. 629&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure was to present different plays in weekly or biweekly repertory, performed by a resident company, generally between June and September. The usual fare consisted of light comedies, romances and mysteries. The theatres were located in rural areas.&lt;ref name=Wilmeth629/&gt;  Touring companies would carry hand props and costumes to each venue, where sound, lights and set would be awaiting them.

Summer stock provided a training ground for actors and inexpensive entertainment for vacationing East Coast urbanites. Craig Mamrick describes [[Louis Edmonds]]' early summer stock experience: "Louis spent the summer of 1949 working as part of the repertory company at the Ogunquit Playhouse in Ogunquit, Maine...The Ogunquit Playhouse was affiliated with the Manhattan Theatre Colony, an apprentice program that hopeful actors could attend (paying $150 for the summer) to learn their craft and observe—and possibly work with—professionals. Such stage luminaries as Maude Adams, Ethel Barrymore, Lilian Gish, and Ruth Gordon had trod the boards here. Students took classes in acting, stagecraft, makeup, and voice, and if they were talented enough, they might be asked to appear in plays with the resident acting company."&lt;ref&gt;Hamrick, Craig. ''Big Lou'' (2004), iUniverse, {{ISBN|0-595-29716-1}}, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many notable performers spent their summers on the circuit. Plays and musicals that had closed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] would play the circuit. By 1950, there were 152 Equity companies, including the Ogunquit Playhouse&lt;ref name=ogunquit&gt;[http://www.ogunquitplayhouse.org/ Ogunquit Playhouse official site] ogunquitplayhouse.org, accessed July 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and Skowhegan Playhouse in Maine; the [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]] Playhouse and the [[Forestburgh, New York|Forestburgh]] Playhouse in upstate New York; [[Falmouth, Massachusetts|Falmouth]] Playhouse in Massachusetts (burned down in 1994);&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, Jeff.[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8268530.html Article summary: "Predawn fire destroys Falmouth Playhouse, a summer tradition", ''The Boston Globe''] highbeam.com, March 1, 1994, accessed July 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Priscilla Beach Theatre]] in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]], and the Bucks County Playhouse in [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]] (suburban Philadelphia), Pennsylvania (established in 1939).&lt;ref&gt;"Before the theater fell on hard times in the 1970s...it was part of the straw-hat circuit that showcased stage and screen stars in the summer."

==Performers==
Stars of Broadway, film, and television would regularly spend summers performing in stock. The Council of Stock Theatres (COST) negotiated a special contract with [[Actors Equity]] to cover the work of actors and stage managers.&lt;ref&gt;Armbrust, Roger.[http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation-services/4592680-1.html "Equity-COST Contract Set - Three-year Contract Includes 9-12% Salary Increases,"] allbusiness.com, as published in ''Backstage'', March 26, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actorsequity.org/docs/rulebooks/COST_1345_Rulebook_04-08.pdf Actors Equity Association Agreement and ules Governing Employment in Non-Resident Dramatic Stock, Effective: December 27, 2004] actorsequity.org, accessed July 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colleen Dewhurst]] wrote of her experiences in summer stock as a new actress: "My first professional jobs were in summer stock, in small, medium and large companies that presented ten plays in ten weeks from June until Labor Day...At that time, the core of each summer stock company was made up of a stage manager and six resident actors: a leading man and woman, a character man and woman, and an ingenue and a juvenile. In some cases, five or six of the summer plays would be 'star vehicles', featuring a familiar actor or actress."&lt;ref&gt;Dewhurst, Colleen.

==Notable theatres==
Some summer theatres specialize in a particular type of production, such as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] [[play (theatre)|plays]], [[musical theatre|musicals]], or even [[opera]]. Some notable summer theatres include: [[Oregon Shakespeare Festival]] [[Ashland, Oregon]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osfashland.org/ Oregon Shakespeare Festival official site] osfashland.org, accessed July 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Rocky Mountain Repertory Theatre, [[Grand Lake, Colorado]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockymountainrep.com/ Rocky Mountain Repertory Theatre official site] www.rockymountainrep.com, accessed July 22, 2009 [[Summerstock Conservatory]], [[Calgary]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.summerstock.ca/ Summerstock Conservatory official site] summerstock.ca, accessed July 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Utah Shakespearean Festival]], [[Cedar City, Utah]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bard.org/ Utah Shakespearean Festival official site] bard.org, accessed july 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Santa Fe Opera]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santafeopera.org/ Santa Fe Opera 2009 Festival Season] santafeopera.org, accessed July 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival]], [[Becket, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http.www.jacobspillow.org/ Jacob's Pillow Official Site]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Williamstown Theatre Festival]], [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtfestival.org/ Williamstown Theatre Festival official site] wtfestival.org, accessed july 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Berkshire Theatre Festival]], [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkshiretheatre.org/ Berkshire Theatre Festival official site] berkshiretheatre.org, accessed July 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glimmerglass Opera]], [[Cooperstown]], New York,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glimmerglass.org/ Glimmerglass Opera official site] glimmerglass.org, accessed July 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan and [[Vancouver]]'s [[Bard on the Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bardonthebeach.org/ Bard on the Beach Shakespeare Festival 2009] bardonthebeach.org, accessed July 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circus tent theatre==
[[Image:Music Circus tent front.jpg|180px|right|thumb|The Sacramento Music Circus tent in 2001]]
In 1949, [[St. John Terrell]] began a new experience presenting summer stock theatre under an arena-type ([[circus]]) tent in [[Lambertville, New Jersey]], the [[Music circus]]. This began a new period of outdoor theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lambertville-music-circus.org/ Music Circus archives, history, show/cast lists] lambertville-music-circus.org, accessed July 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1951 this new style of summer stock made its way west with the addition of the [[California Musical Theatre|Sacramento Music Circus]].

The [[Cape Cod]] Music Circus (now the Melody Tent) in [[Hyannis, Massachusetts|Hyannis]], Massachusetts opened in 1950, the third tent theatre to open, and The South Shore Music Circus in [[Cohasset, Massachusetts|Cohasset]], Massachusetts followed in 1951. A tent theatre had opened earlier in Florida.&lt;ref name=melody/&gt;

[[Image:Music Circus Stage.jpg|180px|left|thumb|The Sacramento Music Circus stage in 2001]]
Another theatre in the round, the [[Valley Forge Music Fair]] (which closed in 1996), in Devon, Pennsylvania, was opened in 1955 by [[Shelly Gross]], [[Lee Guber]] and [[Frank Ford (broadcaster)|Frank Ford]].  They then opened other theatres in the round, including Shady Grove Music Fair in Washington, DC, Painters Mill Music Fair in Maryland (closed in 1991), and the [[Westbury Music Fair]] on [[Long Island]], opened in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simonson, Robert]]. [https://archive.is/20120908022435/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/130436 Shelly Gross, Creator of Summer Stock "Music Fairs," Dies at 88,"] playbill.com, June 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; By 1957, there were 19 tent theatres, many located in Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey, and all presenting musicals only. (The musical ''[[The Pajama Game]]'' was the major show making the tent circuit in the summer of 1957.)&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, Irwinn.[https://books.google.com/books?id=gCEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=Beverly+%22North+Shore+Music%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3 "Tented Broadway Grows",] ''The Billboard'', June 24, 1957, accessed July 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[theatre in the round]] concept brought Broadway-style musicals to northern [[California]] under a big top tent each summer. Original producers Russell Lewis and Howard Young presented their first production, ''[[Show Boat]]'', the same opening production at both the Lambertville and the South Shore Music Circus. The original Lambertville theatre closed in 1970, and both the Sacramento and South Shore theatres continue to thrive today.  In Sacramento, live musicals in the round are presented in a new permanent complex, The [[Wells Fargo Pavilion]]. The South Shore Music Circus and Cape Cod Melody Tent now serve primarily as intimate settings for musical acts including popular singers, oldies groups, and orchestras.

A '''supporting character''' is a [[fictional character|character]] in a [[narrative]] that is not the focus of the primary [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]], but appears or is mentioned in the story enough to be more than just a minor character or a [[cameo appearance]]. Sometimes, supporting characters may develop a complex [[back-story]] of their own, but this is usually in relation to the main character, rather than entirely independently. In television, supporting characters may appear in more than half of the episodes per season.

In some cases, especially in ongoing material such as comic books and television series, supporting characters themselves may become main characters in a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] if they are sufficiently popular with fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=THR|title=6 Characters Who Became the Stars of Their Own Spinoff Films|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/minions-5-character-spinoff-films-808201|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mercury-Wonder-Show-1943.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Advertising herald for ''The Mercury Wonder Show'' (August 1943)]]
'''''The Mercury Wonder Show for Service Men''''' was a 1943 magic-and-variety stage show by the [[Mercury Theatre]], produced by [[Orson Welles]] and [[Joseph Cotten]] as a morale-boosting entertainment for US soldiers in [[World War II]]. Directed by Welles, the show starred Welles ("Orson the Magnificent"), Cotten ("Jo-Jo the Great"), [[Agnes Moorehead]] ("[[Calliope]] Aggie") and [[Rita Hayworth]], whose part was later filled by [[Marlene Dietrich]]. [[Jean Gabin]] also worked on the show backstage, as a propman. The show ran to 150 minutes.

==Background==
[[File:Welles-Draft-1943.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Orson Welles leaving his Army physical examination after being judged unfit for military service (May 6, 1943)]]
In early 1943, the two concurrent radio series (''[[Ceiling Unlimited]]'', ''[[Hello Americans]]'') that Orson Welles created for [[CBS Radio|CBS]] to support the war effort had ended. Filming also had wrapped on ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' and that fee, in addition to the income from his regular guest-star roles in radio, made it possible for Welles to fulfill a lifelong dream. He approached the War Assistance League of Southern California and proposed a show that evolved into a big-top spectacle, part [[circus]] and part [[magic (illusion)|magic show]]. He offered his services as magician and director,&lt;ref name="Magic"&gt;Charvet, David, "Orson Welles and The Mercury Wonder Show". ''[[Magic (magazine)|Magic, An Independent Magazine for Magicians]]'', Volume 2 Number 12, August 1993&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|40|date=June 2014}} and invested some $40,000 of his own money in an extravaganza he called ''The Mercury Wonder Show for Service Men''. Members of the U.S. armed forces were admitted free of charge, while the general public had to pay.&lt;ref name="Genii"/&gt;{{Rp|26|date=June 2014}} The show entertained more than 1,000 service members each night, and proceeds went to the War Assistance League, a charity for military service personnel.&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt;

"It was just like a circus — I would have adored it if I'd been a member of the audience, I know that," Welles later told filmmaker [[Peter Bogdanovich]].&lt;ref name="TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|177|date=June 2014}}

The development of the show coincided with the resolution of Welles's [[Selective Service System|draft status]] in May 1943, when he was finally declared 4-F — unfit for military service — for a variety of medical reasons. "I felt guilty about the war," Welles told biographer Barbara Leaming. "I was guilt-ridden about my civilian status."&lt;ref name="Leaming Hayworth"&gt;Leaming, Barbara, ''If This Was Happiness: A Biography of Rita Hayworth''. New York: Viking, 1989 {{ISBN|0-670-81978-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|86|date=June 2014}} He had been publicly hounded about his patriotism since ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', when the Hearst press began persistent inquiries about why Welles had not been drafted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://framework.latimes.com/2011/09/28/orson-welles-rejected-by-army/ |title=Orson Welles Rejected by Army (May 6, 1943) |publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', September 28, 2011 |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=6392 |title=70 years ago: Orson Welles’ patriotism, military service made headlines |publisher=Wellesnet, May 3, 2013 |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McBride"&gt;[[Joseph McBride (writer)|McBride, Joseph]], ''What Ever Happened to Orson Welles?

Welles's fascination with illusion dated back to childhood; [[Harry Houdini]] gave him his first lessons in magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/sketchbook4.htm |title=Orson Welles Sketch Book Transcripts, Episode 4  |publisher=''[[Orson Welles' Sketch Book]]'' at Wellesnet: The Orson Welles Web Resource |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1941 debut at the [[California State Fair]] (assisted by [[Dolores del Río]]) was a hit and, as "The Ace", he continued practicing his performance skills at vaudeville theaters and army camps. By 1943 Welles had developed a two-hour magic show.&lt;ref name="Genii"/&gt;{{Rp|26|date=June 2014}}

==Rehearsal and previews==

The show's name was a nod to [[Howard Thurston]]'s ''The Wonder Show of the Universe''. Welles adapted at least five of Thurston's illusions for his own show, and adopted his use of showgirls as stage extras.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|162–163}}

For ''The Mercury Wonder Show'', Welles selected [[Rita Hayworth]], one of the most popular women in motion pictures, as his chief assistant.&lt;ref name="Magic"/&gt;{{Rp|40|date=June 2014}}&lt;ref name="Genii"/&gt;{{Rp|26|date=June 2014}} In April 1943 he began teaching illusions to Hayworth, who was then living with him.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|163}} The couple practiced the [[Metamorphosis (illusion)|Houdini Substitution Trunk]] routine in the 125-seat private theater of [[Bill Larsen]], a successful Los Angeles attorney and magician who operated Thayer's Studio of Magic.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|163}}

Other cast included co-producer Joseph Cotten and, in his stage debut as comedy assistant, Welles's chauffeur, George (Shorty) Chirello.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|165|date=June 2014}} Welles hired [[Keye Luke]] — an accomplished visual artist as well as an actor — to design culturally authentic scenery and graphics, in contrast to the fake-Oriental visuals typically seen in [[Western culture|Western]] magic shows.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|167|date=June 2014}}

The show was rehearsed for 17 weeks.&lt;ref name="Magic"/&gt;{{Rp|40|date=June 2014}} Welles leased the Playtime Theatre (later the Las Palmas Theatre), a 350-seat house in Hollywood. Welles initially planned a moderate-sized magic show, open only to service members, that would run six weeks at the theatre and then tour army camps.&lt;ref name="Whaley"&gt;[http://www.lybrary.com/barton-whaley-m-191.html Whaley, Barton], ''Orson Welles: The Man Who Was Magic''.

He tested 18 different openings before he was satisfied.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|167}}

Previews began in June.&lt;ref name="Leaming Hayworth"/&gt;{{Rp|87|date=June 2014}} As the show came together Welles began calling it "the biggest magic show on earth", and the cast and crew grew to 31 people.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|164–165|date=June 2014}} Welles bought or commissioned $26,000 worth of props and put $14,000 into the tent, scenery, costumes and rental of circus equipment. He also rented an entire menagerie, from a canary to a lion. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] donated the venue, a lot near the [[Hollywood Canteen]] on Cahuenga Boulevard.&lt;ref name="Magic"/&gt;{{Rp|40|date=June 2014}}

A portion of the stage show was filmed and included in the 1944 variety film, ''[[Follow the Boys]]''. The film segment was directed by Welles, uncredited.

Welles and Dietrich agreed to appear in the film while ''The Mercury Wonder Show'' was still running. The seven-minute segment was shot on the Universal lot in late September 1943. Welles traded his robe and fez for white tie and tails, and brought along a crew from the show — Shorty Chirello, Tommy Hanlon, Professor Bill and his Circus Symphony, Death Valley Mack, two female assistants and eight chorus girls. Welles performed a few illusions; his own appearance on stage and the comic version of the sawing-a-woman-in-half illusion featuring Dietrich were achieved with trick photography.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|184}} Welles received $30,000 for his part in the film. The segment was to be shot in four or five days, but Welles stretched filming to 16 days to give additional pay to his crew.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|185–186}}

'''''Transporter''''' (French: '''''Le Transporteur''''') is an English-language French [[action film]] franchise, comprising four films released between 2002 and 2015, and a television series. [[Jason Statham]] plays Frank Martin in the first three movies, a professional freelance courier driver for hire. Statham himself is an accomplished [[martial artist]], allowing him to do all the combat scenes involving Frank Martin himself. This permits the films' signature Hong Kong-style fight scenes, choreographed by [[Corey Yuen]]. 
[[Chris Vance (actor)|Chris Vance]] portrays Frank Martin in the [[Transporter: The Series|television series]] and [[Ed Skrein]] portrays Frank Martin in the [[The Transporter Refueled|fourth film]], a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]].

===''The Transporter''===
{{Main|The Transporter}}
Frank Martin ([[Jason Statham]]) is a highly skilled driver known only as "The Transporter." He will transport anything, no questions asked, always on time, and he is known as the best in the business. He strictly follows three rules when transporting: Rule Number 1: "Once the deal is made, it is final", Rule Number 2: "No names", and Rule Number 3: "Never open the package." Frank inadvertently breaks his own rule, opens the package and finds a bound and gagged woman.

===''Transporter 2''===
{{Main|Transporter 2}}
Frank is working as the driver/chauffeur for a wealthy family, in the United States. Martin bonds with their young son, whom he drives to school every day. When the boy is kidnapped, Frank must again take action in order to protect his young "package" and his family. Eventually, Martin unravels a scheme involving biological weapons and the nefarious Gianni Chellini. Martin is forced to remove a bomb from the bottom of his car by executing an aerial corkscrew manoeuver underneath a crane. The crane catches the bomb and Martin escapes unharmed. Frank debuts the [[Audi A8 W12]] in this film.

Inspector Tarconi plays an even more prominent role in this film. It is established that he and Frank are now friends, and Tarconi goes as far as to lie to the police to cover for Frank. His cooking prowess is established as well.

===''Transporter 3''===
{{Main|Transporter 3}}
Frank has been pressured into transporting Valentina ([[Natalya Rudakova]]) the kidnapped daughter of Leonid Vasilev ([[Jeroen Krabbé]]), the head of the Environmental Protection Agency for Ukraine, from [[Marseille]] through [[Stuttgart]] and [[Budapest]] until he ends up in [[Odessa]] on the [[Black Sea]]. Along the way, with the help of Inspector Tarconi ([[François Berléand]]), Frank has to contend with the people who strong armed him to take the job, agents sent by Vasilev to intercept him, and the general non-cooperation of his passenger, who he realises is the package mid-way through the film. Despite Valentina's cynical disposition and Frank's resistance to get involved, Frank and Valentina fall for each other, while escaping from one life-threatening situation after another. Martin again drives an armoured [[Audi A8 W12]] in the film, as well as a [[BMX]] bicycle.

==Frank Martin==
{{Main
| Frank Martin (Transporter)
}}
'''Frank Martin''' is the [[protagonist]] of the films and television series. He initially serves as a [[reluctant hero]]. He is portrayed as a former [[Special Forces]] operative who was a team leader of a search and destroy unit. His military background includes operations "in and out of" [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Sudan]]. He retires from this after becoming fatigued and disenchanted with his superior officers. In simple terms, he got tired of seeing his best efforts turned to nothing by the same people paying him to do the job. So he puts his skills to action as a private driver for hire.

'''Trick roping''' is an entertainment or competitive art involving the spinning of a [[lasso]] also known as a lariat or a "rope."  It is particularly associated with [[Wild West Shows|wild west shows]] or western arts in the United States.

The lasso is a well-known tool of American [[cowboy]]s, who developed rope spinning and throwing skills in using lassos to catch animals. Cowboys developed various tricks to show off their prowess with the lasso and demonstrations of these tricks evolved into entertainment and competitive disciplines.

There is a well-established repertoire of tricks that can be divided into three fundamental categories: "flat loop", "vertical loop" and "butterfly". In addition there are thrown loop tricks and tricks that involve the use of two ropes. Among the vertical loop tricks is the "Texas Skip", which involves the performer spinning the lasso in a wide loop in a vertical plane and jumping through the loop from one side to the other on each rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Well-known trick ropers include:

*[[Texas Jack Omohundro]], the first performer to introduce roping acts to the American stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Logan|first1=Herschel C.|title=Buckskin and Satin: The Life of Texas Jack and His Wife|date=1954||page=73|publisher=Stackpole|location=Harrisburg|url=https://archive.org/details/buckskinandstain007287mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Montie Montana]], who had a 60-year career as a trick roper, also appeared in several [[John Wayne]] movies.

*Actor and humorist [[Will Rogers]], known for his roles as a cowboy, was an expert at trick roping. Rogers' rope tricks were showcased in the 1922 silent film "The Ropin' Fool."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = The Ropin' Fool|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124857/|date = 1922-10-29|accessdate = 2016-02-23|first = Clarence G.|last = Badger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Vince Bruce, born April 4, 1955, died September 24, 2011: Internationally acclaimed as one of the best western acts in the world, Bruce made his Broadway debut in 1991, in the Tony Award-winning musical ''The Will Rogers Follies — A Life in Revue''. Appearing as the trick-roping star and portraying Rogers in this tribute to the cowboy and vaudeville star, Bruce remained with the show for two and a half years at New York’s Palace Theatre. For his act, he performed a spin with two ropes, a feat first devised 60 years earlier by Will Rogers himself. On July 21, 1991, at the Empire State Building, Vince set a new world record — 4,011 — for “Texas Skips”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vince Bruce - Obituaries|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8818953/Vince-Bruce.html|accessdate=29 December 2017|agency=The Telegraph|date=10 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Florence LaDue|Flores LaDue]] (1883-1951): the only cowgirl to claim three world championships for trick and fancy roping, Flores remained undefeated in the event. Flores and her husband, Guy Weadick, also a Trick Roper, organized and produced the first Calgary Stampede. Flores Ladue is reputed to have been the first trick roper to perform the trick known as the Texas Skip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flores Ladue|url=http://www.cowgirl.net/portfolios/flores-ladue/|website=National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30198">The '''United States Telephone Herald Company''', founded in 1909, was the parent corporation for a number of associated "[[telephone newspaper]]" companies, located throughout the United States, that were organized to provide news and entertainment over telephone lines to subscribing homes and businesses. This was the most ambitious attempt made to develop a distributed audio service prior to the rise of radio broadcasting in the early 1920s.

At least a dozen associate companies were chartered, but despite initial optimism and ambitious goals, only two systems ever went into commercial operation — one based in Newark, New Jersey (New Jersey Telephone Herald, 1911-1912) and the other in Portland, Oregon (Oregon Telephone Herald, 1912-1913). Moreover, both of these systems were shut down after operating for only a short time, due to economic and technical issues.

Corporation activity peaked in 1913, but the lack of success caused the company to suspend operations, and the corporation charter for the United States Telephone Herald Company was repealed in early 1918.

==Company history==

[[File:1910 U.S. Telephone Herald stock certificate.JPEG|300px|thumb|right|United States Telephone Herald Company stock certificate (1910).&lt;ref&gt;Twenty-five $10 shares, issued on November 30, 1910 to John J. Griffin. Signed by James Gillies (treasurer) and Manley M. Gillam (president).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The United States Telephone Herald Company was an authorized offshoot of the [[Telefon Hírmondó]] audio service of Budapest, Hungary. The Telefon Hírmondó programming, transmitted to subscribers over telephone wires, consisted of an extensive selection of news during the day, followed by instruction and entertainment during the evening. This "news-teller" service began operation in February 1893, shortly before the death of its inventor, [[Tivadar Puskás]].

Following a visit to Hungary, Cornelius Balassa procured the U.S. patent rights to the Telefon Hírmondó technology. (Later reports state that the company also held the rights for Canada and Great Britain. Another group obtained the rights for Italy, where in 1910 they established the service under the name [[Araldo Telefonico]]). The formation of a parent U.S. company, initially operating under a New York state charter as the "Telephone Newspaper Company of America", was announced in October 1909, with organizing directors Manley M. Gillam (president), William H. Alexander (secretary and treasurer), and Cornelius Balassa, all of New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2014/New%20York%20NY%20Herald/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201909/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201909%20-%209549.pdf" Hark! Telephone Will Tell it All"], ''New York Herald,'' October 7, 1909, page 9 (fultonhistory.com)&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1910, the parent company was reorganized as the "United States Telephone Herald Company", now operating as a Delaware-chartered corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizapedia.com/us/UNITED-STATES-TELEPHONE-HERALD-COMPANY.html United States Telephone Herald Company] entry. (bizapedia.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

An initial demonstration transmission was given at the company headquarters, located at 110 West Thirty-fourth Street in New York City, in early September 1910.&lt;ref&gt;"News Bulletins by 'Phone", ''New York Times'', September 9, 1910, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment used was similar to that which was employed in Budapest. As in Hungary, announcers were called "[[stentor]]s", and because [[vacuum tube]] technology had not been developed yet, there were limited methods for amplification, so to compensate the stentors had to speak as loudly as possible into oversized dual-microphones. The lack of amplification also meant that subscribers needed to listen through headphones instead of loudspeakers. On February 14, 1911 {{US patent|src=uspto|984235}}, describing "a telephone system... adapted for supplying innumerable subscribers... general news, musical compositions, and operas, sermons, correct or standard time and other happenings at stated intervals of day and night" was granted to Árpád Németh, and assigned to the company.

Regionally-based Telephone Herald affiliates were authorized for the purpose of creating local "telephone newspaper" systems, with "the parent company to receive a royalty on every instrument installed".&lt;ref name="short"&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiuo.ark:/13960/t3jx22z8w;view=1up;seq=200" 'Phone Herald's Short Life"], ''The Fourth Estate'', March 2, 1912, pages 10, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; But ultimately the parent company and its affiliates proved financially unsuccessful, and the United States Telephone Herald Company began winding down operations. Its Delaware business charter was repealed on January 28, 1918, for failure to pay state corporate taxes for two years.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. I'' (1926), page 1263.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telephone Herald associate companies===

At least twelve Telephone Herald associate companies were formed, although in only two cases was a telephone newspaper service successfully launched: the New Jersey Telephone Herald (1911-1912) and the Oregon Telephone Herald (1912-1913). (In some cases the service was also referred to as the "telectrophone".)

Each associate company was established by local owners operating under a state-granted business charter. Publicity for these services commonly stated that the telephone newspaper subscriptions would cost 5 cents a day. (For comparison, at this time a copy of the daily ''Oregonian'' newspaper in Portland also cost 5 cents.) However, a majority of the associate companies got no further than the promotion or demonstration stages.

In addition to twelve known associate companies, early company publicity stated that installations would also be set up in Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;"Newspaper By Phone for Chicago", ''Meriden (Connecticut) Morning Record'', June 15, 1910, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Scranton, Pennsylvania &lt;ref&gt;"No Private Wires on News Telephone", ''Scranton (Pennsylvania) Republican'', September 29, 1910, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and Montreal, Canada,&lt;ref&gt;"News and Opera Over Telephone", ''Montreal Gazette'', January 12, 1911, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but systems do not appear to have been established at any of these locations. Also, a December 14, 1912 advertisement for the Central California Telephone Herald listed associate Telephone Herald companies with company names starting with New York, Chicago, New Orleans, Seattle-Tacoma, Columbia (British Columbia and Alberta, Canada), Los Angeles and Oakland,&lt;ref name=missing&gt;"Central California Telephone Herald" (advertisement), ''Sacramento Bee'', December 14, 1912, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no information for these either.

==Associate companies that launched telephone newspapers==

===New Jersey Telephone Herald Co. (Newark)===

[[File:1912 NJ Telephone Herald daily schedule.GIF|thumb|right|300px|New Jersey Telephone Herald's daily schedule (1912)&lt;ref name="njth"&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044048678270;view=1up;seq=712 "Telephone Newspaper—A New Marvel"] by Arthur F. Colton, ''Technical World'', February 1912, pages 666-669. Pictured stentor appears to be Richard D. Arons.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Of the two Telephone Herald affiliates which launched commercial services, the '''New Jersey Telephone Herald''' was both the first and most publicized. The company had been incorporated in October 1910 in the state of New Jersey by Eugene Gorenflo, Duncan McIsaac and Nicholas J. Surgess.

The original plan was to begin operations in March 1911, however, the New York Telephone Company, which operated the Newark telephone system franchise, initially refused to lease telephone lines to the Telephone Herald, on the grounds that their charter did not permit it. It required a ruling by the Public Utility Commission to compel the telephone company to provide the needed wires.&lt;ref name="short" /&gt; The hiring process for the stentors, who worked as the news readers, was competitive and rigorous. According to one of the original stentors, the position was restricted to "college men" with strong voices and extensive vocabularies. Throughout the day four stentors announced during rotating shifts of 15 minutes each, and did staff work when they were not announcing.&lt;ref&gt;"America's First Announcer Hailed From Springfield" by Richard D. Arons, ''Springfield (Massachusetts) Sunday Union and Republican'', February 12, 1928, page 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 1911, an ambitious daily service, closely patterned after the Telefon Hírmondó's, was launched to a reported fifty receivers located in a department store waiting room, plus five hundred Newark homes. The company's central offices, studio, and switch rooms were located in the Essex Building on Clinton Street in Newark. Condit S. Atkinson, who had extensive newspaper experience, headed the service's news department.&lt;ref&gt;"Editor Atkinson Gets Out First Issue of News by Wire", ''New Brunswick (New Jersey) Times'', October 25, 1911, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company reported that there were many persons eager to sign up with the innovative service, and it soon had more potential subscribers than could be supported. One young listener later remembered that "it was a great thrill to pick up the small receiver and hear a voice telling about world events", moreover, "It was such a novelty that I could scarcely wait to get home from school and listen to it. It fascinated me. I would listen as long as it was operative, or until I was called to do my homework."&lt;ref&gt;''My Father Was Uncle Wiggily'' by Roger Garis, 1966, page 90.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the program features was a series of original "Trippertrot" stories, written by local children's author [[Howard R. Garis]], which were later assembled into two book collections: ''Three Little Trippertrots'' and ''Three Little Trippertrots on Their Travels'', published in 1912.
 	
Despite the enthusiastic response, the company soon ran into serious technical and financial difficulties. Due to a revenue crisis, which resulted in employees walking off the job due to missed paychecks, the service was suspended in late February 1912.&lt;ref name="short" /&gt; A replenishment of funding resulted in a temporary revival in late May, with the primary company officials now consisting of Percy Pyne (president), William E. Gunn (vice-president and general manager), and C. E. Danforth (secretary-treasurer), with C. S. Atkinson renewing his editor functions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiuo.ark:/13960/t3jx22z8w;view=1up;seq=527 "The Newark Telephone Herald Resumes"], ''The Fourth Estate'', June 1, 1912, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this would only be a temporary respite, and the telephone newspaper transmissions shut down for good in December 1912.

A later review suggested that the primary issue was technical, as the twisted pair phone lines used for the Newark operation had different electrical characteristics than the wiring used by the original Telefon Hírmondó plant.&lt;ref&gt;"Broadcasting in 1912" by G. C. B. Rowe, ''Radio News'', June, 1925, pages 2219, 2309, 2311.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the permanent suspension of services, the New Jersey Telephone Herald's business charter was declared null and void on January 18, 1916.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. I'' (1926), page 853.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oregon Telephone Herald Co. (Portland)===

Although less well known than the New Jersey affiliate, the second Telephone Herald company to implement an ongoing telephone newspaper service was the '''Oregon Telephone Herald Company'''. But like its predecessor, it also soon faced financial difficulties and was short-lived. The company was incorporated in Oregon, and headquartered at 506 Royal Building (Seventh and Morrison) in Portland. Extensive demonstrations were begun in May 1912, and advertisements the next month said commercial service would start "around October 1st".&lt;ref name="demos"&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1912-06-30/ed-1/seq-5/ "Oregon Telephone Herald" (advertisement)], ''The Sunday Oregonian'', June 30, 1912, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 1913 solicitation for home subscribers for "The Talking Newspaper and Amusement Purveyor" listed the hours of operation as 8:00 AM to midnight.&lt;ref name="orpheum"&gt;[https://gallery.multcolib.org/document/lambardi-grand-opera-company-heilig-theatre-november-18-1912 Theater program], Lambardi Grand Opera Company, Heilig Theatre, Portland, Oregon, November 18, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; Later advertisements referred to the service as the "Te-Lec-Tro-Phone", and in April saw the introduction of the reporting of local [[Portland Beavers]] baseball games.&lt;ref name="play"&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83025138/1913-04-14/ed-1/seq-12/ "Everybody-Play Ball" (advertisement)], ''Morning Oregonian'', April 14, 1912, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; (In December, a Northwestern League representative complained that the service had hurt attendance, and supported "the ousting of the various telephone herald and signalling systems from the ball parks"). A promotion the following month offered the chance to hear election results for free at twenty-five business sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83025138/1913-05-03/ed-1/seq-8/ "Te-lec-tro-phone Election Returns" (advertisement)], ''Portland Oregonian'', May 3, 1913, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In May, the Portland Hotel advertised that diners could listen to "the latest baseball, business and other news by Telephone-Herald" with their meals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83025138/1913-05-07/ed-1/seq-5/ "The Portland Hotel" (advertisement)], ''Morning Oregonian'', May 7, 1913, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There appears to have been a company reorganization in early 1913, and in March two representatives from the parent company, including chief electrical engineer Árpád Németh, were reported in town to give technical advice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1913-03-16/ed-1/seq-4/ "Phone Device Assured"], ''Morning Oregonian'', March 16, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; But as with its New Jersey predecessor, the Portland enterprise was in trouble. During the summer, Oregon Corporation Commissioner R. A. Watson stepped in, and, under provisions of the state's "Blue Sky Law", barred the Oregon Telephone Herald from doing business,&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83025138/1913-08-29/ed-1/seq-6/ "Blue Sky Law Applied"], ''Morning Oregonian'', August 29, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "There was no question about the honesty of this concern, but the scheme isn't practical, and while it might be popular for a short time it would be a failure in the end; therefore, we refused them a permit to sell stock."&lt;ref&gt;"Malheur County Leads State", ''Malheur (Vale, Oregon) Enterprise'', October 25, 1913, pages 1, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final advertisements for the company appeared in June 1913, and the state corporation charter was terminated on January 16, 1917, for failure to file statements or pay fees for two years.

==Other associate companies ==

None of the other ten Telephone Herald associate companies launched their proposed telephone newspaper systems, although there were widely varying levels of plans  and activities.

===Boston Telephone Herald Syndicate, Inc.===

Incorporated in Massachusetts on April 23, 1913, by Ladislaus de Doory (president), John M. Grosvenor, Jr. (treasurer), and Jesse W. Morton. De Doory was also a promoter with the parent company. However, the syndicate does not appear to have made any demonstrations or other significant development, and its business charter was dissolved on February 21, 1916.

===California Telephone Herald Co. (San Francisco)===

This was the first of two companies that were headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company received a California business charter in February 1911, issued to G. S. Holbrook, W. A. Whelan, W. B. Heckmann, A. H. Vorrath, R. M. Graham, R. Boreman, William T. Newverth, A. C. Gould and A. Jacoby.

Demonstrations were conducted in September 1911 at 821, 822, 823 Head Building, but no further progress appears to have been made, and the company charter was declared forfeited and repealed for non-payment of taxes in February 1915.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. III'' (1930), page 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central California Telephone Herald Co. (Sacramento)===

Incorporated in California in February, 1912 by C. J. Ward, F. W. Bresse and S. H. Whisner. Demonstrations were begun on April 2, 1912 from 4th Floor of the Elks' Building.&lt;ref&gt;"Central California Telephone Herald" (advertisement), ''Sacramento Bee'', April 2, 1912, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1913, provisions were made to lease a local theater, the Diepenbrock, to serve as a source for programming.&lt;ref&gt;"Big Free Concert to Open Diepenbrock", ''Sacramento Bee'', November 19, 1913, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was an abrupt change of plans, and instead the owners decided to merge their operations with the Pacific Telephone Herald Company.&lt;ref name="merger"&gt;"Items of Local Interest", ''Placerville (California) Mountain Democrat'', December 6, 1913, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The telephone newspaper service never became operational, either before or after the Pacific Telephone Herald merger. The company's charter was declared forfeited and repealed for non-payment of taxes in February 1915.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. III'' (1930), page 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massachusetts Telephone Herald Co.===

This company was chartered in Delaware in August 1912 by R. R. Cooling, C. J. Jacobs and H. W. Davis of Wilmington, Delaware. There is no additional information, other than the fact that its corporation charter was repealed on January 24, 1916.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. III'' (1930), page 913.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific Telephone Herald Co. (Oakland, California)===

The company was incorporated in California. Demonstrations were made at H. C. Capwell Company's Store beginning in February 1913 which lasted through at least April. The original corporate offices were at 303-304-305 Union Savings Bank Building in Oakland, prior to a relocation to 1741 Franklin Street.

The company's secretary-treasurer, J. B. Whited died in September 1913, and the company president, William Angus, was killed in a mining accident in October 1914. In addition, the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company initially refused to lease telephone lines to the company, resulting in a complaint filed before the Railroad Commission of the State of California. This case was dismissed on November 5, 1913 after the two sides reached a settlement.

In November 1913, a major expansion was announced, with the purchase from the parent company of the rights to operate in twenty-one western U.S. states and "the greater part of southwestern Canada",&lt;ref&gt;"Telephone Herald Co. Acquires Facilities", ''Oakland Tribune'', November 18, 1913, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and the next month saw a merger with the Central California Telephone Herald Company of Sacramento.&lt;ref name="merger" /&gt; But despite the ambitious expansion plans, it does not appear that any regular service was ever established, and the state business charter was forfeited on March 4, 1916 for failure to pay the state license tax.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. II'' (1928), page 1077.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pennsylvania Telephone Herald Co. (Philadelphia)===

Incorporated in the state of Delaware on December 30, 1911 by Frank Vernon, Ivor B. Blaiberg, and Albert D. Miller. Although there was a limited amount of corporate activity reported in 1912-1913,&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiuo.ark:/13960/t3jx22z8w;view=1up;seq=509 "Philadelphia to Have a Telephone Herald"], ''The Fourth Estate'', May 25, 1912, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; nothing of significance appears to have resulted. The corporation charter was repealed on January 25, 1917 for two years taxes unpaid.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. I'' (1926), page 955.&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Diego Telephone Herald Co.===

Incorporated in California in August 1911 by H. A. Schmidt (president), M. N. Schmidt and G. Stephens. The principals were inspired by the reported success of the concept in San Francisco, and promotional advertisements were run in the fall of 1911,&lt;ref&gt;"One Who Knows the Telephone Herald" (advertisement), ''San Diego Union'', October 29, 1911, page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; but the enterprise never began operations.

===San Francisco Telephone Herald Co.===

This was second San Francisco-based Telephone Herald company, following the earlier California Telephone Herald Company. It was incorporated in the state of California on October 29, 1912, with founding the directors of W. H. Dohrmann, J. F. Dohrmann, A. J. Beecher, F. W. Beecher, Thomas R. White, C. E. Youngblood, Rudolph Schlueten, Clarence Eppstein and E. L. Manner.

Demonstrations were given at 687 Market Street in early January 1913, but no further progress appears to have been made. The corporation charter was forfeited November 30, 1913, for failure to pay the state license tax.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. II'' (1928), page 1226.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern California Telephone Herald Co. (Los Angeles)===

One of the first associate companies to be formed, this was also, due to fraud, one of the first to fail. It was chartered in California in May 1911, led by Peter Archbold Gordon Grimes, who turned out to be a con man. Grimes soon ran off with company funds, and was next seen impersonating an aviator in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1912-07-26/ed-1/seq-6/" 'Kenneth Gordon, Aviator' Turns Out to Be Plain Peter Grimes",] ''The Hawaiian Gazette'', July 26, 1912, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The corporation charter was forfeited on November 30, 1911 for failure to pay its state license tax.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. I'' (1926), page 1140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Washington Telephone Herald Co. (Seattle)===

This affiliate, capitalized with $500,000 of common stock, was chartered in the state of Washington in June, 1911. The officers were Sherwood Gillespy, president; B. J. Klarman, vice president; and N. R. Solner, secretary and treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;"Tube in Wall to Tell All News", ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', June 7, 1911, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also announced that demonstrations were being conducted at the company headquarters at 339-340-341 Henry building.&lt;ref&gt;"Washington Telephone Herald Company" (advertisement) ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', June 11, 1911, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The company soon faced financial difficulties, and in October was forced into receivership due to a salary dispute.&lt;ref&gt;"Receiver for Telephone Herald", ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', October 4, 1911, page 5; "Two Receivers are Appointed", ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', October 8, 1911, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The company charter was cancelled sometime during the biennial reporting period of October 1, 1912 to September 30, 1914, for failure to pay the annual state license fee.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. III'' (1930), page 1422.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were a few other early attempts to set up telephone-based news and entertainment systems in the United States, including the [[Tellevent]], which conducted demonstrations and experimental work in Michigan from 1906-1908, and the [[Automatic Electric|Automatic Electric Company's]] [[Musolaphone]], which operated a short-lived entertainment system in Chicago in 1913. However, these efforts were no more successful than the Telephone Herald companies.

Both the Hungarian [[Telefon Hírmondó]] and the Italian [[Araldo Telefonico]] survived long enough for their operations to be combined with radio broadcasting in the 1920s. The same did not occur in the United States, and the Telephone Herald companies were the last early effort to offer nationwide audio programming over telephone lines. Although the concept of home audio entertainment was attractive to potential U.S. subscribers, the lack of signal amplification and other technical limitations, such as the need to maintain a telephone line infrastructure, and having to listen over headphones, made the technology unprofitable.&lt;ref&gt;"Early Uses of the Telephone" by Carolyn Marvin, ''Communication in History'', 1995, page 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than a decade after the failure of the Telephone Herald companies, radio broadcasting was developed, which had the significant advantage that it could dispense with the need to use telephone lines. Moreover, radio programming could be provided free of subscription fees, because selling airtime to advertisers, the financing method most commonly adopted in the United States, provided sufficient revenue for ongoing operations.
