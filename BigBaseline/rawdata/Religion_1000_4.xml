[[File:A Mathematician's Apology.pdf|thumb|Full text of the "A Mathematician's Apology" by G. H. Hardy.]]

'''''A Mathematician's Apology''''' is a 1940 essay by British mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]].  It concerns the [[Mathematical beauty|aesthetics of mathematics]]  with some personal content, and gives the layman an insight into the mind of a working [[mathematician]].

==Summary==
[[File:Ghhardy@72.jpg|thumb|left|In ''A Mathematician's Apology'', [[G. H. Hardy]] defined a set of criteria for mathematical beauty.]]
In the book's title, Hardy uses the word "[[Apologetics|apology]]" in the sense of a formal justification or defence (as in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]''), not in the sense of a plea for forgiveness.

Hardy felt the need to justify his life's work in mathematics at this time mainly for two reasons. Firstly, at age 62, Hardy felt the approach of old age (he had survived a heart attack in 1939) and the decline of his mathematical creativity and skills.
By devoting time to writing the Apology, Hardy was admitting that his own time as a creative mathematician was finished. In his foreword to the 1967 edition of the book, [[C. P. Snow]] describes the Apology as
"a passionate lament for creative powers that used to be and that will never come again".
In Hardy's words, "Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds. [...] It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics. The function of a mathematician is to do something, to prove new theorems, to add to mathematics, and not to talk about what he or other mathematicians have done."

Secondly, at the start of the [[World War II]], Hardy, a committed [[pacifist]], wanted to justify his belief that mathematics should be pursued for its own sake rather than for the sake of its applications. He wanted to write a book in which he would explain his mathematical philosophy to the next generation of mathematicians; that would defend mathematics by elaborating on the merits of pure mathematics solely, without having to resort to the attainments of applied mathematics in order to justify the overall importance of mathematics; and that would inspire the upcoming generations of pure mathematicians. Hardy was an [[atheist]], and makes his justification not to [[God]] but to his fellow man.

One of the main themes of the book is the beauty that mathematics possesses, which Hardy compares to painting and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=135–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Hardy, the most beautiful mathematics was that which had no practical applications in the outside world ([[pure mathematics]]) and, in particular, his own special field of [[number theory]].  Hardy contends that if useful knowledge is defined as knowledge which is likely to contribute to the material comfort of mankind in the near future (if not right now), so that mere intellectual satisfaction is irrelevant, then the great bulk of higher mathematics is useless.  He justifies the pursuit of pure mathematics with the argument that its very "uselessness" on the whole meant that it could not be misused to cause harm.  On the other hand, Hardy denigrates much of the [[applied mathematics]] as either being "trivial", "ugly", or  "dull", and contrasts it with "real mathematics", which is how he ranks the higher, pure mathematics.

Hardy expounds by commenting about a phrase attributed to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] that "Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics." Some people believe that it is the extreme non-applicability of number theory that led Gauss to the above statement about number theory; however, Hardy points out that this is certainly not the reason. If an application of number theory were to be found, then certainly no one would try to dethrone the "queen of mathematics" because of that. What [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] meant, according to Hardy, is that the underlying concepts that constitute number theory are deeper and more elegant compared to those of any other branch of mathematics.

Another theme is that mathematics is a "young man's game", so anyone with a talent for mathematics should develop and use that talent while they are young, before their ability to create original mathematics starts to decline in middle age. This view reflects Hardy's increasing depression at the wane of his own mathematical powers. For Hardy, real mathematics was essentially a creative activity, rather than an explanatory or expository one.

==Critiques==
[[File:MathematiciansApology.jpg|thumb|First edition&lt;br&gt;(publ. [[Cambridge University Press]])]]

Hardy's opinions were heavily influenced by the [[academia|academic]] culture of the universities of [[Cambridge]] and [[Oxford]] between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

Some of Hardy's examples seem unfortunate in retrospect. For example, he writes, "No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years." Since then number theory was used to crack German enigma codes and much later, figure prominently in [[public-key cryptography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wayback.cecm.sfu.ca/personal/jborwein/apaper.pdf|title=Experimental mathematician Jonathan Borwein's comments on the Apology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hardy's more prominent examples of elegant mathematical discoveries with no use (proofs of [[Euclid's theorem|the infinitude of primes]] and of [[Square root of 2|the irrationality of the square root of two]]) still hold up.

The applicability of a mathematical concept is not the reason that Hardy considered applied mathematics somehow inferior to pure mathematics, though; it is the simplicity and prosiness that belong to applied mathematics that led him to describe them as he did.

He considers that [[Rolle's theorem]] for example, though it is of some importance for [[calculus]], cannot be compared to the elegance and preeminence of the mathematics produced by [[Évariste Galois]] and other pure mathematicians.

{{redirect-multi|3|After death|Life after death|Hereafter}}
{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |expanded=religion}}
'''Afterlife''' (also referred to as '''life after death''') is the concept that an [[essence|essential part]] of an individual's [[Personal identity|identity]] or the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] continues to manifest after the [[death]] of the physical body. According to various ideas about the afterlife, the essential aspect of the individual that lives on after death may be some partial element, or the entire [[soul]] or [[spirit]], of an individual, which carries with it and may confer personal identity or, on the contrary, may not, as in Indian [[nirvana]]. Belief in an afterlife, which may be [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] or [[supernatural]], is in contrast to the belief in [[eternal oblivion|oblivion after death]].

In some views, this continued existence often takes place in a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] realm, and in other popular views, the individual may be [[#Reincarnation|reborn]] into [[World (theology)|this world]] and begin the life cycle over again, likely with no memory of what they have done in the past. In this latter view, such rebirths and deaths may take place over and over again continuously until the individual gains entry to a spiritual realm or [[Otherworld]]. Major views on the afterlife derive from [[religion]], [[esotericism]] and [[metaphysics]].

Some belief systems, such as those in the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic tradition]], hold that the dead go to a specific [[Plane (esotericism)|plane of existence]] after death, as determined by [[God]], or other [[divine judgment]], based on their [[orthopraxy|actions]] or [[orthodoxy|beliefs]] during life. In contrast, in systems of [[#Reincarnation|reincarnation]], such as those in the [[Indian religions]], the nature of the continued existence is determined directly by the actions of the individual in the ended life, rather than through the decision of a different being.

==Different metaphysical models==
[[Theists]] generally believe some type of afterlife awaits people when they die. Members of some generally non-theistic religions tend to believe in an afterlife, but without reference to a deity. The [[Sadducees]] were an ancient Jewish sect that generally believed that there was a God but no afterlife.

Many religions, whether they believe in the soul's existence in another world like Christianity, Islam and many [[Paganism|pagan]] belief systems, or in reincarnation like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, believe that one's status in the afterlife is a reward or punishment for their conduct during life.

===Reincarnation===
{{main|Reincarnation}}
Reincarnation is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] or [[Religion|religious]] concept that an aspect of a living [[being]] starts a new [[life]] in a different [[physical body]] or form after each biological [[death]]. It is also called rebirth or transmigration, and is a part of the [[Saṃsāra]] doctrine of cyclic existence.{{Sfn|Norman C. McClelland|2010|pp=24-29, 171}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}} It is a central tenet of all major [[Indian religions]], namely [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Sikhism]].{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}}{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|pp=90-99}}&lt;ref name="Gross1993p148"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rita M. Gross |title=Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PK37AxCfxVEC  |year=1993|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-0513-1 |pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of reincarnation is found in many ancient cultures,{{Sfn|Norman C. McClelland|2010|pp=102–103}} and a belief in rebirth/[[metempsychosis]] was held by Greek historic figures, such as [[Pythagoras]], [[Socrates]], and [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;see Charles Taliaferro, Paul Draper, Philip L. Quinn, ''A Companion to Philosophy of Religion''. John Wiley and Sons, 2010, page 640, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SSCx-67Tk6cC&amp;pg=PA640 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a common belief of various ancient and modern religions such as [[Spiritism]], [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]], and [[Eckankar]] and is found as well in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as [[Australia]], [[East Asia]], [[Siberia]], and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;Gananath Obeyesekere, ''Imagining Karma: Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth''. University of California Press, 2002, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the majority of denominations within the [[Abrahamic religions]] of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of [[Kabbalah]], the [[Catharism|Cathars]], [[Alawites]], the [[Druze]],&lt;ref&gt;Hitti, Philip K (2007) [1924]. ''Origins of the Druze People and Religion, with Extracts from their Sacred Writings (New Edition)''. Columbia University Oriental Studies. '''28'''. London: Saqi. pp. 13–14. {{ISBN|0-86356-690-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Rosicrucians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel|Heindel, Max]] (1985) [1939, 1908] ''The Rosicrucian Christianity Lectures (Collected Works)'': [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcl/rcleng01.htm#lecture1 The Riddle of Life and Death]. Oceanside, California. 4th edition. {{ISBN|0-911274-84-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical relations between these sects and the beliefs about reincarnation that were characteristic of [[Neoplatonism]], [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Manicheanism]], and [[Gnosticism]] of the [[Roman era]] as well as the Indian religions have been the subject of recent scholarly research.&lt;ref&gt;An important recent work discussing the mutual influence of ancient Greek and Indian philosophy regarding these matters is ''The Shape of Ancient Thought'' by [[Thomas McEvilley]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unity Church]] and its founder [[Charles Fillmore (Unity Church)|Charles Fillmore]] teach reincarnation.

===Heaven and hell===
{{Main|Heaven|Hell}}
[[Heaven]], the heavens, [[seven heavens]], [[pure land]]s, [[Tian]], [[Jannah]], [[Valhalla]], or [[the Summerland]], is a common [[Religious cosmology|religious, cosmological]], or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] place where beings such as [[Deity|gods]], [[angel]]s, [[jinn]], [[saint]]s, or [[Veneration of the dead|venerated ancestors]] are said to originate, be [[throne|enthroned]], or live. According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to earth or [[Incarnation|incarnate]], and earthly beings can ascend to heaven in the afterlife, or in exceptional cases [[Entering Heaven alive|enter heaven alive]].

Heaven is often described as a "higher place", the [[Sacred|holiest]] place, a [[paradise]], in contrast to [[hell]] or the [[underworld]] or the "low places", and [[Universal reconciliation|universally]] or conditionally accessible by earthly beings according to various standards of [[divinity]], [[good and evil|goodness]], [[piety]], [[faith]] or other [[virtue]]s or [[orthodoxy|right beliefs]] or simply the [[will of God]]. Some believe in the possibility of a heaven on Earth in a [[world to come]].

In [[Indian religions]], heaven is considered as ''[[Svarga|Svarga loka]]''. There are seven positive regions the soul can go to after death and seven negative regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-research/afterlife/life-after-death/|title=Life after death - Where do we go after we die?|work=SSRF English|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing its stay in the respective region, the soul is subjected to [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] in different living forms according to its ''[[karma]]''. This cycle can be broken after a soul achieves ''[[Moksha]]'' or ''[[Nirvana]]''. Any place of existence, either of humans, souls or deities, outside the tangible world (heaven, hell, or other) is referred to as [[otherworld]].

[[Hell]], in many religious and [[folklore|folkloric]] traditions, is a place of [[torture|torment]] and [[punishment]] in the afterlife. [[Religion]]s with a [[Philosophy of history#Cyclical and linear history|linear]] [[Divinity|divine]] history often depict hell as an [[eternal damnation|eternal destination]],&lt;!--(for example, see [[Christian views on hell]])--&gt; while religions with a [[reincarnation|cyclic history]] often depict a hell as an intermediary period between [[incarnation]]s.&lt;!--(for example, see Chinese [[Diyu]])--&gt; Typically, these traditions locate hell in another dimension or under the [[earth]]'s surface and often include entrances to hell from the land of the living. Other afterlife destinations include [[purgatory]] and [[limbo]].

Traditions that do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of punishment or reward merely describe hell as an [[Bosom of Abraham|abode of the dead]], the [[grave]], a neutral place (for example, [[sheol]] or [[Christian views on Hades|Hades]]) located under the surface of earth.

==Ancient religions==

===Ancient Egyptian religion===
{{main|Ancient Egyptian religion#Afterlife}}
The afterlife played an important role in [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], and its belief system is one of the earliest known in recorded history. When the body died, parts of its soul known as ''ka'' (body double) and the ''ba'' (personality) would go to the Kingdom of the Dead. While the soul dwelt in the [[Aaru|Fields of Aaru]], [[Osiris]] demanded work as restitution for the protection he provided. Statues were placed in the tombs to serve as substitutes for the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Taylor, ''Death and the afterlife: A Cultural Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO, 2000, {{ISBN|0-87436-939-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving at one's reward in afterlife was a demanding ordeal, requiring a sin-free heart and the ability to recite the spells, passwords and formulae of the [[Book of the Dead]]. In the Hall of Two Truths, the deceased's heart was weighed against the ''Shu'' feather of truth and justice taken from the headdress of the goddess [[Ma'at]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bard| first = Katheryn | title = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the heart was lighter than the feather, they could pass on, but if it were heavier they would be devoured by the demon [[Ammit]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Demeritt, ''Ptah's Travels: Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt'', 2005, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptians also believed that being mummified and put in a sarcophagus (an ancient Egyptian "coffin" carved with complex symbols and designs, as well as pictures and hieroglyphs) was the only way to have an afterlife. Only if the corpse had been properly [[Embalming|embalmed]] and entombed in a [[mastaba]], could the [[Resurrection of the Dead|dead live again]] in the Fields of Yalu and accompany the Sun on its daily ride. Due to the dangers the afterlife posed, the Book of the Dead was placed in the tomb with the body as well as food, jewellery, and 'curses'. They also used the "opening of the mouth".&lt;ref&gt;Glennys Howarth, Oliver Leaman, ''Encyclopedia of death and dying'', 2001, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Lunis, ''Tut's Deadly Tomb'', 2010, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptian civilization was based on religion; their belief in the rebirth after death became the driving force behind their funeral practices. Death was simply a temporary interruption, rather than complete cessation, of life, and that eternal life could be ensured by means like piety to the gods, preservation of the physical form through [[mummification]], and the provision of statuary and other funerary equipment. Each human consisted of the physical body, the ''ka'', the ''ba'', and the ''akh''. The Name and Shadow were also living entities. To enjoy the afterlife, all these elements had to be sustained and protected from harm.&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Fleming, Alan Lothian, ''Ancient Egypt's Myths and Beliefs'', 2011, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2010, a spokesman for the Egyptian Culture Ministry claimed it had unearthed a large red granite door in Luxor with inscriptions by [[User (ancient Egyptian official)|User]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/door-to-afterlife-found-in-egyptian-tomb|title=Door to Afterlife found in Egyptian tomb |publisher=www.meeja.com.au |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2008-09-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110016/http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/door-to-afterlife-found-in-egyptian-tomb |archivedate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a powerful adviser to the [[18th dynasty]] Queen [[Hatshepsut]] who ruled between 1479 BC and 1458 BC, the longest of any woman. It believes the false door is a 'door to the Afterlife'. According to the archaeologists, the door was reused in a structure in [[Roman Egypt]].

===Ancient Greek and Roman religions===
{{main|Greek underworld}}
The Greek god [[Hades]] is known in [[Greek mythology]] as the king of the [[underworld]], a place where souls live after death.&lt;ref&gt;F. P. Retief and L. Cilliers, "Burial customs, the afterlife and the pollution of death in ancient Greece", ''Acta Theologica'' '''26'''(2), 2006, p. 45 ([http://www.ajol.info/index.php/actat/article/viewFile/52560/41166 PDF]).&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek god [[Hermes]], the messenger of the gods, would take the dead soul of a person to the underworld (sometimes called Hades or the House of Hades). Hermes would leave the soul on the banks of the River [[Styx]], the river between life and death.&lt;ref&gt;Social Studies School Service, ''Ancient Greece'', 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], also known as the ferry-man, would take the soul across the river to Hades, if the soul had gold: Upon burial, the family of the dead soul would put coins under the deceased's tongue. Once crossed, the soul would be judged by [[Aeacus]], [[Rhadamanthus]] and King [[Minos]]. The soul would be sent to [[Elysium]], [[Tartarus]], [[Asphodel Fields]], or the Fields of Punishment. The Elysian Fields were for the ones that lived pure lives. It consisted of green fields, valleys and mountains, everyone there was peaceful and contented, and the Sun always shone there. Tartarus was for the people that blasphemed against the gods, or were simply rebellious and consciously evil.&lt;ref&gt;Perry L. Westmoreland, ''Ancient Greek Beliefs'', 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;68–70&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asphodel Fields were for a varied selection of human souls: Those whose sins equalled their goodness, were indecisive in their lives, or were not judged. The Fields of Punishment were for people that had sinned often, but not so much as to be deserving of Tartarus. In Tartarus, the soul would be punished by being burned in lava, or stretched on racks. Some heroes of Greek legend are allowed to visit the underworld. The Romans had a similar belief system about the afterlife, with Hades becoming known as [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]. In the ancient Greek myth about the [[Labours of Heracles]], the hero [[Heracles]] had to travel to the underworld to capture [[Cerberus]], the three-headed guard dog, as one of his tasks.

In ''[[Dream of Scipio]]'', [[Cicero]] describes what seems to be an [[out of body experience]], of the [[soul]] traveling high above the Earth, looking down at the small planet, from far away.&lt;ref&gt;N. Sabir, ''Heaven Hell Or'', 2010, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book VI of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the hero, [[Aeneas]], travels to the underworld to see his father. By the River Styx, he sees the souls of those not given a proper burial, forced to wait by the river until someone buries them. While down there, along with the dead, he is shown the place where the wrongly convicted reside, the fields of sorrow where those who committed suicide and now regret it reside, including Aeneas' former lover, the warriors and shades, Tartarus (where the titans and powerful non-mortal enemies of the Olympians reside) where he can hear the groans of the imprisoned, the palace of [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], and the fields of Elysium where the descendants of the divine and bravest heroes reside. He sees the river of forgetfulness, [[Lethe]], which the dead must drink to forget their life and begin anew. Lastly, his father shows him all of the future heroes of Rome who will live if Aeneas fulfills his destiny in founding the city.

The [[Poetic Edda|Poetic]] and [[Prose Edda]]s, the oldest sources for information on the Norse concept of the afterlife, vary in their description of the several realms that are described as falling under this topic. The most well-known are:
* [[Valhalla]]: (lit. "Hall of the Slain" i.e. "the Chosen Ones") Half the warriors who die in battle join the god [[Odin]] who rules over a majestic hall called Valhalla in [[Asgard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.viking-mythology.com/theNineWorlds.php|title=Norse Mythology {{!}} The Nine Worlds|website=www.viking-mythology.com|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fólkvangr]]: (lit. "Field of the Host") The other half join the goddess [[Freyja]] in a great meadow known as Fólkvangr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spangenhelm.com/folkvangr-freyjas-field-warriors/|title=Fólkvangr, Freyja welcomes you to the Field of the Host|date=2016-05-20|work=Spangenhelm|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hel (realm)|Hel]]: (lit. "The Covered Hall") This abode is somewhat like [[Hades]] from Ancient Greek religion: there, something not unlike the [[Asphodel Meadows]] can be found, and people who have neither excelled in that which is good nor excelled in that which is bad can expect to go there after they die and be reunited with their loved ones.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* [[Niflhel]]: (lit. "The Dark" or "Misty Hel") This realm is roughly analogous to Greek [[Tartarus]]. It is the deeper level beneath Hel, and those who break oaths and commit other vile things will be sent there to be among their kind to suffer harsh punishments.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Judaism===
{{main|Jewish eschatology}}

====She'ol====
[[She'ol]], in the [[Hebrew Bible]], is a place of darkness to which all the dead go, both the righteous and the unrighteous, regardless of the moral choices made in life, a place of stillness and darkness cut off from life and from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rainwater|1996|p=819}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=June 2017}}

The inhabitants of Sheol are the "shades" (''[[rephaim]]''), entities without personality or strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Longenecker|2003|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under some circumstances they are thought to be able to be contacted by the living, as the [[Witch of Endor]] contacts the shade of [[Samuel]] for [[Saul]], but such practices are forbidden (Deuteronomy 18:10).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knobel|2011|pp=205–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Hebrew Bible appears to describe Sheol as the permanent place of the dead, in the [[Second Temple period]] (roughly 500 BC–70 AD) a more diverse set of ideas developed. In some texts, Sheol is considered to be the home of both the righteous and the wicked, separated into respective compartments; in others, it was considered a place of punishment, meant for the wicked dead alone.&lt;ref name="Longenecker 2003 189"&gt;{{harvnb|Longenecker|2003|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Hebrew scriptures were translated into [[Septuagint|Greek]] in ancient [[Alexandria]] around 200 BC, the word "[[Hades]]" (the [[Greek underworld]]) was substituted for Sheol. This is reflected in the [[New Testament]] where Hades is both the underworld of the dead and the personification of the [[evil]] it represents.&lt;ref name="Longenecker 2003 189"/&gt;

====World to Come====
The [[Talmud]] offers a number of thoughts relating to the afterlife. After death, the soul is brought for judgment. Those who have led pristine lives enter immediately into the ''Olam Haba'' or [[world to come]]. Most do not enter the world to come immediately, but now experience a period of review of their earthly actions and they are made aware of what they have done wrong. Some view this period as being a "re-schooling", with the soul gaining wisdom as one's errors are reviewed. Others view this period to include spiritual discomfort for past wrongs. At the end of this period, not longer than one year, the soul then takes its place in the world to come. Although discomforts are made part of certain Jewish conceptions of the afterlife, the concept of "eternal [[damnation]]", so prevalent in other religions, is not a tenet of the Jewish afterlife. According to the Talmud, extinction of the soul is reserved for a far smaller group of malicious and evil leaders, either whose very evil deeds go way beyond norms, or who lead large groups of people to utmost evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/tsa/tsa37.htm |title=Tractate Sanhedrin: Interpolated Section: Those Who have no Share in the World to Come |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10049.html |title=Jehoiakim |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maimonides]] describes the ''Olam Haba'' in spiritual terms, relegating the prophesied physical resurrection to the status of a future miracle, unrelated to the afterlife or the [[Messianic era]]. According to Maimonides, an afterlife continues for the soul of every human being, a soul now separated from the body in which it was "housed" during its earthly existence.

The [[Zohar]] describes [[Gehenna]] not as a place of punishment for the wicked but as a place of spiritual purification for souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/06-Jewish-Thought/section-9.html |title=soc.culture.jewish FAQ: Jewish Thought (6/12)Section - Question 12.8: What do Jews say happens when a person dies?

====Reincarnation in Jewish tradition====
Although there is no reference to reincarnation in the Talmud or any prior writings,&lt;ref&gt;Saadia Gaon in Emunoth ve-Deoth Section vi&lt;/ref&gt; according to rabbis such as Avraham Arieh Trugman, reincarnation is recognized as being part and parcel of Jewish tradition. Trugman explains that it is through oral tradition that the meanings of the Torah, its commandments and stories, are known and understood. The classic work of Jewish mysticism,&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{YouTube|mM8dn68vgD8|Reincarnation in the Jewish Tradition}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Zohar, is quoted liberally in all Jewish learning; in the Zohar the idea of reincarnation is mentioned repeatedly. Trugman states that in the last five centuries the concept of reincarnation, which until then had been a much hidden tradition within Judaism, was given open exposure.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

[[Shraga Simmons]] commented that within the Bible itself, the idea [of reincarnation] is intimated in Deut. 25:5-10, Deut. 33:6 and Isaiah 22:14, 65:6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_askrabbi_o/bl_simmons_reincarnation.htm |title=Ask the Rabbi - Reincarnation |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yirmiyahu Ullman wrote that reincarnation is an "ancient, mainstream belief in Judaism". The Zohar makes frequent and lengthy references to reincarnation. [[Onkelos]], a righteous convert and authoritative commentator of the same period, explained the verse, "Let Reuben live and not die&amp;nbsp;..." (Deuteronomy 33:6) to mean that Reuben should merit the World to Come directly, and not have to die again as a result of being reincarnated. Torah scholar, commentator and kabbalist, [[Nachmanides]] (Ramban 1195–1270), attributed Job's suffering to reincarnation, as hinted in Job's saying "God does all these things twice or three times with a man, to bring back his soul from the pit to&amp;nbsp;... the light of the living' (Job 33:29,30)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yirmiyahu |first=Rabbi |url=http://ohr.edu/yhiy/article.php/1077 |title=Reincarnation « Ask! « Ohr Somayach |publisher=Ohr.edu |date=2003-07-12 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reincarnation, called ''[[gilgul]]'', became popular in [[folk belief]], and is found in much [[Yiddish]] literature among [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. Among a few kabbalists, it was posited that some human souls could end up being reincarnated into non-human bodies. These ideas were found in a number of Kabbalistic works from the 13th century, and also among many mystics in the late 16th century. [[Martin Buber]]'s early collection of stories of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]'s life includes several that refer to people reincarnating in successive lives.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Buber, "Legende des Baalschem" in ''Die Chassidischen Bücher'', Hellerau 1928, especially ''Die niedergestiegene Seele''&lt;/ref&gt;

Among well known (generally non-kabbalist or anti-kabbalist) rabbis who rejected the idea of reincarnation are [[Saadia Gaon]], [[David Kimhi]], [[Hasdai Crescas]], Yedayah Bedershi (early 14th century), [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]], the [[Asher ben Jehiel|Rosh]] and [[Leon de Modena]]. Saadia Gaon, in [[Emunoth ve-Deoth]] (Hebrew: "beliefs and opinions") concludes Section VI with a refutation of the doctrine of [[metempsychosis]] (reincarnation). While rebutting reincarnation, Saadia Gaon further states that Jews who hold to reincarnation have adopted non-Jewish beliefs. By no means do all Jews today believe in reincarnation, but belief in reincarnation is not uncommon among many Jews, including Orthodox.

Other well-known rabbis who are reincarnationists include Yonassan Gershom, [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], Talmud scholar Adin Steinsaltz, DovBer Pinson, David M. Wexelman, Zalman Schachter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sytekcom.com/rooster/bta-faq1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716181413/http://www.sytekcom.com/rooster/bta-faq1.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 |title=Reincarnation and the Holocaust FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. Reincarnation is cited by authoritative biblical commentators, including Ramban (Nachmanides), Menachem Recanti and Rabbenu Bachya.

Among the many volumes of Yitzchak Luria, most of which come down from the pen of his primary disciple, Chaim Vital, are insights explaining issues related to reincarnation. His ''[[Shaar HaGilgulim]]'', "The Gates of Reincarnation", is a book devoted exclusively to the subject of reincarnation in Judaism.

Rabbi Naftali Silberberg of The [[Rohr Jewish Learning Institute]] notes that "Many ideas that originate in other religions and belief systems have been popularized in the media and are taken for granted by unassuming Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Where does the soul go?

===Christianity===
{{main|Christian eschatology|Heaven in Christianity|Christian views on hell|Intermediate state}}
{{Primary sources|section|date=July 2017}}
[[Mainstream Christianity]] professes belief in the [[Nicene Creed]], and [[English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use]] include the phrase: "We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come." Although punishments are made part of certain Christian conceptions of the afterlife, the prevalent concept of "eternal damnation" is a tenet of the Christian afterlife.

When questioned by the [[Sadducees]] about the [[resurrection of the dead]] (in a context relating to who one's spouse would be if one had been married several times in life), [[Jesus]] said that marriage will be irrelevant after the resurrection as the resurrected will be like the [[angels]] in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2022:23-33;&amp;version=47; |title=Matthew 22:23-33 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus also maintained that the time would come when the dead would hear the voice of the [[Son of God]], and all who were in the tombs would come out, who have done good deeds to the resurrection of life, but those who have done wicked deeds to the resurrection of condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXD.HTM |title=The New American Bible - IntraText |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Enoch]] describes Sheol as divided into four compartments for four types of the dead: the faithful saints who await resurrection in [[Paradise]], the merely virtuous who await their reward, the wicked who await punishment, and the wicked who have already been punished and will not be resurrected on Judgment Day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Emerson Fosdick|Fosdick, Harry Emerson]]. A guide to understanding the Bible. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 1956. page 276.&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Enoch is considered apocryphal by most denominations of Christianity and all denominations of Judaism.

The book of [[2 Maccabees]] gives a clear account of the dead awaiting a future resurrection and judgment, plus prayers and offerings for the dead to remove the burden of sin.

[[File:Domenico Beccafumi 056.jpg|right|thumb|[[Domenico Beccafumi]]'s ''Inferno'': a Christian vision of hell]]
The author of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] recounts the story of [[Lazarus and Dives|Lazarus and the rich man]], which shows people in Hades awaiting the resurrection either in comfort or torment. The author of the [[Book of Revelation]] writes about God and the angels versus [[Satan]] and [[demons]] in an epic battle at the end of times when all souls are judged. There is mention of ghostly bodies of past prophets, and the [[transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]].

The non-canonical [[Acts of Paul and Thecla]] speak of the efficacy of [[prayer for the dead]], so that they might be "translated to a state of happiness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/thecla.html Acts of Paul and Thecla] 8:5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hippolytus of Rome]] pictures the [[underworld]] ([[Hades]]) as a place where the righteous dead, awaiting in the [[bosom of Abraham]] their resurrection, rejoice at their future prospect, while the unrighteous are tormented at the sight of the "[[Lake of fire|lake of unquenchable fire]]" into which they are destined to be cast.

Gregory of Nyssa discusses the long-before believed possibility of purification of souls after death.&lt;ref&gt;He wrote that a person "may afterward in a quite different manner be very much interested in what is better, when, ''after his departure out of the body'', he gains knowledge of the difference between virtue and vice and finds that he is not able to partake of divinity until he has been ''purged of the filthy contagion in his soul by the purifying fire''" (emphasis added)—Sermon on the Dead, AD 382, quoted in [http://www.catholic.com/library/Roots_of_Purgatory.asp The Roots of Purgatory] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527235028/http://www.catholic.com/library/Roots_of_Purgatory.asp |date=May 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Gregory I repeats the concept, articulated over a century earlier by [[Gregory of Nyssa]] that the saved suffer purification after death, in connection with which he wrote of "purgatorial flames".

The noun [[Purgatory|"purgatorium"]] (Latin: place of cleansing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/purgatory "purgatory"]. The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University Press., 2003. Answers.com 06 Jun. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;) is used for the first time to describe a state of painful purification of the saved after life. The same word in adjectival form (''purgatorius -a -um'', cleansing), which appears also in non-religious writing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2339625 |title=Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, '&amp;#39;A Latin Dictionary'&amp;#39; |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; was already used by Christians such as Augustine of Hippo and [[Pope Gregory I]] to refer to an after-death cleansing.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], theologians and philosophers presented various philosophies and beliefs. A notable example is [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] who wrote some 18 theological works which describe in detail the nature of the afterlife according to his claimed spiritual experiences, the most famous of which is ''[[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)|Heaven and Hell]]''.&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/translation/heaven-and-hell-dole/contents/10|title=Swedenborg, E. '&amp;#39;Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg Foundation, 2000)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His report of life there covers a wide range of topics, such as [[marriage]] in heaven (where all [[angels]] are married), children in heaven (where they are raised by angel parents), [[time]] and [[space]] in heaven (there are none), the after-death awakening process in the World of Spirits (a place halfway between Heaven and Hell and where people first wake up after death), the allowance of a free will choice between Heaven or Hell (as opposed to being sent to either one by God), the [[eternity]] of [[Hell]] (one could leave but would never want to), and that all angels or devils were once people on earth.&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org"/&gt;

====The Catholic Church====
The "Spiritual Combat", a written work by [[Lorenzo Scupoli]], states that four assaults are attempted by the “evil one” at the hour of death.&lt;ref&gt;http://stjudetheapostleparish.org/pdf/books/spiritual_combat.pdf#page35&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic conception of the afterlife teaches that [[Particular judgment|after the body dies, the soul is judged]], the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven. However, those who die in unrepented [[mortal sin]] go to hell. In the 1990s, the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] defined hell not as punishment imposed on the sinner but rather as the sinner's self-exclusion from God. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace, but still carry [[venial sin]] go to a place called [[Purgatory]] where they undergo purification to enter Heaven.

=====Limbo=====
{{main|Limbo}}
Despite popular opinion, Limbo, which was elaborated upon by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages, was never recognized as a [[dogma]] of the [[Catholic Church]], yet, at times, it has been a very popular theological theory within the Church. Limbo is a theory that unbaptized but innocent souls, such as those of infants, [[Virtue#Christianity|virtuous]] individuals who lived before [[Nativity of Jesus|Jesus Christ was born on earth]], or those that die before [[baptism]] exist in neither Heaven or Hell proper. Therefore, these souls neither merit the [[beatific vision]], nor are subjected to any punishment, because they are not guilty of any personal [[sin]] although they have not received baptism, so still bear [[original sin]]. So they are generally seen as existing in a state of natural, but not supernatural, happiness, until the end of time.

In other [[Christian denominations]] it has been described as an [[intermediate state|intermediate place]] or state of confinement in oblivion and neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/limbo |title=limbo - definition of limbo by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Purgatory=====
{{main|Purgatory}}
The notion of [[purgatory]] is associated particularly with the [[Catholic Church]]. In the Catholic Church, all those who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven or the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The tradition of the church, by reference to certain texts of scripture, speaks of a "cleansing fire" although it is not always called purgatory.

[[Anglican]]s of the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition generally also hold to the belief. [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]], believed in an [[intermediate state]] between death and the [[resurrection of the dead]] and in the possibility of "continuing to grow in holiness there", but Methodism does not officially affirm this belief and denies the possibility of [[Prayer for the dead|helping by prayer]] any who may be in that state.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Campbell, Methodist Doctrine: The Essentials (Abingdon 1999), quoted in [http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=5101 Feature article by ''United Methodist Reporter'' Managing Editor Robin Russell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722154244/http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=5101 |date=2011-07-22 }} and in [http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=4746355&amp;content_id=%7B94F6F768-0EA6-4C1B-B6B6-0C88EC04E8A2%7D&amp;notoc=1 FAQ Belief: What happens immediately after a person dies?]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthodox Christianity====
The Orthodox Church is intentionally reticent on the afterlife, as it acknowledges the mystery especially of things that have not yet occurred.  Beyond the second coming of Jesus, bodily resurrection, and final judgment, all of which is affirmed in the [[Nicene Creed]] (325 CE), Orthodoxy does not teach much else in any definitive manner.  Unlike Western forms of Christianity, however, Orthodoxy is traditionally non-dualist and does not teach that there are two separate literal locations of heaven and hell, but instead acknowledges that "the 'location' of one’s final destiny—heaven or hell—as being figurative."&lt;ref name="Andrew P. Klager 2011"&gt;[http://www.clarion-journal.com/files/new-klager-compassionate-eschatology-with-biblioklager-1.pdf#page=19 Andrew P. Klager, "Orthodox Eschatology and St. Gregory of Nyssa's ''De vita Moysis'': Transfiguration, Cosmic Unity, and Compassion," In ''Compassionate Eschatology: The Future as Friend'', eds. Ted Grimsrud &amp; Michael Hardin, 230-252 (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2011), 245.]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Orthodoxy teaches that the final judgment is simply one's uniform encounter with divine love and mercy, but this encounter is experienced multifariously depending on the extent to which one has been transformed, partaken of divinity, and is therefore compatible or incompatible with God. "The monadic, immutable, and ceaseless object of eschatological encounter is therefore the love and mercy of God, his glory which infuses the heavenly temple, and it is the subjective human reaction which engenders multiplicity or any division of experience."&lt;ref name="Andrew P. Klager 2011"/&gt; For instance, [[St. Isaac the Syrian]] observes that "those who are punished in Gehenna, are scourged by the scourge of love. ... The power of love works in two ways: it torments sinners . . . [as] bitter regret. But love inebriates the souls of the sons of Heaven by its delectability."&lt;ref&gt;St. Isaac the Syrian, "Homily 28," In ''The Ascetical Homilies of Saint Isaac the Syrian,'' trans. Dana Miller (Brookline, MA: Holy Transfiguration Monastery Press, 1984), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the divine action is always, immutably, and uniformly love and if one experiences this love negatively, the experience is then one of self-condemnation because of free will rather than condemnation by God.  Orthodoxy therefore uses the description of Jesus' judgment in John 3:19-21 as their model: "19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. 20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God." As a characteristically Orthodox understanding, then, Fr. [[Thomas Hopko]] writes, "[I]t is precisely the presence of God’s mercy and love which cause the torment of the wicked. God does not punish; he forgives. . . . In a word, God has mercy on all, whether all like it or not. If we like it, it is paradise; if we do not, it is hell. Every knee will bend before the Lord. Everything will be subject to Him. God in Christ will indeed be "all and in all," with boundless mercy and unconditional pardon. But not all will rejoice in God's gift of forgiveness, and that choice will be judgment, the self-inflicted source of their sorrow and pain."&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Thomas Hopko, "Foreword," in ''The Orthodox Church'', Sergius Bulgakov (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1988), xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Orthodoxy includes a prevalent tradition of ''[[apokatastasis]]'', or the restoration of all things in the end. This has been taught most notably by [[Origen]], but also many other Church fathers and Saints, including [[Gregory of Nyssa]]. The [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553 C.E.) affirmed the orthodoxy of Gregory of Nyssa while simultaneously condemning Origen's brand of universalism because it taught the restoration back to our pre-existent state, which Orthodoxy doesn't teach.  It is also a teaching of such eminent Orthodox theologians as [[Olivier Clément]], Metropolitan [[Kallistos Ware]], and Bishop [[Hilarion Alfeyev]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarion-journal.com/files/new-klager-compassionate-eschatology-with-biblioklager-1.pdf#page=25 Andrew P. Klager, "Orthodox Eschatology and St. Gregory of Nyssa's ''De vita Moysis'': Transfiguration, Cosmic Unity, and Compassion," In ''Compassionate Eschatology: The Future as Friend'', eds. Ted Grimsrud &amp; Michael Hardin, 230-252 (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2011), 251.]&lt;/ref&gt; Although apokatastasis is not a dogma of the church but instead a [[wikt:theologoumenon#English|theologoumena]], it is no less a teaching of the Orthodox Church than its rejection.  As Met. Kallistos Ware explains, "It is heretical to say that all must be saved, for this is to deny free will; but, it is legitimate to hope that all may be saved,"&lt;ref&gt;Kallistos Ware, The Orthodox Church (New York: Penguin, 1997), 262.&lt;/ref&gt; as insisting on torment without end also denies free will.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints====
{{main|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Exaltation (Mormonism)|Degrees of glory}}
[[File:000 preach-my-gospel 1207575 tmb.jpg|framed|Plan of Salvation in LDS Religion]]

[[Joseph F. Smith]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] presents an elaborate vision of the afterlife. It is revealed as the scene of an extensive missionary effort by righteous spirits in paradise to redeem those still in darkness—a spirit prison or "hell" where the spirits of the dead remain until judgment. It is divided into two parts: Spirit Prison and Paradise. Together these are also known as the Spirit World (also Abraham's Bosom; see Luke 16:19-25). They believe that Christ visited spirit prison [https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.18-20?lang=eng (1 Peter 3:18-20)] and opened the gate for those who repent to cross over to Paradise. This is similar to the [[Harrowing of Hell]] doctrine of some mainstream Christian faiths.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Both Spirit Prison and Paradise are temporary according to Latter-day Saint beliefs. After the resurrection, spirits are assigned "permanently" to three degrees of heavenly glory, determined by how they lived– Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial.(1 Cor 15:44-42; Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76) Sons of Perdition, or those who have known and seen God and deny it, will be sent to the realm of Satan, which is called Outer Darkness, where they shall live in misery and agony forever.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celestial Kingdom is believed to be a place where we can live eternally with our families. Progression does not end once one has entered the Celestial Kingdom, but it extends eternally. According to "True to the Faith" (a handbook on doctrines in the LDS faith), "The celestial kingdom is the place prepared for those who have "received the testimony of Jesus" and been "made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood" (D&amp;C 76:51, 69). To inherit this gift, we must receive the ordinances of salvation, keep the commandments, and repent of our sins."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/kingdoms-of-glory.p1?lang=eng&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] occasionally use terms such as "afterlife"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|title=Is Gehenna a Place of Fiery Torment?|date=April 1, 2011|page=31|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011252}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to any hope for the dead, but they understand [[Ecclesiastes]] 9:5 to preclude belief in an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reasoning From the Scriptures|pages=168–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals judged by God to be wicked, such as in the [[Great Flood]] or at [[Armageddon]], are given no hope of an afterlife. However, they believe that after Armageddon there will be a bodily resurrection of "both righteous and unrighteous" dead (but not the "wicked"). Survivors of Armageddon and those who are resurrected are then to gradually restore earth to a paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insight on the Scriptures|volume=2|pages=574–576}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Armageddon, unrepentant sinners are punished with eternal death (non-existence).

====Seventh-day Adventists====
The Seventh-day Adventist Church, teaches that the first death, or death brought about by living on a planet with sinful conditions (sickness, old age, accident, etc.) is a sleep of the soul. Adventists believe that the body + the breath of God = a living soul. Like Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists use key phrases from the Bible, such as "For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten." (Eccl. 9:5 KJV). Adventists also point to the fact that the wage of sin is death and God alone is [[immortality|immortal]]. Adventists believe God will grant eternal life to the redeemed who are resurrected at Jesus' second coming. Until then, all those who have died are "asleep". When Jesus the Christ, who is the Word and the Bread of Life, comes a second time, the righteous will be raised incorruptible and will be taken in the clouds to meet their Lord. The righteous will live in heaven for a thousand years (the millennium) where they will sit with God in judgment over the unredeemed and the fallen angels. During the time the redeemed are in heaven, the Earth will be devoid of human and animal inhabitation. Only the fallen angels will be left alive. The second resurrection is of the unrighteous, when Jesus brings the New Jerusalem down from heaven to relocate to Earth. Jesus will call to life all those who are unrighteous. Satan and his angels will convince the unrighteous to surround the city, but hell fire and brimstone will fall from heaven and consume them, thus cleansing Earth of all sin. The universe will be then free from sin forever. This is called the second death. On the new earth God will provide an eternal home for all the redeemed and a perfect environment for everlasting life, where Eden will be restored. The great controversy will be ended and sin will be no more. God will reign in perfect harmony forever. (Rom. 6:23; 1 Tim. 6:15, 16; Eccl. 9:5, 6; Ps. 146:3, 4; John 11:11-14; Col. 3:4; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; John 5:28, 29; Rev. 20:1-10; Rev. 20; 1 Cor. 6:2, 3; Jer. 4:23-26; Rev. 21:1-5; Mal. 4:1; Eze. 28:18, 19; 2 Peter 3:13; Isa. 35; 65:17-25; Matt. 5:5; Rev. 21:1-7; 22:1-5; 11:15.)&lt;ref&gt;White, E.G.

===Islam===
[[File:Mohammed´s Paradise.jpg|thumb|An artists representation of "Muhammed's Paradise". A [[Persian miniature]] from ''The History of Mohammed'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], Paris.]]
[[File:Idris the prophet.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]] is shown the afterlife places by an [[Angels in Islam|angel]]. In hell, the inmates are tormented by a [[Shaitan|demon]].]]
{{Main|Islamic view of death|Barzakh|Akhirah}}
The Islamic belief in the afterlife as stated in the [[Quran]] is descriptive. The [[Arabic]] word for Paradise is ''[[Jannah]]'' and Hell is ''[[Jahannam]]''. Their level of comfort while in the grave (according to some commentators) depends wholly on their level of ''[[Iman (concept)|iman]]'' or faith in the one almighty creator or supreme being ([[God]] or [[Allah]]). In order for one to achieve proper, firm and healthy ''iman'' one must practice righteous deeds or else his level of ''iman'' chokes and shrinks and eventually can wither away if one does not practice [[Islam]] long enough, hence the depth of practicing Islam is good deeds. One may also acquire ''[[tasbih]]'' and recite the names of Allah in such manner as ''Subahann Allah'' or "[[Glory (religion)|Glory]] be to Allah" over and over again to acquire good deeds.

In the Quran, God gives warning about grievous punishment to those who do not believe in the afterlife (''[[Akhirah]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|17|10|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and admonishes mankind that Hell is prepared for those who deny the meeting with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|18|103|e=106|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam teaches that the purpose of Man's entire creation is to worship Allah alone, which includes being kind to other human beings and life including bugs, and to trees, by not oppressing them. Islam teaches that the life we live on Earth is nothing but a test for us and to determine each individual's ultimate abode, be it punishment or ''Jannat'' in the afterlife, which is eternal and everlasting.

''Jannah'' and ''Jahannam'' both have different levels. ''Jannah'' has eight gates and seven levels. The higher the level the better it is and the happier you are. ''Jahannam'' possess 7 deep terrible layers. The lower the layer the worse it is. Individuals will arrive at both everlasting homes during [[Judgment Day]], which commences after the Angel [[Israfil]] blows the trumpet the second time. Islam teaches the continued existence of the soul and a transformed physical existence after death. Muslims believe there will be a day of judgment when all humans will be divided between the eternal destinations of Paradise and Hell.

In the 20th century, discussions about the afterlife address the interconnection between human action and divine judgment, the need for moral rectitude, and the eternal consequences of human action in this life and world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e61?_hi=2&amp;_pos=1 |title=Afterlife - Oxford Islamic Studies Online |doi=10.1093/0195156498.001.0001 |publisher=Oxfordislamicstudies.com |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central doctrine of the Quran is the Last Day, on which the world will be destroyed and Allah will raise all people and jinn from the dead to be judged. The Last Day is also called the Day of Standing Up, Day of Separation, Day of Reckoning, Day of Awakening, Day of Judgment, The Encompassing Day or The Hour.

Until the Day of Judgment, deceased souls remain in their graves awaiting the resurrection. However, they begin to feel immediately a taste of their destiny to come. Those bound for hell will suffer in their graves, while those bound for heaven will be in peace until that time.

The resurrection that will take place on the Last Day is physical, and is explained by suggesting that God will re-create the decayed body (17:100: "Could they not see that God who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the like of them?").

On the Last Day, resurrected humans and jinn will be judged by Allah according to their deeds. One's eternal destination depends on balance of good to bad deeds in life. They are either granted admission to Paradise, where they will enjoy spiritual and physical pleasures forever, or condemned to Hell to suffer spiritual and physical torment for eternity. The day of judgment is described as passing over Hell on a narrow bridge (as thin as human hair and sharper than a razor) in order to enter Paradise. Those who fall, weighted by their bad deeds, will remain in Hell forever.

====Ahmadiyya====
[[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]] Muslims believe that the afterlife is not material but of a spiritual nature. According to [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], the founder of [[Ahmadiyya]] sect in Islam, the soul will give birth to another rarer entity and will resemble the life on this earth in the sense that this entity will bear a similar relationship to the soul as the soul bears relationship with the human existence on earth. On earth, if a person leads a righteous life and submits to the will of God, his or her tastes become attuned to enjoying spiritual pleasures as opposed to carnal desires. With this, an "embryonic soul" begins to take shape. Different tastes are said to be born which a person given to carnal passions finds no enjoyment. For example, sacrifice of one's own rights over that of others becomes enjoyable, or that forgiveness becomes second nature. In such a state a person finds contentment and peace at heart and at this stage, according to Ahmadiyya beliefs, it can be said that a soul within the soul has begun to take shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iU1Yn4sSXEkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=elementary+study+of+islam&amp;q=elementary%20study%20of%20islam | title=An Elementary Study of Islam | author=Mirza Tahir Ahmad| page=50 |publisher=Islam International Publications |isbn=1-85372-562-5| year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sufi====
The Sufi scholar [[Ibn 'Arabi]] defined [[Barzakh#Sufism|Barzakh]] as the intermediate realm or "isthmus." It is between the world of corporeal bodies and the world of spirits, and is a means of contact between the two worlds. Without it, there would be no contact between the two and both would cease to exist. He described it as simple and luminous, like the world of spirits, but also able to take on many different forms just like the world of corporeal bodies can. In broader terms Barzakh, "is anything that separates two things". It has been called the dream world in which the dreamer is in both life and death.&lt;ref name="Ibn Al-Arabi 2006 29n,50n, 59,64–8, 73,75–8, 82, 102"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibn Al-Arabi|first=Muhyiddin|title=The Universal Tree and The Four Birds|year=2006|publisher=Anqa Publishing|pages=29n,50n, 59, 64–8, 73, 75–8, 82, 102|editor=Angela Jaffray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith on life after death}}
The teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] state that the nature of the afterlife is beyond the understanding of those living, just as an unborn fetus cannot understand the nature of the world outside of the [[womb]]. The [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í writings]] state that the soul is immortal and after death it will continue to progress until it attains [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|God's presence]]. In Bahá'í belief, souls in the afterlife will continue to retain their individuality and consciousness and will be able to recognize and communicate spiritually with other souls whom they have made deep profound friendships with, such as their [[Marriage|spouses]].&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= Smith|first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith|title= burial, "death and afterlife", evil, evil spirits, sin |year= 2000|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1|pages= 96–97, 118–119, 135–136, 322–323| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahá'í scriptures also state there are distinctions between souls in the afterlife, and that souls will recognize the worth of their own deeds and understand the consequences of their actions. It is explained that those souls that have turned toward God will experience gladness, while those who have lived in error will become aware of the opportunities they have lost. Also, in the Baha'i view, souls will be able to recognize the accomplishments of the souls that have reached the same level as themselves, but not those that have achieved a rank higher than them.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;

==South Asian religions==

===Hinduism===
{{main|Hindu eschatology}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
The [[Upanishads]] describe reincarnation (''punarjanma'') (see also: [[samsara]]). The [[Bhagavad Gita]], an important Hindu script, talks extensively about the afterlife. Here, [[Krishna]] says that just as a man discards his old clothes and wears new ones; similarly the soul discards the old body and takes on a new one. In Hinduism, the belief is that the body is nothing but a shell, the soul inside is immutable and indestructible and takes on different lives in a cycle of birth and death. The end of this cycle is called ''mukti'' (Sanskrit: मुक्ति) and staying finally with supreme God forever; is ''[[moksha]]'' (Sanskrit: मोक्ष) or salvation.

The [[Garuda Purana]] deals solely with what happens to a person after death. The God of Death [[Yama]] sends his representatives to collect the soul from a person's body whenever he is due for death and they take the soul to Yama. A record of each person's timings &amp; deeds performed by him is kept in a ledger by Yama's assistant, Chitragupta.

According to the Garuda Purana, a soul after leaving the body travels through a very long and dark tunnel towards the South. This is why an oil lamp is lit and kept beside the head of the corpse, to light the dark tunnel and allow the soul to travel comfortably.

The soul, called ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' leaves the body and reincarnates itself according to the deeds or ''[[karma]]'' performed by one in last birth. Rebirth would be in form of animals or other lower creatures if one performed bad karmas and in human form in a good family with joyous lifetime if the person was good in last birth. In between the two births a human is also required to either face punishments for bad karmas in "[[Naraka (Hinduism)|naraka]]" or hell or enjoy for the good karmas in ''[[swarga]]'' or heaven for good deeds. Whenever his or her punishments or rewards are over he or she is sent back to earth, also known as ''Mrutyulok'' or human world. A person stays with the God or ultimate power when he discharges only &amp; only ''yajna karma'' (means work done for satisfaction of supreme lord only) in last birth and the same is called as ''moksha'' or ''[[nirvana]]'', which is the ultimate goal of a self realised soul. ''Atma'' moves with ''[[Parmatma]]'' or the greatest soul. According to Bhagavad Gita an ''Atma'' or soul never dies, what dies is the body only made of five elements—Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Sky. Soul is believed to be indestructible. None of the five elements can harm or influence it. Hinduism through Garuda Purana also describes in detail various types of ''narkas'' or Hells where a person after death is punished for his bad ''karmas'' and dealt with accordingly.

Hindus also believe in ''karma''. ''Karma'' is the accumulated sums of one's good or bad deeds. ''Satkarma'' means good deeds, ''vikarma'' means bad deeds. According to [[Hinduism]] the basic concept of karma is 'As you sow, you shall reap'. So, if a person has lived a good life, they will be rewarded in the afterlife. Similarly their sum of bad deeds will be mirrored in their next life. Good karma brings good rewards and bad karmas lead to bad results. There is no judgment here. People accumulate karma through their actions and even thoughts. In Bhagavad Gita when [[Arjuna]] hesitates to kill his kith and kin the lord reprimands him saying thus "Do you believe that you are the doer of the action. No. You are merely an instrument in MY hands. Do you believe that the people in front of you are living? Dear Arjuna, they are already dead. As a ''[[kshatriya]]'' (warrior) it is your duty to protect your people and land. If you fail to do your duty, then you are not adhering to dharmic principles."{{cite quote|date=May 2018}}

===Buddhism===
{{main|Buddhist eschatology}}
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
Buddhists maintain that [[rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] takes place without an unchanging [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] or soul passing from one form to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Becker |first1=Carl B. |title=Breaking the circle: death and the afterlife in Buddhism |date=1993 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location=Carbondale |isbn=0-585-03949-6 |page=viii |quote=Buddhists believe in karma and rebirth, and yet they deny the existence of permanent souls.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of rebirth will be conditioned by the moral tone of the person's actions ([[Karma in Buddhism|kamma or karma]]). For example, if a person has committed harmful actions of body, speech and mind based on greed, hatred and delusion, rebirth in a lower realm, i.e. an animal, a [[Preta|hungry ghost]] or a hell realm, is to be expected. On the other hand, where a person has performed skillful actions based on generosity, loving-kindness ([[metta]]), compassion and wisdom, rebirth in a happy realm, i.e. human or one of the many heavenly realms, can be expected.

Yet the mechanism of rebirth with kamma is not deterministic. It depends on various levels of kamma. The most important moment that determines where a person is reborn into is the last thought moment. At that moment, heavy kamma would ripen if there were performed, if not then near death kamma, if not then habitual kamma, finally if none of the above happened, then residual kamma from previous actions can ripen. According to [[Theravada]] Buddhism, there are 31 realms of existence that one can be reborn into.

[[Pure Land Buddhism]] of [[Mahayana]] believes in a special place apart from the 31 planes of existence called [[Pure Land]]. It is believed that each Buddha has their own pure land, created out of their merits for the sake of sentient beings who recall them mindfully to be able to be reborn in their pure land and train to become a Buddha there. Thus the main practice of pure land Buddhism is to chant a Buddha's name.

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the [[Bardo Thodol|Tibetan Book of the Dead]] explains the intermediate state of humans between death and reincarnation. The deceased will find the bright light of wisdom, which shows a straightforward path to move upward and leave the cycle of reincarnation. There are various reasons why the deceased do not follow that light. Some had no briefing about the intermediate state in the former life. Others only used to follow their basic instincts like animals. And some have fear, which results from foul deeds in the former life or from insistent haughtiness. In the intermediate state the awareness is very flexible, so it is important to be virtuous, adopt a positive attitude, and avoid negative ideas. Ideas which are rising from subconsciousness can cause extreme tempers and cowing visions. In this situation they have to understand, that these manifestations are just reflections of the inner thoughts. No one can really hurt them, because they have no more material body. The deceased get help from different [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]s who show them the path to the bright light. The ones who do not follow the path after all will get hints for a better reincarnation. They have to release the things and beings on which or whom they still hang from the life before. It is recommended to choose a family where the parents trust in the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and to reincarnate with the will to care for the welfare of all beings.

"Life is cosmic energy of the universe and after death it merges in universe again and as the time comes to find the suitable place for the entity died in the life condition it gets born. There are 10 life states of any life: Hell, hunger, anger, animality, rapture, humanity, learning, realization, bodhisatva and buddhahood. The life dies in which life condition it reborn in the same life condition."{{cite quote|date=May 2018}}

===Sikhism===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
[[Sikhism]] may have a belief in the afterlife. They believe that the soul belongs to the spiritual universe which has its origins in God. However it's been a matter of great debate amongst the Sikhs about Sikhism's belief in afterlife. Many believe that Sikhism endorses the afterlife and the concept of reward and punishment as there are verses given in ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]'', but a large number of Sikhs believe otherwise and treat those verses as metaphorical or poetic.

Also it has been noted by many scholars that the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] includes poetic renditions from multiple saints and religious traditions like that of [[Kabir]], [[Baba Farid|Farid]] and [[Ramananda]]. The essential doctrine is to experience the divine through simple living, meditation and contemplation while being alive. Sikhism also has the belief of being in union with God while living. Accounts of afterlife are considered to be aimed at the popular prevailing views of the time so as to provide a referential framework without necessarily establishing a belief in the afterlife. Thus while it is also acknowledged that living the life of a householder is above the metaphysical truth, Sikhism can be considered agnostic to the question of an afterlife. Some scholars also interpret the mention of reincarnation to be naturalistic akin to the biogeochemical cycles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iuscanada.com/journal/archives/2011/j1312p52.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

But if one analyses the Sikh Scriptures carefully, one may find that on many occasions the afterlife and the existence of heaven and hell are mentioned in ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and in ''[[Dasam granth]]'', so from that it can be concluded that Sikhism does believe in the existence of heaven and hell; however, heaven and hell are created to temporarily reward and punish, and one will then take birth again until one merges in God. According to the Sikh scriptures, the human form is the closet form to God and the best opportunity for a human being to attain salvation and merge back with God. Sikh Gurus said that nothing dies, nothing is born, everything is ever present, and it just changes forms. Like standing in front of a wardrobe, you pick up a dress and wear it and then you discard it. You wear another one. Thus, in the view of Sikhism, your soul is never born and never dies. Your soul is a part of God and hence lives forever.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realsikhism.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1248308791&amp;ucat=7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
[[Jainism]] also believes in the after life. They believe that the soul takes on a body form based on previous karmas or actions performed by that soul through eternity. Jains believe the soul is eternal and that the freedom from the cycle of reincarnation is the means to attain eternal bliss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jhaveri|first1=Pujya Gurudevshri Rakeshbhai|title=Death the Awakener|url=http://www.shrimadrajchandramission.org/pujya-gurudevshri/pearls-of-wisdom/death-the-awakener-2110.htm|website=Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur|publisher=Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shinto===
{{further|Shinto#Afterlife}}
It is common for families to participate in ceremonies for children at a shrine, yet have a [[Japanese funeral|Buddhist funeral]] at the time of death. In old Japanese legends, it is often claimed that the dead go to a place called ''[[yomi]]'' (黄泉), a gloomy underground realm with a river separating the living from the dead mentioned in the legend of Izanami and Izanagi. This ''yomi'' very closely resembles the Greek [[Greek underworld|Hades]]; however, later myths include notions of resurrection and even [[Elysium]]-like descriptions such as in the legend of [[Okuninushi]] and [[Susanoo]]. Shinto tends to hold negative views on death and corpses as a source of pollution called ''kegare''. However, death is also viewed as a path towards [[apotheosis]] in Shintoism as can be evidenced by how legendary individuals become enshrined after death. Perhaps the most famous would be Emperor [[Ojin]] who was enshrined as [[Hachiman]] the God of War after his death.

===Unitarian Universalism===
Some [[Unitarian Universalist]]s believe in [[universalism]]: that all souls will ultimately be saved and that there are no torments of hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bond |first1=Jon |url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Unitarians-945/unitarian-view-afterlife.htm |title=Unitarians: unitarian view of afterlife, unitarian universalist association uua, unitarian universalist association |publisher=En.allexperts.com |date=2004-06-13 |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106125811/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Unitarians-945/unitarian-view-afterlife.htm |archivedate=2015-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unitarian Universalists differ widely in their theology hence there is no exact same stance on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism - Page 147, Mark W. Harris - 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although Unitarians historically believed in a literal hell, and Universalists historically believed that everyone goes to heaven, modern Unitarian Universalists can be categorized into those believing in a heaven, reincarnation and oblivion. Most Unitarian Universalists believe that heaven and hell are symbolic places of consciousness and the faith is largely focused on the worldly life rather than any possible afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Searching for Spiritual Unity&amp;nbsp;... Can There Be Common Ground? - Page 582, Robyn E. Lebron - 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritualism===
According to [[Edgar Cayce]], the afterlife consisted of nine realms equated with the nine planets of astrology. The first, symbolized by Saturn, was a level for the purification of the souls. The second, Mercury's realm, gives us the ability to consider problems as a whole. The third of the nine soul realms is ruled by Earth and is associated with the Earthly pleasures. The fourth realm is where we find out about love and is ruled by Venus. The fifth realm is where we meet our limitations and is ruled by Mars. The sixth realm is ruled by Neptune, and is where we begin to use our creative powers and free ourselves from the material world. The seventh realm is symbolized by Jupiter, which strengthens the soul's ability to depict situations, to analyze people and places, things, and conditions. The eighth afterlife realm is ruled by Uranus and develops psychic ability. The ninth afterlife realm is symbolized by Pluto, the astrological realm of the unconscious. This afterlife realm is a transient place where souls can choose to travel to other realms or other solar systems, it is the souls liberation into eternity, and is the realm that opens the doorway from our solar system into the cosmos.&lt;ref name="Afterlife"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sarah|last=Bartlett|date=2015|title=The Afterlife Bible: The Complete Guide to Otherworldly Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9781841814490|publisher=Octopus Publishing Group|isbn=9781841814490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream [[Spiritualist]]s postulate a series of seven realms that are not unlike Edgar Cayce's nine realms ruled by the planets. As it evolves, the soul moves higher and higher until it reaches the ultimate realm of spiritual oneness. The first realm, equated with hell, is the place where troubled souls spend a long time before they are compelled to move up to the next level. The second realm, where most souls move directly, is thought of as an intermediate transition between the lower planes of life and hell and the higher perfect realms of the universe. The third level is for those who have worked with their karmic inheritance. The fourth level is that from which evolved souls teach and direct those on Earth. The fifth level is where the soul leaves human consciousness behind. At the sixth plane, the soul is finally aligned with the cosmic consciousness and has no sense of separateness or individuality. Finally, the seventh level, the goal of each soul, is where the soul transcends its own sense of "soulfulness" and reunites with the World Soul and the universe.&lt;ref name="Afterlife"/&gt;

===Wicca===
The Wiccan afterlife is most commonly described as [[The Summerland]]. Here, souls rest, recuperate from life, and reflect on the experiences they had during their lives. After a period of rest, the souls are reincarnated, and the memory of their previous lives is erased. Many Wiccans see The Summerland as a place to reflect on their life actions. It is not a place of reward, but rather the end of a life journey at an end point of incarnations.&lt;ref&gt;Solitary Wicca For Life: Complete Guide to Mastering the Craft on Your Own - Page 162, Arin Murphy-Hiscock - 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
{{main|Frashokereti}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
Zoroastrianism states that the ''urvan'', the disembodied spirit, lingers on earth for three days before departing downward to the kingdom of the dead that is ruled by Yima. For the three days that it rests on Earth, righteous souls sit at the head of their body, chanting the [[Gathas|Ustavaiti Gathas]] with joy, while a wicked person sits at the feet of the corpse, wails and recites the [[Yasna]]. Zoroastrianism states that for the righteous souls, a beautiful maiden, which is the personification of the soul's good thoughts, words and deeds, appears. For a wicked person, a very old, ugly, naked hag appears. After three nights, the soul of the wicked is taken by the demon [[Vizaresa]] (Vīzarəša), to Chinvat bridge, and is made to go to darkness ([[hell]]).

[[Jamshid|Yima]] is believed to have been the first [[king]] on earth to rule, as well as the first man to die. Inside of Yima's realm, the [[spirits]] live a shadowy existence, and are dependent on their own descendants which are still living on Earth. Their descendants are to satisfy their hunger and clothe them, through rituals done on earth.

Rituals which are done on the first three days are vital and important, as they protect the soul from evil powers and give it strength to reach the underworld. After three days, the soul crosses [[Chinvat bridge]] which is the [[Final Judgment]] of the soul. Rashnu and [[Sraosha]] are present at the final judgment. The list is expanded sometimes, and include [[Bahman|Vahman]] and [[Ahura Mazda|Ormazd]]. [[Rashnu]] is the [[yazata]] who holds the scales of justice. If the good deeds of the person outweigh the bad, the soul is worthy of paradise. If the bad deeds outweigh the good, the bridge narrows down to the width of a blade-edge, and a horrid hag pulls the soul in her arms, and takes it down to hell with her.

[[Misvan Gatu]] is the "place of the mixed ones" where the souls lead a gray existence, lacking both joy and sorrow. A soul goes here if his/her good deeds and bad deeds are equal, and Rashnu's scale is equal.

==Parapsychology==
{{Main|Parapsychology}}
{{See also|Near-death studies|Near death experience}}

The [[Society for Psychical Research]] was founded in 1882 with the express intention of investigating phenomena relating to Spiritualism and the afterlife. Its members continue to conduct scientific research on the paranormal to this day. Some of the earliest attempts to apply [[scientific method]]s to the study of phenomena relating to an afterlife were conducted by this organization. Its earliest members included noted scientists like [[William Crookes]], and philosophers such as [[Henry Sidgwick]] and [[William James]].

Parapsychological investigation of the afterlife includes the study of [[haunting]], [[apparitional experience|apparitions]] of the deceased, instrumental trans-communication, [[electronic voice phenomenon|electronic voice phenomena]], and [[mediumship]].&lt;ref&gt;David Fontana (2005): Is there an afterlife. A comprehensive overview of the evidence.&lt;/ref&gt; But also the study of the near death experience. Scientists who have worked in this area include [[Raymond Moody]], [[Susan Blackmore]], [[Charles Tart]], [[William James]], [[Ian Stevenson]], [[Michael Persinger]], [[Pim van Lommel]] and [[Penny Sartori]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profezie3m.altervista.org/archivio/TheLancet_NDE.htm |title=Near-death experience in survivors of cardiac arrest: a prospective study in the Netherlands |publisher=Profezie3m.altervista.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7463606.stm | accessdate = 6 August 2008 | work=BBC News | title=Nurse writes book on near-death | date=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[21 grams experiment|study]] conducted in 1901 by physician [[Duncan MacDougall (doctor)|Duncan MacDougall]] sought to measure the weight lost by a human when the [[soul]] "departed the body" upon death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roach | first = Mary | title = Spook – Science Tackles the Afterlife | publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Co. | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-393-05962-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacDougall weighed dying patients in an attempt to prove that the soul was material, tangible and thus measurable. Although MacDougall's results varied considerably from "21 grams", for some people this figure has become synonymous with the measure of a soul's mass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/religion/soulweight.asp Urban Legends] - Reference Page (Soul man).&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the 2003 movie ''[[21 Grams]]'' is a reference to MacDougall's findings. His results have never been reproduced, and are generally regarded either as meaningless or considered to have had little if any scientific merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=Robert Ezra|title=Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science|page=90|year=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J|isbn=0-691-14597-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Tipler]] has argued that [[physics]] can explain immortality, though such arguments are not [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] and thus do not qualify, in [[Karl Popper]]'s views, as science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tipler | first = Franl, J. | title = The Physics of Immortality – Modern Cosmology, God and the Resurrection of the Dead | publisher = Anchor | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-385-46799-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 25 years of parapsychological research, [[Susan Blackmore]] came to the conclusion that there is no [[empirical evidence]] for an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Chapters/Kurtz.htm |title=Skeptical Odysseys: Personal Accounts by the World's Leading Paranormal Inquirers pp 85–94 |publisher=Susanblackmore.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kurtz | first = Paul | title = Skeptical Odysseys: Personal Accounts by the World's Leading Paranormal Inquirers | publisher = Prometheus Books | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-57392-884-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Modern philosophy===
There is still the position, based on the philosophical question of [[personal identity]], termed [[open individualism]], and in some ways similar to the old belief of [[monopsychism]], that concludes that individual existence is illusory, and our consciousness continues existing after death in other conscious beings. Positions regarding existence after death were supported by some notable physicists such as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[Freeman Dyson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolak | first = Daniel | title = I Am You: The Metaphysical Foundations for Global Ethics | publisher = Springer | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-4020-2999-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain problems arise with the idea of a particular person continuing after death. [[Peter van Inwagen]], in his argument regarding resurrection, notes that the materialist must have some sort of physical continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/Resurrection.doc|title=I Look for the Resurrection of the Dead and the Life of the World to Come |author=Peter van Inwagen |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610012631/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/Resurrection.doc |archivedate=2007-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hick]] also raises some questions regarding personal identity in his book, ''Death and Eternal Life'' using an example of a person ceasing to exist in one place while an exact replica appears in another. If the replica had all the same experiences, traits, and physical appearances of the first person, we would all attribute the same identity to the second, according to Hick.

===Process philosophy===
In the [[panentheistic]] model of [[process philosophy]] and theology the writers [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]] rejected that the universe was made of [[Matter|substance]], instead reality is composed of living experiences (occasions of experience). According to Hartshorne people do not experience subjective (or personal) immortality in the afterlife, but they do have objective immortality because their experiences live on forever in [[God]], who contains all that was. However other process philosophers such as [[David Ray Griffin]] have written that people may have subjective experience after death.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne, Omnipotence and Other Theological Mistakes (Albany: State University of New York, 1984) p.&amp;nbsp;32–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Griffin, "The Possibility of Subjective Immortality in Whitehead's Philosophy," in The Modern Schoolman, LIII, November. 1975, pp.&amp;nbsp;39–51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=3040&amp;C=2598 What Is Process Theology? by Robert B. Mellert] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109062948/http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=3040&amp;C=2598 |date=2013-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2736&amp;C=2480 A Whiteheadian Conception of Immortality by Forrest Wood, Jr.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205005800/http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2736&amp;C=2480 |date=2011-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science==
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}
Regarding the [[mind–body problem]], most neuroscientists take a [[physicalism|physicalist]] position according to which consciousness derives from and/or is reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity occurring in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Schwartz. ''Appendix D: Consciousness and the Neurobiology of the Twenty-First Century''. In Kandel, ER; Schwartz JH; Jessell TM. (2000). ''Principles of Neural Science, 4th Edition''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. [http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1580394,00.html "The Brain: The Mystery of Consciousness"]. Time. Monday, January 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The implication of this premise is that once the brain stops functioning at [[brain death]], consciousness fails to survive and [[eternal oblivion|ceases to exist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bernat JL|date=8 Apr 2006|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68508-5|issue=9517|journal=Lancet|pages=1181–1192|pmid=16616561|title=Chronic disorders of consciousness|volume=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Laureys|Laureys, Steven]]; Tononi, Giulio. (2009). ''The Neurology of Consciousness: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropathology''. Academic Press. p. 20. {{ISBN|978-0-12-374168-4}} "In brain death there is irreversible cessation of all functions of the brain including the brainstem. Consciousness is, therefore, permanently lost in brain death."&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological proposals for the origin of a belief in an afterlife include cognitive disposition, cultural learning, and as an intuitive religious idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pereira|first1=Vera|last2=Faísca|first2=Luís|last3=de Sá-Saraiva|first3=Rodrigo|title=Immortality of the Soul as an Intuitive Idea: Towards a Psychological Explanation of the Origins of Afterlife Beliefs|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|date=1 January 2012|volume=12|issue=1|page=121|doi=10.1163/156853712X633956|url=http://sapientia.ualg.pt/bitstream/10400.1/4894/1/Immortality%20of%20the%20soul%20as%20an%20intuitive%20idea.%20Towards%20a%20psychological%20explanation%20of%20the%20origins%20of%20afterlife%20beliefs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one study, children were able to recognize the ending of physical, mental, and perceptual activity in death, but were hesitant to conclude the ending of will, self, or emotion in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Misailidi|first1=Plousia|last2=Kornilaki|first2=Ekaterina N|title=Development of Afterlife Beliefs in Childhood: Relationship to Parent Beliefs and Testimony|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|date=April 2015|volume=61|issue=2|pages=290–318|issn=0272-930X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amrit Velā''' ({{lang-pa|ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ ਵੇਲਾ}}) (Time of [[Amrita|Amrit]]) refers to the early morning period of time sometime between 3:00am and 6:00am&lt;ref name="McLeod"&gt;{{cite book|last=McLeod|first=W. H.|title=The A to Z of Sikhism|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810863446|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; or before the [[dawn]]ing of the morning sun&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Dharma|title=Meditation As Medicine: Activate the Power of Your Natural Healing Force|date=2011|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=9781439117538|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is used for daily [[meditation]] and recitation of [[Gurbani]] hymns. [[Guru Nanak]] in the [[Japji Sahib]] (4th Pauri) says, "In amrit velā meditate on the grandeur of the one true Name."&lt;ref name="McLeod" /&gt; The importance of Amrit Vela is found throughout the [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. The Guru Granth Sahib states that "those who consider themselves a Sikh must wake up daily at Amrit vela and be in tune with the [[Nam japna|''Naam'']] (the Lord's Name)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Guru Granth Sahib|page=Ang 305|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=305&amp;g=1&amp;h=1&amp;r=1&amp;t=1&amp;p=0&amp;k=0&amp;fb=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sikh Rehat Maryada]] it is written to arise Amrit Velā, bath, and meditate on the divine ''Naam'' (through [[Simran]] and [[Nam Japo|Naam Japna]]). Sikhs recite their morning ''[[Nitnem]]'' during Amrit vela. Traditionally after ''Nitnem'' Sikhs meet with the [[Sangat (term)|Sangat]] (congregation) to recite [[Asa di Var]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duggal|first=Kartar|title=The Prescribed Sikh Prayers (Nitnem)|date=1980|publisher=Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788170173779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ancient Semitic religion''' encompasses the [[polytheistic]] religions of the [[Semitic people]]s from the [[ancient Near East]] and [[Northeast Africa]]. Since the term ''Semitic'' itself represents a rough category when referring to cultures, as opposed to languages, the definitive bounds of the term "ancient Semitic religion" are only approximate.

Semitic traditions and their [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noll|first=K. L.|authorlink=K. L.

[...] Other gods were subordinate to, and partners with, the divine patron, just as the human aristocracy and commoners were expected to be subordinate to, and supportive of, the human king. The pantheon was usually quite complex, often including hundreds or even thousands of gods.}}&lt;/ref&gt; fall into regional categories: [[Canaanite religion]]s of the [[Levant]], the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian tradition]]–inspired [[Assyro-Babylonian religion]] of [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Ancient Hebrew religion]] of the 
[[Israelites]], and [[Arabian polytheism]]. Semitic [[polytheism]] possibly transitioned into [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] [[monotheism]] by way of the god [[El (deity)|El]], whose name "El" is a word for "god" in Hebrew, [[cognate]] to Arabic [[Allah]].

==Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia==

{{Further|Babylonian religion|Enûma Eliš|Marduk|Epic of Gilgamesh|Ashur (god)}}

When the five planets were identified, they were associated with the sun and moon and connected with the chief gods of the Babylonian pantheon. A bilingual list in the British Museum arranges the sevenfold planetary group in the following order:&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] (the [[Moon]])
* [[Shamash]] (the [[Sun]])
* [[Marduk]] ([[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]])
*  [[Ishtar]] ([[Venus (planet)|Venus]])
* [[Ninurta]] ([[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]])
* [[Nabu]] ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]])
* [[Nergal]] ([[Mars (planet)|Mars]])

The religion of the [[Assyrian Empire]] (sometimes called [[Ashurism]]) centered on [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], [[patron deity]] of the city of [[Assur]], and [[Ishtar]], patroness of [[Nineveh]]. The last positively recorded worship of Ashur and other Assyrian gods dates back to the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aina.org/aol/peter/brief.htm#Religion | title=Brief History of Assyrians | publisher= AINA Assyrian International News Agency | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Simo |last=Parpola |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Assyrians after Assyria |url=http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html |work=Assyriologist |publisher=Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, Vol.  XIII No. 2, |id= |pages= |page= |year=1999 |accessdate= |quote= The gods Ashur, Sherua, Ishtar, Nanaya, Bel, Nabu and Nergal continued to be worshiped in Assur at least until the early 3rd century AD; the local cultic calendar was that of the imperial period; the temple of Ashur was restored in the 2nd century AD; and the stelae of the local rulers resemble those of Assyrian kings in the imperial period.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashur, the patron deity of the eponymous capital from the Late Bronze Age, was in constant rivalry with the patron deity of [[Babylon]], [[Marduk]]. In Assyria, Ashur eventually superseded Marduk, even becoming the husband of Ishtar.

The major Assyro-Babylonian and Akkadian gods were:

==Canaan==
{{Main|Ancient Canaanite religion}}
{{Further|Torah|Origins of Judaism}}
The Canaanite religion was practiced by people living in the ancient [[Levant]] throughout the [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]]. Until the excavation (1928 onwards) of the city of [[Ugarit|Ras Shamra]] (also known as Ugarit) in Northern [[Syria]] and the discovery of its Bronze Age archive of clay tablet [[alphabet]]ic [[cuneiform]] texts,&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John, "The Legacy of Canaan the Ras Shamra Texts and Their Relevance to the Old Testament", No. 5. ''Brill Archive'', 1957; for a more recent discussion see Yon, Marguerite, ''The City of Ugarit at Tell Ras Shamra'', Eisenbrauns, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; scholars knew little about Canaanite religious practice. [[Papyrus]] seems to have been the preferred writing material for [[scribe]]s at the time. Unlike the papyrus documents found in Egypt, ancient papyri in the Levant have often simply decayed from exposure to the humid [[Mediterranean climate]]. As a result, the accounts in the [[Bible]] became the primary sources of information on ancient Canaanite religion. Supplementing the Biblical accounts, several secondary and tertiary Greek sources have survived, including [[Lucian of Samosata]]'s treatise ''[[De Dea Syria]]'' (The Syrian Goddess, 2nd century CE), fragments of the ''Phoenician History'' of [[Sanchuniathon]] as preserved by [[Philo of Byblos]] (c. 64 – 141 CE), and the writings of [[Damascius]] ({{circa}} 458 – after 538). Recent study of the Ugaritic material has uncovered additional information about the religion,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Mark S., ''The origins of biblical monotheism: Israel's polytheistic background and the Ugaritic texts'', Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; supplemented by inscriptions from the Levant and [[Ebla|Tel Mardikh]] archive&lt;ref&gt;J. Pons, Review of G. Pettinato, A. Alberti, Catalogo dei testi cuneiformi di Tell Mardikh - Ebla, MEE I, Napoli, 1979, in  Études théologiques et religieuses 56 (1981) 339—341.&lt;/ref&gt; (excavated in the early 1960s).

The Canaanite religion shows the clear influence of [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] religious practices.{{cn|date=June 2017}} Like other peoples of the ancient Near East, the Canaanites were [[polytheistic]], with families typically focusing worship on ancestral [[Household deity|household gods and goddesses]] while acknowledging the existence of other [[deities]] such as [[Baal]], [[Anath]], and [[El (god)|El]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica|date= 2014-04-17

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2017}}
Kings also played an important religious role and in certain ceremonies, such as the [[hieros gamos|sacred marriage]] of the [[New Year Festival]]; Canaanites may have revered their kings as gods.

According to the pantheon, known in Ugarit as 'ilhm ([[Elohim]]) or the children of El (compare the Biblical "[[sons of God]]"), {{Clarify|text=the creator,|date=May 2016}} called El, fathered the other deities. In the Greek sources he was married to Beruth ([[Beirut]], the city). The pantheon was supposedly obtained by [[Philo of Byblos]] from [[Sanchuniathon]] of Berythus ([[Beirut]]). The marriage of the deity with the city seems to have Biblical parallels with the stories that link [[Melkart]] with [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]] with [[Jerusalem]], and [[Tanit]] and [[Baal Hammon]] with [[Carthage]]. El Elyon is mentioned (as ''God Most High'') in Genesis 14.18–19 as the God whose priest was [[Melchizedek]], king of Salem. &lt;!-- "Psalm 78.35 confirms the fact that the Elohim were considered the family of El Elyon". The quoted text has been removed{{by whom?}} because it is not true --&gt;

Philo states that the union of El Elyon and his consort resulted in the birth of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Ge]] (Greek names for ''Heaven'' and ''Earth''). This closely parallels the opening verse of the Hebrew Bible, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:1—"In the beginning God ([[Elohim]]) created the [[Heaven]]s (''[[Shemayim]]'') and the Earth" (''Eretz''). It also parallels the story of the Babylonian [[Anunaki]] gods.

==Abrahamic religions==
{{Further|Panbabylonism}}
The ''[[Enuma Elish]]'' has been compared to the [[Genesis creation narrative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crivoice.org/enumaelish.html |title=The Enuma Elish: The Babylonian Creation Myth |publisher=Crivoice.org |date=2011-11-11 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stenudd.com/myth/enumaelish/enumaelish-4.htm |title=ENUMA ELISH - Babylonian Creation Myth - Theories |publisher=Stenudd.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122033206/http://stenudd.com/myth/enumaelish/enumaelish-4.htm |archivedate=22 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharpes, Donald K. 'Lords of the scrolls: literary traditions in the Bible and Gospels'. Peter Lang, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8204-7849-0}}, 978-0-8204-7849-4&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers trace the story of [[Esther]] to Babylonian roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunkel|first=Hermanh|title=Creation and Chaos in the Primeval Era and the Eschaton: Religio-Historical Study of Genesis 1 and Revelation 12|year=2006|publisher=[[William B.

[[El Elyon]] also appears in Balaam's story in Numbers and in Moses song in Deuteronomy 32.8. The [[Masoretic Text]]s suggest:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the Most High ('Elyōn) divided to the nations their inheritance, he separated the sons of man (Ādām); he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the sons of Israel.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rather than "sons of [[Israel]]", the [[Septuagint]], the Greek Old Testament, {{Clarify|text=suggests the angelōn theou,|date=May 2016}} or "angels of God", and a few versions even have ''huiōn theou'' ([[sons of God]]). The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] version of this suggests that there were in fact 70 sons of the Most High God sent to rule over the 70 nations of the Earth. This idea of the 70 nations of Earth, each ruled over by one of the Elohim (sons of God), is also found in Ugaritic texts. The [[Arslan Tash]] inscription suggests that each of the 70 sons of El Elyon was bound to their people by a covenant. Thus, Crossan{{Who|date=May 2016}} translates:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The Eternal One ('Olam) has made a covenant oath with us,
Asherah has made (a pact) with us.
And all the sons of El,
And the great council of all the Holy Ones ([[Qetesh|Qedesh]]).
With oaths of Heaven and Ancient Earth.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Arvind Sharma''' is the Birks Professor of Comparative Religion at [[McGill University]]. Sharma's works focus on [[comparative religion]], [[Hinduism]], [[philosophy of religion]] and the role of women in religion. Some of his more widely read works include ''Our Religions'' and ''Women in World Religions'', which were edited by him. ''Feminism in World Religions'' was selected as a [[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]] Outstanding Academic Book (1999).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.students.emory.edu/HSC/sharma.html Dr. Arvind Sharma], Emory University Hindu Students Council, retrieved 2015-04-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography== 
Arvind Sharma was born on the 13th of January 1940 in [[Varanasi]], [[India]] . Raised in a family that traditionally worked in the [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS), he followed suit and joined the IAS in 1962 after a distinguished academic career. 

He served in the State of Gujarat until 1968, when he moved to the United States to pursue higher studies in economics at the [[University of Syracuse]], obtaining a Masters in economics in 1970.  While pursuing the role of non-economic factors in economic development he became interested in religion and joined Harvard Divinity School in 1972.  After obtaining a Masters in Theological Studies, concentrating on comparative religion, he earned his PhD from the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies in 1978.  His doctorate work involved the first ever translation in English of Abhinavagupta's commentary on the Bhagavad Gita.

While at Harvard he was recruited in 1976 by the newly founded Department of Studies in Religion at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. In 1980 he moved to the University of Sydney, from where he was hired by McGill University in Canada in 1987.  In 1994 he was appointed the Birks Professor of Comparative Religion at McGill University, where he continues to teach as of 2018.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9049">'''Astrolatry''' is the worship of [[stars]] and other  [[heavenly body|heavenly bodies]] as [[deity|deities]], or the association of deities with heavenly bodies.
The most common instances of this are [[sun god]]s and [[moon god]]s in polytheistic systems worldwide. Also notable is the association of the [[planet]]s with deities in [[Babylonian religion|Babylonian]], and hence in Greco-Roman religion, viz. [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]].

The term '''astro-theology''' is used in the context of 18th- to 19th-century scholarship aiming at the discovery of the [[Urreligion|original religion]], particularly [[Urmonotheismus|primitive monotheism]]. Unlike ''astrolatry'', which usually implies [[polytheism]], frowned upon as [[idolatry|idolatrous]] by Christian authors since [[Eusebius]], astrotheology is any "religious system founded upon the observation of the heavens",&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'', citing Derham (1714) as the first attestation of the term.&lt;/ref&gt;   and in particular, may be [[monotheism|monotheistic]]. Gods, goddesses, and demons may also be considered personifications of astronomical phenomena such as lunar eclipses, planetary alignments, and apparent interactions of planetary bodies with stars. '''Astro-theology''' is used by Jan Irvin, [[Jordan Maxwell]] and Andrew Rutajit (2006) in reference to "the earliest known forms of religion and nature worship", advocating the [[entheogen]] theory of the [[origin of religion]].

==Etymology==
''Astrolatry'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἄστρον ''astron'', "star" and the suffix -λάτρης, itself related to [[wikt:λάτρις|λάτρις]] ''latris'', "worshipper" or λατρεύειν ''latreuein'', "to worship" from λάτρον ''latron'', "payment".

==History==
[[Babylonian astronomy]] from early times associates stars with deities, but the [[heaven]]s as the residence of an anthropomorphic pantheon, and later of monotheistic [[God]] and his retinue of angels, is a later development, gradually replacing the notion of the pantheon residing or convening on the summit of high mountains. Sayce (1913) argues a parallelism of the "stellar theology" of Babylon and Egypt, both countries absorbing popular star-worship into the official pantheon of their respective state religions by identification of gods with stars or planets.&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Henry Sayce, The religion of ancient Egypt, Adamant Media Corporation, 1913, 237f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrolatry does not appear to have been common in the [[Levant]] prior to the [[Iron Age]], and becomes popular under [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] influence.
The [[Sabaeans]] were notorious for their astrolatry, for which reason the practice is also known as "Sabaism" or "Sabaeanism".
Similarly, the [[Chaldea]]ns came to be seen as the prototypical astrologers and star-worshippers by the Greeks.

The term ''astro-theology'' appears in the title of a 1714 work by [[William Derham]],  ''Astro-theology: or, A demonstration of the being and attributes of God, from a survey of the heavens'' based on the author's observations by means of "Mr. [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]]' Glass". Derham thought that the stars were openings in the [[firmament]] through which he thought he saw the [[Empyrean]] beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Crowe, ''Modern theories of the universe: from Herschel to Hubble'', Courier Dover Publications, 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-486-27880-3}}, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1783 issue of ''The New Christian's magazine'' had an essay entitled ''Astro-theology'' which argued the "demonstration of sacred truths" from "a survey of heavenly bodies" in the sense of the [[watchmaker analogy]]. [[Edward Higginson]] (1855) argues a compatibility of "Jewish Astro-theology" of the [[Hebrew Bible]], which places God and his angelic hosts in the heavens, with a "Scientific Astro-theology" based on observation of the cosmos.

[[Manly P Hall]] (1901–1990), mystic and a [[33rd degree]] mason, taught that each of the  three Abrahamic faiths has a planet that governs that religion. Judaism is Saturn: the symbol of Judaism is a hexagram symbol of Saturn, and the day of worship is on Saturday, day of Saturn. Christianity is the Sun: the symbol of Christianity is the cross symbol of the Sun, and the day of worship is Sunday, day of the Sun. Islam is Venus: the symbol of Islam is the star and  crescent (the star commonly thought to represent Venus), and the day of worship is on Friday.

==Prohibition in Abrahamic religions==
The [[Hebrew Bible]] contains repeated reference to astrolatry. Thus, Deuteronomy 4:19, 17:3 contains a stern warning against worshipping the sun, moon, stars or any of the [[heavenly host]]. Relapse into worshipping the host of heaven, i.e. the stars, is said to have been the cause of the fall of the [[kingdom of Judah]] in II Kings 17:16. King [[Josiah]] in 621 BC is recorded as having abolished all kinds of [[idolatry]] in Judah, but astrolatry was continued in private (Zeph. 1:5; Jer. 8:2, 19:13). [[Ezekiel]] (8:16) describes sun-worship practiced in the court of the temple of Jerusalem, and Jeremiah (44:17) claims that even after the destruction of the temple, women in particular insisted on continuing their worship of the "queen of heaven".

[[Augustine of Hippo]] criticized sun- and star-worship in ''De Vera Religione''  (37.68) and  ''De civitate Dei'' (5.1–8). Pope [[Leo the Great]] also denounced astrolatry, and the cult of ''[[Sol Invictus]]'', which he contrasted with the Christian nativity.

Despite such prohibitions, [[Dorothy M. Murdock]], a proponent of the study,&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Casey Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths? T&amp;T Clark 2014 p21-22&lt;/ref&gt; has released books on the subject and teaches the connections between the solar allegory and the life of Christ. She also goes beyond the astronomical comparisons and postulates ties between the origins of many of the early Abrahamic religions to ancient mythologies of that in Egypt, Rome, and Greece.

The [[Qur'an]] contains strong prohibitions against astrolatry.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Strong prohibition of Astrolatry is mentioned in the Quran through Prophet Abrahim observation of celestial bodies whose worship was common in Babylonian religion of that time.

Below is the reference from Al-Quran, Surah Anaam, chapter 6, verses 75–80
 
75. Thus did we show Ibrahim (Abraham) the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he be one of those who have Faith with certainty.

76. When the night covered him over with darkness he saw a star. He said: "This is my lord." But when it set, he said: "I like not those that set."

77. When he saw the moon rising up, he said: "This is my lord." But when it set, he said: "Unless my Lord guides me, I shall surely be among the erring people."

78. When he saw the sun rising up, he said: "This is my lord. This is greater." But when it set, he said: "O my people! I am indeed free from all that you join as partners in worship with Allah.

79. Verily, I have turned my face towards Him Who has created the heavens and the earth Hanifa (Islamic Monotheism, i.e. worshipping none but Allah Alone) and I am not of Al-Mushrikun (see V.2:105)".

80. His people disputed with him. He said: "Do you dispute with me concerning Allah while He has guided me, and I fear not those whom you associate with Allah in worship. (Nothing can happen to me) except when my Lord (Allah) wills something. My Lord comprehends in His Knowledge all things. Will you not then remember?

Al-Quran, Surah Anaam (chapter 6, verse 75–80)

[[Image:Catrina-sculpture.jpg|right|thumb|A ''calaca'' of [[La Calavera Catrina]].]]
A '''calaca''' ({{IPA-es|kaˈlaka}}, a colloquial [[Mexican Spanish]] name for [[skeleton]]) is a figure of a [[human skull|skull]] or [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]] (usually human) commonly used for decoration during the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Day of the Dead]] festival, although they are made all year round.

==Description==
Tracing their origins from [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] imagery, calacas are frequently shown with [[Tagetes|marigold]] flowers and foliage. As with other aspects of the Day of the Dead festival, calacas are generally depicted as joyous rather than mournful figures. They are often shown wearing festive clothing, dancing, and playing musical instruments to indicate a happy afterlife. This draws on the Mexican belief that no dead soul likes to be thought of sadly, and that death should be a joyous occasion. This goes back to Aztec beliefs, one of the few traditions to remain after the Spanish conquest.

Calacas used in the festival include carved skull masks worn by revelers, small figures made out of carved wood or fired clay, and sweet treats in the form of [[human skull|skull]]s or skeletons. Calacas are sometimes made of wood, stone, or even candy.

A popular phrase among Mexicans and those Latinos that personally know someone is "se lo (la) llevó la calaca" after someone has died, literally meaning "the calaca took him (her)" or "death took him (her)".

In Guatemala, "calaca" is understood as "death". The figure of a bare skeleton represents death and implies fear of death.  Thus, it is not normally utilized as a joyful image.

==Popular culture==
Calaca-like figures can be seen in the [[Tim Burton]] films ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and ''[[Corpse Bride]]'', Neil Gaiman's movie ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'', the PlayStation 3 games ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' (2008) and ''[[Guacamelee!]]'' (2013), and the 1998 [[Tim Schafer]] computer game ''[[Grim Fandango]].''

Calacas are prominently featured as representations of the deceased in ''[[The Book of Life (2014 film)|The Book of Life]]''.

In ''[[Monster High]]'', Skelita Calaveras is a calaca and is the daughter of Los Esklitos (The Skeletons).

In ''[[El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera]]'', the villain Sartana of the Dead is a calaca and commands various calacas that are in her service.

The Calacas are featured in ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]''.

'''Deconsecration''' is the act of removing a religious blessing from something that had been previously [[consecration|consecrated]] by a minister or priest of that religion. The practice is usually performed on churches to be rendered to non-religious ([[secular]]) use or demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1876/11/03/archives/deconsecration-of-a-london-church.html |title=Deconsecration of a London Church |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 3, 1876 |author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dialogue Between a Priest and a Dying Man''''' (original French: ''Dialogue entre un prêtre et un moribond'') is a dialogue written by the [[Marquis de Sade]] while incarcerated at the [[Château de Vincennes]] in 1782. It is one of the earliest known written works from de Sade to be dated with certainty, and was first published in 1926 together with an edition of ''[[Historiettes, Contes et Fabliaux]]'' (written originally in 1788). It was subsequently published in English in 1927 by [[Pascal Covici]] in a limited, hand-numbered edition of 650 copies.

==Plot==
The work expresses the author's [[atheism]] by having a dying man (a [[libertine]]) tell a priest about what he views as the mistakes of a [[pious]] life.

According to John Phillips, Emeritus Professor of French Literature and Culture at London Metropolitan University:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Of all the direct expressions of atheism in Sade's work, the ''Dialogue''... is probably the most incisive and, at the same time, the most artistically satisfying... The influence of Sade's Jesuit training in rhetorical debate is the mainspring of this brilliant dramatic essay, which, as the title suggests, is not so much theatre as philosophical dialogue. But what makes the work charming as well as persuasive is the impish humour that lies behind its characters and situation.&lt;ref name=phillips2005&gt;Phillips, John (2005). ''The Marquis de Sade: a very short introduction.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp.37-38. {{ISBN|0-19-280469-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Steven Barbone, of [[San Diego State University]] notes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We can postulate one of two things: Sade was entirely pleased with this manuscript and saw no reason to make any changes to it or Sade completely gave up on the dialogue and had decided to abandon it. The reason for either of these hypotheses is that the manuscript itself contains almost no trace of Sade’s editing. It is up to the reader to divine whether the “Dialogue between the Priest and a Dying Man” is Sade’s position or not. Either way, it is worth reading even in the very unlikely event that it presents a position Sade would have repudiated. (This may be the case: near the beginning  of  October  1788,  Sade  himself  made  a  catalogue  of  his works, and the “Dialogue” is omitted.)  &lt;ref name=barbone2000&gt;de Sade, Donatien-Alphonse-François.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Publication history==

Sade completed the notebook which contains the Dialogue on 12 July 1782, while imprisoned at [[Château de Vincennes]].&lt;ref name=seaverwainhouse /&gt; He took the manuscript with him when he was transferred to the [[Bastille]] in 1784.&lt;ref name=barbone2000 /&gt;{{rp|343}}

Following the [[Storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July [[1789]], Sade's prison writings disappeared (Sade had been moved to [[Charenton (asylum)|Charenton]] on 4 July), the manuscript of the Dialogue among them. However, it survived in private collections and was sold on at auction a number of times during the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=seaverwainhouse /&gt; On 6 November 1920 it was bought by [[Maurice Heine]] at an auction at the [[Hôtel Drouot]], [[Paris]], and he oversaw its publication in France for the first time in 1926 &lt;ref name=heine&gt;de Sade, Donatien-Alphonse-François, Marquis. ''Dialogue entre un prêtre et un moribond, par Donatien-Alphonse-François, marquis de Sade, publié, pour la première fois, sur le manuscrit autographe inédit, avec un avant-propos et des notes, par Maurice Heine.'' Paris, Société générale d'imprimerie et d'édition (71, rue de Rennes; Stendhal et Cie), 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; in a limited edition of 500 copies for which he wrote an introduction.&lt;ref name=seaverwainhouse /&gt;

===English translations===

The first English translation was published in the United States by [[Pascal Covici]] in 1927, again in a limited edition of 650 numbered copies.&lt;ref name=walter2001note /&gt; The translator was [[Samuel Putnam]].  This edition was based on the first French edition and included a translation of Heine's introduction.&lt;ref name=putnam&gt;de Sade, Marquis. ''Dialogue between a Priest and a Dying Man.''

==Legacy==
The dialogue inspired a similar scene in [[Luis Buñuel]]'s film ''[[Nazarín]]'' (1959), wherein a dying woman wards off a priest while on her deathbed. Buñuel had previously adapted ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]'' into a scene in his earlier ''[[L'Age d'Or]]'' (1930) and would go on to feature the Marquis himself as a character in ''[[The Milky Way (1969 film)|La Voie Lactée]]'' (1969).

{{Other uses|Dualism (disambiguation)}}
{{God}}
'''Dualism in cosmology''' is the moral or spiritual belief that two fundamental concepts exist, which often oppose each other. It is an umbrella term that covers a diversity of views from various religions, including both traditional religions and scriptural religions.

Moral dualism is the belief of the great complement of, or conflict between, the benevolent and the malevolent. It simply implies that there are two moral opposites at work, independent of any interpretation of what might be "moral" and independent of how these may be represented. Moral opposites might, for example, exist in a worldview which has one god, more than one god, or none. By contrast, duotheism, bitheism or ditheism implies (at least) two gods. While bitheism implies harmony, ditheism implies rivalry and opposition, such as between good and evil, or light and dark, or summer and winter. For example, a ditheistic system could be one in which one god is a creator, and the other a destroyer. In [[theology]], dualism can also refer to the relationship between God and creation or God and the universe (see theistic dualism). This form of dualism is a belief shared in certain traditions of [[Christianity]] and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt; Alternatively, in ontological dualism, the world is divided into two overarching categories. The opposition and combination of the universe's two basic principles of [[yin and yang]] is a large part of Chinese philosophy, and is an important feature of [[Taoism]]. It is also discussed in [[Confucianism]].

Many [[Mythology|myths]] and creation [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] with dualistic cosmologies have been described in [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] and [[Cultural anthropology|anthropological]] literature. These motifs conceive the world as being created, organized, or influenced by two [[demiurge]]s, [[culture hero]]es, or other mythological beings, who either compete with each other or have a complementary function in creating, arranging or influencing the world. There is a huge diversity of such cosmologies. In some cases, such as among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]], the beings collaborate rather than competing, and contribute to the creation in a coequal way. In many other instances the two beings are not of the same importance or power (sometimes, one of them is even characterized as gullible). Sometimes they can be contrasted as good versus evil.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 42&lt;/ref&gt; They may be often [[Twin (mythology)|believed to be twins]] or at least brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966: 71, 181&lt;/ref&gt; Dualistic motifs in mythologies can be observed in all inhabited continents. Zolotaryov concludes that they cannot be explained by [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]] or borrowing, but are rather of convergent origin: they are related to a dualistic organization of society ([[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moieties]]); in some cultures, this social organization may have ceased to exist, but mythology preserves the memory in more and more disguised ways.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral dualism==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Moral dualism is the belief of the great complement or conflict between the benevolent and the malevolent. Like ditheism/bitheism (see below), moral dualism does not imply the absence of [[Monism|monist]] or [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] principles. Moral dualism simply implies that there are two moral opposites at work, independent of any interpretation of what might be "moral" and—unlike ditheism/bitheism—independent of how these may be represented.

For example, Mazdaism (Mazdean [[Zoroastrianism]]) is both dualistic and monotheistic (but not monist by definition) since in that philosophy God—the Creator—is purely good, and the [[antithesis]]&lt;!-- Mazdaism's core tenet is truth/[[asha]] vs falsehood. --&gt;—which is also uncreated–is an absolute one. [[Zurvanism]] (Zurvanite Zoroastrianism), [[Manichaeism]], and [[Mandaeism]] are representative of dualistic ''and'' [[monism|monist]] philosophies since each has a supreme and transcendental First Principle from which the two equal-but-opposite entities then emanate. This is also true for the lesser-known Christian [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] religions, such as [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], [[Catharism]], and so on. More complex forms of monist dualism also exist, for instance in [[Hermeticism]], where ''[[Nous]]'' "thought"—that is described to have created man—brings forth both good and evil, dependent on interpretation, whether it receives prompting from the God or from the Demon. Duality with [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] is considered a logical fallacy.

===History===
Moral dualism began as a theological belief. Dualism was first seen implicitly in Egyptian religious beliefs by the contrast of the gods [[Set (deity)|Set]] (disorder, death) and [[Osiris]] (order, life).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/172631/dualism/38186/Egypt-and-Mesopotamia "Egypt and Mesopotamia"]&lt;/ref&gt; The first explicit conception of dualism came from the Ancient Persian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]] around the mid-fifth century BC. Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion that believes that [[Ahura Mazda]] is the eternal creator of all good things. Any violations of Ahura Mazda's order arise from ''[[druj]]'', which is everything uncreated. From this comes a significant choice for humans to make. Either they fully participate in human life for Ahura Mazda or they do not and give ''druj'' power. Personal dualism is even more distinct in the [[good and evil|beliefs]] of later religions.

The religious dualism of [[Christianity]] between good and evil is not a perfect dualism as God (good) will inevitably destroy [[Satan]] (evil). Early Christian dualism is largely based on Platonic Dualism (See: [[Neoplatonism and Christianity]]). There is also a personal dualism in Christianity with a soul-body distinction based on the idea of an immaterial Christian [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Knight | first = Kevin | title = Soul | encyclopedia = Catholic Encyclopedia | edition = Online | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm | accessdate = 13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duotheism, bitheism, ditheism==
When used with regards to multiple gods, ''dualism'' may refer to duotheism, bitheism, or ditheism. Although ditheism/bitheism imply moral dualism, they are not equivalent: ditheism/bitheism implies (at least) two gods, while moral dualism does not necessarily imply ''[[theism]]'' ([[god (word)|theos = god]]) at all.

Both bitheism and ditheism imply a belief in two equally powerful gods with complementary or antonymous properties; however, while bitheism implies harmony, ditheism implies rivalry and opposition, such as between good and evil, bright and dark, or summer and winter. For example, a ditheistic system would be one in which one god is creative, the other is destructive (cf. [[theodicy]]). In the original conception of [[Zoroastrianism]], for example, [[Ahura Mazda]] was the spirit of ultimate good, while Ahriman ([[Angra Mainyu]]) was the spirit of ultimate evil.

In a bitheistic system, by contrast, where the two deities are not in conflict or opposition, one could be male and the other female (cf. duotheism{{clarify|reason=where would one go to [[Cf.|confer]]?|date=December 2016}}). One well-known example of a bitheistic or duotheistic theology based on gender polarity is found in the [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]]. In Wicca, dualism is represented in the belief of a god and a goddess as a dual partnership in ruling the universe. This is centered on the worship of a [[Wiccan views of divinity|divine couple]], the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Moon Goddess]] and the [[Horned God]], who are regarded as lovers. However, there is also a ditheistic theme within traditional Wicca, as the Horned God has dual aspects of bright and dark - relating to day/night, summer/winter - expressed as the Oak King and the Holly King, who in Wiccan myth and ritual are said to engage in battle twice a year for the hand of the Goddess, resulting in the changing seasons. (Within Wicca, bright and dark do not correspond to notions of "good" and "evil" but are aspects of the natural world, much like [[yin and yang]] in [[Taoism]].)

===Radical and mitigated dualism===
* '''Radical Dualism''' – or absolute Dualism which posits two co-equal divine forces. [[Manichaeism]] conceives of two previously coexistent realms of light and darkness which become embroiled in conflict, owing to the chaotic actions of the latter. Subsequently, certain elements of the light became entrapped within darkness; the purpose of material creation is to enact the slow process of extraction of these individual elements, at the end of which the kingdom of light will prevail over darkness. Manicheanism likely inherits this dualistic mythology from [[Zoroastrianism]], in which the eternal spirit [[Ahura Mazda]] is opposed by his antithesis, [[Angra Mainyu]]; the two are engaged in a cosmic struggle, the conclusion of which will likewise see Ahura Mazda triumphant. '[[The Hymn of the Pearl]]' included the belief that the material world corresponds to some sort of malevolent intoxication brought about by the powers of darkness to keep elements of the light trapped inside it in a state of drunken distraction.
* '''Mitigated Dualism''' – is where one of the two principles is in some way inferior to the other. Such classical Gnostic movements as the Sethians conceived of the material world as being created by a lesser divinity than the true God that was the object of their devotion. The spiritual world is conceived of as being radically different from the material world, co-extensive with the true God, and the true home of certain enlightened members of humanity; thus, these systems were expressive of a feeling of acute alienation within the world, and their resultant aim was to allow the soul to escape the constraints presented by the physical realm.

However, bitheistic and ditheistic principles are not always so easily contrastable, for instance in a system where one god is the representative of summer and drought and the other of winter and rain/fertility (cf. the mythology of [[Persephone]]). [[Marcionism]], an early Christian sect, held that the Old and New Testaments were the work of two opposing gods: both were First Principles, but of different religions.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Riparelli, ''Il volto del Cristo dualista. Da Marcione ai catari'', Peter Lang, Bern - Berlin - Bruxelles - Frankfurt am Main - New York - Oxford - Wien 2008, 368 pp.  {{ISBN|978-3-03911-490-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theistic dualism ==
In theology, dualism can refer to the relationship between God and creation or God and the universe. This form of dualism is a belief shared in certain traditions of Christianity and Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt;

===In Christianity===
[[Image:Cathars expelled.JPG|thumb|right|The Cathars being expelled from [[Carcassonne]] in 1209. The Cathars were denounced as heretics by the Roman Catholic Church for their dualist beliefs.]]
The dualism between God and Creation has existed as a central belief in multiple historical sects and traditions of Christianity, including [[Marcionism]], [[Catharism]], [[Paulicianism]], and [[Gnosticism|Gnostic Christianity]]. Christian dualism refers to the belief that God and creation are distinct, but interrelated through an indivisible bond.&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt; In sects like the Cathars and the Paulicians, this is a dualism between the material world, created by an evil god, and a moral god. Historians divide Christian dualism into absolute dualism, which held that the good and evil gods were equally powerful, and mitigated dualism, which held that material evil was subordinate to the spiritual good.&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=Edward|title=Heresy and Authority in Medieval Europe|year=2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0680-7|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief, by Christian theologians who adhere to a libertarian or compatibilist view of free will, that [[Free will in theology|free will]] separates humankind from God has also been characterized as a form of dualism.&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt; The theologian Leroy Stephens Rouner compares the dualism of Christianity with the dualism that exists in Zoroastrianism and the [[Samkhya]] tradition of Hinduism. The theological use of the word dualism dates back to 1700, in a book that describes the dualism between good and evil.&lt;ref name="Rouner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rouner|first=Leroy|title=The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology|year=1983|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22748-7|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tolerance of dualism ranges widely among the different Christian traditions. As a monotheistic religion, the conflict between dualism and monism has existed in Christianity since its inception.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Jeffrey|title=A History of Heaven: The Singing Silence|year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00684-0|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1912 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' describes that, in the Catholic Church, "the dualistic hypothesis of an eternal world existing side by side with God was of course rejected" by the thirteenth century, but [[mind–body dualism]] was not.&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church|year=1912|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[problem of evil]] is difficult to reconcile with absolute monism, and has prompted some Christian sects to veer towards dualism. Gnostic forms of Christianity were more dualistic, and some Gnostic traditions posited that the Devil was separate from God as an independent deity.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; The Christian dualists of the Byzantine Empire, the [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]], were seen as Manichean heretics by Byzantine theologians. This tradition of Christian dualism, founded by [[Constantine-Silvanus]], argued that the universe was created through evil and separate from a moral God.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamilton|first1=Janet |last2=Hamilton|first2=Bernard |last3=Stoyanov|first3=Yuri |title=Christian Dualist Heresies in the Byzantine World, C. 650-c. 1450: Selected Sources|year=1998|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4765-7|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catharism|Cathars]], a Christian sect in southern France, believed that there was a dualism between two gods, one representing good and the other representing evil. The Roman Catholic Church denounced the Cathars as heretics, and sought to crush the movement in the 13th century. The [[Albigensian Crusade]] was initiated by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1208 to remove the Cathars from [[Languedoc]] in France, where they were known as Albigesians. The [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]], which began in 1233 under [[Pope Gregory IX]], also targeted the Cathars.&lt;ref name="Chidester"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chidester|first=David|title=Christianity: A Global History|year=2001|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-251770-8|pages=266–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gnosticism====
[[Gnosticism]] is a diverse, [[syncretistic]] [[religious movement]] consisting of various [[belief systems]] generally united in the teaching that humans are divine [[soul]]s trapped in a [[Nature|material world]] created by an imperfect god, the [[demiurge]], who is frequently identified with the [[Abrahamic]] [[God]]. The demiurge may be depicted as an embodiment of evil, or in other instances as merely imperfect and as benevolent as its inadequacy permits. This demiurge exists alongside another remote and unknowable [[God|supreme being]] that embodies good.

[[Bogomils]], [[Paulicianism|Paulicans]] and [[Cathar]]s are typically seen as being imitative of Gnosticism. Whether or not the Cathari possessed direct historical influence from ancient Gnosticism is a matter of dispute. The basic conceptions of Gnostic cosmology are, however, to be found in Cathar beliefs (most distinctly in their notion of a lesser creator god). Unlike the second century Gnostics, they did not apparently place any special relevance upon knowledge (''gnosis'') as an effective [[Salvation|salvific]] force.

===In Hinduism===
The [[Dvaita Vedanta]] school of [[Indian philosophy]] espouses a dualism between God and the universe by theorizing the existence of two separate [[realities]]. The first and the more important reality is that of [[Shiva]] or [[Shakti]] or [[Vishnu]] or [[Brahman]]. Shiva or Shakti or Vishnu is the supreme [[Self]], God, the absolute truth of the universe, the independent reality. The second reality is that of dependent but equally real universe that exists with its own separate essence. Everything that is composed of the second reality, such as individual soul ([[Jiva]]), matter, etc. exist with their own separate reality. The distinguishing factor of this philosophy as opposed to [[Advaita Vedanta]] ([[monistic]] conclusion of Vedas) is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Etter, Christopher. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jW2pcWpXY8wC&amp;pg=PA59 A Study of Qualitative Non-Pluralism]. iUniverse Inc. P. 59-60. {{ISBN|0-595-39312-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2018}} Because the existence of individuals is grounded in the divine, they are depicted as reflections, images or even shadows of the divine, but never in any way identical with the divine. [[Moksha|Salvation]] therefore is described as the realization that all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Jeaneane D. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8dRZ4E-qgz8C&amp;pg=PA340&amp;dq=dualism+dvaita+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VoXnT_6RH8qtrAeO3qmJCQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dualism%20dvaita%20vedanta&amp;f=false Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism]. Sussex Academic Press. P. 340-344. {{ISBN|1-898723-93-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ontological dualism==
[[Image:Yin yang.svg|right|100px|thumb|The yin and yang symbolizes the duality in nature and all things in the Taoist religion.]]

Alternatively, ''dualism'' can mean the tendency of humans to perceive and understand the world as being divided into two overarching [[categorization|categories]]. In this sense, it is dualistic when one perceives a tree as a thing separate from everything surrounding it. This form of ontological dualism exists in Taoism and Confucianism, beliefs that divide the universe into the complementary oppositions of [[yin and yang]].&lt;ref name="Girardot"&gt;{{cite book|last=Girardot|first=N.J.|title=Myth and Meaning in Early Taoism: The Theme of Chaos (hun-tun)|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06460-7|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditions such as classical Hinduism, [[Zen]] Buddhism or [[Islam]]ic [[Sufi]]sm, a key to enlightenment is "transcending" this sort of dualistic thinking, without merely substituting dualism with [[monism]] or [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]].

===In Chinese philosophy===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
The opposition and combination of the universe's two basic principles of [[yin and yang]] is a large part of [[Chinese philosophy]], and is an important feature of [[Taoism]], both as a philosophy and as a religion, although the concept developed much earlier. Some argue that yin and yang were originally an earth and sky god, respectively.&lt;ref name="Yin and Yang"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Jeremy|title=Yin and Yang|url=http://online.infobase.com/HRC/Search/Details/239492?q=yin%20and%20yang|website=Ancient and Medieval History|publisher=Facts on File|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the oldest principles in Chinese philosophy, yin and yang are also discussed in [[Confucianism]], but to a lesser extent.

Some of the common associations with yang and yin, respectively, are: male and female, [[light]] and [[darkness|dark]], active and passive, motion and stillness. Some scholars believe that the two ideas may have originally referred to two opposite sides of a mountain, facing towards and away from the sun.&lt;ref name="Yin and Yang"/&gt; The yin and yang symbol in actuality has very little to do with Western dualism; instead it represents the philosophy of balance, where two opposites co-exist in harmony and are able to transmute into each other. In the yin-yang symbol there is a dot of yin in yang and a dot of yang in yin. In Taoism, this symbolizes the inter-connectedness of the opposite forces as different aspects of Tao, the First Principle. Contrast is needed to create a distinguishable reality, without which we would experience nothingness. Therefore, the independent principles of yin and yang are actually dependent on one another for each other's distinguishable existence.

The complementary dualistic concept seen in yin and yang represent the reciprocal interaction throughout nature, related to a [[feedback loop]], where opposing forces do not exchange in opposition but instead exchange reciprocally to promote stabilization similar to [[homeostasis]]. An underlying principle in Taoism states that within every independent entity lies a part of its opposite. Within sickness lies health and vice versa. This is because all opposites are manifestations of the single Tao, and are therefore not independent from one another, but rather a variation of the same unifying force throughout all of nature.

== In traditional religions ==

=== Uralic peoples ===
In a [[Nenets people|Nenets]] myth, Num and [[Nga (god)|Nga]] collaborate and compete with each other, creating land,&lt;ref name=land&gt;Vértes 1990: 104, 105&lt;/ref&gt; there are also other myths about competing-collaborating demiurges.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparative studies of Uralic peoples and Kets ===
Among others, also dualistic myths were investigated in researches which tried to compare the mythologies of Siberian peoples and settle the problem of their origins. [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Vladimir Toporov]] compared the [[mythology]] of [[Ket people]] with those of [[Uralic peoples]], assuming in the studies, that there are modelling [[Semiotics|semiotic]] systems in the compared mythologies; and they have also made typological comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov &amp; Toporov 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984:390, in editorial afterword by Hoppál&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, from possibly Uralic mythological analogies, those of [[Ob-Ugric languages|Ob-Ugric]] peoples&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 225, 227, 229&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Samoyedic peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 229, 230&lt;/ref&gt; are mentioned. Some other discussed analogies (similar folklore [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]], and purely typological considerations, certain binary pairs in symbolics) may be related to dualistic organization of society—some of such dualistic features can be found at these compared peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 229–231&lt;/ref&gt; It must be admitted that, for Kets, neither dualistic organization of society&lt;ref name=noket2org&gt;Zolotaryov 1980: 39&lt;/ref&gt; nor cosmological dualism&lt;ref name=ket2cosm&gt;Zolotaryov 1980: 48&lt;/ref&gt; has been researched thoroughly: if such features existed at all, they have either weakened or remained largely undiscovered;&lt;ref name=noket2org/&gt; although there are some reports on division into two exogamous patrilinear moieties,&lt;ref&gt;Zolotaryov 1980: 37&lt;/ref&gt; folklore on conflicts of mythological figures, and also on cooperation of two beings in creating the land:&lt;ref name=ket2cosm/&gt; the diving of the water fowl.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 229&lt;/ref&gt; If we include dualistic cosmologies meant in broad sense, not restricted to certain concrete motifs, then we find that they are much more widespread, they exist not only among some Uralic peoples, but there are examples in each inhabited continent.&lt;ref name="Zolotarjov"&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 56&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chukchi ===
A [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] myth and its variations report the creation of the world; in some variations, it is achieved by the collaboration of several beings ([[bird]]s, collaborating in a coequal way; or the creator and the [[raven]], collaborating in a coequal way; or the creator alone, using the birds only as assistants).&lt;ref&gt;"Zolotarjov 1980: 40–41"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anyiszimov 1981: 92 – 98&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fuegians ===
{{see also|Fuegians#Spiritual culture}}
All three [[Fuegians|Fuegian]] tribes had dualistic myths about [[culture hero]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966:71&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yámana]] have dualistic myths about the two {{IPA-xx|joalox|}} brothers. They act as culture heroes, and sometimes stand in an antagonistic relation with each other, introducing opposite laws. Their figures can be compared to the Kwanyip-brothers of the [[Selk'nam]].&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966:181&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the presence of dualistic myths in two compared cultures does not imply relatedness or [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]] necessarily.&lt;ref name="Zolotarjov" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="950">In [[sociology]], '''elite religion''' is defined as the symbols, rituals and beliefs which are recognized as legitimate by the leadership of that religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bock, Wilbur.

==In contrast to folk religion==
Elite religion is often contrasted with [[folk religion]], or the religious symbols and beliefs of the masses. Elite religion is then the "official religion" as championed by the leaders of a religion.

==Strengthening denominationalism==
Sociologist [[Charles Liebman]] theorized that the strengthening of elite religion over members of a particular group led to the growth of [[denominationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Liebman, Charles. ''The Ambivalent American Jew''. Jewish Publication Society. (1973): 83-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3635">{{for|the academic journal|Epoché: A Journal for the History of Philosophy}}
'''Epoché''' ([[wikt:ἐποχή|ἐποχή]] ''epokhē'', "suspension"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29poxh%2F ἐποχή] in Liddell and Scott's ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon|Greek–English Lexicon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[ancient Greek]] term typically translated as "suspension of judgment" but also as "withholding of assent".&lt;ref&gt;Benson Mates, "The Skeptic Way" p225&lt;/ref&gt; In its philosophical usage "epoché" describes the state where all judgments about non-evident matters are suspended in order to induce a state of [[ataraxia]] (freedom from worry and anxiety). This concept was developed by the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] school of philosophy and was also employed in [[Academic Skepticism]].

Epoché plays an implicit role in subsequent skeptical thought, as in [[René Descartes]]' epistemic principle of [[methodic doubt]]. The term was popularized in modern philosophy by [[Edmund Husserl]]. Husserl elaborates the notion of 'phenomenological epoché' or '[[bracketing (phenomenology)|bracketing]]' in ''Ideas I''. Through the systematic procedure of 'phenomenological reduction', one is thought to be able to suspend judgment regarding the general or naive philosophical belief in the existence of the external world, and thus examine phenomena as they are originally given to consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/phen-red/#SSSH5a.i.1 "The Phenomenological Reduction"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pyrrhonism==
Epoché plays an important role in [[Pyrrhonism]], the skeptical philosophy named after [[Pyrrho]]. Pyrrhonism provides practitioners with techniques for achieving epoché through use of the Ten Modes of [[Aenesidemus]], the Five Modes of [[Agrippa the Skeptic|Agrippa]], and the Pyrrhonist maxims.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrrhonism is mostly known today through the writings of the Pyrrhonist philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] whose surviving works appear to be an encyclopedia of Pyrrhonist arguments for inducing epoché across a breadth of philosophical and other intellectual issues of antiquity.

==Phenomenology==
{{main article|Bracketing (phenomenology)}}
In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological research]] epoché is described as a process involved in blocking biases and assumptions in order to explain a phenomenon in terms of its own inherent system of meaning. This is a general predisposition one must assume before commencing phenomenological study. It is different from bracketing, which is to acknowledge any personal bias or contextual assumptions of the researcher.  This involves systematic steps to "set aside" various assumptions and beliefs about a phenomenon in order to examine how the phenomenon presents itself in the world of the participant.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, T.M., Brumfield, K.A. (2010). ''Phenomenological designs: The philosophy of phenomenological research''. In C.J Sheperis, J.S Young, &amp; M.H. Daniels (Eds.), Counseling research: Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevant prerequisites for human religion ==

===Increased brain size===
In this set of theories, the religious mind is one consequence of a brain that is large enough to formulate religious and philosophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Religious ideas can theoretically be traced to the evolution of brains large enough to make possible the kind of abstract thought necessary to formulate religious and philosophical ideas|authorlink=Paul R.

Much of the brain's expansion took place in the [[neocortex]]. The cerebral neocortex is presumed to be responsible for the neuronal computations underlying complex phenomena such as perception, thought, language, attention, episodic memory and voluntary movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/141/1/11|title=How unique is the human neocortex?|first1=Zoltán|last1=Molnár|first2=Alex|last2=Pollen|date=1 January 2014|journal=Development|volume=141|issue=1|pages=11–16|accessdate=20 March 2018|via=dev.biologists.org|doi=10.1242/dev.101279|pmid=24346696}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dunbar's number|Dunbar's theory]], the relative [[Neocortex#Neocortex ratio|neocortex size]] of any species correlates with the level of social complexity of the particular species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Processing power limits social group size: computational evidence for the cognitive costs of sociality|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1765/20131151|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2013-08-22|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 3712454|pmid = 23804623|page = 20131151|volume = 280|issue = 1765|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2013.1151|first = T.|last = Dávid-Barrett|first2 = R.

[[Robin Dunbar]] argues that the critical event in the evolution of the neocortex took place at the [[speciation]] of [[Archaic humans|archaic homo sapiens]] about 500,000 years ago. His study indicates that only after the speciation event is the neocortex large enough to process complex social phenomena such as language and religion. The study is based on a [[regression analysis]] of neocortex size plotted against a number of social behaviors of living and extinct hominids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/ANTH689%20Fall%202005/Week%2011/Dunbar%202003.pdf |title=THE SOCIAL BRAIN: Mind, Language, and Society in Evolutionary Perspective |last=Dunbar |first=Robin |authorlink=Robin Dunbar |year=2003 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=author%3ADunbar+intitle%3ATHE+SOCIAL+BRAIN%3A+Mind%2C+Language%2C+and+Society+in+Evolutionary+Perspective&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2003&amp;as_yhi=2003&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911214723/http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/ANTH689%20Fall%202005/Week%2011/Dunbar%202003.pdf |archivedate=September 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] suggests that religion may have grown out of evolutionary changes which favored larger brains as a means of cementing group coherence among savannah hunters, after that larger brain enabled reflection on the inevitability of personal mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Jay Gould|author2=Paul McGarr|author3=Steven Peter Russell Rose|title=The richness of life: the essential Stephen Jay Gould|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yfXJhKmp1wUC|year=2007|publisher=W.

===Tool use===
[[Lewis Wolpert]] argues that causal beliefs that emerged from tool use played a major role in the evolution of belief. The manufacture of complex tools requires creating a mental image of an object which does not exist naturally before actually making the artifact. Furthermore, one must understand how the tool would be used, that requires an understanding of [[causality]].&lt;ref name="wolpert"&gt;{{cite book| title=Six impossible things before breakfast, The evolutionary origins of belief|authorlink=Lewis Wolpert|isbn=978-0-393-06449-0|quote=with regard to hafted tools, One would have to understand that the two pieces serve different purposes, and imagine how the tool could be used,| author=Lewis Wolpert| year=2006| publisher=Norton| location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the level of sophistication of stone tools is a useful indicator of causal beliefs.&lt;ref name="wolpert2"&gt;{{cite book| title=Six impossible things before breakfast, The evolutionary origins of belief|authorlink=Lewis Wolpert|last=Wolpert|first=Lewis|isbn=978-0-393-06449-0| quote= Belief in cause and effect has had the most enormous effect on human evolution, both physical and cultural. Tool use, with language, has transformed human evolution and let to what we now think of as belief|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HP35qPdfioAC&amp;pg=PA82|page=82| year=2006| publisher=Norton| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolpert contends use of tools composed of more than one component, such as hand axes, represents an ability to understand cause and effect. However, recent studies of other primates indicate that causality may not be a uniquely human trait. For example, chimpanzees have been known to escape from pens closed with multiple latches, which was previously thought could only have been figured out by humans who understood causality.  Chimpanzees are also known to mourn the dead, and notice things that have only aesthetic value, like sunsets, both of which may be considered to be components of religion or spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/can-an-ape-learn-to-be-human-2332047.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Steve | last=Connor | title=Can an ape learn to be human? | date=August 5, 2011}}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The difference between the comprehension of causality by humans and chimpanzees is one of degree. The degree of comprehension in an animal depends upon the size of the prefrontal cortex: the greater the size of the prefrontal cortex the deeper the comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=3190564 | pmid=22013351 | doi=10.4103/0973-1229.33001 | volume=6 | issue=1 | title=Neurobiology of spirituality | year=2008 | journal=Mens Sana Monogr | pages=63–80 | last1 = Mohandas | first1 = E}} {{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of language===
{{See also|Origin of language|Myth and religion}}
Religion requires a system of symbolic communication, such as language, to be transmitted from one individual to another. [[Philip Lieberman]] states "human religious thought and moral sense clearly rest on a cognitive-linguistic base".&lt;ref name="lieberman"/&gt; From this premise science writer [[Nicholas Wade]] states: 
:"Like most behaviors that are found in societies throughout the world, religion must have been present in the ancestral human population before the dispersal from Africa 50,000 years ago. Although religious rituals usually involve dance and music, they are also very verbal, since the sacred truths have to be stated. If so, religion, at least in its modern form, cannot pre-date the emergence of language. It has been argued earlier that language attained its modern state shortly before the exodus from Africa. If religion had to await the evolution of modern, articulate language, then it too would have emerged shortly before 50,000 years ago."&lt;ref name="wade"&gt;*"[[Nicholas Wade|Wade, Nicholas]] – ''Before The Dawn, Discovering the lost history of our ancestors''.  Penguin Books, London, 2006.  p. 8 p. 165" {{ISBN|1-59420-079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another view distinguishes individual religious belief from collective religious belief. While the former does not require prior development of language, the latter does. The individual human brain has to explain a phenomenon in order to comprehend and relate to it. This activity predates by far the emergence of language and may have caused it. The theory is, belief in the supernatural emerges from hypotheses arbitrarily assumed by individuals to explain natural phenomena that cannot be explained otherwise. The resulting need to share individual hypotheses with others leads eventually to collective religious belief. A socially accepted hypothesis becomes dogmatic backed by social sanction.

===Morality and group living===
{{Main|Evolution of morality|Morality#Evolution}}
[[Frans de Waal]] and Barbara King both view human morality as having grown out of primate sociality. Although morality awareness may be a unique human trait, many [[social animal]]s, such as primates, dolphins and whales, have been known to exhibit pre-moral sentiments. According to [[Michael Shermer]], the following characteristics are shared by humans and other social animals, particularly the great apes:
{{quote|attachment and bonding, cooperation and mutual aid, sympathy and empathy, direct and indirect reciprocity, altruism and reciprocal altruism, conflict resolution and peacemaking, deception and deception detection, community concern and caring about what others think about you, and awareness of and response to the social rules of the group.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

De Waal contends that all social animals have had to restrain or alter their behavior for group living to be worthwhile. Pre-moral sentiments evolved in primate societies as a method of restraining individual selfishness and building more cooperative groups. For any social species, the benefits of being part of an altruistic group should outweigh the benefits of individualism. For example, a lack of group cohesion could make individuals more vulnerable to attack from outsiders. Being part of a group may also improve the chances of finding food. This is evident among animals that [[pack hunter|hunt in packs]] to take down large or dangerous prey.

All social animals have hierarchical societies in which each member knows its own place. Social order is maintained by certain rules of expected behavior and dominant group members enforce order through punishment. However, higher order primates also have a sense of fairness. In a 2008 study, de Waal and colleagues put two capuchin monkeys side by side and gave them a simple task to complete: Giving a rock to the experimenter. They were given cucumbers as a reward for executing the task, and the monkeys obliged. But if one of the monkeys was given grapes, something interesting happened:
After receiving the first piece of cucumber, the capuchin monkey gave the experimenter a rock as expected. But upon seeing that the other monkey got grapes, the capuchin monkey threw away the next piece of cucumber that was given to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/19/health/chimpanzee-fairness-morality/index.html|title=Morality: It's not just for humans - CNN|first=By Elizabeth Landau,|last=CNN|date=|website=cnn.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Chimpanzees live in [[Fission-fusion society|fission-fusion groups]] that average 50 individuals. It is likely that early ancestors of humans lived in groups of similar size. Based on the size of [[wikt:extant|extant]] hunter-gatherer societies, recent Paleolithic [[hominid]]s lived in bands of a few hundred individuals. As community size increased over the course of human evolution, greater enforcement to achieve group cohesion would have been required. Morality may have evolved in these bands of 100 to 200 people as a means of social control, conflict resolution and group solidarity. According to Dr. de Waal, human morality has two extra levels of sophistication that are not found in primate societies. Humans enforce their society's moral codes much more rigorously with rewards, punishments and reputation building. Humans also apply a degree of judgment and reason not otherwise seen in the animal kingdom.

Psychologist Matt J. Rossano argues that religion emerged after morality and built upon morality by expanding the social scrutiny of individual behavior to include [[supernatural]] agents. By including ever-watchful ancestors, spirits and gods in the social realm, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups.&lt;ref name="supernature"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The adaptive value of religion would have enhanced group survival.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/science/20moral.html Nicholas Wade. ''Scientist Finds the Beginnings of Morality in Primate Behavior''. New York Times.

University of Glasgow. 2007. Retrieved June 6, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
Rossano is referring here to collective religious belief and the social sanction that institutionalized morality. According to Rossano's teaching, individual religious belief is thus initially epistemological, not ethical, in nature.

==Evolutionary psychology of religion==
{{Main|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}
Cognitive scientists underlined that religions may be explained as a result of the brain architecture that expressed in early [[Homo#list of species|''Homo'' genus]], through the [[Timeline of the evolutionary history of life|history of life]]. However, there is disagreement on the exact mechanisms that drove the evolution of the religious mind. The two main schools of thought hold that either religion evolved due to [[natural selection]] and has selective advantage, or that religion is an evolutionary byproduct of other mental adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/BeginnersGuide.pdf Evolutionary Religious Studies (ERS): A Beginner's Guide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611204211/http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/BeginnersGuide.pdf |date=2010-06-11 }}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Jay Gould]], for example, believed that religion was an [[exaptation]] or a [[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]], in other words that religion evolved as byproduct of psychological mechanisms that evolved for other reasons.&lt;ref name="henig"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/magazine/04evolution.t.html|title=Darwin's God|date=4 March 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/religion%20seminar%20papers/Kirkpatrick_1999.pdf Toward an evolutionary psychology of religion and personality] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910084648/http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/religion%20seminar%20papers/Kirkpatrick_1999.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pinker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2004_10_29_religion.htm|title=The evolutionary psychology of religion |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509063432/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2004_10_29_religion.htm |archive-date=2008-05-09 |author=[[Steven Pinker]]|date=29 October 2004|website=harvard.edu|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such mechanisms may include the ability to infer the presence of organisms that might do harm (agent detection), the ability to come up with causal narratives for natural events ([[etiology]]), and the ability to recognize that other people have minds of their own with their own beliefs, desires and intentions ([[theory of mind]]). These three adaptations (among others) allow human beings to imagine purposeful agents behind many observations that could not readily be explained otherwise, e.g. thunder, lightning, movement of planets, complexity of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid= 16035401|url= http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/Atran-12172002/Referees/|title= Religion's evolutionary landscape: counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion.|year= 2004|journal= [[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]|last1= Atran|first1= S|last2= Norenzayan|first2= A|volume= 27|issue= 6|pages= 713–30; discussion 730–70|doi= 10.1017/s0140525x04000172|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080807165354/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/Atran-12172002/Referees/|archivedate= 2008-08-07|df= |citeseerx= 10.1.1.687.8586}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of collective religious belief identified the agents as deities that standardized the explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The deification of historical figures and the emergence of priesthoods as a solution to a network coordination problem|journal = Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date = 2015-08-14|issn = 2153-599X|pages = 1–11|volume = 0|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|first = Tamás|last = Dávid-Barrett|first2 = James|last2 = Carney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested that religion is genetically "hardwired" into the human condition. One controversial proposal, the [[God gene]] hypothesis, states that some variants of a specific gene, the [[Vesicular monoamine transporter 2|VMAT2]] gene, predispose to spirituality.&lt;ref name="kluger2004"&gt;{{cite news

Another view is based on the concept of the [[triune brain]]: the reptilian brain, the limbic system, and the neocortex, proposed by [[Paul D. MacLean]]. Collective religious belief draws upon the emotions of love, fear, and gregariousness and is deeply embedded in the limbic system through socio-biological conditioning and social sanction. Individual religious belief utilizes reason based in the neocortex and often varies from collective religion. The limbic system is much older in evolutionary terms than the neocortex and is, therefore, stronger than it much in the same way as the reptilian is stronger than both the limbic system and the neocortex.

Yet another view is that the behavior of people who participate in a religion makes them feel better and this improves their fitness, so that there is a genetic selection in favor of people who are willing to believe in religion.  Specifically, rituals, beliefs, and the social contact typical of religious groups may serve to calm the mind (for example by reducing ambiguity and the uncertainty due to complexity) and allow it to function better when under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Lionel Tiger and Michael McGuire | title = God's Brain | publisher = Prometheus Books | date = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-61614-164-6}} see pages 202-204&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow religion to be used as a powerful survival mechanism, particularly in facilitating the evolution of [[War#Motivations|hierarchies]] of [[Killer ape theory|warriors]], which if true, may be why many modern religions tend to promote [[fertility]] and [[family|kinship]].

Still another view, proposed by F.H. Previc, is that human religion was a product of an increase in dopaminergic functions in the human brain and a general intellectual expansion beginning around 80 kya.&lt;ref&gt;Previc, F.H. (2009).

The exact time when humans first became [[religion|religious]] remains unknown, however research in evolutionary archaeology shows credible evidence of religious-cum-ritualistic behaviour from around the [[Middle Paleolithic]] era (45-200 [[tya (unit)|thousand years ago]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5954/784|title=On the Origin of Religion|first=Elizabeth|last=Culotta|date=6 November 2009|journal=Science|volume=326|issue=5954|pages=784–787|accessdate=20 March 2018|via=science.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/science.326_784|pmid=19892955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleolithic burials===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Skhul burial.jpg|thumb|right|400px|90,000 year old double burial of Homo sapiens at [[Qafzeh]] cave in Israel]] --&gt;
The earliest evidence of religious thought is based on the ritual treatment of the dead. Most animals display only a casual interest in the dead of their own species.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8209 Elephants may pay homage to the dead]{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritual burial thus represents a significant change in human behavior. Ritual burials represent an awareness of life and death and a possible belief in the [[afterlife]]. [[Philip Lieberman]] states "burials with grave goods clearly signify religious practices and concern for the dead that transcends daily life."&lt;ref name="lieberman"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&amp;pg=PA162 | title=Uniquely Human|isbn=978-0-674-92183-2| year=1991|last=Lieberman| authorlink=Philip Lieberman |publisher= Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest evidence for treatment of the dead comes from [[Archaeological Site of Atapuerca|Atapuerca]] in Spain. At this location the bones of 30 individuals believed to be ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' have been found in a pit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7Q3nOqkJQwoC&amp;pg=PA158 |title=How Symbols, Language, and Intelligence Evolved from Early Primates to Modern Human|authorlink=Stanley Greenspan|last=Greenspan|first=Stanley|isbn=978-0-306-81449-5|year=2006|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Neanderthals]] are also contenders for the first [[Hominidae|hominids]] to intentionally bury the dead. They may have placed corpses into shallow graves along with stone tools and animal bones. The presence of these [[grave goods]] may indicate an emotional connection with the deceased and possibly a belief in the afterlife. Neanderthal burial sites include [[Shanidar]] in Iraq and [[Krapina]] in Croatia and [[Kebara Cave]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.waspress.co.uk/journals/beforefarming/journal_20021/abstracts/papers/20021_04_s.pdf|title= The Neanderthal dead:exploring mortuary variability in Middle Palaeolithic Eurasia|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080910084648/http://www.waspress.co.uk/journals/beforefarming/journal_20021/abstracts/papers/20021_04_s.pdf|archivedate= 2008-09-10|df= }}{{clarify|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="evolving_graves"/&gt;&lt;ref name="evolving_graves"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_24_160/ai_81827792/pg_1|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|author=|date=|website=findarticles.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC article on the Neanderthals|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A21606040|quote=Neanderthals buried their dead, and one burial at [[Shanidar]] in Iraq was accompanied by grave goods in the form of plants. All of the plants are used in recent times for medicinal purposes, and it seems likely that the Neanderthals also used them in this way and buried them with their dead for the same reason. Grave goods are an archaeological marker of belief in an afterlife, so Neanderthals may well have had some form of religious belief.}}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known burial of modern humans is from a cave in Israel located at [[Qafzeh]]. Human remains have been dated to 100,000 years ago. Human skeletons were found stained with [[red ochre]]. A variety of grave goods were found at the burial site. The mandible of a wild boar was found placed in the arms of one of the skeletons.&lt;ref name="lieberman2"&gt;. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&amp;pg=PA163 Uniquely Human page 163]&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Lieberman states:
:"Burial rituals incorporating grave goods may have been invented by the anatomically modern hominids who emigrated from Africa to the Middle East roughly 100,000 years ago".&lt;ref name="lieberman2"/&gt;

Matt Rossano suggests that the period between 80,000–60,000 years before present, following the retreat of humans from the Levant to Africa, was a crucial period in the evolution of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/mrossano/recentpubs/Springer%20chapter.pdf|title=The African Interregnum: The "Where," "When," and "Why" of the Evolution of Religion|year=2009|last=Rossano|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-00128-4_9|first1=Matt|pages=127–141|series=The Frontiers Collection|isbn=978-3-642-00127-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of symbolism===
The use of [[Religious symbolism|symbolism in religion]] is a universal established phenomenon. Archeologist [[Steven Mithen]] contends that it is common for religious practices to involve the creation of images and symbols to represent supernatural beings and ideas. Because supernatural beings violate the principles of the natural world, there will always be difficulty in communicating and sharing supernatural concepts with others. This problem can be overcome by anchoring these supernatural beings in material form through representational art. When translated into material form, supernatural concepts become easier to communicate and understand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BRyMgrYx3EUC&amp;pg=PA147 Symbolism and the Supernatural]{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the association of art and religion, evidence of symbolism in the fossil record is indicative of a mind capable of religious thoughts. Art and symbolism demonstrates a capacity for abstract thought and imagination necessary to construct religious ideas. Wentzel van Huyssteen states that the translation of the non-visible through symbolism enabled early human ancestors to hold beliefs in abstract terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Uniqueness and Symbolization|url=http://www.metanexus.net/magazine/tabid/68/id/10167/Default.aspx|quote=This 'coding of the non-visible' through abstract, symbolic thought, enabled also our early human ancestors to argue and hold beliefs in abstract terms. In fact, the concept of God itself follows from the ability to abstract and conceive of 'person'|access-date=2008-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527011227/http://www.metanexus.net/magazine/tabid/68/id/10167/Default.aspx|archive-date=2009-05-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest evidence of symbolic behavior is associated with [[Middle Stone Age]] sites in Africa. From at least 100,000 years ago, there is evidence of the use of pigments such as [[red ochre]]. Pigments are of little practical use to hunter gatherers, thus evidence of their use is interpreted as symbolic or for ritual purposes. Among extant hunter gatherer populations around the world, red ochre is still used extensively for ritual purposes. It has been argued that it is universal among human cultures for the color red to represent blood, sex, life and death.&lt;ref name="rossano"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of red ochre as a proxy for symbolism is often criticized as being too indirect. Some scientists, such as [[Richard Klein (paleoanthropologist)|Richard Klein]] and [[Steven Mithen]], only recognize unambiguous forms of art as representative of abstract ideas. Upper paleolithic cave art provides some of the most unambiguous evidence of religious thought from the paleolithic. Cave paintings at [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] depict creatures that are half human and half animal.

Organised religion traces its roots to the [[neolithic revolution]] that began 11,000 years ago in the [[Near East]] but may have occurred independently in several other locations around the world. The invention of agriculture transformed many human societies from a [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle to a [[sedentism|sedentary lifestyle]]. The consequences of the neolithic revolution included a population explosion and an acceleration in the pace of technological development. The transition from foraging bands to states and empires precipitated more specialized and developed forms of religion that reflected the new social and political environment. While bands and small tribes possess supernatural beliefs, these beliefs do not serve to justify a central authority, justify transfer of wealth or maintain peace between unrelated individuals.
Organized religion emerged as a means of providing social and economic stability through the following ways:
*Justifying the central authority, which in turn possessed the right to collect taxes in return for providing social and security services.
*Bands and tribes consist of small number of related individuals. However, states and nations are composed of many thousands of unrelated individuals. [[Jared Diamond]] argues that organized religion served to provide a bond between unrelated individuals who would otherwise be more prone to enmity. In his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' he argues that the leading cause of death among hunter-gatherer societies is murder.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;

*Religions that revolved around moralizing gods may have facilitated the rise of large, cooperative groups of unrelated individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Norenzayan | first1 = A. | last2 = Shariff | first2 = A.

The states born out of the Neolithic revolution, such as those of Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, were [[theocracies]] with chiefs, kings and emperors playing dual roles of political and spiritual leaders.&lt;ref name="shermer"/&gt; Anthropologists have found that virtually all state societies and chiefdoms from around the world have been found to justify political power through divine authority. This suggests that political authority co-opts collective religious belief to bolster itself.&lt;ref name="shermer"/&gt;

===Invention of writing===
{{See also|History of writing}}
Following the neolithic revolution, the pace of technological development (cultural evolution) intensified due to the invention of writing 5000 years ago. Symbols that became words later on made effective communication of ideas possible. Printing invented only over a thousand years ago increased the speed of communication exponentially and became the main spring of cultural evolution.
Writing is thought to have been first invented in either Sumeria or Ancient Egypt and was initially used for accounting. Soon after, writing was used to record myth. The first religious texts mark the beginning of [[History of religion|religious history]]. The [[Pyramid Texts]] from ancient Egypt are one of the oldest known religious texts in the world, dating to between 2400–2300 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=SieAmOiyGQMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9 | title=An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Literature|first= Wallis|last= Budge|authorlink = E.

In pre-literate societies, religious ideas were based on an [[oral tradition]], the contents of which were articulated by shamans and remained limited to the collective memories of the society's inhabitants. With the advent of writing, information that was not easy to remember could easily be stored in sacred texts that were maintained by a select group (clergy). Humans could store and process large amounts of information with writing that otherwise would have been forgotten. Writing therefore enabled religions to develop coherent and comprehensive doctrinal systems that remained independent of time and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnnnAwMfeV0C&amp;pg=PA160#PPA160,M1|chapter=Holy Book:The Invention of writing and religious cognition|title=Magic, Miracles, and Religion: A Scientist's Perspective | first=Ilkka|last=Pyysiäinen|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7591-0663-5|publisher=AltMira Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Writing also brought a measure of objectivity to human knowledge. Formulation of thoughts in words and the requirement for validation made mutual exchange of ideas and the sifting of generally acceptable from not acceptable ideas possible. The generally acceptable ideas became objective knowledge reflecting the continuously evolving framework of human awareness of reality that [[Karl Popper]] calls 'verisimilitude' – a stage on the human journey to truth.&lt;ref&gt;''Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach'', 1972, Rev. ed., 1979, {{ISBN|0-19-875024-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Foundation for Interreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue''' ('''FIIRD''') was founded in 1999, sponsored by the [[Levant Foundation]] with the [[University of Geneva]] in Switzerland "to pursue its scholarly and humanistic goals with the main objective of fostering understanding of the three monotheistic religions: Christianity, Islam and Judaism."  The main program of the FIIRD is to enhance knowledge and the critical examination of the wellsprings of each religious tradition and then to acquire the linguistic and strategic tools needed to study the normative scriptures of these religions without syncretism or proselytism.

==Projects and Goals==
In 2006 the FIIRD published a boxed set of the three Holy Books, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament and the Holy Qur'an.

Another goal of the FIIRD, strongly supported by the [[Levant Foundation]], was to create a post-doctoral program at the [[University of Geneva]] in the field of interreligious and intercultural dialogue whereby several Fellows, each possessing a PhD in theology, philosophy, history or other humanities and dedicated to further their knowledge and understanding of the monotheistic religions, participate in approved research and publish their results all done with the goal of searching for peace between the Abrahamistic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

==Background==
For nearly four decades, [[Eknath Easwaran|Easwaran]] taught a method of meditation, known as [[Passage Meditation|passage meditation]], which involves focusing the mind on inspiring sacred texts, such as the ''[[Psalm 23|23rd Psalm]]'' or the Buddha's ''[[Metta Sutta|Discourse on Good Will]]''. Throughout this time, he received inquiries about whether various texts were suitable passages for meditation. He taught that  passages should meet the criteria he had learned to trust in his own practice: a passage should be "positive, practical, universal, and inspiring".&lt;ref name=gmrf2009&gt;''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'', 2009 edition, {{ISBN|978-1-58638-038-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} and drawn from a scripture or a person whose words and life attest to spiritual realization. ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' grew as a collection of such passages.

==Topics covered==
All US editions of ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' and its derivatives contain an introduction, plus numerous 1- to 3- or more page selections of spiritual texts from many traditions. Examples of spiritual texts are shown in the table at right.

[[File:Guruvayoor Kesavan Statue-sidecrop.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.40|alt=Statue of devout elephant|[[Guruvayur Keshavan|Statue of devout elephant]]&lt;ref&gt;This is a photograph of a statue of [[Guruvayur Keshavan]], an elephant who lived the last 54 years of his life, until 1976, at [[Guruvayur Temple]] in Kerala state, India. The elephant was reported to display many signs of devotion to God. See [http://www.hindu.com/2005/12/11/stories/2005121102861000.htm "'Guruvayur Keshavan' Remembered"] in ''[[The Hindu]]'', Sunday, 11 Dec 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;]] [[Eknath Easwaran|Easwaran's]] Introduction uses a sculptural metaphor&lt;ref&gt;The elephant is used as both a [[metaphor]] (e.g., "once we have become attentive to the presence of this true self, then all we really need do is resolutely chip away whatever is not divine in ourselves," p. 16) and a [[simile]] (e.g., "we wouldn't use a dull chisel or one meant for wood on a piece of stone, and we should use suitable passages for meditation," p. 21), 2009 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; to explain how passages can be used beneficially in meditation. He tells the story of an ancient Indian sculptor who was renowned for vivid representations of elephants. His secret, the sculptor explained, was that after quarrying a giant rock,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;ldquo;for a long time, I do nothing but observe... and study it from every angle. I focus all my concentration on this task... At first, I see nothing but a huge and shapeless rock... Then slowly, very slowly, I... feel a presentiment... an outline, scarcely discernible, shows itself to me... An elephant is stirring in there!... I now know the one thing I must do:... I must chip away every last bit of stone that is ''not'' elephant. What then remains will be, must be, elephant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;ref name=foralongtime&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0c4M73NeoQUC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=isbn:9781586380380+%22for+a+long+time%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2eoRTuTkOYzEsAOWzoj8DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=isbn%3A9781586380380%20%22for%20a%20long%20time%22&amp;f=false Direct link: "For a long time...", page 15, ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, Easwaran says, meditation helps us to reveal "our higher self... [a] spark of divinity [that] is to be found in the heart of each human being.... [by] resolutely chip[ping] away whatever is not divine in ourselves."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|16}} This process is neither easy or quick, and "can't be done in a week or by the weak."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|16}} But "whatever our tradition, we are inheritors of straightforward spiritual practices [that] vary a bit from culture to culture... but essentially... are the same."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|19}} Meditation is the most potent practice, enabling us to "see the lineaments of our true self":&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|19}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In meditation, the inspirational passage is the chisel, our concentration is the hammer.... When we use our will to drive the thin edge of the passage deep into consciousness, we get the purchase to pry loose tenacious habits and negative attitudes. The passage, whether it is from the Bhagavad Gita or ''The Imitation of Christ'' or the Dhammapada of the Buddha, has been tempered in the flames of mystical experience...&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|19}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Easwaran, "the great principle upon which meditation rests is that we become what we meditate on."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|22}} This, he says, is consistent with our experience that even in everyday life, we are shaped by what occupies our thoughts – for example, if we spend most of our time "studying the market, checking the money rates, evaluating our portfolios, we are going to become money-people."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|22}} Thus, in selecting meditation passages, Easwaran has "aimed for the highest the human being is capable of, the most noble and elevating truths that have ever been expressed on this planet."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|23}} Indeed,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The test of suitable meditation passages is simply this: Does the passage bear the imprint of deep, personal spiritual experience? Is it the statement of one who went beyond the narrow confines of past conditioning into the unfathomable recesses of the mind, there to begin the great work of transformation?.... whatever lacks this validation by personal experience, however poetic or imaginative... is not suited for use in meditation.&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|21–2}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He also states that passages should be "life affirming,"&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|22}} and encourages building a varied repertoire of passages that can "guard against overfamiliarity.... [and] match a passage to your particular need at the time."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|23}}

The 2nd and 3rd  editions contain several supplementary sections:
*A description of 8-point program of [[Passage Meditation|passage meditation]] recommended by Easwaran, involving silently and slowly focusing the mind on memorized or previously known passages (6 pages)
*A post-script on the "Message of the Scriptures," describing the goal of meditation as a "deathless state of Self-realization.... the message of every major scripture [and] the testimony of mystics everywhere, East or West."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|256–7}}  (3 pages)
*The author's statement of what he believes separates the book from other sacred literature collections: that it functions as an instrument for transforming one's life. He states he can "testify from my own experience [that the passages] have the power to remake personality in the image of one's highest ideals."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|13}} ("Preface," 1 page)
*Indices by source, title, and first line
*Biographical and bibliographic notes on passage sources

In ''[[Resurgence &amp; Ecologist|Resurgence]]'', Marian van Eyk McCain wrote that "it feels refreshingly [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] to see sacred texts from many different [[wisdom tradition]]s gathering peaceably between two covers."&lt;ref name=resurgence04/&gt; ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' "contains old favorites like the [[Make Me an Instrument of Your Peace|Prayer of St Francis]]," verses from well-known scriptures, psalms, prayers, poems, two Native American pieces, and selections from "many... individual sages like [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]], [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], [[Hildegard of Bingen|Hildegard]], [[Thomas à Kempis]] and [[Inayat Khan|Hazrat Inayat Khan]]."&lt;ref name=resurgence04/&gt; McCain also warned those "like me" with an aversion to a "preponderance of male pronouns" that "The divine feminine is seriously under-represented here (less than five percent) and only one fifth of the pieces are gender-neutral."&lt;ref name=resurgence04/&gt; In response, a letter from a reader, Margaret Purrett, also published by ''[[Resurgence &amp; Ecologist|Resurgence]]'', argued that "meditators need to be tolerant of [[metaphor]]s for divinity and gender usage from the past. I would not like to be prevented from enjoying and using the ''Bhagavad Gita'', the ''Vedas'', ''Dhammapada'', or the ''Psalms'' merely because of references to male pronouns. Would anyone?"&lt;ref name=purrett04&gt;{{cite journal |author=Margaret Purrett |year=2004 
 |title=Engendering Change [letter commenting on review of God makes the rivers to flow, by Eknath Easwaran] 
 |journal=[[Resurgence &amp; Ecologist|Resurgence]] |publisher=The Resurgence Trust |volume=14 |issue=226 |pages=60
 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=Z1vHTdG8NZOksQPRl4i8AQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=tGMkAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=resurgence+easwaran&amp;q=easwaran#search_anchor |issn= 0034-5970 |OCLC=1763807}} (letter signed by Margaret Purrett of Voorschoten, The Netherlands)&lt;/ref&gt; Purrett stated that "In fact, [[Eknath Easwaran]] made new translations of many passages to make them more neutral for this last edition, and he changed many of the masculine singulars to neutral plurals."&lt;ref name=purrett04/&gt;

''[[The Times of India]]'' described the passages in ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' as "positive and practical, inspiring and life-affirming," "alive with the charge of mystical awareness," and having "the power to change your life."&lt;ref name=timesofindia/&gt;

''Prairie Messenger'', a Roman Catholic publication,&lt;ref&gt;The ''Prairie Messenger's'' website states that [http://www.prairiemessenger.ca/About_us.html "True to its Catholic tradition, the Prairie Messenger seeks to mirror for the church on the Prairies the whole reality of the pilgrim People of God as they seek to better understand, make present and judge themselves by the kingdom of God as announced in the liberating and merciful news of Jesus Christ."] (accessed 26 June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; stated that "these texts should have wide-ranging appeal since they are devoted to catching a glimpse of our inner being. Having taught meditation for over 30 years, Easwaran knows the importance of texts, the discipline of mental training, the use of a mantram, a holy formula, and daily meditation periods.... Easwaran is a faithful guide."&lt;ref name=jwg95/&gt;

{{Eknath Easwaran}}Reviewing the audio edition (1995), ''Fellowship in Prayer'' stated that "There is no end to the beauty that pours forth from the Blue Mountain Meditation Center in California, where Sri Eknath Easwaran continues to weave the golden threads of his ministry."&lt;ref name=mfg95/&gt; The reviewer described the audio as "magnificent," stating that "the depths of Easwaran's great soul brings each text to its most full expression of beauty and holiness... one has a sense of huge ocean waves rolling slowly, quietly, softly, timelessly, onto a distant shore.... My heart overflows with gratitude."&lt;ref name=mfg95/&gt;

In ''[[B.C. Catholic]]'s'' review of the audio edition (1995), Paul Matthew St. Pierre stated that "All of them [the passages] are spiritually thrilling both in their content and as read aloud by Easwaran."&lt;ref name=stpierre95/&gt; St. Pierre stated that "My own position... is that works of literature are to be read aloud, to be assigned a voice,"&lt;ref&gt;A fuller version of St. Pierre's statement is: "My own position as an English professor is that works of literature are to be read aloud, to be assigned a voice, either from within the text (the voice of author, narrator, or character) or from outside the text (the voice of the reader). This oral dimension of inscribed texts is no more evident than in works that have their origin in oral traditions, such as the scriptures of most of the world's religions. The Hebrew and Christian Scriptures are less a recorded than an authored text, recorded by men and women, but first authored (spoken) by God. Before they came to be recorded, these Scriptures circulated within the Jewish and Christian faith communities, passed on by word of mouth, from generation to generation."&lt;/ref&gt; and that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Having now listened (twice!) to all 170 minutes of readings, I feel confident in stating that this tape will stand up to repeated "hearings" from audiences interested in ecumenical Scriptures and holy books by saints and mystics, and in particular audiences looking for inspiration and dedicated to meditation.&lt;ref name=stpierre95/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[New Age Journal]]'' stated that "as an attractive sampler of sacred literature [the book] would be impressive enough. But these passages were chosen... for their [[spiritual transformation|transformative]] power.... The meanings and rhythms of the selections are calming. Their beauty inevitably emanates from their simplicity."&lt;ref name=newage92/&gt;

''India-West'' stated that the book "fills an important void in our lives.... The passages chosen are practical, positive and universal in appeal and of great literary beauty."&lt;ref name=ghosh04/&gt;

''BC Catholic's'' review of the 3rd edition (2003) stated that "This would be a wonderful book to help with one's [[Advent]] preparation and discipline... the book is designed for [[lectio divina]] and meditation.... the book... will fill readers with a sense of wonder, mostly obviously because it collects profoundly inspirational passages... but also because it demands that readers study the passages deferentially, with reverence."&lt;ref name=stpierre03/&gt; It mentioned many passages as comprising "Catholic content,"&lt;ref&gt;"The Catholic content comprises Psalms 23, 24, 100, and 139; [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm's]] 'Teach Me'; Saint [[Symeon the New Theologian]]'s 'I know That He Reveals Himself'; Saint [[Francis of Assisi]]'s 'Prayer of Saint Francis' and Saint [[Clare of Assisi]]'s 'The Mirror of Eternity'; Christ's 'Sermon on the Mount' from the [[Gospel of Saint Matthew]]; 'When You Call' from the [[Book of Isaiah]]; [[St. Paul]]'s '[[1 Corinthians 13|Epistle on Love]]'; St. [[Therese of Liseux]]'s 'Living on Love'; and St. [[Teresa of Avila]]'s 'I Gave All My Heart' and 'Her Heart is Full of Joy.' Other contributions are by Sts. [[Ignatius of Loyola]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Catherine of Genoa]], [[Brother Lawrence]], [[Francis de Sales]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]]; and by [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Elizabeth of the Trinity]], [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]], [[Thomas a Kempis]], and Cardinal [[John Henry Newman]]." (St. Pierre, 2003, p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All the content, from all the faith traditions, in the spirit of ecumenism, is deeply inspirational. For example, the 'Invocations' of Ansari of Herat.... "O Lord, give me that right discrimination / That the lure of the world may cheat me no more. Give me strength / That my faith suffer no eclipse." This prayer evokes not only the penitence of Ramadan (Islam's month of fasting...) but also the preparation and discipline of Advent.&lt;ref name=stpierre03/&gt;

Recommended meditation passages also ''motivate'' by including exemplars’ accounts of positive rewards and benefits of spiritual living" (p. 92, Oman, Flinders &amp; Thoresen, 2008, italics in original)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyperreligiosity''' is a psychiatric disturbance in which a person experiences intense religious beliefs or experiences that interfere with normal functioning.  Hyperreligiosity generally includes [[delusions|abnormal beliefs]] and a focus on religious content, which interferes with work and social functioning.  Hyperreligiosity may occur in a variety of disorders including [[epilepsy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=D. M.|last2=Novelly|first2=R. A.|last3=Walker|first3=P.

"'''I Married a Jew'''" is an [[essay]] by Gretchen Lewis published in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in the January 1939 issue.&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Gretchen |date=January 1939 |title=I Married a Jew |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1939/01/i-married-a-jew/306262/ |work=[[The Atlantic]] |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It discusses her marriage to a Jewish man, referred to as Ben in the article. Herself being a Christian [[White Americans|White American]] of German descent, she describes her marriage as an [[interracial marriage]]. The article also discusses the assimilation of Jews and other minorities into a white American mainstream culture. She writes that she frequently tries "to see things from the Nazis' point of view," to "the hurt confusion" of her Jewish husband.&lt;ref name="lewis" /&gt;

'''Incarnation''' literally means ''embodied in flesh'' or ''taking on flesh''. It refers to the [[Conception (biology)|conception]] and birth of a [[Sentience|sentient]] being who is the material manifestation of an [[entity]], [[god]] or force whose original nature is immaterial. In its religious context the word is used to mean the descent from [[Heaven]] of a [[god]], [[Deity|deity]], or divine being in human/animal form on Earth.

==Bahá'í==
{{further|God in the Bahá'í Faith}}

In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], God is not seen to be incarnated into this world and is not seen to be part of creation as he cannot be divided and does not descend to the condition of his creatures.&lt;ref name="saq"&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1981 |title = Some Answered Questions |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-190-6 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-53.html.iso8859-1#gr5 | pages = 202–203 |origyear = 1904-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifestations of God are also not seen as an incarnation of God, but are instead understood to be like a perfect mirror reflecting the attributes of God onto this [[materialism|material world]].&lt;ref name="manifestation"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9 | pages = 1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hatcher118"&gt;{{cite book |author = Hatcher, W.S. |author2=Martin, J.D. |year = 1998 |title = The Bahá'í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion |publisher = Harper &amp; Row |location = San Francisco |isbn = 0-87743-264-3 | page = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{see also|Rebirth (Buddhism)}}

Buddhism is a non-theistic religion, it denies the concept of a creator god or any incarnation of a creator god. Buddhism, however, does teach the [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] doctrine and asserts that living beings are reborn, endlessly, reincarnating as [[Deva (Buddhism)|Devas]] (gods), demi-gods, human beings, animals, hungry ghosts or hellish beings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Trainor | first =Kevin | year =2004 | title =Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide | publisher =Oxford University Press | isbn =978-0-19-517398-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PrloTKuAjwC|pages=61–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a cycle of ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|samsara]]'' that stops only for those who reach [[nirvana]] (nibbana).&lt;ref name="Harvey2012p46"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=32–33, 38–39, 46–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], an enlightened spiritual teacher ([[lama]]) is believed to reincarnate, and is called a ''[[tulku]]''. According to Tulku Thondup,&lt;ref name="TThondup_Incarnation"&gt;Tulku Thondup (2011) Incarnation: The History and Mysticism of the Tulku Tradition of Tibet. Boston: Shambhala.&lt;/ref&gt; there are three main types of tulkus.  They are the emanations of buddhas, the manifestations of highly accomplished adepts, and rebirths of highly virtuous teachers or spiritual friends.  There are also authentic secondary types as well which include unrecognized tulkus, blessed tulkus, and tulkus fallen from the path.

==Christianity==
[[File:Meister von Daphni 002.jpg|thumb|left|[[Christ Pantocrator]], God incarnate in the [[Christianity|Christian faith]], shown in a mosaic from [[Daphni Monastery|Daphni]], [[Greece]], ca. 1080-1100.]]
{{main|Incarnation (Christianity)|}}

Logos-Sarx-Schema uses to explain incarnation of the [[Son of God]]. The incarnation of [[Christ]] is a central Christian doctrine that God became flesh, assumed a human nature, and became a man in the form of [[Jesus]], the [[Son of God]] and the second person of the [[Trinity]]. This foundational Christian position holds that the divine nature of the Son of God was perfectly united with human nature in one divine Person, [[Jesus]], making him both truly God and truly man. The theological term for this is [[hypostatic union]]: the Second Person of the Trinity, [[God the Son]], became flesh when he was miraculously conceived in the womb of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/284611/Incarnation|title=Incarnation|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical passages traditionally referenced in connection with the doctrine of the Incarnation include {{Bibleref2|John|3:1-21}}, {{bibleref||Colossians|2:9}}, and {{Bibleref2|Philippians|2:7-8}}.

==Hinduism==
{{main|Avatar}}
[[File:Avatars.jpg|thumb|250px|Ten incarnations of [[Vishnu]] ([[Matsya]], [[Kurma]], [[Varaha]], [[Vamana]], [[Krishna]], [[Kalki]], [[Buddha]], [[Parshurama]], [[Rama]] &amp; [[Narasimha]]). Painting from [[Jaipur]], now at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]]]
In [[Hinduism]], incarnation refers to its rebirth doctrine, and in its theistic traditions to ''[[avatar]]''.&lt;ref name=kimctap192&gt;{{cite book|author=Sebastian C. H. Kim |title=Christian Theology in Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXh3iq94MWIC |year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-47206-7 |pages=169–176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Avatar literally means "descent, alight, to make one's appearance",&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsavatar/&gt; and refers to the embodiment of the essence of a superhuman being or a deity in another form.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=98}} The word also implies "to overcome, to remove, to bring down, to cross something".&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsavatar&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA90|year=1923|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hindu traditions, the "crossing or coming down" is symbolism, states Daniel Bassuk, of the divine descent from "eternity into the temporal realm, from unconditioned to the conditioned, from infinitude to finitude".&lt;ref name="Bassuk1987p3"/&gt; An avatar, states Justin Edwards Abbott, is a ''saguna'' (with form, attributes) embodiment of the ''nirguna'' [[Brahman]] or [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Justin Edwards Abbott |title=Life of Tukaram: Translation from Mahipati's Bhaktalilamrita |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-UmxAoX2wYC|year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0170-7|pages=335–336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the [[Vedas]] nor the [[Mukhya Upanishads|Principal Upanishads]] ever mentions the word ''avatar'' as a noun.&lt;ref name="Bassuk1987p3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel E Bassuk |title=Incarnation in Hinduism and Christianity: The Myth of the God-Man |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k3iwCwAAQBAJ |year=1987|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-349-08642-9 |pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verb roots and form, such as ''avatarana'', do appear in ancient post-Vedic Hindu texts, but as "action of descending", but not as an incarnated person (avatara).{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=415-417}} The related verb ''avatarana'' is, states Paul Hacker, used with double meaning, one as action of the divine descending, another as "laying down the burden of man" suffering from the forces of evil.{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=415-417}}

The term is most commonly found in the context of the Hindu god [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsavatar/&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldavatar/&gt; The earliest mention of Vishnu manifested in a human form to empower the good and fight against evil, uses other terms such as the word ''sambhavāmi'' in verse 4.6 and the word ''tanu'' in verse 9.11 of the [[Bhagavad Gita]],{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=98-99}} as well as other words such as ''akriti'' and ''rupa'' elsewhere.{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=405-409}} It is in medieval era texts, those composed after the sixth century CE, that the noun version of avatar appears, where it means embodiment of a deity.{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=424, also 405-409, 414-417}} The incarnation idea proliferates thereafter, in the [[Purana|Puranic]] stories for many deities, and with ideas such as ''ansha-avatar'' or partial embodiments.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=98-99}}&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldavatar&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Avatar" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pages 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

While Avatars of other deities such as [[Ganesha]] and [[Shiva]] are also mentioned in medieval Hindu texts, this is minor and occasional.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Shiva" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 635&lt;/ref&gt; The incarnation doctrine is one of the important differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=laiengavatar&gt;{{cite book|author=Lai Ah Eng |title=Religious Diversity in Singapore |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9MmNaNebFD8C |year=2008|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore|isbn=978-981-230-754-5|pages=221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ryanjonesavatar&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones |author2=James D.

===Avatar versus incarnation===
The translation of avatar as "incarnation" has been questioned by Christian theologists, who state that an incarnation is in flesh and imperfect, while avatar is mythical and perfect.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=107-109}}&lt;ref name="Matchett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matchett|first=Freda|title=Krishna, Lord or Avatara?: the relationship between Krishna and Vishnu|publisher=9780700712816|year=2001|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1oqTYiPeAxMC&amp;pg=PA4 | isbn=978-0-7007-1281-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theological concept of Christ as an incarnation, as found in [[Christology]], presents the Christian concept of incarnation. This, state Oduyoye and Vroom, is different from the Hindu concept of avatar because avatars in Hinduism are unreal and is similar to [[Docetism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mercy Amba Oduyoye, H. M. Vroom, ''One gospel&amp;nbsp;– many cultures: case studies and reflections on cross-cultural theology'', Rodopi, 2003, {{ISBN|978-90-420-0897-7}}, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheth disagrees and states that this claim is an incorrect understanding of the Hindu concept of avatar.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=108}}{{Refn|group=note|Buddha, a real person, is included as an avatar of Vishnu in many Hindu texts.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=99}}}} Avatars are true embodiments of spiritual perfection, one driven by noble goals, in Hindu traditions such as [[Vaishnavism]].{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=108}}

==Islam==
Mainstream [[Islam]] completely rejects the doctrine of the incarnation of God in any form, as the concept is defined as ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]''. In mainstream Islam God is one and "neither begets nor is begotten".&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, (112:1-4).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{main|God in Judaism}}
{{see also|Chabad-Lubavitch related controversies}}
Mainstream [[Judaism]] totally rejects any doctrine of an incarnation of God and absolutely rejects any concept of an incarnation of God in any form.&lt;ref&gt;L. Jacobs 1973 ''A Jewish Theology'' p. 24.  N.Y.: Berman House&lt;/ref&gt; However, some [[Hasidism|Hasidim]] believe in a somewhat similar concept. [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], a prominent [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] leader, said that the ''[[Rebbe]]'' is God's essence itself put into a body of a ''[[tzadik]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Likkutei Sichos'', Vol. 2, pp. 510-511.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serer religion==
[[Serer religion]] rejects any notion of an incarnation or manifestation of ''[[Roog (Serer deity)|Roog]]'' (the supreme deity in [[Serer religion]]), called [[Koox]] among the [[Cangin languages|Cangin]]. However, the [[reincarnation]] (''ciiɗ'')&lt;ref name=faye&gt;Faye, Louis Diène, ''Mort et Naissance Le Monde Sereer'', Les Nouvelles Edition Africaines (1983), pp 9-10, {{ISBN|2-7236-0868-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[reincarnation#Serer religion|ancient Serer saints and ancestral spirits]], called ''[[Pangool]]'', is a well held principle in Serer religion. These Pangool (singular : ''Fangool'') act as intermediaries between the living world and the Devine. When the Serers speak of incarnation, it is these Pangool they refer to, who are themselves holy by virtue of their intercession with the Divine.&lt;ref name=faye/&gt;&lt;ref name="Religio"&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Issa Laye Thiaw|Thaiw, Issa Laye]], « La religiosité des Seereer, avant et pendant leur islamisation », in ''Éthiopiques, no. 54, volume 7, 2e semestre 1991 [http://ethiopiques.refer.sn/spip.php?article1248]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], ''La civilisation sereer, Cosaan:  les origines'', vol.1, Nouvelles Editions africaines (1983), p 33, {{ISBN|2-7236-0877-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wodden Carvings of the Bululs.jpg|thumb|Wooden images of the ancestors (''[[Bulul]]'') in a museum in [[Bontoc, Mountain Province|Bontoc]], [[Mountain Province]], [[Philippines]]]]
Various terms have been used to refer to the '''religious beliefs of the 175 ethnolinguistic groups of the Philippines''', where each had their own form of indigenous government prior to colonization from Islam and Spain. They are characterized as being [[Animism|animistic]], and have been collectively referred to as '''Anitism''' or '''Bathalism''' or the more modern and less Tagalog-centric '''Dayawism'''.&lt;ref name="Almocera2005"&gt;Almocera, Ruel A., (2005) Popular Filipino Spiritual Beliefs with a proposed Theological Response. in Doing Theology in the Philippines.

The profusion of different terms arises from the fact that these indigenous religions mostly flourished in the pre-colonial period before the Philippines had become a single nation.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Scott  | first = William Henry  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian)   | coauthors =  | title = Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society  | publisher = Ateneo de Manila University Press  | date = 1994  | location = Quezon City  | isbn = 971-550-135-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The various peoples of the Philippines spoke different languages and thus used different terms to describe their religious beliefs.   While these beliefs can be treated as separate religions, scholars have noted that they follow a "''common structural framework of ideas''" which can be studied together.&lt;ref name="SitoyJr1985"/&gt;

Some writers have noted that these beliefs have similarities with the [[Shinto]] religion of [[Japan]], although they do not draw a historical linkage between the two belief systems.&lt;ref name="Gutierrez2017"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=mYEoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=anito+Philippines+shinto&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eXCig7dTQ9&amp;sig=1HJUBcwvyTpVNsBipF2PStnEh-U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-sLWXt9TXAhWBuZQKHam4BhQQ6AEIggEwDg#v=onepage&amp;q=anito%2520Philippines%2520shinto&amp;f=false |title=Mixed Magic: Global-local Dialogues in Fairy Tales for Young Readers |last=Gutierrez |first=Anna Katrina |date=2017-06-15 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |isbn=9789027265456 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; More historically linked are the various indigenous religious beliefs the various religions of Oceania and the maritime Southeast Asia, which draw their roots from Austronesian beliefs as those in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborne2004"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Osborne  | first = Milton  | authorlink = Milton Osborne  | coauthors =  | title = Southeast Asia: An Introductory History  | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin  | date = 2004  | location = Australia  | pages =  | volume =  | edition = Ninth  | url =  | doi =  | id =    | isbn = 1-74114-448-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, an estimated 2% of the Philippine population identified as practicing indigenous beliefs - the majority of whom live in isolated areas where [[Islam]], [[Catholicism]], or [[Protestantism]] have not become dominant. Since the entrance of the 21st century, streams of Christian and Muslim Filipinos are steadily reverting to their indigenous ethnic religions that were once branded as lowly by Spanish, American, and Arabians colonizers, but have been affirmed by the social sciences as comprehensive and highly in nature.&lt;ref name=pew&gt;[http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/philippines/religious_demography Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project: Philippines]. [[Pew Research Center]]. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, many aspects of these traditions have been integrated into the local practice of Catholicism and Islam, resulting in syncretistic practices called "[[Folk Catholicism]]"&lt;ref name="Almocera2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt; and "[[Folk Islam]]".&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;

The folklore narratives associated with these religious beliefs constitute what is now called [[Philippine mythology]], and is an important aspect of the study of [[Philippine culture]] and [[Filipino psychology]].

== Religious worldview ==
{{Main|Anito}}
[[File:Ifugao sculpture Louvre 70-1999-4-1.jpg|thumb|15th century ''[[bulul]]'', an ''[[anito]]'' representation, with a ''pamahan'' (ceremonial bowl) in the [[Louvre Museum]]]]
Historian T. Valentino Sitoy, in his review of documents concerning pre-Spanish religious beliefs, notes that three core characteristics which shaped the religious worldview of Filipinos throughout the archipelago before the arrival of Spanish colonizers. First, Filipinos believed in the existence of parallel [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]], which was invisible but had an influence on the visible world.  Second, Filipinos believed that there were spirits (''[[anito]]'') everywhere - ranging from the high creator gods to minor spirits that lived in the environment such as trees or rocks or creeks. Third, Filipinos believed that events in the human world were influenced by the actions and interventions of these spirit beings.&lt;ref name="SitoyJr1985"/&gt;

''Anito'' were the [[ancestor spirit]]s (''umalagad''), or nature spirits and deities (''[[diwata]]'') in the indigenous [[Animism|animistic]] religions of [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|precolonial Philippines]]. ''Paganito'' (also ''maganito'' or ''anitohan'') refers to a [[séance]], often accompanied by other rituals or celebrations, in which a shaman ([[Visayan languages|Visayan]]: ''[[babaylan]]'', [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''[[katalonan]]'') acts as a [[mediumship|medium]] to communicate directly with the spirits. When a nature spirit or deity is specifically involved, the ritual is called ''pagdiwata'' (also ''magdiwata'' or ''diwatahan''). ''Anito'' can also refer to the act of worship or a religious sacrifice to a spirit.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rosa"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Sánchez de la Rosa|title =Diccionario Hispano-Bisaya para las provincias de Samar y Leyte, Volumes 1-2|publisher =Tipo-Litografia de Chofre y Comp.|year =1895|page=414|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=7EwHAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Spanish missionaries arrived in the Philippines, the word "''anito''" came to be associated with the physical representations of spirits that featured prominently in ''paganito'' rituals. During the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American rule of the Philippines (1898–1946)]], the meaning of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''idolo'' ("a thing worshiped") has been further conflated with the English word "[[Cult image|idol]]", and thus ''anito'' has come to refer almost exclusively to the carved figures or statues (''taotao'') of ancestral and nature spirits.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sawyer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic H. Sawyer|title =The Inhabitants of the Philippines|publisher =Charles Scribner's Sons|year =1900|url =https://archive.org/details/inhabitantsofphi00sawy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief in ''anito'' is sometimes referred to as [[anitism]] in scholarly literature (Spanish: ''anitismo'' or ''anitería'').&lt;ref name="hislop"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephen K. Hislop|year=1971|title=Anitism: a survey of religious beliefs native to the Philippines |journal=Asian Studies|volume=9|issue=2|pages=144&amp;ndash;156|url=http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-09-02-1971/hislop-anitism-survey-religious%20beliefs-native-philippines.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deities and spirits ==
{{Main|Deities of Philippine mythology}}

=== Creator gods in Filipino religions ===
Many indigenous Filipino cultures assert the existence of a high god, creator god, or sky god.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991" /&gt;  Among the Tagalogs, the supreme god was known as [[Bathala]], who was additionally described as Maykapal (the all-powerful) or  Lumikha (the creator).  Among the Visayan peoples the creator God is referred to as [[Laon]], meaning "the ancient one."  Among the Manuvu, the highest god was called Manama.  Among most of the Cordilleran peoples (with the Apayao region as an exception), the creator and supreme teacher is known as [[Kabuniyan]].&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991" /&gt;

In most cases, however, these gods were considered such great beings that they were too distant for ordinary people to approach.&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt;  People thus tended to pay more attention to "lesser gods" or "assistant deities" who could more easily approached, and whose wills could more easily be influenced.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt;

=== "Lower gods" in Filipino religions===
Lesser deities in Filipino religions generally fit into three broad categories: nature spirits residing in the environment, such as a mountain or a tree; guardian spirits in charge of specific aspects of daily life such as hunting or fishing; and deified ancestors or tribal heroes.  These categories frequently overlap, with individual deities falling into two or more categories, and in some instances, deities evolve from one role to another, as when a tribal hero known for fishing becomes a guardian spirit associated with hunting.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;

==Filipino folk healers==
{{Unreferenced section|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}
During the pre-Hispanic period, ''[[babaylan]]'', functioned as shamans and spiritual leaders and ''[[mananambal]]'' were for folk healers.  At the onset of the Colonial era, the suppression of the ''babaylans'' and the native Filipino religion gave rise to the ''[[albularyo]]''. By exchanging the native prayers and spells with Catholic ''oraciones'' and Christian prayers, the albularyo was able to synchronize the ancient mode of healing with the new religion.

''Albularyos'' employ herbs, [[alum]], coconut oil, etc., in their healing practices as well as various prayers, chants and "supernatural" cures—especially for cases involving supernatural causes. As time progressed, the ''albularyo'' became more prominent in rural areas in the Philippines. Lacking access to scientific medical practices, rural Filipinos trusted the ''albularyos'' to rid them of common (and sometimes believed to be supernatural) sicknesses and diseases.

However, the role of the ''albularyo'' was slowly overshadowed by the rise of modern medical facilities. Urbanization gave the masses access to more scientific treatments, exchanging the chants and herbs of the ''albularyos'' with the newer technologies offered by the medical field. Still, ''albularyos'' flourish in many rural areas in the Philippines where medical facilities are still expensive and sometimes inaccessible.

===Rituals===
Some of the rituals observed by Filipino Folk Healers include:
*''Pangalap'' - the aforementioned yearly search for concoction ingredients
*''Halad'' - ritual offering of food and drink to honor the spirits of the dead
*''Palínà'' - ritual fumigation; called ''tu-ob'' in the islands of [[Panay]] and [[Negros Island|Negros]]
*''Pangadlip'' - the chopping or slicing of ''pangalap'' ingredients 
*''Pagpagong'' - burning or reducing the ingredients into charcoal or ashes
*Making of ''Minasa'' - concoctions made from the ''pangalap'' ingredients 
*Rubbing with ''Lana'' - medicinal oil concocted from [[coconut]]

The term was introduced in 2004 by [[Mario De Caro]] &amp; [[David Macarthur]]&lt;ref&gt;De Caro, M. &amp; Macarthur, D. ''Naturalism in Question'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, April 2004), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and, independently, by [[Gregg Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Gregg, ''A Place for Consciousness: Probing the Deep Structure of the Natural World'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, November 2004), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of naturalism has been ascribed to [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Robert, ''Kant, Science, and Human Nature''. Clarendon Press, 2006, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
For a liberal naturalist many things in our everyday world that are not explicable (or not fully explicable) by science are, nonetheless, presupposed by science—e.g. tables, persons, artworks, institutions, rational norms and values. Explaining such things might require non-scientific non-supernatural resources according to this form of naturalism. So, rather than tailoring their [[ontology]] to the posits of the successful sciences, as scientific naturalists do, liberal naturalists recognise the prima facie irreducible reality of everyday objects that are part of what [[Wilfrid Sellars]] called "the manifest image".&lt;ref&gt;Sellars, W. ''Science, Perception &amp; Reality'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1963), ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal naturalism is a "liberal"&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, J. ''Mind, Value and Reason'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1998), ch. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[Catholic (term)|catholic]]"&lt;ref&gt;Strawson, P. ''Skepticism and Naturalism: Some Varieties'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; naturalism for several reasons each of which contrasts with scientific naturalist orthodoxy:
# As we have seen, it does not limit its ontological commitments to the explanatory posits of the successful sciences. 
# It acknowledges the existence of non-scientific modes of knowing and/or understanding such things as the value of artworks, the moral dimension of persons, and the relations between reasons of different kinds;&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, H. "Pragmatism and Nonscientific Knowledge" in ''Hilary Putnam: Pragmatism and Realism'', ed. Urszula M. Zeglen and James Conant (London and New York: Routledge, 2002), 14-24&lt;/ref&gt; 
# It allows for distinctively 1st-personal aspects of [[rational agent|rational agency]] such as [[decision making|making up one's mind]], taking [[personal responsibility|responsibility for one's actions]], and [[self-consciousness]];&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, J. ''Mind and World'' (Cambridge Mass: Harvard University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;
# It attempts to provide a non-reductive non-supernatural account of the rational or conceptual normativity to which we are responsive in theoretical and practical reasoning, e.g., by appeal to the Hegelian or pragmatist idea of mutual acknowledgement in a community;&lt;ref&gt;Macarthur, D. "Pragmatism, Metaphysical Quietism and the Problem of Normativity" in ''Philosophical Topics'', vol 36 no. 1 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
# It challenges the widely influential Quinean thesis that philosophy, when properly naturalized, must limit itself to the methods of the successful sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. ''Theories and Things'' (Cambridge Mass: Harvard University Press, 1981), ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of [[angel]]s in [[theology]]''', including both specific angels (e.g. [[Gabriel]]) and types of angels (e.g. [[Seraphim]]).

Note that some overlap is to be expected with the [[list of theological demons]] entry, since various traditions have different classifications for the spirits they mention.

{{Eschatology}}
The following topics pertain to [[eschatology]], a part of [[theology]], [[physics]], [[philosophy]] and [[futurology]] concerned with what are believed to be the final events of [[history of the world|history]], the [[Destiny|ultimate destiny]] of humanity — commonly referred to as the "end of the world" or "[[end time]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0503181v1.pdf ''Scientific Eschatology''], H.Pierre Noyes, James Lindesay, 2005, Cornell University, SLAC-PUB-11063&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Living Interfaith Church''' is a religious unity founded by Steven Greenebaum and based in [[Lynnwood, Washington]], United States, which embraces the teachings of all [[spirituality|spiritual]] paths that lead people to seek a life of compassionate action.&lt;ref name=meetup&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.meetup.com/Living-Interfaith-Church/|title=Living Interfaith Church|work=[[Meetup (website)]]| accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interfaith, as a faith, does not seek to discover which religion or spiritual path is "right". Rather, it recognizes that everyone is brother and sister, and that at different times and different places we have encountered the [[sacred]] differently.&lt;ref name=meetup/&gt;

==General information==
===The religion===
Living Interfaith Church celebrates differing spiritual paths. They claim that what is the same  in every [[religion]] is the call to compassion, the call to think beyond ourselves, and to recognize that we are all connected.  Interfaith "calls upon us not to ignore our differences, but to rather to respect them, and to realize that each of our paths, in their own special and different way, call us to love and to be loving".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://livinginterfaith.org/?page_id=120|work=livinginterfaith.org|author=|title=Living Interfaith Church FAQ’s |date=| accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church views Interfaith as a faith that celebrates humanity's differing spiritual paths. It believes that a person's actions in this world are what count and that humanity is called to engage the world, both with compassion and with love. A stated tenet of the church is to respect all faith traditions and not to ignore their importance or their differences. [[Christianity]] is acknowledged as different from [[Buddhism]]. [[Islam]] is acknowledged as different from [[Humanism]], and so forth. According to the movement, the claim of Interfaith as a faith is that what is the same within all of humanity’s spiritual paths is the call to compassion, to thinking beyond ourselves, and to recognizing that we are all connected.&lt;ref name="Living Interfaith Church FAQ"&gt;{{cite web | title=Living Interfaith Church FAQ’s | website=Living Interfaith Church | date=July 13, 2013 | url=http://www.livinginterfaith.org/living-interfaith-church-faqs/ | access-date=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenebaum stated that "interfaith, as a spiritual practice, can serve as a new model for how we deal with each other and a new vision for how we act on our religious beliefs to live compassionate lives and share the world in harmony."&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swift|first=Diana|title=Why Faith is Better Than Religion|journal=Anglican Journal|date=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===The founder===
Reverend Steven Greenebaum, the founder of the Living Interfaith Church, grew up as a [[Reform Jew]] in suburban [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/us/a-religion-that-embraces-all-religions.html?_r=1&amp; |work=|author= Samuel G. Freedman|title=A Church That Embraces All Religions and Rejects ‘Us’ vs. ‘Them’| date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has a [[Master's degree]] in [[Mythology]], [[Music]], and [[Pastoral]] Studies. His experiences directing [[Jewish]], [[Methodist]], [[Presbyterian]], and [[Interfaith]] choirs have helped him to understand the profound wisdom of many spiritual traditions. He has dedicated his life to working for social and environmental justice through a multitude of forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.newsociety.com/Contributors/G/Greenebaum-Reverend-Steven|work=|author=|title= Reverend Steven Greenebaum
| date=| accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about his entity, he explained: “My faith is Interfaith. My spiritual path is Judaism. My tribe is Humanity. I’m also a minister, choir director, and vegetarian.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.meetup.com/Living-Interfaith-Church/members/13440755/ |work=|author=|title=Rev. Steven Greenebaum| date=| accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;

In 2012 he published his first book [https://www.amazon.com/The-Interfaith-Alternative-Embracing-Spiritual/dp/0865717052/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1377031846&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+interfaith+alternative ''The Interfaith Alternative: Embracing Spiritual Diversity''] through [[New Society Publishers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://livinginterfaith.org/?page_id=125|work=|author=|title= Meet Reverend Steven Greenebaum| date=| accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His second book, [https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Interfaith-Humanity-Celebrate-Diversity/dp/1594735697/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467067037&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=practical+interfaith''Practical Interfaith''], was published by [http://www.skylightpaths.com/ ''Skylight Paths''] in 2014.

{{Anthropology of religion}}
[[Millenarianism]] has been found through history among people who rally around often-apocalyptic religious prophecies that predict a return to power, the defeat of enemies, and/or the accumulation of wealth. These movements have been especially common among people living under [[colonialism]] or other forces that disrupt previous social arrangements.

The phrase "millennialist movement" has been used by scholars in anthropology and history to describe the common features of these religious phenomena when viewed as [[social movements]], and has most often been used to describe the social movements that have taken place in colonized societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burridge|first=Kenelm|title=New Heaven, New Earth: A study of Millenarian Activities|year=1969|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity itself can be seen as originating in a millenarian movement among [[Jewish people]] living under Roman rule, although its characteristics as a social movement quickly changed as it spread through the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Book of Revelation]] also predicts a thousand-year reign of [[Jesus]] prior to the defeat of [[Satan]]. 

Some millenarian movements include:
* The [[Ghost Dance]] movement among Native Americans.
* [[Tenskwatawa]] the "Shawnee Prophet" called for return to ancestral ways and defeat of European colonial power.
* The [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] cattle-killing movement of [[South Africa]], led by the prophetess [[Nongqawuse]].
* The [[Righteous Harmony Society]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] was a Chinese movement reacting against Western colonialism.
* The [[God Worshipping Society]] of the [[Taiping Rebellion]], which fused Anglo-American [[Protestant]] Christian and Chinese elements into a movement that focused the resentment of [[Han Chinese]] against the ruling [[Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]]. [[Hong Xiuquan]], their leader, proclaimed himself to be the second son of [[God]] and brother of [[Jesus Christ]], as well as the [[Son of Heaven|''Tian Zi'' (Son of Heaven)]], a sacred title of the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]]. He would establish the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]], which controlled much of southern China from 1851-1864.  
* The [[Maji Maji Rebellion]] was influenced by an African [[spirit medium]] who gave his followers war medicine that he said would turn German bullets into water.
* [[Bábism]] and [[Bahá'í faith|Bahá'ism]], two [[Perennial philosophy|perennialist]] movements founded in [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Persia]] by self-proclaimed prophets.
* The [[Mahdist State]] in [[Sudan]], which was established by [[Muhammad Ahmad]], who proclaimed himself the [[Mahdi]] and led a [[Mahdist War|jihad]] against the [[History of Sudan (1821-1885)|Khedive of Egypt's rule over the Sudan]] and the [[British Empire]]. 
* [[Chilembwe uprising]] - a 1915 uprising in [[Nyasaland]] led by a millenarian priest
* The Melanesian [[John Frum]] [[cargo cult]] believed in a return of their ancestors brought by Western technology.
* [[Burkhanism]] was an [[Altay people|Altay]]an movement led by a visionary that reacted against [[Russification]].
* The [[Battle of Kuruyuki]] was the 1892 attempt of the [[Eastern Bolivian Guarani]] to combat Christianity and Bolivian settlers.   
* The [[Guaycuru|Guaycuruan]]-speaking [[Toba people|Toba]] attempted to regain control of the [[Gran Chaco]] in Argentina in 1904.
* The [[Tepehuán Revolt]] in 1620s Mexico was an attempt to expel Spanish colonists and priests and return to traditional ways.

The '''Open Episcopal Church''' (OEC) is a liberal Christian denomination. It has bishops in England and Wales and clergy throughout the United Kingdom and internationally. It has over 29,000 members.&lt;ref name="Members"&gt;[http://www.openepiscopalchurch.org/organisation/organisation.html Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

The church was the first in Britain to ordain a woman as bishop and to perform religious wedding ceremonies for gay couples.

The OEC is a member of the [[International Council of Community Churches]], which in turn is a member of The [[World Council of Churches]] and [[Churches Uniting in Christ]].

==History==
=== Founding of the Society for Independent Christian Ministry ===
In 1994 Jonathan Blake, who had been a priest in the [[Church of England]] for over 12 years, effected a Deed of Relinquishment,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/33-34/91/section/3&lt;/ref&gt; severing his denominational ties. 

As an independent priest&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/have-dog-collar-will-travel-counselling-dance-workshops-conflict-resolution-arbitration-exorcism----jim-white-meets-the-countrys-first-freelance-vicar-1444165.html The Independent - on 'Country's first freelance vicar'.]&lt;/ref&gt; he offered sacramental ministry to all. In 1997 he wrote about these experiences in his book, ''For God's Sake Don't Go To Church''.&lt;ref name="For God's Sake Don't Go To Church"&gt;For God's Sake Don't Go To Church {{ISBN|0-85305-446-0}} Published by Arthur James.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he nailed 95 theses&lt;ref name="95 Theses"&gt;[http://www.bishopjonathanblake.com/theses.htm 95 Theses]&lt;/ref&gt; to the door of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], for which he was arrested but not charged.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christian-alternative.com/authors/archbishop-jonathan-blake]&lt;/ref&gt;

A lesbian from the north of England arranged to meet Blake after reading his book. She felt a call to the ministry but had been rebuffed by the church over her sexuality and was interested in independent ministry. Following the meeting Blake placed an advert in the ''[[Church Times]]'' inviting all those interested in such a ministry to a conference the following March. Over 100 people contacted him, among them Richard Palmer,&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;[http://www.lcc.cc/tlc/lxv1/europe1.htm Richard Palmer]&lt;/ref&gt; who had been consecrated as a bishop of the [[Liberal Catholic Church]] in 1997, but had resigned in April 1999. 

Blake wrote the Founding Principles&lt;ref name="The Founding Principles"&gt;[http://www.sicm.eu/736.html The Founding Principles]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Society for Independent Christian Ministry (SICM), which was inaugurated by a group of Christians reciting the [[Lord’s Prayer]] in the Sanctum of the Holy Circle Trust&lt;ref name="The Holy Circle Trust"&gt;The Holy Circle Trust. Charity Number 1066062&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Ryarsh]] in [[Kent]] at sunrise on 1 January 2000.

In February 2001, Blake conducted the first gay wedding blessing on Richard and Judy's prime time TV programme ''This Morning''.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1170214.stm BBC News - Gay Wedding on Richard and Judy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Founding of the Open Episcopal Church ===

By the time SICM met for the third time in Bournemouth, Palmer required those who had been ordained simply in Dartford to be ordained ''sub conditione'' at this gathering in a full rite of ordination. Blake realized that a new denomination had to be founded and set about writing the necessary canons.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

At [[Hazlewood Castle]], Michael Wilson&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/archive/2004/08/07/Lancashire+Archive/5825155.Rent_a_bishop_at_your_service Michael Wilson]&lt;/ref&gt; was consecrated a bishop by Palmer and Blake. The three bishops issued the "Hazlewood Declaration" on 10 November 2001, which facilitated the creation of the Open Episcopal Church. The church viewed itself as being in succession from the [[Old Catholic Church]], which had been established in England in 1908 by [[Arnold Mathew]] from See of Utrecht and continued through the [[Liberal Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openepiscopalchurch.org/about/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next year, the Society of Independent Christian Ministry and the Open Episcopal Church coexisted, but the differences between them made this untenable, and at Liverpool in October 2002 it was decided finally that thereafter they should separate, following  similar paths, and containing many of  the same people, but with two distinct approaches.

The first significant meeting of the College of Bishops of the Open Episcopal Church took place in London in July 2002, prior to the separation of the Open Episcopal Church and the Society for Independent Christian Ministry at Liverpool in October of that year.

[[Elizabeth Stuart (theologian)|Elizabeth Stuart]] was consecrated as a bishop at the Royal Holloway Chapel, the college chapel of the [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, the University of London, Egham]] in Surrey, in April 2003. This was the first consecration of a woman as an independent Catholic bishop in the UK. 

The first congress of the church was held at the [[All Saints Pastoral Centre]] in June 2004. The church's college of bishops met at Weston Manor in Oxfordshire in January 2005 and Wilson, an evangelical, resigned from the Church. The second congress was held at [[Whaley Hall]] at Whaley Bridge in mid 2005. In October, Roger Whatley&lt;ref name="Whatley"&gt;[http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=75762 Roger Whatley]&lt;/ref&gt; was consecrated a bishop in the Chapel of the [[Ammerdown House, Kilmersdon|Ammerdown Conference Centre]].

===Development===
The church has had three archbishops: Richard Palmer, who left the church along with Roger Whatley after the allotted five-years of Palmer's tenure as archbishop ended; Elizabeth Stuart, who left the church in 2006 and was appointed the Archbishop of the Province of Great Britain and Ireland of the more traditionalist [[Liberal Catholic Church International]]; and Jonathan Blake, OEC's founder, who was the church's sole remaining bishop after Stuart left.

In 2008 the Open Episcopal Church became a member of the [[International Council of Community Churches]] and through them, a member of the [[World Council of Churches]] and [[Churches Uniting in Christ]].&lt;ref name="ICCCC"&gt;[http://www.icccnow.org/Europe/  ICCCC.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The church received national and international attention due to the wedding blessing Blake conducted for [[reality television]] figures [[Jade Goody]] and [[Jack Tweed]],&lt;ref name="Jade Goody's Wedding"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/4779170/Jade-Goodys-wedding-The-final-preparations.html Jade Goody's Wedding]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Mail Wedding"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1150757/Roof-stunt-archbishop-line-conduct-Jades-wedding.html Daily Mail - Goody's wedding]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Damian Thomspon's blog"&gt;[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/8679611/Jade_Goody_Archbishop_Blake_and_the_strange_phenomenon_of_wandering_bishops Damian Thompson's blog]&lt;/ref&gt; through interviews broadcast after Jade Goody's  death,&lt;ref name="After death"&gt;[http://www.talktalk.co.uk/video/11383/news/Bishop-praises-Jade/#36029 Talk Talk News Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; through the prayer released before Jade Goody's funeral,&lt;ref name="Prayer"&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/04/03/jade-goody-s-funeral-what-the-star-planned-for-her-last-journey-115875-21249010 Prayer for Jade]&lt;/ref&gt; through Blake's response to [[Michael Parkinson]]'s criticism of Goody,&lt;ref name="Criticism of Jade"&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Jade-Goody-Bishop-Jonathan-Blake-Hits-Back-At-Sir-Michael-Parkinsons-Criticism/Article/200904215258069 Sky News - criticism of Jade]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph - Criticism"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/jade-goody/5123450/Bishop-hits-back-at-Sir-Michael-Parkinson-comments-on-Jade-Goody.html Daily Telegraph - criticism of Jade]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Mirror - criticism of Jade"&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/04/08/jade-goody-s-wedding-bishop-defends-her-against-sir-michael-parkinson-s-criticism-115875-21263483 Daily Mirror - criticism of Jade]&lt;/ref&gt; through the launch of Post the Host (an outreach provision to distribute the consecrated Hosts by post),&lt;ref&gt;

Following Jade Goody's wedding, Christopher Woods, Chaplain and Director of Studies in Theology at Christ's College, Cambridge, called upon the Church of England to speak out against Blake and the OEC. The Church of England declined to comment.&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article5786676.ece Revd Woods criticism]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pralaya''' ([[Sanskrit]]), in [[Hindu cosmology]], is an aeonic{{what|date=November 2018}} term for ''dissolution'', which specifies different periods of time during which a non-activity situation persists, as per different formats or contexts. The word Mahapralaya stands for ''Great Dissolution''. During each pralaya, the lower ten realms ([[loka]]) are destroyed,&lt;ref name=shivp&gt;{{cite book |title=Shiv Purana|author=B. K. Chaturvedi|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|year=2004|isbn=8171827217 |page=124 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bchgql0em9YC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=Swargaloka&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LuXJT7TDN4OyrAeBoajSDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Swargaloka&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the higher four realms, including [[Satya-loka]], Tapa-loka, Jana-loka, and Mahar-loka are preserved.  During each Mahapralaya, all 14 realms are destroyed.

In the [[Samkhya]] philosophy, one of the six schools of classical [[Indian philosophy]], Pralaya means "non-existence", a state of matter achieved when the three gunas (principles of matter) are in perfect balance. The word pra-laya comes from Sanskrit meaning 'dissolution' or by extension 'reabsorption, destruction, annihilation or death'.

==Pralaya in popular culture==
The word pralaya appears in the Cyclops chapter of [[James Joyce]]'s epic novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

"Pralaya" appears in the [[Shin Megami Tensei: Persona|Persona]] series of games (specifically ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]'') as an attack. While it can be inherited to other Personae, its original user is "Shiva", a Persona based on the [[Shiva|Hindu deity of the same name]].

Pralaya is also the name of an antagonist in the [[DC Comics]] series ''[[Justice League Dark]]'' who appears in the series' final arc, threatening to destroy the fictional multiverse.

Pralaya is an otter-like alien wizard who is sometimes [[Demonic_possession|overshadowed]] by the [[Young_Wizards#The_Lone_Power|Lone Power]] in Diane Duane's [[Young Wizards]] novel, ''[[The Wizard's Dilemma]]''.

The Swedish metal band, [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]], references "Mahapralaya" in their song, "Maha Kali".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1885">The '''Religious Experience Research Centre''' was founded by the distinguished marine biologist Professor [[Alister Hardy]] FRS in 1969 as The Religious Experience Research Unit. He and his co-researchers began to gather a unique archive of accounts of [[religious experience]] and to publish research into the area. The maintenance of both the archives and the research and publications have continued. The Centre organises conferences and produces both books and a series of Occasional Papers on religious experience and spirituality.

Sir Alister was awarded the ''[[Templeton Prize]] for Progress In Religion'' in 1985 and the Centre has since received a grant from the Templeton Foundation for the computerisation of the archives. The Centre was located at [[Manchester College, Oxford]] from 1969-1989 and from 1989–1999 at [[Westminster College, Oxford]]. In 2000 the Centre moved to the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]]
(presently University of Wales, Trinity Saint David). 

The directors of the Centre are currently Greg Barker, Bettina Schmidt and Sally Wilkinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsd.ac.uk/en/lrc/librariesandcentres/alisterhardyreligiousexperienceresearchcentre/contacts/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328113909/http://www.tsd.ac.uk/en/lrc/librariesandcentres/alisterhardyreligiousexperienceresearchcentre/contacts/ |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Codex Vaticanus B, 2Thess. 3,11-18, Hebr. 1,1-2,2.jpg|thumb|The [[Septuagint]]: A page from ''[[Codex Vaticanus]]'']]
'''Religious texts''' (also known as scripture, or scriptures, from the [[Latin]] ''scriptura'', meaning "writing") are texts which religious traditions consider to be central to their practice or beliefs. Religious texts may be used to provide meaning and purpose, evoke a deeper connection with the [[divine]], convey religious truths, promote [[religious experience]], foster communal identity, and guide individual and communal religious practice. Religious texts often communicate the practices or values of a religious traditions and can be looked to as a set of guiding principles which dictate physical, mental, spiritual, or historical elements considered important to a specific religion. The terms 'sacred' text and 'religious' text are not necessarily interchangeable in that some religious texts are believed to be [[sacred]] because of their nature as [[Divinity|divinely]] or [[supernatural]]ly [[Revelation|revealed]] or [[Divine Revelation|inspired]], whereas some religious texts are simply narratives pertaining to the general themes, practices, or important figures of the specific religion, and not necessarily considered sacred by itself. A core function of a religious text making it sacred is its ceremonial and liturgical role, particularly in relation to sacred time, the [[liturgical year]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, the [[Liturgy of the Hours|divine efficacy]] and subsequent holy service; in a more general sense, its performance.

It is not possible to create an exhaustive list of religious texts, because there is no single definition of which texts are recognized as religious.

== History of religious texts ==
{{See also|History of religions|Timeline of religion|History of writing}}
One of the oldest known religious texts is the [[Kesh Temple Hymn]] of Ancient [[Sumer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kramer|first=Samuel|year=1942|title=The Oldest Literary Catalogue: A Sumerian List of Literary Compositions Compiled about 2000 B.C.|url=|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|volume=88|pages=10–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanders|first=Seth|year=2002|title=Old Light on Moses' Shining Face|url=|journal=Vetus Testamentum|volume=52|pages=400–406|via=EbscoHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; a set of inscribed clay tablets which scholars typically date around 2600 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Princess_priestess_poet.html?id=X3ALAQAAMAAJ|title=Princess, priestess, poet: the Sumerian temple hymns of Enheduanna|last=Enheduanna|last2=Meador|first2=Betty De Shong|date=2009-08-01|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292719323|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] from [[Sumer]], although only considered by some scholars as a religious text, has origins as early as 2150-2000 BCE, and stands as one of the earliest literary works that includes various [[mythological]] figures and themes of interaction with the divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=eCZRK_61adMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=religion+in+the+epic+of+gilgamesh&amp;ots=30kD2623sQ&amp;sig=9EjuqoN4QViNQQtmposUYgEjVgg#v=onepage&amp;q=religion&amp;f=false|title=The Epic of Gilgamesh: The Babylonian Epic Poem and Other Texts in Akkadian and Sumerian|last=George|first=Andrew|date=2002-12-31|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780140449198|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]] of ancient [[Hinduism]] is estimated to have been composed between 1700–1100 BCE, which not only denotes it as one of the oldest known religious texts, but also one of the oldest written religious text which is still actively used in religious practice to this day, though no actual evidence of this text exists prior to the 13th century AD.

There are many possible dates given to the first writings which can be connected to Talmudic and Biblical traditions, the earliest of which is found in scribal documentation of the 8th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://contradictionsinthebible.com/the-yahwist-2/|title=The Yahwist|date=2012-12-23|newspaper=Contradictions in the Bible|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by administrative documentation from temples of the 5th and 6th centuries BCE,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=F7USWMRAwGYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=first+writing+of+torah&amp;ots=iaIwVQlUOw&amp;sig=Tmec5mzl647UARFgSvmb57Et6-E#v=onepage&amp;q=BCE&amp;f=false|title=Torah in the Mouth: Writing and Oral Tradition in Palestinian Judaism 200 BCE-400 CE|last=Jaffee|first=Martin S.|date=2001-04-19|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198032236|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with another common date being the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although a significant text in the history of religious text because of its widespread use among religious denominations and its continued use throughout history, the texts of the Abrahamic traditions are a good example of the lack of certainty surrounding dates and definitions of religious texts.

High rates of mass production and distribution of religious texts did not begin until the invention of the printing press in 1440,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/press.html|title=The History Guide|website=www.historyguide.org|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; before which all religious texts were hand written copies, of which there were relatively limited quantities in circulation.

== Associated terminology ==
A religious canon refers to the generally accepted, uniform, and often unchanging collection of texts which a religious denomination considers comprehensive in terms of their specific application of texts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, the content of a [[Protestant Bible]] may differ from the content of a [[Catholic Bible]] - insofar as the Protestant Old Testament does not include the [[Deuterocanonical books]] while the Roman Catholic canon does.  Protestants and Catholics use the same 27 book NT canon, as well as the same 39 book OT protocanon, also shared by Jews.

The word "canon" comes from the Sumerian word meaning "standard".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Canon Debate|last= Ulrich|first= Eugene|publisher= |year= 2002|isbn= |location= |pages= 21–35|chapter= The Notion and Definition of Canon|quote= |via= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "scripture" and variations such as "Holy Writ", "Holy Scripture" or "Sacred Scripture" are defined by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as terms which specifically apply to Biblical text and the [[Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/scripture|title= scripture - definition of scripture in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website= Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date= 2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=January 2017}}

Hierographology ([[Ancient Greek]]: ἱερός, ''hieros'', "sacred" or "holy"; γραφή, ''graphe'', "writing"; λόγος, ''logos'', "word" or "reason") ([[archaism|archaically]] also '[[hierology (textual criticism)|hierology]]') is the study of sacred texts.

;[[Christianity|Traditional Christianity]]
* The [[Bible]] (the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]]). The Apostolic churches (Catholicism and Orthodoxy) also include the [[Biblical apocrypha|Deuterocanonicals]].
** For '''[[Protestantism]]''', this is the 66-book canon - the [[Jewish]] [[Tanakh]] of 24 books divided differently (into 39 books) and the universal 27-book [[New Testament]]. Some denominations also include the 15 books of the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] between the Old Testament and the New Testament, for a total of 81 books.
** For '''[[Catholicism]]''', this includes seven [[deuterocanonical books]] in the Old Testament for a total of 73 books, called the [[Canon of Trent]] (in versions of the Latin Vulgate, [[3 Esdras]], [[4 Esdras]], and the [[Prayer of Manasseh]] are included in an appendix, but considered non-canonical).
** For the '''[[Eastern Orthodox Church]]''', this includes the ''[[anagignoskomena]]'', which consist of the Catholic deuterocanon, plus [[3 Maccabees]], [[Psalm 151]], the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], and [[3 Esdras]]. [[4 Maccabees]] is considered to be canonical by the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Orthodox also generally divide Baruch and Letter of Jeremiah into two books instead of one. The enumeration of the Books of Ezra is different in many Orthodox Bibles, as it is in all others: see Wikipedia's article on [[Esdras|the naming conventions of the Books of Esdras]].&lt;/ref&gt;
** The '''[[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]''' (and its offspring, the [[Eritrean Orthodox Church]]) adds various additional books depending on the specific enumeration of the canon (see [[Ethiopian Biblical canon]]), but always includes 4 Esdras, the [[Book of Jubilees]], [[1 Enoch]], [[4 Baruch]], and [[Meqabyan|1, 2, and 3 Meqabyan]] (no relation to the Books of Maccabees).
** Some '''[[Syriac Christianity|Syriac churches]]''' accept the [[Letter of Baruch]] as scripture.

'''Religious tourism in India''' is focus of [[Narendra Modi]]'s national tourism policy. [[Uttarakhand]] has been popular as a religious and adventure tourism hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=U’khand eyes wellness tourism |url=http://timesofindia.com/city/dehradun/Ukhand-eyes-wellness-tourism/articleshow/50977552.cms |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=13 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahesh Sharma]] said, "In view of religious tourism, Ramdevera and Tanot would also be linked to a tourism circuit in western Rajasthan."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Small cities to be linked with air services: Sharma |url=http://wap.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/small-cities-to-be-linked-with-air-services-sharma-116021200523_1.html |work=[[Business Standard]] |date=12 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious tourism has been one of the reason of developing India. India is widely known for its wonderful religious places which are nowhere seen in world. Many places like '''Kashi Vishwanath, Omkareshwar, Mahakaleshwar, Gangotri, Yamunotri, Badrinath, Kedarnath of lord Shiva are most visited places in India. Even people from USA and UK come to India to visit these places.'''

'''Repentance''' is the activity of [[Examination of conscience|reviewing one's actions]] and feeling [[contrition]] or regret for past wrongs, which is accompanied by commitment to change for the better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geEADgAAQBAJ |title=Justice for All: How the Jewish Bible Revolutionized Ethics |author=Jeremiah Unterman |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2017 |page=109 |isbn=0827612702 |quote=The modern definition of "to repent," according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', is "To review one's actions and feel contrition or regret for something one has done or omitted to do; (esp. in religious contexts) to acknowledge the sinfulness of one's past action or conduct by showing sincere remorse and undertaking to reform in the future."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is generally seen as involving a commitment to personal change and the resolve to live a more responsible and humane life.  In other words, being sorry for one's misdeeds. But it can also involve sorrow over a specific sin or series of sins that an individual feels he or she has committed. The practice of repentance plays an important role in the [[Soteriology|soteriological doctrines]] of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, in which it is often considered necessary for the attainment of [[salvation]]. Analogous practices have been found in other world religions as well. In religious contexts, it often involves an act of [[Confession (religion)|confession]] to God or to a spiritual elder (such as a monk or priest). This typically includes an admission of [[culpability|guilt]], a promise or resolve not to repeat the offense; an attempt to make restitution for the wrong, or in some way to reverse the harmful effects of the wrong where possible. As such, it can be seen as having a certain relationship to modern day therapeutic practices though it clearly differs in its particulars.

==Etymology==
In [[Biblical]] [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the idea of repentance is represented by two verbs: שוב ''shuv'' (to return) and נחם ''nacham'' (to feel sorrow). In the [[New Testament]], the word translated as 'repentance' is the Greek word μετάνοια (''metanoia''), "after/behind one's [[mind]]", which is a compound word of the preposition 'meta' (after, with), and the verb 'noeo' (to perceive, to think, the result of perceiving or observing). In this compound word, the preposition combines the two meanings of time and change, which may be denoted by 'after' and 'different'; so that the whole compound means: 'to think differently after'. ''Metanoia'' is therefore primarily an after-thought, different from the former thought; a change of mind and change of conduct, "change of mind and heart", or, "change of consciousness". metanoia: change of mind, repentance
Original Word: μετάνοια, ας, ἡ
Part of Speech: Noun, Feminine
Transliteration: metanoia
Phonetic Spelling: (met-an'-oy-ah)
Short Definition: repentance, a change of mind
Definition: repentance, a change of mind, change in the inner man.

==Abrahamic religion==
The doctrine of repentance as taught in the [[Bible]] is a call to persons to make a radical turn from one way of life to another. The repentance (''metanoia'') called for throughout the Bible is a summons to a personal, absolute and ultimate unconditional surrender to God as Sovereign. Though it includes sorrow and regret, it is more than that. It is a call to ''conversion'' from self-love, self-trust, and self-assertion to obedient trust and self-commitment to God.&lt;ref name=Stagg&gt;Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology.'' Broadman Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}, pp. 118-119&lt;/ref&gt; It is a change of mind that involves a conscious turning away from wrong actions, attitudes and thoughts that conflict with a Godly lifestyle and biblical commands, and an intentional turning toward doing that which the Bible says pleases God. In repenting, one makes a complete change of direction (180° turn) toward God. The words "repent," "repentance," and "repented" are mentioned over 100 times in the Bible.&lt;ref name=Stagg/&gt;

Repentance typically requires an admission of [[culpability|guilt]] for committing a wrong or for omitting to do the right thing; a promise or resolve not to repeat the offense; an attempt to make restitution for the wrong, or in some way to reverse the harmful effects of the wrong or the omission where possible.

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Repentance in Judaism}}
{{Bibleref2|Ezekiel|14:6}} says, "Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations."

[[Rabbinic literature|Rabbinic Jewish literature]] contains extensive discussions on the subject of repentance. Many rabbinic sources state that repentance is of paramount importance to the existence of this world, so that it was one of the seven provisions which God made before the Creation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud]] Bavli, tractates Pesahim 54a; Nedarim 39b; [[Midrash]] Genesis Rabbah 1&lt;/ref&gt; "The Holy One, blessed be His name, said to Elijah, 'Behold, the precious gift which I have bestowed on my world: though a man sins again and again, but returns in penitence, I will receive him.'&amp;nbsp;"&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 28b&lt;/ref&gt; "Great is repentance: it brings healing into the world"; "it reaches to the throne of the Lord";{{Bibleref2c|Hosea|14:2,5}} "it brings redemption";{{Bibleref2c|Isaiah|59:20}} "it prolongs man's life";{{Bibleref2c|Ezekiel|18:21}} Talmud Yoma 86a).
"Repentance and works of charity are man's intercessors before God's throne".&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Shabbath 32a&lt;/ref&gt; Sincere repentance is equivalent to the rebuilding of the Temple, the restoration of the altar, and the offering of all the sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;(Pesiqta, ed. Buber, 25:158; [[Midrash]] Leviticus Rabbah 7; [[Talmud]] Sanhedrin 43b)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sincere repentance is manifested when the same temptation to sin, under the same conditions, is ever after resolutely resisted.&lt;ref&gt;([[Talmud]] Yoma 86b; [[Mishneh Torah]] ''Teshuva'' 2:1-2)&lt;/ref&gt; "He that confesses his sin and still clings to it is likened to a man that holds in his hand a defiling object; though he batheth in all the waters of the world he is not cleansed; but the moment he casteth the defiling object from him a single bath will cleanse him, as it is said: 'Whosoever confesses and forsakes them [his sins] shall have mercy'&amp;nbsp;".{{Bibleref2c|Prov.|28:13}}&lt;ref&gt;([[Talmud]] Taanith 16a; [[Mishneh Torah]] ''Teshuva'' 2:3)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jewish doctrine, repentance is the prerequisite of [[Atonement in Judaism|atonement]].&lt;ref&gt;([[Mishna]] Yoma Chapter 8, 8)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yom Kippur]], the day of atonement, derives its significance only from the fact that it is the culmination of the ten penitential days with which the Jewish religious year begins; and therefore it is of no avail without repentance&lt;ref&gt;Midrash Sifra, Emor, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Though man ought to be penitent every day,&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishna]] Avoth Chap 2, 10; [[Talmud]] Shabbath 153a&lt;/ref&gt; the first ten days of every year are the acceptable time announced by the prophet Isaiah: "Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near".{{Bibleref2c|Isaiah|55:6}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud]] Rosh Hashan 18a; [[Mishneh Torah]] ''Teshuva'' 2:6&lt;/ref&gt;

Repentance and the Day of Atonement only absolve one from sins committed against God; from sins against another person they absolve only when restitution has been made and the pardon of the offended party has been obtained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud]] Yoma 87a; [[Mishneh Torah]] ''Teshuva''2:9&lt;/ref&gt;

No one need despair on account of his or her sins, for every penitent sinner is graciously received by God.{{Bibleref2c|Jeremiah|31:9}} Jewish doctrine holds that it is never too late, even on the day of death, to return to God with sincere repentance for "as the sea is always open for every one who wishes to cleanse himself, so are the gates of repentance always open to the sinner".&lt;ref&gt;(Pesiqta., ed. Buber, xxv. 157; Midrash Deuteronomy Rabbah ii.; Midrash Psalms lxiii.)&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish doctrine states that the hand of God is continually stretched out to receive a sinner.&lt;ref&gt;(Talmud Pesachim 119a; Deuteronomy Rabbah ii)&lt;/ref&gt; One view in the Talmud holds that a repentant sinner attains a more exalted spiritual eminence than one who has never sinned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud]] Berakhoth 34b.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a sin to taunt a repentant sinner by recalling their former sinful ways.&lt;ref&gt;([[Talmud]] Bava Metsia 58b; [[Mishneh Torah]] ''Teshuva'' 8:8)&lt;/ref&gt;

Repentance occupies a prominent position in all the ethical writings of the Middle Ages. [[Bahya ibn Paquda]] devotes a special section to it in his 'Hovot ha-Levavot", "Gate of Repentance." [[Maimonides]] devotes the last section of "Sefer ha-Madda'" in his [[Mishneh Torah]] to the subject. One of the most significant medieval works on Repentance is "Shaarei Teshuva," the "Gates of Repentance" by [[Yonah Gerondi|Rabbeinu Yona of Gerona]].

In the Hebrew Bible, repentance generally leads to salvation. In some cases, individuals or nations repent of their [[sin]]s and are spared God's judgment. Sometimes the punishment avoided is destruction in this life, and sometimes it is [[damnation]].&lt;ref&gt;In the Hebrew Bible, the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|4:7}}; {{Bibleref2|Leviticus|4, 5}}; {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|4:30}}; {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|30:2}}; {{Bibleref2|1 Kings|8:33, 48}}; {{Bibleref2|Hosea|14:2}}; {{Bibleref2|Jeremiah|3:12,31:18,36:3}}; {{Bibleref2|Ezekiel|18:30-32}}; {{Bibleref2|Isaiah|54:22,55:6-10}}; {{Bibleref2|Joel|2:12}}; {{Bibleref2|Jonah|2:10}}).&lt;/ref&gt; In the Book of Jonah, the prophet initially chose to disobey God's command, and then he repented and became obedient. However, Jonah returned to disobedience when he hoped for the destruction of the city of [[Nineveh]]. The Hebrew term ''teshuvah'' (lit. "return") is used to refer to "repentance". This implies that transgression and [[sin]] are the natural and inevitable consequence of man's straying from God and [[613 mitzvot|His laws]],&lt;ref&gt;(comp. Deut. 11:26-28; Isa. 1:4; Jer. 2:13, 16:11; Ezek. 18:30)&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is man's destiny and duty to be with God. The Bible states that God's loving-kindness is extended to the returning sinner.

The [[Torah]] (five books of Moses) distinguishes between offenses against God and offenses against man. In the first case, the manifestation of repentance consists in: (1) [[Confession in Judaism|Confession]] of one's sin before God,{{Bibleref2c|Lev.|5:5}} {{Bibleref2c|Num.|5:7}} the essential part being a solemn promise and firm resolve not to commit the same sin again. (2) Making certain prescribed offerings.{{Bibleref2c|Lev.|5:1-20}} Offenses against man require, in addition to confession and sacrifice, restitution in full of whatever has been wrongfully obtained or withheld from one's fellow man, with one-fifth of its value added thereto.{{Bibleref2c|Lev.|5:20-26}} If the wronged man has died, restitution must be made to his heir; if he has no heir, it must be given to the priest who officiates at the sacrifice made for the remission of the sin.{{Bibleref2c|Num.|5:7-9}}

There are other manifestations of repentance mentioned in the Bible. These include pouring out water,&lt;ref&gt;(I Sam. 7:6; according to the Targum&lt;/ref&gt; which symbolizes the pouring out of one's heart before God;&lt;ref&gt;comp. Jerusalem Talmud Ta'anit 68d;Midrash Tehilim cxix.; [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 2:19);&lt;/ref&gt; prayer&lt;ref&gt;(II Sam. 12:16);&lt;/ref&gt; self-affliction, as fasting; wearing [[sackcloth]]; sitting and sleeping on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;(I Kings 21:27; Joel 2:13; Jonah 3:5).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Prophets disparaged all such outer manifestations of repentance, insisting rather on a complete change of the sinner's mental and spiritual attitude.{{Bibleref2c|Hosea|14:1-2}} "Rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger and plenteous in mercy, and repenteth him of the evil".{{Bibleref2c|Joel|2:13}} In {{Bibleref2|Isaiah|55:7}}, the Bible states that repentance brings pardon and forgiveness of sin. Apart from repentance, no other activities, such as sacrifices or religious ceremonies can secure pardon and forgiveness of sin.

=== Christianity ===
{{Main|Repentance (Christianity)}}
In the [[New Testament]], one of many examples of repentance in the New Testament can be found in the [[parable]] of the [[prodigal son]] found in {{Bibleref2|Luke|15:11ff}}. Other instances of repentance included water baptism, restitution, and the burning of occultic possessions.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Bibleref2|Matt.|11:20-21}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|1:4}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|19:8}}; {{Bibleref2|Acts|19:19}}. Such deeds are called "fruits fit for repentance".{{Bibleref2c|Matt.|3:8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repentance appears prominently in the [[Scriptures]]. See the description of repentance in the [[Hebrew Bible]] above for repentance in the [[Old Testament]]. In the [[New Testament]], the first command that Jesus gave was to repent.{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|4:17}} He thus repeated the message of [[John the Baptist]].{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|3:2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicexchange.com/gospel-imperative-repent/|title=Gospel imperative: Repent!|date=26 January 2008|website=Catholicxexchange.com|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus sent out disciples who "proclaimed that people should repent".{{Bibleref2c|Mark|6:12}} In his [[Pentecost]] sermon, [[Peter the Apostle]] called on people to repent,{{Bibleref2c|Acts|2:38}} an appeal he repeated in his sermon at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple: "Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out".{{Bibleref2c|Acts|3:19}} [[Paul the Apostle]] likewise testified "both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God"{{Bibleref2c|Acts|20:21}} and said that "The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent".{{Bibleref2c|Acts|17:30}}

The [[Greek language|Greek]] word used for repentance in the New Testament is μετάνοια [[Metanoia (theology)|(''metanoia'')]],&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=meta/noia|title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, μετάνοια|website=Perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblesuite.com/greek/3341.htm|title=Strong's Greek: 3341. μετάνοια (metanoia) -- change of mind, repentance|website=biblesuite.com|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Greek verb for "to repent" is μετανοῶ, contracted from μετανο-έω (''metano-eo''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=metanoe/w|title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, μετανο-έω|website=Perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblesuite.com/greek/3340.htm|title=Strong's Greek: 3340. μετανοέω (metanoeó) -- to change one's mind or purpose|website=biblesuite.com|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark's]] account of the initial preaching of Jesus: "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; ''repent'', and believe in the good news."

In English, the prefix ''meta'' can indicate "beyond, about", as "meta-economics" or "meta-philosophy" (see [[meta]]), inspired by the non-Greek use of the word "metaphysics", which in Greek was just the title of a work of [[Aristotle]], the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', so named simply because in the customary ordering of the works of Aristotle it was the book following the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''; the Greek word thus meant nothing more than "[the book that comes] after [the book entitled] ''Physics''". In Greek, composite words that have μετα- (''meta-'') as the initial element are most frequently used "of ''change'' of place, condition, plan, etc.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=meta/|title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, μετά|website=Perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in the English word "[[metamorphosis]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/metamorphosis|title=Metamorphosis definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=Collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in a non-religious context, the Greek word μετάνοια (''metanoia''), in particular, meant "change of mind or heart, repentance" or, in rhetoric, "afterthought, correction".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==== Protestantism ====
=====Lutheran=====
[[File:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|235px|Martin Luther's 1534 bible]]
The [[Augsburg Confession]], (known in Latin as Confessio Augustana), is the primary confession of faith used in the Lutheran Church. It is one of the most important documents of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. It divides repentance into two parts:

*"One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the [[Law and Gospel#Book of Concord|knowledge of sin]];"
*"The other is faith, which is born of the Gospel, or of [[Absolution#Lutheran Church|absolution]], and believes that for Christ's sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article12|title=Augsburg Confession - Book of Concord|website=Bookofconcord.org|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Calvinism=====
In the Calvinist tradition within Protestantism, there is a threefold idea involved in true repentance. The Protestant reformer [[John Calvin]] wrote that repentance "may be justly defined to be a true conversion of our life to God, proceeding from a serious [[fear of God (religion)|fear of God]], and consisting in the mortification of the flesh and of the old man, and in the vivification of the Spirit.” He further said that "it will be useful to amplify and explain the definition we have given; in which there are three points to be particularly considered".[[File:Calvin 1562.jpg|thumb|200px|John Calvin at 53 in an engraving by [[René Boyvin]].]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the first place, when we call repentance 'a conversion of the life to God', we require a transformation, not only in the external actions, but in the soul itself; which, after having put off the old nature, should produce the fruits of actions corresponding to its renovation.... &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the second place, we represented repentance as proceeding from a serious fear of God. For before the mind of a sinner can be inclined to repentance, it must be excited by the knowledge of the Divine judgment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It remains for us, in the third place, to explain our position, that repentance consists of two parts—the mortification of the flesh and the vivification of the spirit.... Both these branches of repentance effects our participation of Christ. For if we truly partake of his death, our old man is crucified by its power, and the body of sin expires, so that the corruption of our former nature loses all its vigor.... If we are partakers of his resurrection, we are raised by it to a newness of life, which corresponds with the [[righteousness]] of God." [Quotes from ''A Compend of the Institutes of the Christian Religion'' by John Calvin edited by Hugh T. Kerr, The Westminster Press-Philadelphia 1939.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Repentance in Islam}}
The word ''tawbah'' (repentance) in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] literally means 'to return', and is mentioned in the [[Quran]]. In an Islamic context, it refers to the act of leaving what Allah has prohibited and returning to what he has commanded. The act of repentance can redeem the sins and give the opportunity to go to heaven:

:O you who have believed, repent to Allah with sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord will remove from you your misdeeds and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow [on] the Day when Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believed with him. Their light will proceed before them and on their right; they will say, "Our Lord, perfect for us our light and forgive us. Indeed, You are over all things." [''At-Tahriim'' 66:8]

Although repentance is considered as one act that can be used for cleansing the sins, the Quran notes that all of the sins are forgiven with or without repentance except the state of [[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]], i.e. the act of worshiping another deity besides Allah. The believing person must repent for shirk sin and seek the forgiveness of Allah. Two verses are giving comments regarding Shirk, ''An-Nisaa'' 4:48 and 4:116.

:Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin. [''An-Nisaa'' 4:48]

Islam does not accept the concept of [[original sin]]; instead, it teaches that a person is born in a state of innocence and pure belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|28|46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person remains in that state of sinlessness until reaching the age of puberty, after which he is accountable for his sins.

== Buddhism ==

The Buddha considered shame over doing wrong ([[Pali]]: ''hiri'') and fear of the consequences of wrongdoing (Pali:''otappa'') as essential safeguards against falling into evil ways and further as extremely useful in the [[Eightfold Path|path of purification]]. Also recommended was the regular practice of self-assessment or wise reflection (Pali: ''yoniso manasikara'') on one's own actions in relation to others and the bigger picture.

In Mahayana Buddhism, one of the most common repentance verses used for reflection is Samantabhadra's Repentance Verse taken from Chapter 40 of the Flower Adornment Sutra:
&lt;poem&gt;
 For all the evil deeds I have done in the past 
 Created by my body, mouth, and mind, 
 From beginningless greed, anger, and delusion, 
 I now know shame and repent of them all.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cttbusa.org/avatamsaka/avatamsaka40_1.asp|title=City of 10,000 Buddhas - Sutra Texts - The Avatamsaka Sutra 40|website=Cttbusa.org|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Hawaiian tradition ==
{{Main|Hawaiian religion}}
[[Ho'oponopono|''Ho{{okina}}oponopono'']] (ho-o-pono-pono) is an ancient Hawaiian practice of reconciliation and forgiveness, combined with (repentance) prayers. Similar forgiveness practices were performed on islands throughout the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], including Samoa, Tahiti and New Zealand. Traditionally ''ho{{okina}}oponopono'' is practiced by healing priests or ''[[kahuna]] lapa{{okina}}au'' among family members of a person who is physically ill. Modern versions are performed within the family by a family elder, or by the individual alone.

Some scholars prefer the terms "'''sacred sex'''" or "'''sacred sexual rites'''" to "sacred prostitution" in cases where payment for services was not involved. 

==Ancient Near East==
[[File:Ishtar vase Louvre AO17000-detail.jpg|100px|thumb|[[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]] depicted wearing the ceremonial [[headdress]] of the [[high priestess]]]]
[[Ancient Near East]]ern societies along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers featured many shrines and temples or ''houses of heaven'' dedicated to various [[deities]]. The 5th-century BC historian Herodotus's account and some other testimony from the [[Hellenistic Period]] and [[Late Antiquity]] suggest that ancient societies encouraged the practice of sacred sexual rites not only in [[Babylonia]] and [[Cyprus]], but throughout the [[Near East]].

According to [[Herodotus]], the rites performed at these temples included sexual intercourse, or what scholars later called sacred sexual rites:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The foulest Babylonian custom is that which compels every woman of the land to sit in the temple of [[Aphrodite]] and have intercourse with some stranger at least once in her life. Many women who are rich and proud and disdain to mingle with the rest, drive to the temple in covered carriages drawn by teams, and stand there with a great retinue of attendants.  But most sit down in the sacred plot of Aphrodite, with crowns of cord on their heads; there is a great multitude of women coming and going; passages marked by line run every way through the crowd, by which the men pass and make their choice.  Once a woman has taken her place there, she does not go away to her home before some stranger has cast money into her lap, and had intercourse with her outside the temple; but while he casts the money, he must say, "I invite you in the name of [[Mylitta]]".  It does not matter what sum the money is; the woman will never refuse, for that would be a sin, the money being by this act made sacred. So she follows the first man who casts it and rejects no one. After their intercourse, having discharged her sacred duty to the goddess, she goes away to her home; and thereafter there is no bribe however great that will get her. So then the women that are fair and tall are soon free to depart, but the uncomely have long to wait because they cannot fulfil the law; for some of them remain for three years, or four. There is a custom like this in some parts of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+1.199 1.199], tr A.D. Godley (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The British anthropologist [[James Frazer]] accumulated citations to prove this in a chapter of his magnum opus ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890–1915),&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Frazer, ''The Golden Bough'', abridged edition (1922), [[s:The Golden Bough/Adonis in Cyprus|Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus]]; see also the more extensive treatment in the 3rd edition of ''The Golden Bough'', volumes 5 and 6 (published 1914). Frazer's argument and citations are reproduced in slightly clearer fashion by Fernando Henriques, ''Prostitution and Society: a study'' (3 vols., London : MacGibbon &amp; Kee, 1962–1968), vol. I, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and this has served as a starting point for several generations of scholars. Frazer and Henriques distinguished two major forms of sacred sexual rites: temporary rite of unwed girls (with variants such as dowry-sexual rite, or as public [[defloration]] of a bride), and lifelong sexual rite.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Henriques, ''Prostitution and Society: a study'' (3 vols., London : MacGibbon &amp; Kee, 1962–1968), vol. I, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Frazer took his sources mostly from authors of [[Late Antiquity]] (i.e. 150–500 AD), not from the Classical or [[Hellenistic period]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] are the only sources mentioned by Frazer that were active prior to the 2nd century AD; his other sources include [[Deipnosophistae|Athenaeus]], [[De Dea Syria|pseudo-Lucian]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], and the Christian church historians [[Sozomen]] and [[Socrates of Constantinople]].&lt;/ref&gt; This raises questions as to whether the phenomenon of temple sexual rites can be generalized to the whole of the ancient world, as earlier scholars typically did. 

The research of Daniel Arnaud, Vinciane Pirenne-Delforge, Julia Assante, Stephanie Budin&lt;ref name = "Budin"/&gt; and others has cast the whole tradition of scholarship that defined the concept of sacred prostitution into doubt. Budin regards the concept of sacred prostitution as a myth—arguing that the practices described in the sources simply never existed. A more nuanced view, espoused by Pirenne-Delforge, suggests that ritual sex did exist in the Near East, but not in the Greek or Roman worlds in classical or Hellenistic times.&lt;ref name = "Budin"/&gt;

===Sacred marriage===

The practice of sacred prostitution has not been substantiated in any [[Ancient Near East]]ern cultures, despite many popular descriptions of the habit.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Frazer]] (1922), ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', 3e, [[s:The Golden Bough/Adonis in Cyprus|Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus]]&lt;/ref&gt; Through the twentieth century, scholars generally believed that a form of ''sacred marriage'' rite or ''[[hieros gamos]]'' was staged between the king of a [[Sumer]]ian city-state and the High Priestess of [[Inanna]], the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian goddess]] of sexual love, fertility, and warfare, but no certain evidence has survived to prove that sexual intercourse was included. Along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers there was a temple of Eanna, meaning ''house of heaven''&lt;ref&gt;é-an-na = sanctuary ('house' + 'Heaven'[='An'] + genitive) [John Halloran's Sumerian Lexicon v. 3.0 – see link below]&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to [[Inanna]] in the Eanna District of [[Uruk]].&lt;ref&gt;Modern-day [[Warka (Iraq)|Warka]], Biblical [[Erech]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While there may well have been some religious prostitution in the temples of [[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]], Assante suggests the concept of the 'sacred marriage' (''[[hieros gamos]]'') has been misunderstood. It was previously believed to have been a custom whereby the king coupled with the high priestess to represent the union of [[Dumuzid, the Shepherd|Dumuzid]] with [[Inanna]] (later called [[Ishtar]]).&lt;ref name=Day_2004&gt;John Day, "Does the Old Testament Refer to Sacred Prostitution and Did it Actually Exist in Ancient Israel?", in ''Biblical and Near Eastern Essays: Studies in Honour of Kevin J. Cathcart'', eds. Carmel McCarthy &amp; John F Healey (Continuum International Publishing, 2004), 2–21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is much more likely that these unions never occurred but were embellishments to the image of the king; hymns which praise Middle Eastern kings for coupling with the goddess [[Ishtar]] often speak of him as running 320 kilometres, offering sacrifices, feasting with the sun-god [[Utu]], and receiving a royal crown from [[Anu|An]], all in a single day. One scholar comments: "No one, to the best of my knowledge, has been so wooden-minded to propose that human actors played the role of Utu and An at the banquet."&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, R. "A New Look at the 'Sacred Marriage' in Ancient Mesopotamia", in E. Robbins and S. Sandahl, eds., Corolla Torontonensis. Studies in Honour of Ronald Morton Smith (Toronto, 1994) 85–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all authors are convinced, however.&lt;ref name=Day_2004 /&gt;

Other modern historians argue that the temple did house priestesses of the goddess, but there is no evidence that they performed any kind of sexual services in any [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]].&lt;ref&gt;Budin, Stephanie Lynn, ''The Myth of Sacred Prostitution in Antiquity''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Assante, Julia 1998.

===Code of Hammurabi===
In [[code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi's code of laws]], the rights and good name of female sacred sexual priestesses were protected.  The same legislation that protected married women from slander applied to them and their children. They could inherit property from their fathers, collect income from land worked by their brothers, and dispose of property. These rights have been described as extraordinary, taking into account the role of women at the time.&lt;ref&gt;The Sacred Prostitute: Eternal Aspect of the Feminine By Nancy Qualls-Corbett&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hebrew Bible===
The [[Hebrew Bible]] uses two different words for prostitute, ''zonah'' (זונה)&amp;lrm;&lt;ref name="zanah"&gt;Associated with the corresponding verb ''zanah''.{{cite web|title=Genesis 1:1 (KJV)|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&amp;strongs=h2181|website=[[Blue Letter Bible]]|accessdate=5 April 2018|language=en}} incorporating [[Strong's concordance]] (1890) and [[Gesenius]]'s Lexicon (1857). Also transliterated ''qĕdeshah'', ''q&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;deshah'', ''qědēšā'' ,''qedashah'', ''kadeshah'', ''kadesha'', ''qedesha'', ''kdesha''. A modern liturgical pronunciation would be ''k'deysha''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''kedeshah'' (or ''qedesha'') (קדשה)&amp;lrm;.&lt;ref name="zanah" /&gt; The word ''zonah'' simply meant an ordinary prostitute or ''loose woman''.&lt;ref name="zanah" /&gt; But the word ''kedeshah'' literally means ''consecrated'' (feminine form), from the Semitic root ''[[Q-D-Sh|q-d-sh]]'' (קדש)&amp;lrm; meaning ''holy'' or ''set apart''.&lt;ref name="zanah" /&gt; In spite of the cultic significance of a ''kedeshah'' to a follower of the [[Canaanite religion]], two verses makes it clear that cultic prostitution had no place within Yahweh's worship. {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:17-18|NIV}}:

{{quote|None of the daughters of Israel shall be a ''kedeshah'', nor shall any of the sons of Israel be a ''kadesh''.

You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute (''zonah'') or the wages of a dog (''kelev'') into the house of the Lord your God to pay a vow, for both of these are an abomination to the Lord your God.}}

[[Stephen O. Murray]] writes that biblical passages ban ''qdeshim'' and link them with gods and "forms of worship detested by orthodox followers of Yahweh".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Stephen O. |title=Homosexualities |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2002 |page=295 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HCikDlcEHw8C|isbn=9780226551951 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Celia Brewer Sinclair has written that "the ethical demands of the covenant preclude worshiping Yahweh in licentious sexual rites (sacred sexual rites )".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sinclair |first1=Mashal |last2=Brewer |first2=Celia |title=A Guide Through the Old Testament |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=1989 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NopUi53PC0YC|isbn=9780804201247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Male priests who engaged in same-sex sacred prostitution were called ''kadesh'' or ''qadesh'' (literally: male ''holy one''); the word evolved semantically in ancient Hebrew to take on a similar meaning to ''sodomite''.&lt;ref name="rictornorton.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/homopho1.htm|title=A History of Homophobia: 1 The Ancient Hebrews|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source|sure=y|reason=topic is out of author's scope and area of expertise, essay is unsourced and does not represent scholarly consensus re: ancient history and Biblical studies|date=August 2017}} The Hebrew word ''kelev'' (dog) in the next line may also signify a male dancer or prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&amp;strongs=h3611 Lexicon results for ''kelev'' (Strong's H3611)], incorporating [[Strong's Concordance]] (1890) and [[Gesenius]]'s Lexicon (1857).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some scholars see the injunctions against foreign worship, including male sacred prostitution, as possibly the original cause of what would later become Judaism's condemnation of sexual contact between men.&lt;ref name="rictornorton.co.uk"/&gt;{{Unreliable source|sure=y|reason=topic is out of author's scope and area of expertise, essay is unsourced and does not represent scholarly consensus re: ancient history and Biblical studies|date=August 2017}}

The Law of Moses (Deuteronomy) was not universally observed in Hebrew culture under the rule of King David's dynasty, as recorded in Kings.  In fact Judah had lost "the Book of the Law".  During the reign of King Josiah, The high priest Hilkiah discovers it in "the House of the Lord" and realizes that the people have disobeyed, particularly regarding Sacred Prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;2 Kings 22:8&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, Marvin A. King Josiah of Judah, Oxford University Press, 2001, p.137. {{ISBN|978-0-19-513324-0}}]&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of male temple prostitution ("sodomites" [KJV, GNV]) being banned under King Josiah are recorded to have been commonplace since the reign of King Rehoboam of Judah (King Solomon's son). &lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 14:24, 1 Kings 15:12 and 2 Kings 23:7 &lt;/ref&gt;.  Modern bible translations refer to King Josiah's bans on "male temple prostitutes" [NRSV] or similarly "male shrine prostitutes" [NIV], where as older translations refer to the ban of "Sodomites" and "the Houses of the Sodomites" [KJV, GNV].  Under the polytheistic religious practices that were commonplace, homosexuality experienced a degree of cultural acceptance along with heterosexuality among the Hebrew tribes, but sacred prostitution was not allowed in conjunction with the worship of Yahweh, where these had been expressly forbidden in Deuteronomy, their sacred Book of Law under King Josiah.

In the [[Book of Ezekiel]], [[Oholah and Oholibah]] appear as the allegorical brides of God who represent [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] and Jerusalem. They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. The prophet Ezekiel condemns both as guilty of religious and political alliance with heathen nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=OHOLIBAH|title=NETBible: Oholibah|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

So within Hebrew cultures involving pagan religions, both homosexual and heterosexual pagan temple prostitution experienced periods of acceptance, and periods of banishment, as under King Josiah.

===Sumer===
According to the noted Assyriologist [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], kings in the ancient Near Eastern region of [[Sumer]] established their legitimacy by taking part in a ritual sexual act in the temple of the fertility goddess Ishtar every year on the tenth day of the New Year festival [[Akitu]].&lt;ref&gt;S. N. Kramer, ''The Sacred Marriage Rite: Aspects of Faith, Myth and Ritual in Ancient Sumer''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hittites===
The [[Hittites]] practiced sacred prostitution as part of a cult of deities, including the worship of a mated pair of deities, a bull god and a lion goddess, while in later days it was the mother-goddess who became prominent, representing fertility, and (in Phoenicia) the goddess who presided over human birth.&lt;ref&gt;Nagendra Kr Singh, ''Divine Prostitution'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=nYEdPoGAaz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 6], (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient Greece and Hellenistic World ==

===Ancient Greece===
{{Main|Prostitution in ancient Greece#Temple prostitution in Corinth}}
In [[ancient Greece]], sacred prostitution was known in the city of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] where the [[Temple of Aphrodite (Corinth)|Temple of Aphrodite]] employed a significant number of female servants, ''hetairai'', during [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Strabo|title=Geographica|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/8F*.html|location=VIII.6.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek term ''hierodoulos'' or ''hierodule'' has sometimes been taken to mean ''sacred holy woman'', but it is more likely to refer to a former slave freed from slavery in order to be ''dedicated'' to a god.&lt;ref name = "Budin"&gt;Stephanie Budin, ''The Myth of Sacred Prostitution in Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009); more briefly the case that there was no sacred prostitution in Greco-Roman Ephesus by S.M.

===Hellenistic world===
In the Greek-influenced and colonized world, "sacred prostitution" was known in [[Cyprus]] (Greek-settled since 1100 BC), [[Sicily]] (Hellenized since 750 BC), in the [[Kingdom of Pontus]] (8th century BC) and in [[Cappadocia]] (c. 330 BC hellenized).{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Ancient Rome and late antiquity==

===Ancient Rome===
{{Main|Prostitution in ancient Rome#Prostitution and religion}}

===Late antiquity===
The Roman emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] closed down a number of temples to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] or similar deities in the 4th century AD, as the Christian church historian [[Eusebius]] proudly noted.&lt;ref name="3.55" /&gt; [[Eusebius]] also claimed that the [[Phoenicia]]n cities of [[Afqa|Aphaca]] and [[Baalbek|Heliopolis]] ([[Baalbek]]) continued to practise temple prostitution until the emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] put an end to the rite in the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name="3.55"&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''Life of Constantine'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lv.html 3.55] and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lviii.html 3.58]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==

===India===
In Southern [[India]] and the eastern Indian state of [[Odisha]], [[devadasi]] is the practice of hierodulic prostitution, with similar customary forms such as basavi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is child hierodulic servitude?|url=http://anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/hieroras.htm|website=[[Anti-Slavery Society]]|accessdate=5 April 2018|date= |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160102084104/http://anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/hieroras.htm |archive-date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and involves dedicating pre-pubescent and young adolescent girls from villages in a ritual marriage to a deity or a temple, who then work in the temple and function as spiritual guides, dancers, and prostitutes servicing male devotees in the temple. [[Human Rights Watch]] reports claim that devadasis are forced into this service and, at least in some cases, to practice prostitution for upper-caste members.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch. [http://hrw.org/campaigns/caste/presskit.htm Caste: Asia's Hidden Apartheid]&lt;/ref&gt; The devadasis were originally seen as interluders who allowed upper-caste men to have contact with the gods. Though they did develop sexual relations with other men, they were not looked upon with lust. The system was criticised by British rulers, leading to decline in support for the system and the devadasis were forced into entering prostitution for survival.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Fq5rDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT143&amp;dq=devadasi+sexual+relations&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBsOfhq5HdAhWBeisKHbRCDSMQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=devadasi%20sexual%20relations&amp;f=false Women, Music, Culture: An Introduction] by Julie C.

They include Bombay Devdasi Act, 1934, Devdasi (Prevention of dedication) Madras Act, 1947, Karnataka Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1982, and Andhra Pradesh Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.

===Japan===
Sacred prostitution was once practised by the [[Miko]] within traditional [[Shinto]] in [[Japan]]. There were once Shinto beliefs that prostitution was sacred, and there used to be lodgings for the temple prostitutes on the shrine grounds. This traditional practise came to an end during the beginning of the [[Meiji era]], due to the encroachment of Western Christian morality, and the government implementing the ''[[Shinbutsu bunri]]''; which, among other things, drastically decreased the roles of the Miko, and modified Shinto beliefs until it became what is now colloquially referred to as [[State Shinto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fuzoku-style-jp.com/history/shinto.html Ways of thinking that connect religion and prostitution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuly |first1=Lisa |title=Locating Transcendence in Japanese Minzoku Geinô : Yamabushi and Miko Kagura |journal=Ethnologies |date=2003 |volume=25 |issue=1 |page=198 |doi=10.7202/007130ar |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ethno/2003/v25/n1/007130ar.html |language=en |issn=1481-5974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Serer titles}}
'''Saltigue''', sometimes spelt ''Saltigué'' or wrongly ''Saltigui'', are [[Serer people|Serer]] high priests and priestesses who preside over the religious ceremonies and affairs of the Serer people, such as the ''Xoy'' ceremony, the biggest event in the Serer religious calendar.  They usually come from ancient Serer paternal families.  Such a title is usually inherited by birthright.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Gravrand. La Civilisation Seereer. Pangool.

They were the leaders of the Fulas in some Fula areas, belonging to the [[Denianke Dynasty]] of the [[Empire of Great Fulo]] founded by Koli Tengella Bâ in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;M. Th. Houtsma. E. J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam 1913–1936. BRILL. {{ISBN|90-04-08265-4}}. p 663&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that the word "''Saltigi''", used in reference to the Fulas, comes from the [[Mandinka language]], in which it means ''"master of the road"'', used in reference to their neighbors who are Fulani herders and tenders of the flock, the traditional activity of Fulani leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfrey Mwakikagile|Mwakikagile, Godfrey]],  ''Ethnic Diversity and Integration in the [[Gambia]]:'' The Land, the People and the Culture. {{ISBN|9987-9322-2-3}}. p163&lt;/ref&gt; In Serer country, ''Saltigue'', not to be confused with ''Saltigi'', are always [[Divination|diviners]]. In [[Wolof people|Wolof]] areas, they were the assistant chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Martin A., ''Islam and Imperialism in [[Senegal]] [[Sine-Saloum]], 1847–1914'', Edinburgh University Press (1968) p 262&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of this article deals only with ''Saltigue'' or ''Saltigué''  – "diviners" (the high priests and priestesses) and termed by some scholars as "the ministers of the religious cult";&lt;ref&gt;University of Texas at Austin.

==Role of Saltigues==
The Saltigues were advisers to Serer governments, for example in the old Serer Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]], [[Saloum]] and [[Baol]]. Their principal role was and still is for the prosperity of the country. In this role, they were responsible for predicting the future of kings; the weather to come (for the purposes of agriculture); any natural disaster or political catastrophe that could befall the country; etc. As such, they were frequently consulted by the Serer kings ([[Maad a Sinig]] and [[Maad Saloum]])&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Serer language]], ''Maad'' and very rarely used ''Maat'' (though correct) means "king" i.e. [[Maad a Sinig]] (King of [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]]), [[Maad Saloum]] (King of [[Saloum]]). The  [[Lamane]]s, – the ancient Serer kings and [[landed gentry]], should not be confused with the post-[[Guelowar]] Lamanes who were merely the landed gentry and provincial chiefs answerable to the king. There are two types of Lamanes in Serer chronology : Lamanes pre-Guelowar (the original Lamanes, kings and landowners) and Lamanes during and after the Guelowar period (1350–1969) (mere chiefs and landowners)&lt;/ref&gt; preferably at the beginning of the rainy season.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alioune Sarr|Sarr, Alioune]], ''Histoire du Sine-Saloum'', Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n° 3–4, 1986–1987. p31&lt;/ref&gt;

Before a king launches a war against another kingdom, or to repel an attack from another kingdom, the king consults the great assembly of Saltigues to predict the outcome of the battle, as was the case of Saltigué and ''Diaraf'' Wassaly Sene and Saltigué Laba Diene Ngom at the [[Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune]] (18 July 1867), commonly known as the Battle of Somb, during the reign of [[Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarr, Alioune . Histoire du [[Sine-Saloum]]. Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n° 3–4, 1986–1987. pp 31–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, Mahawa, ''L'information Historique: L'exemple du Siin.'' Ethiopiques n°54 revue semestrielle de culture négro-africaine. Nouvelle série volume 7 2e semestre 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, Niokhobaye, ''Chronique du Royaume du Sine'', IFAN, commenté par Charles Becker &amp; Victor Martin (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Martin A., ''Islam and Imperialism in Senegal Sine-Saloum, 1847–1914.'' [[Edinburgh University Press]] (1968), p 91&lt;/ref&gt; The assembly of Saltigues will predict the outcome, offer precautionary advice on when to launch the attack, the route to take to the battlefield and the animals to be sacrificed, etc. The role of Saltigue was not political. They are not government ministers or politicians, but spiritual advisors and elders. They are the Serer hereditary "Rain priests" – guardians of the [[Serer religion]] and customs, a birthright they inherited from their ancient [[Lamane|Lamanic]] ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Sarr, Alioune,, ''Histoire du Sine-Saloum'', Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n° 3–4, 1986–1987. p31&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[precolonialism|precolonial]] period, during the ''Raan Festival''&lt;ref&gt;See [[Serer religion]] for Raan Festival.&lt;/ref&gt; which takes place in [[Tukar]] annually on the second Thursday after the onset of the [[new moon]] in April, the kings (during the [[Guelowar]] period&lt;ref&gt;In Serer history and chronology, the Guelowar period starts from 1350 during the reign of [[Maad a Sinig Maysa Wali Jaxateh Manneh]] – the first Guelowar king to reign in Serer country i.e. the [[Kingdom of Sine]] and ends in 1969 following the deaths of [[Maad a Sinig Mahecor Joof]] and [[Maad Saloum]] Fode N'Goye Joof, king of Sine and [[Saloum]] respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;) will attend the Raan Festival of Tukar, making their way from the capital ([[Diakhao Arrondissement|Diakhao]]). However, the king was extremely careful never to arrive before the Lamane&lt;ref&gt;These should not be confused with pre-Guelowar Lamanes, who were the kings and landowners (the [[landed gentry]] among the old the Serer noble classes).&lt;/ref&gt; and always avoid direct encounters with the Lamane of Tukar. Whilst the Lamane was busy self-meditating, touring Tukar and making offerings to the [[pangool]] Jegan Joof, the Chief Saltigue and his associates drink ''sum-sum'' alcohol all morning before the Festival. It is reported that drinking ''sum-sum'' improves the Saltigue's vision of the future and the supernatural world.

Having prepared himself sufficiently, the Saltigue and his close associates leave the house and mount their horses, then start their own tour of some of the sacred places of the country. The Saltigué's tour is programmed to follow the king, but ultimately to cross his path at a location known as 'Nenem". In this location, the king, aware that the Saltigue is coming, stops the royal entourage. The king and the royal entourage must wait for the Saltigue and his companions to pass. After these high priests and priestesses have passed, the king then gives the signal to the royal entourage to pass as they proceed to their next destination. This is the kind of respect that is afforded to the Saltigue.&lt;ref&gt;Galvan, Dennis Charles, ''The State Must Be Our Master of Fire:'' How Peasants Craft Culturally Sustainable Development in Senegal. Berkeley, University of California Press ( 2004). pp 202–204&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars like [[Alioune Sarr]] note that Saltigues are famously celebrated and respected in Serer Kingdoms because of their knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Sarr, Alioune, ''Histoire du Sine-Saloum'', Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n° 3–4, 1986–1987. p31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serer and Lebu healing methods==
The [[Lebu people]] share many cosmo-spiritual beliefs with the [[Serer people|Serers]]. Many Lebu ''rab'' ([[jinn]]) are actually Serer ''[[pangool]]'' ([[Reincarnation#Serer religion|ancestral spirits or saints]]). The sacred dwelling place of the Lebu ''rab'' is the same as the Serer ''pangool'' called ''Sangomar'', based on the ancient Serer and [[Diola people|Diola]] legend of ''[[The legend of Jambooñ and Agaire|Jambooñ and Agaire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Many variations of spelling especially Agaire. Sometimes spelt Ageen, Ougeney, Eugene, etc. Jambooñ is sometimes spelt Jambon, Jambonge, etc. Fata Ndiaye in Ethiopiques {{fr}} [http://ethiopiques.refer.sn/spip.php?article1245 Le SIIN avant les Gelwaar]&lt;/ref&gt; – two young sisters whose boat split into half around [[the Point of Sangomar]]. One sails to the north, the other sails south. Those traveling south became the ancestors of the Diolas and the other became the ancestor of the Serers. The healing method of the Lebu is called ''ndepp'' while the Serer healing method is called ''Loup''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abibitumikasa.com/yabb/Attachments/coumbalambafinalreport.pdf The Cosaan Foundation]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ecole pratique des hautes études (France). 6. section: Sciences économiques et sociales.

&lt;!-- [[Image:BogdanKacmajor.jpg|thumb|Bogdan Kacmajor]] --&gt; 
The '''Sekta Niebo''' (Heaven Sect) ([[Polish language|Polish]] ''Zbór Chrześcijański Leczenia Duchem Bożym''; "Christian Church of Healing by Spirit of God") was a small religious movement founded in 1990 by [[faith healer]] [[Bogdan Kacmajor]], who believed he was a prophet chosen by God and a reincarnation of the prophet [[Elijah]].

==Beliefs and practices==
Members of the sect believed that by the year 2000 the world would come to an end. Their goal was to establish a commune of chosen people. As a symbol of their new life they took new names and destroyed their identity documents. Total submission to Kacmajor was required. Members married each other, refused to send children to public school (as Kacmajor stated, "in chemistry class they teach that you can't turn water into wine, in physics class they teach that you can't walk on water") and refused to take any medical treatment (Kacmajor was convinced that he can heal even AIDS). Niebo gathered approximately 50 members.

==Decline==
Because of their total social alienation the group soon started to have troubles with the law. Reports of kidnapping and children being kept prisoner started circulating. The Catholic Church and several church-related movements started a campaign against the community which resulted in bad fame and financial problems. As of 2008 the community does not exist and there are several court cases against Kacmajor.

The '''''shi''''' ({{zh|c=尸|p=''shī''|w=''sh'ih''|l=corpse}}) was a ceremonial "personator" who represented a dead relative during ancient [[Ancestor Veneration in China|Chinese ancestral sacrifices]]. In a ''shi'' ceremony, the ancestral spirit supposedly would enter the descendant "corpse" personator, who would eat and drink sacrificial offerings and convey messages from the spirit. [[James Legge]] (1895 IV:135), an early translator of the Chinese classics, described ''shi'' personation ceremonies as "grand family reunions where the dead and the living met, eating and drinking together, where the living worshipped the dead, and the dead blessed the living." In modern terms, this ancient Chinese ''shi'' practice would be described as [[necromancy]], [[mediumship]], or [[spirit possession]].

==Word==
[[File:尸-oracle.svg|thumb|150px|[[Oracle bone script]] for ''shi'' 尸]]
[[File:尸-bronze.svg|thumb|150px|[[Bronze script]] for ''shi'' 尸]]
[[File:尸-seal.svg|thumb|150px|[[Seal script]] for ''shi'' 尸]]

The word ''shi'' 尸 "corpse; personator; inactive; lay out; manage; spirit tablet" can be discussed in terms of [[Chinese character]] evolution, [[Historical Chinese phonology|historical phonology]], [[semantics]], and English translations.

===Characters===
The modern character [[Wikt:尸|尸]] for ''shi'' "corpse; personator" is a graphic simplification of ancient [[pictograph]]s showing a person with a bent back and dangling legs. The first records of ''shi'' are on [[oracle bones]] dating from the late [[Shang Dynasty]] (ca. 1600–ca. 1046 BCE). The [[oracle bone script]] for ''shi'' 尸 "corpse" was used interchangeably for ''yi'' [[Wikt:夷|夷]] "barbarian; non-Chinese people (esp. eastern, see ''[[Dongyi]]''); at ease; level". The [[bronze script]] for ''shi'' 尸, found in [[Chinese bronze inscriptions]] dating from the Shang and [[Zhou Dynasty]] (ca. 1045 BCE-ca. 256 BCE), had a more curved back and legs. The graphically reduced [[seal script]] for ''shi'', standardized during the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221-207 BCE), resembles the [[regular script]] 尸.

Today, ''shi'' 尸 is more commonly used as the [[Radical 44|"corpse/body radical"]] in [[Chinese characters]] (number 44 in the [[List of Kangxi radicals]]) than to write the original word "corpse". Many characters written with this radical involve the body (e.g., ''niao'' [[Wikt:尿|尿]] "urine" with 水 "water"), but not all (e.g., ''wu'' [[Wikt:屋|屋]] "house; room" with 至 "go to"). 

''Shi'' 尸 "corpse; cadaver" has a [[variant Chinese character]] [[Wikt:屍|屍]] that combines the "corpse radical" 尸 with ''si'' [[Wikt:死|死]] "dead" (e.g., ''[[jiang shi]]'' 僵屍 "stiff corpse") Michael Carr (2007:358) explains, "This semantically redundant ''shi'' 屍 'dead-corpse' graphically distinguishes the original 'corpse' meaning of ''shi'' 尸from its various other meanings such as 'personator'."

===Meanings===
[[Chinese classics]] used the word ''shi'' 尸 in six meanings: 
*(1) "corpse; body of a dead person"
*(2) "personator of a dead ancestor"
*(3) "motionless; inactive"
*(4) "lay out; arrange; expose"
*(5) "manage; direct; spirit tablet"
*(6) "proper names (of a place, family, and bird)"
Carr (2007:362) outlines the semantic connections among these ''shi'' meanings. The basic meaning (1) "corpse" was semantically extended into both (2) "act on behalf of a corpse" or "personator of a dead ancestor" and (3) "act like a corpse" or "motionless; inactive; doing nothing". Meaning (4) "lay out, arrange; display" generalizes "lay out a corpse." Meaning (5) "manage; direct; ancestral tablet" links the representative ''shi'' (2) "personator" with the metaphorical replacement "ancestral tablet". Meaning (6) uses ''shi'' to transcribe proper names.

Meaning (1) is the core sense of "corpse; dead body; cadaver; carcass". Early ritual texts, notably the ''[[Liji]]'' "Classic of Rites", ''[[Zhouli]]'' "Rites of Zhou", and ''[[Etiquette and Rites|Yili]]'' "Etiquette and Rites", frequently use ''shi'' "corpse" in [[mortuary]] and [[funeral]] contexts. Here is an example ''Liji'' passage:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As soon as death took place, the corpse was transferred to the couch, and covered with a large sheet. The clothes in which the deceased had died were removed. A servant plugged the mouth open with the spoon of horn; and to keep the feet from contracting, an easy stool was employed. These observances were the same for a ruler, a great officer, and an ordinary officer. (22, tr. Legge 1885 28:181)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Shi'' meaning (2) "personator; sacrificial representative of a dead person's spirit" is discussed below.

Meaning (3) figuratively expands ''shi'' to "corpse-like", which can contextually mean either "motionless; calm; quiescent" or "inactive; negligent; remiss". A ''Shijing'' ode (245, tr. Karlgren 1950:214) laments that, "the good men sit motionless and silent". Karlgren explains, "'The good men act the corpse,' play the part of a representative of the dead at a sacrifice, who sits still and silent during the whole ceremony; here then, remain inactive, do nothing to help." The ''[[Lunyu]]'' ("Confucian Analects") uses ''shi'' to praise [[Confucius]] (tr. Legge 1895 I:235), "In bed, he did not lie like a corpse." Commentators disagree whether this means "sleep with the arms and legs sprawled out" or "sleep facing the north (the land of the dead)".

Meaning (4) is defined as Chinese ''chen'' [[Wikt:陳|陳]] "lay out; set forth, array; arrange; display". Examples in classic texts range from specifically "lay out (a corpse)" to generally "lay out; set out; arrange". The ''Liji'' distinguishes between ''shi'' 尸 "uncoffined corpse" and ''jiu'' [[Wikt:柩|柩]] (with the "wood radical" and a ''jiu'' 匛 "long; enduring" phonetic) "coffined corpse" (tr. Legge 1885 27:117): "(The corpse) on the couch is called [''shi''] (the laid out); when it is put into the coffin, that is called [''jiu''] (being in the long home)." A ''[[Shijing]]'' poem (185, tr. Karlgren 1950) refers to men called off to war, "There are mothers who set forth the (sacrificial) dishes."

Meaning (5) of ''shi'' is defined as ''zhu'' [[Wikt:主|主]] "master; manage, preside; spirit tablet, ancestral tablet". The ''[[Chuci]]'' (tr. Hawkes 1959:55) uses ''shi'' asking about [[King Wu of Zhou]], whose father [[King Wen of Zhou]] did not live to see the conquering of the previous dynasty, Shang-Yin: "When Wu set out to kill Yin, why was he so grieved? He went into the battle carrying the 'corpse.' Why was he in such haste?" Commentators disagree whether this ''shi'' means ''zhu'', specifically ''muzhu'' 木主 "wooden spirit/ancestral tablet" or ''jiu'' "corpse in a coffin". Hawkes justifies translating "corpse": "According to some accounts it was the 'spirit tablet' of his dead father [King Wen] which King Wu carried in his chariot to battle. But I think the poet understood him to have taken the actual corpse, and was surprised that he had not waited to bury it."

The sinologists Eduard Erkes and Bernhard Karlgren debated this ''Chuci'' usage of ''shi'' "corpse; spirit tablet". Erkes (1928) proposed that the ''zhu'' was a wooden ancestral tablet shaped in the image of the deceased. Karlgren (1930) disagreed and argued that the ''zhu'' was phallic shaped:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He seems to think that the substitution of [muzhu] 'wooden tablet' for the corpse (if really a corpse is intended; the word shi is ambiguous) proves the [muzhu] to have been an image of the corpse, and therefore he translates [muzhu] by 'wooden statue.' Nothing could be more arbitrary. The [muzhu], wooden ancestral tablet, was the resting place of the ancestor's spirit, once his body was dead and decomposed. In this sense it was a substitute for his body, his spiritual force had entered it, and therefore it was carried into battle, bringing this mental force of his into play on the side of his descendant. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Erkes (1931) countered Karlgren by citing other texts describing a human-shaped ''muzhu'' "wooden lord". For instance, the ''[[Shiji]]'' ("Record of History", tr. Erkes) records this King Wu story with ''muzhu'' instead of ''shi'': "He (viz. Wu-Wang) made a wooden image of Wen-Wang and took it with [him] on his carriage into the battle." Erkes further suggested, "very probably the custom of carrying a [muzhu] into battle had developed from an earlier one of taking the body itself, and that therefore the [muzhu] was something representing the corpse, i.e., an image of the deceased."

Meaning (6) includes some semantically unrelated usages of ''shi''. ''Shi'' 尸 is an ancient place name (in [[Henan]]); a surname (e.g., the [[Syncretism (Chinese philosophy)|Syncretist]] philosopher [[Shizi (book)|Shizi]] 尸子, ca. 390–330 BCE); and a variant of ''shi'' [[Wikt:鳲|鳲]] (which is used in bird names like ''shijiu'' 鳲鳩 "cuckoo; turtledove").

===Pronunciations and etymologies===
The [[Standard Chinese]] ''shī'' pronunciation of 尸 phonologically descends from (ca. 6th century CE) [[Middle Chinese]] and (ca. 6th century BCE) [[Old Chinese]]. Compare these Middle and Old Chinese reconstructions of ''shi'' 尸 "corpse" and ''yi'' 夷 "barbarian" (which anciently had interchangeable characters): ''śi'' &lt; *''śjər'' 尸and ''i'' &lt; *''djər'' 夷 ([[Bernhard Karlgren]] 1957), ''syij'' &lt; *''hljij'' 尸and ''yij'' &lt; *''ljɨj'' 夷 (William Baxter 1992), and ''śi'' &lt; *''lhi'' 尸 and ''ji'' &lt; *''ləi'' 夷 (Axel Schuessler 2009).

There are several hypothetical [[etymologies]] for ''shi'' "corpse". Karlgren proposed that ''si'' &lt; *''sjər'' 死 "die, dead" and ''shi'' &lt; *''śjər'' 尸 "the dead, corpse" were etymologically [[cognate]]. Paul K. Benedict (1972) suggested possible [[Proto-Sino-Tibetan]] roots for ''shi'': either *''(s-)raw'' "corpse; carcass" or *''siy'' "die". Schuessler (2007) hypothesizes a semantic development from *''li'' 夷 "extend; expose; display; set out; spread out" to *''lhi'' 尸 "to spread out; lie down flat (in order to sleep); motionless; to set forth (sacrificial dishes)", to "personator of a dead ancestor", to "corpse". He rejects Karlgren's assumption that ''shi'' "corpse" is cognate to ''si'' "to die", "because the MC [Middle Chinese] initial ''ś-'' (&lt; *''lh-'', *''nh-'', *''hj-'') never derives from an *''s-'', except when they share an initial *''l'' or *''n''."

===Translations===
English translations of the ceremonial ''shi'' 尸 include ''[[personator]]'', ''[[impersonator]]'', ''[[:wikt:representative|representative]]'', ''[[Mediumship|medium]]'', and ''[[shaman]]''. Carr reviews the choices.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Obviously, rendering this into English is problematic because there is no Western analogy for the ceremonial ''shi'' 'corpse.' ''Personator'' is chosen as the nearest English translation. ''Impersonator'' would be possible, but this word implies falsehood, which was not originally associated with the ''shi''. ''Representative'' is too general in meaning, and does not usually have a sense of spirituality, unless modified by ''of the dead/ancestor''. Paper [1995] suggests ''Incorporator of the Dead'', which has a parallel 'one who embodies' etymology, but the derivate words ''incorporate'' and ''incorporation'' commonly have other meanings. ''Medium'' and ''shaman'' are similar with ''shi'' in meaning and are part of Chinese traditions; however, the descriptions of a dignified personator are unlike the spirit-possession of either. Another translational tactic would be to coin a [[nonce word]], such as Waley's [1937] "the Dead One," Eberhard's [1968] "death boy," or Wilhelm's [1967] "corpse boy," but the sense of such a coinage is not always clear. Therefore, in the absence of a better English word, ''personator'' will translate this meaning of ''shi''. (2007:364-365) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early descriptions==
Zhou Dynasty classic texts (c. 11th-3rd centuries BCE) use the word ''shi'' 尸 hundreds of times. Lothar von Falkenhausen contrasts the frequently recorded ''shi'' "personator" with the rarely noted [[Wu (shaman)|''wu'']] [[Wikt:巫|巫]] "shaman; spirit medium". 
&lt;blockquote&gt;At ancestral sacrifices, the ancestral spirits descend into individuals designated from among their descendants, the "Impersonators" (''shi'' 尸). Occupying their ritual rôle by virtue of their kinship position vis-à-vis the ancestor that is sacrificed to, the Impersonators are not trained religious specialists like the Spirit Mediums. Although it has been speculated that the actions of the ''shi'' may have originally involved trance and possession, the surviving source materials — none earlier than the Western Zhou period — show them as staid and passive, acting with the utmost demeanor and dignity. (1995) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some early ''shi'' meanings are contextually ambiguous. For instance, the ''[[Yijing]]'' ("Book of Changes") uses ''yu shi'' [[Wikt:輿|輿]]尸 "carry corpses; corpse carrier" twice for [[I Ching hexagrams#Hexagram 7|Hexagram 7]] (tr. Wilhelm 1967:34-35): "Perchance the army carries corpses in the wagon. Misfortune … Let the eldest lead the army. The younger transports corpses. Then perseverance brings misfortune." [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] summarizes the ''Yijing'' commentaries.
&lt;blockquote&gt; Here we have a choice of two explanations. One points to defeat because someone other than the chosen leader interferes with the command; the other is similar in its general meaning, but the expression, "carries corpses in the wagon," is interpreted differently. At burials and at sacrifices to the dead it was customary in China for the deceased to whom the sacrifice was made to be represented by a boy of the family, who sat in the dead man's place and was honored as his representative. On the basis of this custom the text is interpreted as meaning that a "corpse boy" is sitting in the wagon, or, in other words, that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has been usurped by others. (1967:34) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Marshall (2002:77) concludes this hexagram refers to carrying a corpse, and compares the "Israelites carrying the Ark of the Covenant into battle against the Philistines".

===Shijing===
The ''[[Shijing]]'' ("Classic of Poetry", ca. 11th-6th centuries BCE) contains early and detailed descriptions of personation ceremonies, in the following themes.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is an abundance of sacrificial wine and food (odes 166, 209, 210, and 248) shared by both the ancestral spirits (through the personator) and their descendants. Drunkenness is frequently mentioned: 209/5 "The spirits [note: 'souls' not 'liquor'] are all drunk," 209/6 "all are happy; they are drunk," 247/1, 2 "We are drunk with wine," and 248/5 "the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is befumed (by the spirits); the good wine makes you merry." Most significantly, the ancestral spirits speak directly through the intoxicated personators (166, 210, and 247), approve of the sacrificial offerings, and bless their descendants (166, 209, 210, 247, and 248). (Carr 2007:369) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Shi'' "personator" occurs fourteen times in two pairs of consecutive ''Shijing'' odes (209–210 and 247–248, tr. Karlgren 1950:203-204). Ode 209 says "we make (the representative of the dead) sit at ease, we (assist him =) encourage him to eat" and "The august representative of the dead then rises, the drums and bells (by their sound) escort away the representative." The following ode 210 describes sacrificial wine and food, "he presents them  to our representative of the dead and to our guests."

''Shijing'' odes 247 and 248, which portray ancestral feasts to the Zhou royal house, exclusively use the term ''gongshi'' 公尸 with the modifier ''gong'' [[Wikt:公|公]] "prince; duke; public; palace; effort". Compare these ''gongshi'' translations: "representative of the (dead) princes" (Karlgren), "personators of your ancestors" (Legge, admitting 1895 IV:447, "The expression 公尸, 'ducal personators,' is somewhat difficult to account for"), "impersonator of the Ancient", "ducal Dead", or "Dead One" (Waley, noting 1937:215, "Impersonator of a former Duke or ruler"). Ode 247 (''Jizui'' 既醉 "Already Drunk") describes a sacrificial feast for ancestral spirits, and says "the representative of the (dead) princes makes a happy announcement".

Ode 248 (''Fuyi'' 鳧鷖 "Wild Ducks") describes another feast, which commentators say was held on the following day to reward the personator, and details sacrificial offerings and ancestral blessings.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The wild ducks are on the [Jing] (river); the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is at peace; your wine is clear, your viands are fragrant; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and (achieve, complete you =) make you perfect. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are on the sands; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and (approves =) finds it good; your wine is plentiful, your viands are fine; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and (act for =) favor you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are on the island; the representative of the (dead) prices comes and feasts and reposes; your wine is strained, your viands are sliced; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and descend on you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are at the junction of the river; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is (treated in temple-fashion =) revered; the feast is in the temple, that is where felicity and blessings descend; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and are piled up (heavily =) amply on you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are in the gorge; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is befumed (by the spirits); the good wine makes you merry; the roast and broiled things are fragrant; the representative feasts and drinks; there will be no after trouble. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Besides the ''Shijing'', other texts refer to ''shi'' frequently drinking sacrificial [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|''jiu'']] 酒 "alcoholic beverage; liquor", which Paper (1995:113) interprets as a ritual means to induce hallucinations of ancestral spirits. Based upon a ''Liji'' ceremony (tr. Legge 1885 28:246) describing a ''shi'' personator drinking nine cups of ''jiu'', with an estimated alcohol content from 5% to 8%, and volume measurements of Zhou bronze sacrificial cups, Paper (1995:114) calculates a "conservative estimate is that the ''shi'' consumed between 2.4 and 3.9 ounces of pure alcohol (equivalent to between 5 and 8 bar shots of eighty-proof liquor)."

===Child personators===
Several texts refer to a Chinese custom that a personator should be a child of the same sex as the dead ancestor, preferably either a legitimate grandson or his wife. However, personation by younger relatives, who were of lower [[social status]] than their elders, created an exception to traditional Chinese culture. The earliest textual reference comes from the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mengzi]]'' ("Book of Mencius") questioning the status shown to a younger brother during the personation ceremony.
&lt;blockquote&gt;You should ask him, "Which do you respect most, — your uncle, or your younger brother?" He will answer, "My uncle." Ask him again, "If your younger brother be personating a dead ancestor, to which do you show the greater respect, — to him or to your uncle?" He will say, "To my younger brother." You can go on, "But where is the respect due, as you said, to your uncle?" He will reply to this, "I show the respect to my younger brother because of the position which he occupies." (6, tr. Legge 1895 IV:400). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Liji'' reiterates that personation contradicted the established social hierarchy (18, tr. Legge 1895 28:88): "Thus it is that there are two among his subjects whom the ruler does not treat as subjects. When one is personating (his ancestor) he does not treat him as such, nor does he treat his master as such." Another ''Liji'' passage (7, tr. Legge 1895 27:337-338) explains: "A rule of propriety says, 'A superior man may carry his grandson in his arms, but not his son.' This tells us that a grandson may be the personator of his deceased grandfather (at sacrifices), but a son cannot be so of his father." When a grandson personated his grandfather's spirit, it reversed the normal family hierarchy and a father would have to worship his own son. 

Scholars have differing hypotheses explaining why a grandchild would make the most suitable personator. [[Marcel Granet]] (1930:337–338) said the basic reason was a predominance of uterine over agnatic [[primogeniture]]; the grandfather is the closest of the uterine relatives, and thus closer to his grandson than the father is. [[Wolfram Eberhard]] (1968:338) explained that a child makes the best personator owing to the ancient Chinese believed that a soul is small. [[Julian Jaynes]] (1976:344–345) mentions a Greek parallel; the philosopher [[Iamblichus]] wrote that "young and simple persons" make the most suitable mediums. Stephen Bokenkamp mentions examples besides ''shi'' rituals.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In China, possessions by spirits that occurred outside of this ritual scenario often involved younger members of the family as well. As in instances of mediumism around the world, the youthful and illiterate were regarded as more reliable conduits to the dead, since they could hardly be suspected of having fabricated their utterances and writings themselves. This fact brings to the fore questions of power. Women and junior male members of a family frequently found that mediumism was a way to bring attention to their own, otherwise easily ignored, concerns. (2007:40) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Female personators===
Two ritual texts mention female personators. The ''Liji'' (15, tr. Legge 1885 28:75) describes a wife personating her husband's dead grandmother: "A wife, on festive occasions, even though it were on receiving a gift from the ruler, (only) made a curtsy. When seated as a personatrix (of the deceased grandmother of her husband), she did not bow with her head to her hands, but made the curtsy." The ''Yili'' (14, tr. Steele 1917:119.) euphemistically says a female personator should preferably not be the wife of a concubine's grandson; "A man personates a dead man, and a woman a woman. In the latter case a woman of a different surname is chosen, and as such not one of inferior standing."

===Historical changes in personation===
Several early texts and commentaries reiterate a traditional history of personation beginning in the second millennium BCE as a sacred communion with ancestral spirits, but ending as a drinking party in the late 1st millennium BCE. When the personation ceremony supposedly originated during the [[Xia Dynasty]] (ca. 2100-ca. 1600 BCE), a personator would make contact with the dead ancestral spirit before sitting down to eat and drink. During the Yin or Shang Dynasty (ca. 1600-1046 BCE), a personator would sometimes sit down without having contacted the spirit, and by the late Zhou Dynasty (1045-256 BCE), a personation ceremony became a revelry with several personators repeatedly making toasts and drinking sacrificial wines.

Two ''Liji'' chapters describe how personation rituals changed during the Zhou period.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under the [Zhou] dynasty the representatives of the dead sat. Their monitors and cup-suppliers observed no regular rules. The usages were the same (as those of Yin [Shang]), and the underlying principle was one. Under the [Xia] dynasty, the personators had stood till the sacrifice was ended (whereas) under the Yin [Shang] they sat. Under [Zhou], when the cup went round among all, there were six personators. [Zengzi] said, "The usages of [Zhou] might be compared to a subscription club." (10, tr. Legge 1885 27:405-406) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(When the representative of the departed) had made the libation with the [jia] cup, or the horn, (the sacrificer) was told (to bow to him) to put him at ease. Anciently, the representative stood when nothing was being done; when anything was being done, he sat. He personated the spirit. The officer of prayer was the medium of communication between him and the sacrificer. (11, tr. Legge 1885 27:446) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later sources repeat this legendary history of personation. For example, He Xiu 何休's 2nd-century commentary to the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals|Chunqiu]]'' ("Spring and Autumn Annals") ''[[Gongyang Zhuan]]'' says (tr. Carr 2007:371), "The Xia had standing personators, the Shang [Yin] had sitting personators, and the Zhou had six personators who would make serial toasts." Granet (1930:337) mentions the Zhou personation parties: "It was not long before this archaic custom was criticized by the ritualists. When the sacrifices were offered simultaneously to several ancestors each of whom was represented, the ceremony was found indeed to assume a displeasing likeness to a picnic."

===Doubts about personation===
The above ''Liji'' description of Zhou "subscription club" personation ceremonies quotes [[Confucius]]'s student and compiler [[Zengzi]] (505-436 BCE). The ''Liji'' contains three passages where Zengzi questions his teacher about whether personators were needed for ancestral rituals. For instance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Zengzi] asked, "Is it necessary that there should be a representative of the dead in sacrifices? Or may he be dispensed with as when the satisfying offerings are made to the dead?" Confucius said, "In sacrificing to a full-grown man for whom there have been the funeral rites, there must be such a representative, who should be a grandson; and if the grandson is too young, someone must be employed to carry him in his arms. If there be no grandson, some one of the same surname should be selected for the occasion. In sacrificing to the one who had died prematurely, there are (only) the satisfying offerings, for he was not full-grown. To sacrifice to a full-grown man, for whom there have been the funeral rites without a representative, would be to treat him as if he had died prematurely." (7, tr. Legge 1885 27:337-338) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Hypothetical origins ==
Chinese scholars have long disagreed about when and how ''shi'' personation originated. Henri Doré (1914 1:99-102) summarizes the four principal opinions, which are worth quoting in full.

The first opinion is that personation was a bygone superstition. The [[Tang Dynasty]] historian [[Du You]] criticizes the ''shi'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ancients employed a personator. This rite deserves censure, and has been abolished by our great Worthies. One vied with the other in practicing it. Now that an era of progress has set in, and these silly customs have disappeared, it is important not to revive them; common sense bids to refrain from them. Some half-baked literati of our days would fain re-establish this ceremony of the personator. This is quite absurd. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second opinion is that the personator was not the agent of the departed, but merely its metaphorical representative or ''shenxiang'' 神象 "image of the spirit". The [[Han Dynasty]] historian [[Ban Gu]] explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The personator is found in the ceremony wherein sacrifice is offered to ancestors, because the soul emitting no perceptible sounds and having no visible form, the loving sentiment of filial piety finds no means of displaying itself, hence a personator has been chosen to whom meats are offered, after which he breaks the bowls, quite rejoiced, as if his own father had eaten plenty. The personator, drinking abundantly, imparts the illusion that it is the soul which is satiated. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Carr (2007:386) notes, "This passage sounds as though Ban had personally observed a personation ceremony."    
   
Some [[Qing Dynasty]] scholars held a third opinion, namely, that the personator was bearer of the ancestral tablet. The ''Jishuo quanzhen'' 集說詮真 "Collected Sayings Explaining Truth" says, "The filial son chooses a personator to carry the tablet, but not to be the resting place of the soul of the dead person. His intention is therefore manifest." The ''Yuzhou dayiyi'' 宇宙大疑議 "Discussion of Universal Great Doubts" says: "The personator is employed during sacrifices to the dead, in order to carry the ancestral tablet … hence there is no need of having such a one immediately after death, as the tablet is not yet erected."

The fourth opinion refutes the first three condemnations of personators as mere representatives or tablet-holders for the dead, and contends that a personator was temporarily the seat of a dead ancestor's soul. Two leading [[Neo-Confucianist]] philosophers held this judgment.
[[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] writes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ancients, when sacrificing to the dead, employed the personator, because the soul and the vital force of the dead person after being separated from the body, seek an agent of the same nature. Now, men being all of the same kind, the father and the children being all of one family and of the same stock, the soul of the departed person is requested to come and establish its seat in one of them as in an agent. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
His follower [[Zhu Xi]] concurs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In ancient times all employed a personator when sacrificing to the dead. Since the descendants continue the life of their ancestors, the personator shares, therefore, in the life of the departed person, and the ancestor's soul descends undoubtedly upon his descendants, and reposes therein to enjoy the sacrifice offered. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carr (2007:387-388) offers a contemporary explanation for ''shi'' "corpse" personation: [[Julian Jaynes]]'s psychological [[Bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]] hypothesis. Jaynes proposed that human "[[consciousness]]", meaning [[self-awareness]] and [[cognition]], began evolving around 1000 BCE. Prior to that, ancient people had "bicameral mentality" in which one part of the brain "spoke" (often in an [[authority figure]]'s voice) while another part listened and obeyed. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the theory of the bicameral mind, hallucinations of a person in some authority could continue after death as an everyday matter. And hence the almost universal custom of feeding the corpses after death, and burying them with the appurtenances of life. (Jaynes 1976:290) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
If the original personators were bicameral, they could have directly hallucinated voices from a ''shi'' "corpse". Carr notes the historical correspondence between Jaynes's first millennium BCE timeline for the breakdown of the bicameral mind in other parts of the world and the 11th-3rd centuries BCE personation practices in China.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Several early sources give variations of the same chronicle about the personation ceremony. It began during the Xia Dynasty, when personators would communicate on behalf of the dead; continued during the Shang and Western Zhou Dynasties; but was criticized and discontinued after the Eastern Zhou Dynasty when personators were no longer able to speak for the dead. (2007:387) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:SanXingDui ZongMuMianJu.jpg|thumb|[[Sanxingdui]] bronze mask]]
Wearing [[Ritual mask#Ritual masks|ritual masks]] is a recent hypothesis about ''shi''. Paper (1995:82) suggested the possibility that Shang and Zhou ''shi'' wore bronze masks "symbolizing the spirit of the dead to whom the sacrifices were offered". Liu believes the phantasmagoric bronze masks discovered at [[Sanxingdui]], dating from c. 12th-11th centuries BCE, might have been ritually worn by ''shi'' 尸.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''shi'' was generally a close, young relative who wore a costume (possibly including a mask) reproducing the features of the dead person. The ''shi'' was an impersonator, that is, a person serving as a reminder of the ancestor to whom sacrifice was being offered. During such a ceremony, the impersonator was much more than an actor in a drama. Although the exact meaning may have been different, the group of Sanxingdui masked figures in bronze all have the character of an impersonator. It is likely the masks were used to impersonate and identify with certain supernatural beings in order to effect some communal good. (2000:37) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Shroud of Charlemagne manufactured in Constantinople 814.jpg|thumb|Portion of the death shroud of [[Charlemagne]]. It represents a [[quadriga]] and was manufactured in [[Constantinople]].]]
'''Shroud''' usually refers to an item, such as a cloth, that covers or protects some other object. The term is most often used in reference to ''[[burial]] sheets'', '''mound shroud''', '''grave clothes''', '''winding-cloths''' or '''winding-sheets''', such as the famous [[Shroud of Turin]] or ''[[Tachrichim]]'' (burial shrouds) that [[Jews]] are dressed in for burial. Traditionally, mound shrouds are made of white [[cotton]], [[wool]] or [[linen]], though any material can be used so long as it is made of [[natural fibre]]. Intermixture of two or more such fibres is forbidden,&lt;ref&gt;Alfred J. Kolatch, ''The Jewish Book of Why'' (New York: Jonathan David Publishers, 1981), pp. 52-53&lt;/ref&gt; a proscription that ultimately derives from the [[Torah]], ''viz.'', [[Deuteronomy|Deut.]] 22:11.

A traditional Orthodox Jewish shroud consists of a tunic; a hood; pants that are extra-long and sewn shut at the bottom, so that separate foot coverings are not required; and a belt, which is tied in a knot shaped like the Hebrew letter ''shin'', mnemonic of one of God's names, Shaddai.  Early shrouds incorporated a cloth, the ''sudarium'', that covered the face, as depicted in traditional artistic representations of the entombed Jesus or His friend, Lazarus ([[Gospel of John|John]] 11, ''q.v.'').  An especially pious man may next be enwrapped in either his [[kittel]] or his [[tallit]], one tassel of which is defaced to render the garment ritually unfit, symbolizing the fact that the decedent is free from the stringent requirements of the 613 ''mitzvot'' (commandments). The shrouded body is wrapped in a winding sheet, termed a ''sovev'' in Hebrew (a cognate of ''svivon'', the spinning [[Hanukkah]] toy that is familiar under its Yiddish name, ''[[dreidel]]''), before being placed either in a plain coffin of soft wood (where required by governing health codes) or directly in the earth.  [[Croesus]]-rich or dirt-poor, every Orthodox Jew is dressed to face the Almighty on the same terms.

The [[Early Christian Church]] also strongly encouraged the use of winding-sheets, except for monarchs and bishops. The rich were wrapped in cerecloths, which are fine fabrics soaked or painted in wax to hold the fabric close to the flesh. An account of the opening of the coffin of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] says that the "innermost covering seems to have been a very fine linen cerecloth, dressed close to every part of the body". Their use was general until at least the Renaissance – clothes were very expensive, and they had the advantage that a good set of clothes was not lost to the family.
In Europe in the Middle Ages, coarse linen shrouds were used to bury most poor without a coffin. In poetry shrouds have been described as of sable, and they were later embroidered in black, becoming more elaborate and cut like shirts or shifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Design for Death|last=Jones|first=Barbara|publisher=Andre Deutsch Limited|year=1967|isbn=|location=London|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; p.112, Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Orthodox Christians]] still use a burial shroud, usually decorated with a cross and the [[Trisagion]]. The special shroud that is used during the Orthodox [[Holy Week]] services is called an [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaphios]]. Some Catholics also use the burial shroud particularly the [[Eastern Catholics]] and traditionalist [[Roman Catholics]].

Muslims as well use burial shrouds that are made of white cotton or linen.  The [[Burying in Woollen Acts]] 1666-80 in England were meant to support the production of woollen cloth.

In a [[religion|religious]] context, '''sin''' is an act of transgression against [[divine law|divine]] or [[natural law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=sin|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sin|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sin can also be viewed as any thought or action that endangers the ideal relationship between an individual and [[God]]; or as any diversion from the perceived ideal order for human [[Life|living]]. In [[Jainism]], sin refers to anything that harms the possibility of the ''[[Jiva (Jainism)|jiva]]'' (being) to attain ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (supreme emancipation). In [[Islamic ethics]], [[Muslim]]s see sin as anything that goes against the commands of [[Allah]] ([[God in Islam|God]]). [[Judaism]] regards the violation of any of the [[613 commandments]] as a sin.

== Etymology ==
The word derives from "[[Old English]] ''syn(n)'', for original *''sunjō''. The stem may be related to that of Latin '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''sons'', ''sont-is''' guilty. In Old English there are examples of the original general sense, ‘offence, wrong-doing, misdeed'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oed.com/view/Entry/180030?isAdvanced=false&amp;result=1&amp;rskey=9Bb3P3&amp; |title=sin |work=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate= 16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English Biblical terms translated as "sin" or "syn" from the Biblical Greek and Jewish terms sometimes originate from words in the latter languages denoting the act or state of missing the mark; the original sense of [[New Testament Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἁμαρτία}} ''hamartia'' "sin", is failure, being in error, missing the mark, especially in spear throwing;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a(marti/a|ἁμαρτία}}, {{LSJ|a(marta/nw|ἁμαρτάνω|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jewish views on sin|Hebrew ''hata'' "sin"]] originates in [[archery]] and literally refers to missing the "gold" at the centre of a target, but hitting the target, i.e. error.&lt;ref&gt;
Pagels, Elaine. ''The Gnostic Gospels''. Vintage Books: New York, 1989. p. 123.
&lt;/ref&gt; "To sin" has been defined from a Greek [[Bible concordance|concordance]] as "to miss the mark".&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/nas/hamartia.html "Hamartia,"] ''The NAS New Testament Greek Lexicon''.&lt;br/&gt;
[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] eventually (after the [[Pelagianism|Pelagian controversy]]) defined sin as a hardened heart, a loss of love for God, a disposition of the heart to depart from God because of inordinate self-love (see Augustine ''On Grace and Free Will'' in ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', trans. P. Holmes, vol. 5, 30-31 [14-15]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religions ==

=== Bahá'í ===
{{Anchor| Bahá'í faith }}
{{Main|Bahá'í views on sin}}

In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], humans are considered naturally good (perfect), fundamentally spiritual beings. Human beings were created because of God's immeasurable love. However, the Bahá'í teachings compare the human heart to a mirror, which, if turned away from the light of the sun (i.e. God), is incapable of receiving God's love.

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main|Buddhist views on sin}}

[[Buddhism]] believes in the principle of ''[[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]'', whereby [[Dukkha|suffering]] is the inevitable consequence of greed, anger, and delusion (known as the [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|Three poisons]]).&lt;ref&gt;Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, Soka Gakkai, "Three Poisons": "Greed, anger, and foolishness. The fundamental evils inherent in life that give rise to human suffering."&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no direct Buddhist equivalent of the Abrahamic concept of sin, wrongdoing is recognized in Buddhism. The concept of [[Buddhist ethics]] is [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] in nature and is not based upon duty towards any deity.
Karma means action, and in Buddhist context, motivation is the most important aspect of an action. Whether karma done with mind, body and/or speech is called 'good' or 'bad', depends on whether it would bring pleasant or unpleasant results to the person who does the action. 
One needs to purify negative karma [[Satipatthana Sutta|Four Satipatthanas]] to free oneself from obstacles to liberation from the vicious circle of rebirth. The purification reduces suffering and in the end one reaches [[Nirvana]], the ultimate purification by realizing selflessness or emptiness. An enlightened being is free of all the suffering and karmas, and will not be automatically born again.

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Forbidden fruit.jpg|thumb|A [[Sistine Chapel]] [[fresco]] depicts the [[Expulsion from the Garden of Eden|expulsion]] of [[Adam and Eve]] for [[Original sin|transgressing God's command]] not to eat [[Forbidden fruit|the fruit]] of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]].]]
{{Main|Hamartiology|Christian views on sin}}
{{See also|Christian views on the Old Covenant|Seven deadly sins}}
In the [[Old Testament]], some sins were [[Religion and capital punishment#Christianity|punishable by death]] in different forms, while most sins are forgiven by burnt offerings. [[Christians]] consider the [[Mosaic covenant|Old Covenant]] to be fulfilled by the [[The gospel|Gospel]].

In the [[New Testament]] the [[Atonement in Christianity|forgiveness of sin]] is effected through [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] and [[Repentance (Christianity)|repentance]] ([[Mark 1]]:15).&lt;ref&gt;Mark 1:15&lt;/ref&gt; Sin is [[Forgiveness#Christianity|forgiven]] when the sinner acknowledges, [[Confession (religion)#Christianity|confesses]], and repents for their sin as a part of believing in [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmaus|first1=Michael|title=Dogma: The Church as Sacrament|date=1975|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-7425-3203-8|page=220,222|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5oTziWXEKgC&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sinner is expected to confess his sins to [[God in Christianity|God]] as a part of an ongoing relationship, which also includes [[Gratitude#Christian conceptions|giving thanks]] to God. The sinful person has never before been in a favorable relationship with God. When, as a part of the process of salvation, a person is forgiven, they enter into a [[Union with Christ|union with God]] which abides forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willmington|first1=H.L.|title=Willmington's Guide to the Bible|date=1981|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-8423-8804-4|page=725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NeCN2cVnONYC&amp;pg=PA725}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Epistle to the Romans]] [[Romans 6:23|6:23]], it is mentioned that "the wages of sin is death", which is commonly interpreted as, if one repents for his sins, such person will inherit [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romans 6:23|url=https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm|website=Biblehub|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jewish Christianity]], sin is believed to alienate the sinner from God even though He has extreme [[Agape|love for mankind]]. It has damaged and completely severed the relationship of humanity to God. That relationship can only be restored through acceptance of Jesus Christ and his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death on the cross]] as a [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|satisfactory sacrifice]] for the sins of humanity. Humanity was [[Destiny#Religion|destined]] for life with God when [[Adam]] disobeyed God. The Bible in [[John 3:16]] says "For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting."

In [[Eastern Christianity]], sin is viewed in terms of its effects on relationships, both among people and likewise between people and God. Also as in Jewish Christianity, Sin is likewise seen as [[Fall of man|the refusal]] to follow [[Will of God|God's plan]] and the desire to be "like God" (as stated in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 3:5) and thus in direct opposition to God's will (see the account of [[Adam and Eve]] in Genesis).

{{Anchor|Original sin}}
[[Original sin]] is a Western concept that states that sin entered the human world through [[Adam and Eve]]'s sin in the [[Garden of Eden]] and that human beings have since lived with the consequences of this first sin.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11312a.htm|title=Original Sin|work=Catholic Encyclopedia|date=1 February 1911 |accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Serpents in the Bible#Eden|The serpent]] who beguiled [[Eve]] to eat of [[Forbidden fruit|the fruit]] was punished by having it and its kind being made to crawl on the ground and God set an enmity between them and [[Genealogies of Genesis|Eve's descendants]] (Genesis 3:14-15). Eve was punished by the pains of childbirth and the sorrow of bringing about life that would eventually age, sicken and die (Genesis 3:16). The second part of the curse about being [[Fall of man#Subordination|subordinate to Adam]] originates from her creation from one of Adam's ribs to be his helper ([[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis 2:18-25]]); the curse now clarifies that she must now obey her [[Christian views on marriage|husband]] and desire only him. Adam was punished by having to work endlessly to feed himself and his family. The land would bring forth both thistles and thorns to be cleared and herbs and grain [[Religion and agriculture|to be planted, nurtured, and harvested]]. The second part of the curse about his mortality is from his origin as red clay - he is from the land and he and his descendants would return to it when [[Christian burial|buried]] after death. When Adam's son [[Cain and Abel|Cain slew his brother Abel]], he introduced murder into the world (Genesis 4:8-10). For his punishment, God banished him as a fugitive, but first [[Curse and mark of Cain|marked him]] with a sign that would protect him and his descendants from harm (Genesis 4:11-16).

One concept of sin deals with things that exist on Earth, but not in [[Heaven in Christianity|Heaven]]. Food, for example, while a necessary good for the (health of the [[Temporality|temporal]]) body, is not of ([[eternity|eternal]]) transcendental living and therefore its ''excessive'' [[Gluttony|savoring]] is considered a sin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"&gt;Hanegraaff, Hank. ''The Bible Answer Book'' pp. 18-21. {{ISBN|0-8499-9544-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unforgivable sin (or [[eternal sin]]) is a sin that can never be forgiven;
Matthew 12:30-32 :
" &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; He that is not with me, is against me: and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth. &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; And Therefore I say to you: Every sin and [[Blasphemy#Christianity|blasphemy]] shall be forgiven men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven. &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; And whosoever shall speak a word against the [[Son of man]], it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall speak against the [[Holy Ghost]], it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come."

In [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christianity sins are classified into grave sins called [[mortal sin]]s and less serious sins called [[venial sin]]. Mortal sins cause one to lose salvation unless the sinner repents and venial sins require some sort of penance either on Earth or in [[Purgatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church No. 1472|location=The Vatican|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1472.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus was said to have paid for the complete mass of sins past, present, and to come in future. Even inevitable sin is said to have already been cleansed.

The [[Lamb of God]] was and is God himself and is therefore sinless. In the Old Testament, [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 16:21 states that ‘the laying on of hands’ was the action that the High Priest [[Aaron]] was ordered to do yearly by God to take sins of Israel's nation onto a [[sacrificial lamb|spotless young lamb]].

=== Hinduism ===
&lt;!--Section was previously blanked by an IP: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sin&amp;diff=391608941&amp;oldid=391538998 --&gt;
In [[Hinduism]], the term ''sin'' (''{{IAST|pāpa}}'' in [[Sanskrit]]) is often used to describe actions that create negative [[Karma]] by violating moral and ethical codes, which automatically brings negative consequences. This is somewhat  similar to Abrahamic sin in the sense that pāpa is considered a crime against the laws of God, which is known as (1) [[Dharma]], or moral order, and (2) one's own self, but another term ''aparadha'' is used for grave offences. The term papa cannot be taken however, in literal sense as that of a sin. This is because there is no consensus regarding the nature of ultimate reality or God in Hinduism. Only, the vedanta school being unambiguously theistic, whereas no anthropomorphic God exists in the rest five schools namely Samkhya, Nyaya Yoga, Vaishashikha, and  Purva-Mimansa . The term  ''papa'' however in the strictest sense refers to actions which bring about wrong/unfavourable consequences, not relating to a specific divine will in the absolute sense. To conclude, considering a  lack of consensus  regarding the nature of ultimate reality in Hinduism, it can be considered that ''papa'' has lesser insistence on God for it be translated as Sin, and that there is no exact equivalent to Sin in Hinduism.

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Islamic views on sin}}

In [[Islamic ethics]], [[Muslim]]s see sin as anything that goes against the commands of [[Allah]] ([[God in Islam|God]]), a breach of the laws and norms laid down by religion.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2211|work=Sin|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic terms for sin include ''dhanb'' and ''khaṭīʾa'', which are synonymous and refer to intentional sins; ''khiṭʾ'', which means simply a sin; and ''ithm'', which is used for grave sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Wensinck, A. J. | year= 2012 | title=K̲h̲aṭīʾa |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/2214-871X_ei1_SIM_4141|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], the word for sin is the Sanskrit word पाप (''paap''), which is the antithesis of पुण्य (''punya'') meaning merit. A ''[[Jiva (Jainism)|jiva]]'' (a being) acquires sin based on its [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], if it hurts anyone, causes someone to hurt anyone, or commends hurting anyone by thought, speech or action. Anyone, here, refers to literally any living organism, but not limited to human beings.

No ''jiva'' can achieve ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (ultimate emancipation) without ceasing to accumulate karma and shedding off the already accumulated karma entirely. A ''jiva'' accumulates karma if it resorts to violence, non-chastity, falsehood, stealing, and possessiveness. A ''jiva'' ceases to accumulate karma if he resorts to the golden trio of ''samyak gyan'' (right knowledge), ''samyak darshan'' (right sight) and ''samyak charitra'' (right character). A ''jiva'' begins to shed off the accumulated karma by resorting to penance, repentance, vows and by exterminating foes of lust, anger, attachment, aversion, ignorance and fallacy.

If a ''jiva'' does not give up sin, his karma will keep accumulating and no sin can be absolved without getting its fruit or repenting for it. Thus such a ''jiva'' is bound to remain in the worldly cycle of constant [[reincarnation]], wherein it will keep taking rebirths, into any of the four broad types of living organisms, depending on the magnitude and nature of karma accumulated in previous birth(s). The four types are ''dev'' (beings of heaven, including deities), ''manushya'' (human), ''tiryanch'' (plants, animals, insects, etc.) and ''naarki'' (beings of hell). 

During this cycle of getting born and dying for infinity, the ''jiva'' will have to then live the life of the organism he is and while living it, the ''jiva'' will again perform more karma. This will again lead to rebirth and again performing more karma. Thus, the cycle continues.

It is important to note that Jains believe that for complete liberation, not only the "sinful karma" but even the "meritorious karma" needs to be shed off. This means that a jiva can truly attain moksha, only if the soul is completely and absolutely pure and devoid of any accumulation. For instance, sins may cause the ''jiva'' to be reborn, inter alia, in hell and merits may cause it to be reborn in heaven. But heaven, like hell is a part of worldly cycle of reincarnation and not supreme moksha of the soul. Thus, if a person hypothetically keeps performing only and exclusively good deeds in his life, he may still not attain ''moksha'', because he has not yet shed off previously accumulated sins through repentance and knowledge.

Jains believe that only a human ''jiva'' has the capacity and the will to attain ''moksha''. Hence the ''jiva'' should use this extremely rare opportunity of being born as a human to walk on the path that brings him closer to ''moksha''. In fact, Jains take the concept of avoiding sin so seriously that not only are they completely [[vegetarian]] but some devout Jains also abstain from eating underground grown food like potatoes, onions, etc. to avoid killing small organisms. Most of the Jains are also nonalcoholics and eat before sunset each day.

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Jewish views on sin|Golden mean (philosophy)#Judaism}}
Mainstream [[Judaism]] regards the violation of any of the [[613 commandments]] of the [[Mosaic law]] for [[Jews]], or the seven [[Noahide laws]] for [[Gentiles]] as a sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/The_Seven_Noahide_Laws.html|title= The Seven Noachide Laws - Jewish Virtual Library|publisher= Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate= 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism teaches that all humans are inclined to sin from birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Rosenberg|first1= A. J.|last2= [[Rashi]]|title= The Book of Genesis (Genesis 8:21 with [[Rashi]]'s commentary)|date= 1969|publisher= The Judaica Press|location= New York|isbn= 1880582082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sin has many classifications and degrees. Some sins are punishable with death by the court, others with death by heaven, others with lashes, and others without such punishment, but no sins with willful intent go without consequence. Unwillful violations of the [[613 commandments|mitzvot]] (without negligence) do not count as sins. "Sins by error" are considered as less severe sins. When the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] yet stood in Jerusalem, people would offer [[Karbanot|sacrifices]] for their misdeeds. The atoning aspect of ''[[korbanot]]'' is carefully circumscribed. For the most part, ''korbanot'' only expiate such "sins by error", that is, sins committed because a person forgot or did not know that this thing was a sin. In some circumstances, lack of knowledge is considered close to deliberate intent. No atonement is needed for violations committed under duress, and for the most part, ''korbanot'' cannot atone for a deliberate sin. In addition, ''korbanot'' have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely repents his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who suffered harm through the violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/qorbanot.html|title= Sacrifices and Offerings (Karbanot)|publisher= Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate= 1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rabbimichaelskobac"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/answers/jewish-polemics/texts/scriptural-studies/leviticus-1711/|title= Leviticus 17:11|author= Rabbi Michael Skobac|publisher= Jews for Judaism|accessdate= 1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judaism teaches that all willful sin has consequences. The completely righteous suffer for their sins (by humiliation, poverty, and suffering that God sends them) in this world and receive their reward in the world to come. The in-between (not completely righteous or completely wicked), suffer for and repent their sins after death and thereafter join the righteous. The very evil do not repent even at the gates of hell. Such people prosper in this world to receive their reward for any good deed, but cannot be cleansed by and hence cannot leave ''[[Gehenna|gehinnom]]'', because they do not or cannot repent. This world can therefore seem unjust where the righteous suffer, while the wicked prosper. Many great thinkers have contemplated this.&lt;ref name="rabbimichaelskobac"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Sparagmos''''' ({{lang-grc|σπαραγμός}}, from σπαράσσω ''sparasso'', "tear, rend, pull to pieces") is an act of rending, tearing apart, or mangling,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Lincoln]], ''Death, War, and Sacrifice: Studies in Ideology and Practice'' (University of Chicago Press, 1991), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; usually in a [[Dionysian]] context.

In Dionysian rite as represented in myth and literature, a living animal, or sometimes even a human being, is [[Animal sacrifice|sacrificed]] by being dismembered. ''Sparagmos'' was frequently followed by [[omophagia]] (the eating of the raw flesh of the one dismembered). It is associated with the [[Maenad]]s or Bacchantes, followers of [[Dionysus]], and the [[Dionysian Mysteries]]. Historically, however, there is little indication that women celebrating the rites of Dionysus dismembered animals or ate raw flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Dillon, ''Girls and Women in Classical Greek Religion'' (Routledge, 2002), pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of ''sparagmos'' appear in [[Euripides]]'s play ''[[The Bacchae]]''. In one scene guards sent to control the Maenads witness them pulling a live bull to pieces with their hands. Later, after King [[Pentheus]] has banned the worship of Dionysus, the god lures him into a forest, to be torn limb from limb by Maenads, including his own mother [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]]. According to some myths, [[Orpheus]], regarded as a prophet of Orphic or Bacchic religion, died when he was dismembered by raging Thracian women. 

==Medea==
[[Medea]] is said to have killed and dismembered [[Absyrtus|her brother]] whilst fleeing with [[Jason]] and the stolen [[Golden Fleece|fleece]] in order to delay their pursuers, who would be compelled to collect the remains of the prince for burial. The Italian film director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] staged a sparagmos ritual as part of a long sequence near the beginning of his film ''[[Medea (1969 film)|Medea]]'' (1969), before dramatising the episode in which Medea kills her brother in a similar way.

==Modern literature and theory==
Interpreting the ritual through the lens of the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[Oedipus complex]], Catherine Maxwell identifies ''sparagmos'' as a form of [[castration]], particularly in the case of Orpheus.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Maxwell, ''The Female Sublime from Milton to Swinburne: Bearing Blindness'', Manchester University Press, 2001, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary literature, this is used in [[Tennessee Williams]]'s play ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer]]''. 

Sparagmos is also briefly mentioned in [[Donna Tartt|Donna Tartt's]] ''[[The Secret History]]''.

Sparagmos is a central theme in [[Dimitris Lyacos]]'s [[The First Death]] recounting the torments of a mutilated protagonist stranded on an island. The book draws upon the dismemberment of Dionysus as well as ancient Greek rituals and practices.&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Modern Greek Studies,Volume 19, 2001/ Johns Hopkins University Press.

{{italic title}}
'''''Summum bonum''''' is a Latin expression meaning "the highest good", which was introduced by the [[Roman philosopher]] [[Cicero]],{{sfn|Dinneen|1909}} to correspond to the [[Form of the Good|Idea of the Good]] in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. The ''summum bonum'' is generally thought of as being an end in itself, and at the same time containing all other goods.

The term was used in [[medieval philosophy]]. In the [[Thomism|Thomist]] synthesis of [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Christianity]], the highest good is usually defined as the life of the righteous and/or the life led in [[communion (Christian)|communion]] with [[God]] and according to [[Divine law|God's precepts]].{{sfn|Dinneen|1909}} In [[Kantianism]], it was used to describe the [[ultimate importance]], the singular and overriding end which human beings ought to pursue.

==Plato and Aristotle==
[[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' argued that, "In the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all, and is seen...to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right".&lt;ref&gt;B. Jowett trans, ''The Essential Plato'' (1999) p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Silent contemplation was the route to appreciation of the Idea of the Good.&lt;ref&gt;A. Kojeve, ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel'' (1980) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' accepted that the target of human activity, "Must be the 'Good', that is, the supreme good.", but challenged Plato's Idea of the Good with the [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] question: "Will one who has had a vision of the Idea itself become thereby a better doctor or general?".&lt;ref&gt;H, Tredennick revd, ''The Ethics of Aristotle'' (1976) p. 63 and p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; However, arguably at least, Aristotle's concept of the [[unmoved mover]] owed much to Plato's Idea of the Good.&lt;ref&gt;Tredennick, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hellenic syncretism==
[[Philo]] of Alexandria conflated the [[Old Testament]] God with the unmoved mover and the Idea of the Good.&lt;ref&gt;J. Boardman ed., ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (1991) p. 703&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plotinus]], the [[neoplatonism|neoplatonic]] philosopher, built on Plato's Good for his concept of the supreme One, while [[Plutarch]] drew on [[Zoroastrianism]] to develop his eternal principle of good.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, p. 705-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] in his early writings offered the summum bonum as the highest human goal, but was later to identify it as a feature of the Christian God&lt;ref&gt;J. McWilliam, ''Augustine'' (1992) p. 152-4&lt;/ref&gt; in ''De natura boni'' (''On the Nature of Good'', c. 399). Augustine denies the positive existence of absolute [[evil]], describing a world with [[God]] as the supreme good at the center, and defining different grades of evil as different stages of remoteness from that center{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

==Later developments==
The summum bonum has continued to be a focus of attention in Western philosophy, secular and religious. [[Hegel]] replaced Plato's dialectical ascent to the Good by his own dialectical ascent to the Real.&lt;ref&gt;Kojeve, p. 181-4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. E. Moore]] placed the highest good in personal relations and the contemplation of beauty – even if not all his followers in the [[Bloomsbury Group]] may have appreciated what [[Clive Bell]] called his "all-important distinction between 'Good on the whole' and 'Good as a whole'".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in H. Lee, ''Virginia Woolf'' (1996)  p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] considered that "the sovereign good, if this confusing term must be retained, can be found again only at the level of the law",&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;  i.e. the [[symbolic order]], offsetting [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] with [[Marquis de Sade|De Sade]] to undercut nobler but one-dimensional notions of the Good.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Concepts'' p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier he had regretted the way the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] must know, "Not only doesn't he have that Sovereign Good that is asked of him, but he also knows there isn't any".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Ethics of Psychoanalysis'' (1992) p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgments==
{{Details|Intrinsic value (ethics)#Life stances and intrinsic value}}
Judgments on the highest good have generally fallen into four categories:{{sfn|Dinneen|1909}}
* [[Utilitarianism]], when the highest good is identified with the maximum possible psychological happiness for the maximum number of people;
* [[Eudaemonism]] or [[virtue ethics]], when the highest good is identified with [[eudaemonia|flourishing]];
* Rational [[deontologism]], when the highest good is identified with [[virtue]] or duty;
* Rational eudaemonism, or tempered deontologism, when both virtue and happiness are combined in the highest good.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16572">A '''tobacco fatwa''' is a [[fatwa]] ([[Islam]]ic legal pronouncement) that prohibits the usage of [[tobacco]] by [[Muslim]]s. All contemporary rulings condemn smoking as potentially harmful or prohibit ([[haraam|haram]]) smoking outright as a result of the [[Health effects of tobacco|severe health damage]] that it causes. [[Arab Muslims]] tend to prohibit smoking (despite [[Saudi Arabia]] ranking 23rd in the world for the percentage of its population that smokes)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanbedu.com/2009/10/09/saudi-arabia-don%E2%80%99t-keep-us-from-smoking/|title=Saudi Arabia:  Don’t Keep Us From Smoking|work=American Bedu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in South Asia, smoking tends to be considered lawful but discouraged:&lt;ref name="Ghouri et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghouri|first1=N|last2=Atcha|first2=M|last3=Sheikh|first3=A|title=Influence of Islam on smoking among Muslims.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=4 February 2006|volume=332|issue=7536|pages=291-4|doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7536.291|pmid=16455732|pmc=1360407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many Muslims, the legal status of smoking has changed during recent years, and numerous fatawas, including from notable authorities such as [[Al-Azhar University]] in Cairo, now consider smoking ''[[haram]]'' (prohibited). The reasons cited in support of the reclassification of smoking as prohibited include [[Islamic law]]'s general prohibition of all actions that result in harm. For example, the Quran says, "And spend of your substance in the cause of God, and make not your own hands contribute to your own destruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|2|195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, jurists rely on the exhortations in the Quran not to waste money. Greater appreciation of the risks associated with [[secondhand smoke]] has also led recent jurists to cite the obligation to avoid causing willful annoyance, distress, or harm to other people.&lt;ref name="Ghouri et al. 2006"/&gt;

Fatwas condemning smoking have been issued in [[Egypt]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Malaysia]], [[Morocco]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[UAE]], among others.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;&lt;ref name=Byron /&gt;  

==History==
The earliest fatwa regarding smoking was issued in Morocco in 1602. Following the introduction of tobacco to the kingdom in 1598, King [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] sought guidance from religious scholars in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]]. The kingdom's Grand Mufti and the Wali of Sila both ruled that smoking was forbidden in Islam. This ruling failed to have much effect on tobacco use in the kingdom, leading the Mufti to issue a second ruling forbidding its use, as the use of all "intoxicants and harmful substances" is forbidden in Islam. This categorical prohibition was unsuccessful, and the Mufti and the other scholars who joined him in his ruling were either killed by a mob angry at this ruling or fled the country.{{r|WHO|pp=13-15}}

In recent years, [[tobacco fatwa]]s (Islamic legal pronouncements) have been issued due to health concerns.

The holy book of [[Islam]], the [[Qur'ān]], does not specifically prohibit or denounce smoking, but gives behavioral guidance:

* “Don't throw yourself into danger by your own hands...” (el-Bakara 2/195)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|2|195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* “You may eat, drink, but not waste” (el-A‘râf 7/31)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|7|31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Do not kill yourselves for God Almighty is most merciful to you" (en-Nisaa' 4/29)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|4|29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, at least one recent survey (Abbottabad, [[Pakistan]]) found that observant Muslims tend to avoid smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hameed|first1=A|last2=Jalil|first2=MA|last3=Noreen|first3=R|last4=Mughal|first4=I|last5=Rauf|first5=S|title=Role of Islam in prevention of smoking.|journal=Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad|date=2002|volume=14|issue=1|pages=23-5|pmid=12043328|url=http://www.ayubmed.edu.pk/JAMC/PAST/14-1/Hameed.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of young Muslim Arab-Americans found that Islamic influences were correlated with some diminished smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Islam|first1=SM|last2=Johnson|first2=CA|title=Correlates of smoking behavior among Muslim Arab-American adolescents.|journal=Ethnicity &amp; Health|date=November 2003|volume=8|issue=4|pages=319-37|doi=10.1080/13557850310001631722|pmid=14660124|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a714038251~db=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, an Egyptian study found that knowledge of an anti-smoking [[fatwa]] did not reduce smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radwan |first1=GN |last2=Israel |first2=E |last3=El-Setouhy |first3=M |last4=Abdel-Aziz |first4=F |last5=Mikhail |first5=N |last6=Mohamed |first6=MK |title=Impact of religious rulings (Fatwa) on smoking. |journal=Journal of the Egyptian Society of Parasitology |date=December 2003 |volume=33 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=1087-101 |pmid=15119472 |url=http://www.nosmokingegypt.com/FATWA.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041012204303/http://www.nosmokingegypt.com/FATWA.pdf |archivedate=2004-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the prevalence of smoking is increasing in Islamic countries.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

The prominent scholar [[Yusuf al Qaradawi]] argues that smoking is no longer an issue of dispute among Islamic scholars due to the knowledge of health risks.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reported juristic disagreement among Muslim scholars on the ruling concerning smoking, since its appearance and spread, is not usually based on differences between legal proofs, but on the difference in the verification of the cause on which the ruling is based. They all agree that whatever is proved to be harmful to the body and mind is prohibited, yet they differ whether this ruling applies to smoking. Some of them claimed that smoking has some benefits, others assured that it had few disadvantages compared to its benefits, whereas a third group maintained that it had neither benefits nor bad effects. This means that if scholars had been certain about the harmfulness of smoking, then they would undoubtedly have considered it prohibited.[…]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Second: Our inclination to consider smoking prohibited does not mean that it is as grave as major sins like adultery, drinking alcohol or theft. In fact, prohibited matters in Islam are relative; some of them are minor prohibitions whereas others are major, and each has its own ruling. The major sins, for example, have no expiation other than sincere repentance. However, the minor sins can be expiated by the Five Prayers, the [[Friday Prayer]], the Fasting of [[Ramadan]], the Night Vigil Prayer in Ramadan, and other acts of worship. They can also be expiated by avoiding the major sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503548726 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213192447/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503548726 |title=Is the Ruling on Smoking Still Controversial? - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar |archivedate=13 February 2008 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fatwas ruling that smoking is impermissible have been issued by sheikhs of all four Sunni schools of [[fiqh]]—[[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Hanbali]]—as well as by those of the [[Ibadi]] sect.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

==Egypt==
In 2000, the [[Grand Mufti of Egypt]], Dr. [[Nasr Farid Wasil]], ruled that smoking was ''[[haram]]''  (forbidden) in Islam because of its detrimental health effects.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Khayat |editor1-first=M.H. |title=Islamic Ruling on Smoking |date=2000 |publisher=World Health Organization Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean |location=Alexandria, Egypt |isbn=92-9021-277-2 |edition=2 |url=http://applications.emro.who.int/dsaf/dsa46.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fatwa, which ruled that smoking is a major sin on par with alcohol use and acceptable grounds for divorce, triggered substantial controversy in Egypt.&lt;ref name=Hossam&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hassan |first1=Hossam |title=RELIGION-EGYPT: Fatwa On Smoking Triggers Debate |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2000/10/religion-egypt-fatwa-on-smoking-triggers-debate/ |accessdate=2 August 2018 |work=IPS |date=October 5, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grand Imam Gadul Haq Ali Gadul Haq, the Sheikh of [[al-Azhar mosque]], the center of Islamic learning in the Sunni world, issued a similar ruling in 2000, citing the following verse from the Quran as justification: "and cast not yourselves to ruin with your own hands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|2|195}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|WHO|pg=22}} 

==Indonesia==
In 2009, [[Majelis Ulama Indonesia]], the organization of Indonesian religious scholars, declared smoking in public or near pregnant women ''haram'' (forbidden), while declaring smoking in general to be ''[[makruh]]'' (discouraged or reprehensible).&lt;ref name=Byron&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008111| issn = 2044-6055| volume = 5| issue = 12| pages = –008111| last1 = Byron| first1 = M.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study found that the fatwa had had a small effect on smoking and was primarily effective at keeping non-smokers from smoking.&lt;ref name=Byron /&gt;

==Iran==
Iran’s Grand Ayatollah [[Mirza Shirazi]] in 1891 [[Tobacco Protest|issued a fatwa against tobacco]].

==Malaysia==
Malaysia's [[National Fatwa Council]] first issued a fatwa against smoking in 1996, when it declared smoking haram because of its detrimental health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Don’t take ‘smoking is haram’ fatwa lightly, Muslims told |url=https://www.malaymail.com/s/487343/dont-take-smoking-is-haram-fatwa-lightly-muslims-told |accessdate=2 August 2018 |work=malaymail |date=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a study of Muslims and Buddhists in Malaysia found that this fatwa and other religious norms against smoking have had an independent and significant increase in quit attempts. Among Muslims, religious pressure against smoking was more effective at inspiring people to quit than social pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s12529-012-9225-6| issn = 1070-5503| volume = 20| issue = 2| pages = 252–258| last1 = Yong| first1 = Hua-Hie| last2 = Savvas| first2 = Steven| last3 = Borland| first3 = Ron| last4 = Thrasher| first4 = James| last5 = Sirirassamee| first5 = Buppha| last6 = Omar| first6 = Maizurah| title = Secular Versus Religious Norms Against Smoking: Which Is More Important as a Driver of Quitting Behaviour Among Muslim Malaysian and Buddhist Thai Smokers?| journal = International Journal of Behavioral Medicine| accessdate = 2018-08-02| date = 2013-06-01| url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-012-9225-6| pmc = 3412917}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the National Fatwa Council followed-up by issuing a fatwa declaring [[electronic cigarette]]s haram because of their harmful health effects and bad smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia's Fatwa Council declares electronic cigarettes as 'haram' or forbidden |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysias-fatwa-council-declares-electronic-cigarettes-as-haram-or-forbidden |accessdate=2 August 2018 |work=The Straits Times |date=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Oman==
In 1996, Sheikh Ahmed Bin Hamad Al Khalili, the Grand Mufti of Oman, issued a fatwa prohibiting smoking and the sale of tobacco, comparing smoking to "sipping poison" Sheikh Al Khalili cited a verse from the Quran,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|4|29}}&lt;/ref&gt; "do not kill yourselves for God Almighty is most merciful to you," to justify his ruling.{{r|WHO|pg=91}}

==The Philippines ==
The Supreme Council of Darul Ifta of the Philippines, headed by Grand Mufti Sheikh Omar Pasigan, stated in June 2010 that smoking cigarettes is ''haram''.&lt;ref name="forbidden to smoke"&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate=  4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saudi Arabia==
The [[Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia]], Sheikh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Aal Al-Sheikh, has ruled that "smoking is impermissible on the basis of authentic quotations, sound judgments, and the opinions of reputable physicians."{{r|WHO|pg=97}} The Mufti cites a sahih [[hadith]] (verifiable saying of the Prophet) saying "do not harm yourself or others." He further referenced a Quranic verse saying that the Prophet "forbids that which is unwholesome." 

==The UAE==
In addition to issuing a fatwa against smoking, the United Arab Emirates instructed imams in all mosques to read a sermon against smoking on June 11, 1999 following [[Friday prayers]].{{r|WHO|pg=105}}

==Tobacco industry pushback==
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, tobacco companies including [[British American Tobacco]] and [[Altria Group|Phillip Morris]] were involved in campaigns to undermine fatwas against smoking in [[Muslim majority countries]] by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a {{"'}}fundamentalist'? who wishes to return to [[Shariah|sharia law]]", and be "a threat to existing government".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boseley |first1=Sarah |title=How tobacco firms tried to undermine Muslim countries' smoking ban |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/20/tobacco-firms-tried-undermine-muslim-countries-smoking-ban|accessdate=5 February 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|title=How tobacco firms try to undermine Muslim countries' smoking ban|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2015/04/21/84683.php|accessdate=5 February 2017|publisher=[[The Bangladesh Observer]]|date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tobacco industry]] was also concerned that the [[World Health Organization]]'s encouraging of anti-smoking stance of [[Ulama|Muslim scholars]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 1985 report from tobacco firm Philip Morris squarely blamed the WHO: "This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO ... The WHO has not only joined forces with Muslim fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Towards a Global Ethic: An Initial Declaration''''' expresses the ethical commitments held in common by the world's religious, spiritual, and cultural traditions.&lt;ref name="ethic"&gt;"Towards a Global Ethic (An Initial Declaration)", Parliament of the World's Religions, Chicago, 1993. It is the Parliament's signature document.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weltethos.org/erkl%C3%A4rung%20zum%20weltethos/|title= ''Towards a Global Ethic: An Initial Declaration'' translated into various languages|accessdate=2013-08-17|format=PDF in Arabic, Malaysian, Bulgarian, Chinese, German, English, French, Italian, Catalan, Croatian, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian, Slovene, Spanish, Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
At the request of the Council for a [[Parliament of the World's Religions]], [[Hans Küng]], President of the Foundation for a Global Ethic (''Stiftung Weltethos''), wrote an initial draft in consultation with fellow scholars and religious leaders. The Council's leaders and Trustees then worked on the final draft in consultation with Küng and their own, extensive network of leaders and scholars from various religions and regions. Most notable in leading this effort were [https://parliamentofreligions.org/videos/daniel-gomez-ibanez-first-director-parliament Daniel Gómez-Ibáñez], the Executive Director of the Council, and [https://eia.archchicago.org/about-us/presentations-and-contributions-by-the-vicar-very-reverend-thomas-a.-baima Thomas A. Baima], a member of the Board of Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;"Executive summary: 1993 Parliament of the World’s Religions." Chicago, Illinois: Council for the Parliament of the World’s Religions.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamental ethical demands ==
The declaration identifies two fundamental ethical demands as its foundation. First: the [[Golden Rule]]: ''What you wish done to yourself, do to others,'' "a principle which is found and has persisted in many religious and ethical traditions of humankind of thousands of years." Second: every human being must be treated humanely—an insight the beginnings of which exists in every great religious or ethical traditions.&lt;ref name="Kung book"&gt;Hans Küng, ''A Global Ethic: The Declaration of the Parliament of the World's Religions''(New York: Continuum, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Four shared directives ==
The two fundamental ethical demands are made concrete in four directives, which are "convincing and practical for all women and men of good will, religious and non-religious".&lt;ref name="ethic"/&gt; These directives are elaborated in the ''Global Ethic''. They are:

     1. Commitment to a culture of non-violence and respect for life.
     2. Commitment to a culture of solidarity and a just economic order.
     3. Commitment to a culture of tolerance and a life of truthfulness.
     4. Commitment to a culture of equal rights and partnership between men and women.

== Other unique features ==
=== The directives proclaim things held in common ===
The ''Global Ethic'' acknowledges that some significant differences exist between, and among, the religions. Still, these differences need not, it insists, stop them "from proclaiming publicly those things" that they already hold in common and that they jointly affirm. Each tradition holds those things to be true on the basis of their own religious or ethical grounds.&lt;ref name="ethic"/&gt;

=== Contains no religious or theological language ===
Because its goal was to express those things about which the world's religious, spiritual, and cultural traditions agree, no religious or theological terms appear in "the Global Ethic". Some religions such as [[Buddhism]] do not have a god while other religions such as [[Hinduism]] have many.

=== Calls for a change in inner consciousness ===
In his account of the writing of the ''Global Ethic'', Küng describes several working parameters: It should 1) make a clear distinction between the ethical level and the purely legal or political level, 2) not duplicate the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] because an ethic is more than [[rights]], 3) avoid political declarations, 4) not devolve into [[casuistry]], 5) forego any attempt to become a philosophical [[treatise]], and, 6) set aside enthusiastic religious proclamations. On a positive programmatic level, the declaration must: 1) penetrate to the deep ethical level of binding values, irrevocable criteria, and basic inner attitudes, 2) be capable of securing moral unanimity and steer clear of statements rejected by the religions, 3) offer constructive criticism, 4) relate to the world as it really is, 5) use language familiar to newspaper readers (no technical jargon!), 6) have a religious foundation since, for the religions, an ethic must have a religious foundation.&lt;ref name="Kung book"/&gt;

=== Endorsed globally ===
In the summer of 1993, "The ''Global Ethic''" was ratified as an official document of the Parliament of the World's Religions by a vote of its Trustees. It was then signed by more than 200 leaders from 40+ different faith traditions and spiritual communities during the [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1993-06-04-9306040123-story.html international gathering organized by the Parliament in 1993] in Chicago, Illinois · USA.&lt;ref&gt;"The Assembly of Religious and Spiritual Leaders: List of Participants," 1993 Parliament of the World's Religions, The Art Institute of Chicago, September 2, 3, &amp; 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1993/09/03/declaration-of-a-global-ethic-signed-at-religious-parliament/ca995881-52e9-4ca1-9ebf-29097545132d/?utm_term=.d50729519b71 Laurie Goodstein, "'Declaration of a Global Ethic' Signed at Religious Parliament," Washington Post, September 3, 1993].&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of participants attending the gathering also endorsed "the ''Global Ethic''" by acclamation. Since 1993 leaders and individuals around the world continue to endorse the ''Global Ethic'' with their signatures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://parliamentofreligions.org/global-ethic-signatures List of individuals who have endorsed the Global Ethic.]&lt;/ref&gt; It has served as a common ground for people to discuss, to agree, and to cooperate for the good of all.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/ethics_online/0023 "In Search of Common Ground: The Role of a Global Ethic in Inter-Religious Dialogue." Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs, July 1, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2018: a fifth directive ==
Since 1993, agreement has emerged among the world's religious, spiritual, and cultural traditions on issues tied to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia: Religion and environmentalism]]&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of this shift, and because the ''Global Ethic'' was intended from the start to be a living document, the Parliament of the World's Religions decided to expand the ''Global Ethic'' with a fifth directive. Led by Myriam Renaud, the Parliament's Global Ethic Project Director, a task force wrote an initial draft. After soliciting and reflecting on 100+ pages of comments offered by scholars and religious leaders from many of the world's faith traditions and regions, the task force prepared and then submitted a final draft to the Trustees for their vote.&lt;ref name="ethic"/&gt; The ''Global Ethic'', expanded with a fifth directive, became official in July 2018:

     5. Commitment to a culture of [[sustainability]] and care for the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://parliamentofreligions.org/parliament/global-ethic/fifth-directive Full text of the fifth directive available on the website of the Parliament of the World's Religions.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Humanity's shared home was mentioned in the 1993 draft of the ''Global Ethic''. Its first directive states that the lives of animals and plants deserve protection and care and that people, especially with a view to future generations, have a special responsibility for the Earth's air, water and soil. The fifth directive sets out in greater detail what this responsibility entails—for example: "Caring and prudent use of resources is based on fairness in consumption and takes into account limits on what ecosystems can bear."

Related concepts are [[eudaimonia]], [[happiness]], [[flourishing]], [[quality of life]], [[contentment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5|pages=6–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[meaningful life]].
{{TOC limit|2}}

== Theories ==
Central theories are [[Ed Diener|Diener's]] [[tripartite model of subjective well-being]], [[Carol Ryff|Ryff's]] [[Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being]], [[Corey Keyes|Corey Keyes']] work on [[flourishing]], and [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]]'s contributions to [[positive psychology]] and his theories on ''authentic happiness'' and [[Martin Seligman#PERMA|P.E.R.M.A.]]

Positive psychology is concerned with [[eudaimonia]], "the good life" or [[flourishing]], living according to what holds the greatest value in life – the factors that contribute the most to a well-lived and fulfilling life. While not attempting a strict definition of the good life, positive psychologists agree that one must live a [[Happiness|happy]], engaged, and meaningful life in order to experience "the good life". [[Martin Seligman]] referred to "the good life" as "using your signature strengths every day to produce authentic happiness and abundant gratification".&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M.E.P. (2009). Authentic Happiness. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]], "eudaimonia trumps hedonism".&lt;ref name="Peterson2008"&gt;Christopher Peterson (2008), [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-good-life/200805/what-is-positive-psychology-and-what-is-it-not ''What Is Positive Psychology, and What Is It Not?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on positive psychology, well-being, eudaimonia and happiness, and the theories of Diener, Ryff, Keyes and Seligmann cover a broad range of levels and topics, including "the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life."{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}}

The pursuit&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;http://thriving.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Catalino - Prioritizing Positivity (Simon-Thomas Lecture).pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of happiness predicts both positive emotions and less depressive symptoms. People&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; who prioritize happiness are more psychologically able, all else held equal.

== Methodology of study ==

=== Well-being measurement ===
Different ways of measuring well-being reveal different contributing factors. The correlation between two of these, life satisfaction and happiness, in the World Values Survey (1981–2005) is only 0.47.&lt;ref name="internationaljournalofwellbeing.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://internationaljournalofwellbeing.org/index.php/ijow/article/viewFile/364/477 |title=A statistical meta-analysis of the wellbeing literature |website=internationaljournalofwellbeing.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are different, but related concepts which are used interchangeably outside of academia. Typically, life satisfaction, or evaluative wellbeing is measured with Cantril’s self-anchoring ladder, a questionnaire where wellbeing is rated on a scale from 1–10. Happiness or hedonic/Affective well-being measurement is measured with the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS), a more complex scale.

=== Limitations ===
The UK Government's Department of Health compiled a factsheet in 2014, in which it is stated that the key limitations to well-being, quality of life and life satisfaction research are that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wellbeing-and-health-policy|title=Wellbeing and health policy - GOV.UK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are numerous associations and correlations in the body of evidence, but few causal relationships, since existing longitudinal datasets "''do not use consistent wellbeing and predictor measures at different time points''";
* After controlling for mental health status, not many of the found associations are still significant;
* Subgroup analyses are rare;
* There are too few studies to conduct meta-analyses;
* There are too few interventional studies.

== Major factors ==

=== For evaluative well-being (life satisfaction) ===
Mental health is the strongest&lt;ref&gt;[http://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/research/wellbeing/causes_and_effects_of_wellbeing.as ]{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; individual predictor of life satisfaction. Mental illness is associated&lt;ref name=pmid26321990&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garaigordobil M | title = Predictor variables of happiness and its connection with risk and protective factors for health | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 6 | pages = 1176 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26321990 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with poorer well-being. In fact, mental health is the strongest determinant of quality of life at a later age.

Studies&lt;ref name=pmid10784456&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mendlowicz MV, Stein MB | title = Quality of life in individuals with anxiety disorders | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 157 | issue = 5 | pages = 669–82 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10784456 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.5.669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have documented the relationship between anxiety and quality of life.

The VOXEU&lt;ref name="voxeu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voxeu.org/article/origins-happiness|title=Origins of happiness: Evidence and policy implications|first1=Andrew|last1=Clark|first2=Sarah|last2=Fleche|first3=Richard|last3=Layard|first4=Nattavudh|last4=Powdthavee|first5=George|last5=Ward | name-list-format = vanc |date=12 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; analysis of happiness showed the principal determinants of an adult’s life satisfaction to be income, parenting, family break up, mother's mental health and schooling.
The factors that explain life satisfaction roughly map (negatively) to those factors that explain misery. They are first and foremost diagnosed depression/anxiety, which explains twice as much as the next factor, physical health (number of medical conditions), that explains just as much variance in subjective well-being between people, as income and whether someone is partnered.
These factors count twice as much as each of whether someone is employed and whether they are a non-criminal, which in turn are 3 times as important as years of education.

Overall, the best predictor of an adult's life satisfaction is their emotional health as a child as reported by the mother and child. It trumps factors like the qualifications that someone gets and their behaviour at 16 as reported by the mother. A child and therefore an adult's emotional health is most affected itself by a mother's mental health, which is just over twice as important as family income.
2/3 as important as family income is parent's involvement, which is 0.1 partial correlation coefficients more important than aggressive parenting (negative), father's unemployment (negative), family conflict (negative) and whether the mother worked in the subject's 1st year of life.

Whether the mother worked thereafter has 0 correlation with well-being, however. In terms of non-family factors, the place where someone goes to secondary school matters a fair bit more than observed family background altogether, which in turn is slightly more important than the place where someone went to primary school.

=== For affective well-being (happiness) ===

The main determinants of affective well-being, by correlation and effect size are:&lt;ref name="internationaljournalofwellbeing.org"/&gt;

# Corruption index (-0.54)
# Public service quality (0.40)
# GDP per capita (although, there is evidence of publication bias) (0.39)
# Economic freedom (0.35)
# Human rights violations (-0.33)
# Political and economic violence (-0.28)
# Life expectancy at birth (0.27)
# Unemployment (0.19)
# Are you married (0.07)

Determinants that correlate highly with one another, for instance, alternative ways of measuring corruption, are excluded from this list.

== Biological factors ==

=== Gender ===
Over the last 33 years, a significant decrease in women's happiness leads researchers to believe that men are happier than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stevenson |first=B. |last2=Wolfers |first2=J. |year=2009|title=The paradox of declining female happiness |journal=American Economic Journal: Economic Policy |volume= 1 |issue=2 |pages=190–225. |doi=10.1257/pol.1.2.190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a Pew Research Centre survey found that more women are satisfied with their lives than men, overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/men-or-women-happier.htm|title=Are men or women happier?|date=20 May 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found no gender gap in happiness.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Happiness Inequality in the United States |first1=Betsey |last1=Stevenson |first2=Justin |last2=Wolfers |year=2008 |journal=[[Journal of Legal Studies]] |volume=37 |issue=S2 |pages=S33–S79 |doi=10.1086/592004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of these findings could be due to the way men and women differ in calculating their happiness. Women calculate the positive self-esteem, closeness in their relationships and religion. Men calculate positive self-esteem, active leisure and mental control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reid | first1 = A. | year = 2004 | title = Gender and sources of subjective well-being | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 51 | issue = 11/12| pages = 617–629 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-004-0714-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, neither men nor women are at greater risk for being less happy than the other. Earlier in life, women are more likely than men to fulfill their goals (material goals and family life aspirations), thereby increasing their [[life satisfaction]] and overall happiness.

A study was conducted by Siamak Khodarahimi to determine the roles of gender and age on positive psychology constructs – psychological hardiness, emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and happiness – among 200 Iranian adolescents and 200 young adults who were questioned through various tests. The study found that the males of the sample showed significantly higher rates in psychological hardiness, emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and happiness than females, regardless of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khodarahimi|first1=Siamak | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Role of Gender on Positive Psychology Constructs in a Sample of Iranian Adolescents and Young adults|journal=Applied Research in Quality of Life|date=5 February 2013|volume=9|issue=1|pages=45–61|doi=10.1007/s11482-013-9212-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining whether emotions have a genetic trait or not were studied by David Lykken and Auke Tellegen. They found that up to 80% of a long-term sense of [[well-being]] is due to heredity. Basically, our families are important to our eventual emotional lives as adults because they provide us with genetic material that largely determines our base [[emotional]] responsiveness to the world. Therefore, [[genetics|genetic]] makeup is far more important to the long-term quality of our emotional lives than is learned behavior or the quality of our early childhood environment, at least as found in our current socio-economic paradigm.&lt;ref name="Lykken"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lykken D, Tellegen A | year = 1996 | title = Happiness is a stochastic phenomenon | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 186–189 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00355.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining theoretical 20%, however, still leaves room for significant change in thoughts and behavior from environmental/learned sources that should not be understated, and the interpretation of variance in twin studies is controversial, even among clinical psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://vaughanbell.net/nature-vs-nurture-is-a-lie/ |title= Nature vs nurture is a lie | last1 = Bell | first1 = Vaughan | name-list-format = vanc | journal = The Psychologist | date = July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual differences in both overall Eudaimonia, identified loosely with [[self-control]], and in the facets of eudaimonia are inheritable. Evidence from one study supports 5 independent genetic mechanisms underlying the Ryff facets of this trait, leading to a genetic construct of eudaimonia in terms of general self-control, and four subsidiary biological mechanisms enabling the psychological capabilities of purpose, agency, growth, and positive social relations.&lt;ref name="pmid22432931"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Archontaki D, Lewis GJ, Bates TC | title = Genetic influences on psychological well-being: a nationally representative twin study | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 81 | issue = 2 | pages = 221–30 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 22432931 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2012.00787.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurology===
It is generally accepted that happiness is at least in part mediated through [[dopaminergic]], [[adrenergic]] and [[serotonergic]] metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dfarhud D, Malmir M, Khanahmadi M | title = Happiness &amp; Health: The Biological Factors- Systematic Review Article | journal = Iranian Journal of Public Health | volume = 43 | issue = 11 | pages = 1468–77 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 26060713 | pmc = 4449495 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A correlation has been found between [[hormone]] levels and happiness. [[SSRI]]s, such as Prozac, are used to adjust the levels of [[serotonin]] in the [[Major depressive disorder|clinically unhappy]]. Researchers, such as [[Bruce K. Alexander|Alexander]], have indicated that many peoples usage of narcotics may be the unwitting result of attempts to readjust hormone levels to cope with situations that make them unhappy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alexander |first1=Bruce K. | title=Rat Park |journal=Psychopharmacology |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuroscience's findings ===
[[Neuroscience]] and brain imaging have shown increasing potential for helping science understand happiness and sadness. Though it may be impossible to achieve any comprehensive objective measure of happiness, some physiological correlates to happiness can be measured. [[Stefan Klein]], in his book ''The Science of Happiness'', links the dynamics of [[Neurobiology|neurobiological]] systems (i.e., dopaminergic, opiate) to the concepts and findings of positive psychology and social psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Stefan | last = Klein | authorlink = Stefan Klein | title = The Science of Happiness | publisher = Marlowe &amp; Company | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-56924-328-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nobel prize]] winner [[Eric Kandel]] and researcher Cynthia Fu described very accurate diagnoses of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] just by looking at fMRI brain scans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2008/12/05 |title=Diagnosis – Radiolab |publisher=Wnyc.org |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By identifying [[neural correlate]]s for [[emotions]], scientists may be able to use methods like [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|brain scans]] to tell us more about the different ways of being "happy". Richard Davidson has conducted research to determine which parts of the brain are involved in [[positive emotions]]. He found that the left prefrontal [[cortex (anatomy)|cortex]] is more activated when we are happy and is also associated with greater ability to recover from negative [[emotion]]s as well as enhanced ability to suppress negative emotions. Davidson found that people can train themselves to increase activation in this area of their brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Luz A, Dunne J, Davidson R | year = 2007 | chapter = Meditation and the neuroscience of consciousness | veditors = In Zelazo P, Moscovitch M, Thompson E | title = Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that our [[brain]] can change throughout our lives as a result of our experiences; this is known as [[neuroplasticity]].

The evolutionary perspective offers an alternative approach to understanding happiness and quality of life. Key guiding questions are: What features are included in the brain that allow humans to distinguish between positive and negative states of mind? How do these features improve humans' ability to survive and reproduce? The evolutionary perspective claims that the answers to these questions point towards an understanding of what happiness is about and how to best exploit the capacities of the brain with which humans are endowed. This perspective is presented formally and in detail by the evolutionary biologist [[Bjørn Grinde]] in his book ''[[Darwinian Happiness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Grinde | first = Bjørn | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2002 | title = Happiness in the perspective of evolutionary psychology | journal = Journal of Happiness Studies | volume = 3 | pages = 331–354 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021894227295 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal factors ==

=== In relation with age ===

==== In adolescence ====
There has been a significant focus in past research on adulthood, in regards to well-being and development and although eudaimonia is not a new field of study, there has been little research done in the areas of adolescence and youth. Research that has been done on this age group had previously explored more negative aspects than well-being, such as problem and risk behaviours (i.e. drug and alcohol use).

Researchers who conducted a study in 2013 recognized the absence of adolescents in eudaimonic research and the importance of this developmental stage. Adolescents rapidly face cognitive, social and physical changes, making them prime subjects to study for development and well-being. The ''eudaimonic identity theory'' was used in their research to examine the development of identity through self-discovery and self-realization. They emphasize the personal value found in discovering and appeasing one's “''daimon''” ([[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]) through subjective experiences that develop eudaimonic happiness from aligning with one's true self.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Coatsworth JD, Sharp EH | title = The best within us: Positive psychology perspectives on eudaimonia | date = 2013 | publisher = American Psychological Association | location  = Washington, DC }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|250}}

Researchers focused their studies on PYD ([[positive youth development]]) and the ''eudaimonic identity theory'' in the context of three developmental elements: ''self-defining activities'', ''personal expressiveness'' and ''goal-directed behaviours''.

They determined that adolescents sample multiple ''self-defining activities''; these activities aid in identity formation, as individuals choose activities that they believe represents who they are. These ''self-defining activities'' also help determine the adolescent's social environments. For example, an adolescent involved in sports, would likely surround themselves with like-minded active and competitive people.

''Personal expressiveness'', as coined by psychologist A. S. Waterman, are the activities that we choose to express and connect with our “''daimon''” through subjective experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Waterman AS |title=Two conceptions of happiness: Contrasts of personal expressiveness (eudaimonia) and hedonic enjoyment|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1993|volume=64|issue=4|pages=678–691|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.4.678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, ''goal-directed behaviours'', are developed through goal setting, where individuals work towards identity establishment. Adolescents recognize their passions, abilities and talents and aim to fulfill their goals and behave in a way that appeases their true self.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|251}}

The study on adolescents was conducted in Italy, Chile and the United States, which produced slightly varied outcomes. Outcomes were contingent on availability, access and choice of opportunities (activities).&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|254}} Socioeconomic context also affected the results, as not all individuals could access the activities that may be more in-line with their true selves.

The Personally Expressive Activities Questionnaire (PEAQ) was used to conduct the study. Adolescence was the youngest age group that the PEAQ was used on. The PEAQ asked adolescents to self-report on activities they participate in and describe themselves with ''self-defining activities''.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|260}} It was reported that 80% of adolescents defined themselves with two to four ''self-defining activities'' signifying an understanding in adolescence of self-concept through the domains of leisure, work and academia.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|255}}

Leisure activities were found to have the largest impact on individuals because these activities were the most self-directed of the three domains, as adolescents had the choice of activity, and were more likely to be able to align it with their true selves. The study found that subjective experiences were more important than the activities themselves and that adolescents reported higher levels of well-being. They reported that when adolescents express themselves through ''self-defining activities'' across multiple domains, they have a clearer image of themselves, of what they want to achieve and higher wellness. ''Goal-setting'' was found to be a unique predictor; when adolescents work towards goals set by themselves and accomplish them, they are likely to have a clearer emerging identity and higher well-being. Researchers found that more adolescents were happy when they were involved in self-chosen activities because the activities were chosen in line with their true self.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|257–259}}

==== In midlife ====
The [[midlife crisis]] may mark the first reliable drop in happiness during an average human's life. Evidence suggests most people generally become happier with age, with the exception of the years 40 – 50, which is the typical age at which a ''crisis'' might occur. Researchers specify that people in both their 20s and 70s are happier than during midlife, although the extent of happiness changes at different rates. For example, feelings of stress and anger tend to decline after age 20, worrying drops after age 50, and enjoyment very slowly declines in adulthood but finally starts to rise after age 50.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianHappiness&gt;{{cite news|last=Bakalar |first=Nicholas | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/health/research/01happy.html?_r=1 |title=The Guardian, Happiness May Come With Age, Study Says.

Well-being in late life is more likely to be related to other contextual factors including proximity to death.&lt;ref name=pmid18605841&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerstorf D, Ram N, Estabrook R, Schupp J, Wagner GG, Lindenberger U | title = Life satisfaction shows terminal decline in old age: longitudinal evidence from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 1148–59 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18605841 | pmc = 3551350 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.44.4.1148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid18361663&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerstorf D, Ram N, Röcke C, Lindenberger U, Smith J | title = Decline in life satisfaction in old age: longitudinal evidence for links to distance-to-death | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 154–68 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18361663 | pmc = 3482430 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.23.1.154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However most of this terminal decline in well-being could be attributed to other changes in age-normative functional declines including physical health and function.&lt;ref name=pmid24660795&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burns RA, Mitchell P, Shaw J, Anstey KJ | title = Trajectories of terminal decline in the well-being of older women: the DYNOPTA project | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–56 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24660795 | doi = 10.1037/a0035370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is growing debate that assumptions that a single population estimate of age-related changes in well-being truly reflects the lived experiences of older adults has been questioned. The use of growth mixture modelling frameworks has allowed researchers to identify homogenous groups of individuals who are more similar to each other than the population based on their level and change in well-being and has shown that most report stable well-being in their late life and in the decade prior to death.&lt;ref name=pmid25108532&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burns RA, Byles J, Magliano DJ, Mitchell P, Anstey KJ | title = The utility of estimating population-level trajectories of terminal wellbeing decline within a growth mixture modelling framework | journal = Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 479–87 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25108532 | doi = 10.1007/s00127-014-0948-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are based on decades of data, and control for cohort groups; the data avoids the risk that the drops in happiness during midlife are due to populations' unique midlife experiences, like a war. The studies have also controlled for income, job status and parenting (as opposed to [[childlessness]]) to try to isolate the effects of age.

Researchers found support for the notion of age changes inside the individual that affect happiness.
This could be for any number of reasons. Psychological factors could include greater awareness of one's self and preferences; an ability to control desires and have more realistic expectations – unrealistic expectations tend to foster unhappiness; moving closer to death may motivate people to pursue personal goals; improved social skills, like forgiveness, may take years to develop – the practice of forgiveness seems linked to higher levels of happiness; or happier people may live longer and are slightly overrepresented in the elderly population. Age-related chemical changes might also play a role.&lt;ref name=GuardianHappiness/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardAge/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|last=Bakalar |first=Nicholas  | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/health/research/01happy.html?_r=1 |title=The Guardian, Happiness May Come With Age, Study Says |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2010-05-31 |access-date=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EcoAgeHap&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17722567 |title=Age and happiness: The U-bend of life|publisher=The Economist |date=2010-12-16 |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have found older individuals reported more health problems, but fewer problems overall. Young adults reported more anger, anxiety, depression, financial problems, troubled relationships and career stress. Researchers also suggest depression in the elderly is often due largely to passivity and inaction – they recommend people continue to undertake activities that bring happiness, even in old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The activity restriction model of depressed affect suggests that stressors that disrupt traditional activities of daily life can lead to a decrease in mental health. The elderly population is vulnerable to activity restriction because of the disabling factors related to age. Increases in scheduled activity as well as social support can decrease the chances of activity restriction.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, S. J., Snyder, C. R. "The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology". Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In relation with depression and languishing ===
A study by Keyes found that there are major costs of depression, which 14% of adults experience annually: it impairs social roles; it costs billions each year due to work absenteeism, diminished [[productivity]], and [[healthcare]] costs; finally, depression accounts for at least one-third of [[suicides]]. Therefore, it is important to study flourishing to learn about what is possible if issues such as depression are tackled and how the ramifications of focusing on the positive make life better not just for one person, but also for others around them.&lt;ref name = "Keyes_2002" /&gt;

Flourishing has significant positive aspects magnified when compared to languishing adults and when languishing adults are compared to depressed adults, as explained by Keyes. For example, languishing adults have the same amount of chronic [[disease]] as those that are depressed whereas flourishing adults are in exceptionally better [[physical health]]. Languishing adults miss as many days at work as depressed adults and, in fact, visit [[Physician|doctors]] and [[therapists]] more than depressed adults.&lt;ref name="(2001).

A [[Strength-based practice|strengths-based approach]] to personal positive change aims to have clinical psychology place an equal weight on both positive and negative functioning when attempting to understand and treat distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duckworth AL, Steen TA, Seligman ME | title = Positive psychology in clinical practice | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 1 | issue =  | pages = 629–51 | year = 2005 | pmid = 17716102 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.144154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rationale is based on empirical findings. Because positive characteristics interact with negative life events to predict disorder the exclusive study of negative life events could produce misleading results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen LH, McGowan J, Fooskas S, Rose S | title = Positive life events and social support and the relationship between life stress and psychological disorder | journal = American Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 567–87 | date = October 1984 | pmid = 6496413 | doi = 10.1007/BF00897213 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/n2527h6pr72571x1/ | doi-broken-date = 2018-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, psychologists are looking to use positive psychology to treat patients. Amy Krentzman, among the others, discussed positive intervention as a way to treat patients. She defined positive intervention as a therapy or activity primarily aimed at increasing positive feelings, positive behaviors, or positive cognitions, as opposed to focusing on negative thoughts or dysfunctional behaviors. A way of using positive intervention as a clinical treatment is to use positive activity interventions. Positive activity interventions, or PAIs, are brief self-administered exercises that promote positive feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. Two widely used PAIs are “Three Good Things” and “Best Future Self.” “Three Good Things” requires a patient to daily document, for a week, three events that went well during the day, and the respective cause, or causes (this exercise can be modified with counterfactual thinking, that is, adding the imagination of things had them been worse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?dq=gratitude+counterfactual&amp;ei=YB2eVeC2I8Ll8AXNjYfoCA&amp;hl=en&amp;id=Qz4nhZ3ZMmgC&amp;lpg=PA332&amp;ots=CGH8m_Ee_j&amp;pg=PA332&amp;sa=X&amp;sig=pSTwZDyMo3_feDWFMeADTsaiWDY&amp;source=bl&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA|title=The Psychology of Gratitude|first1=Robert A.|last1=Emmons|first2=Michael E.|last2=McCullough | name-list-format = vanc |date=26 February 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;). “Best Future Self” has a patient “think about their life in the future, and imagine that everything has gone as well as it possibly could. They have worked hard and succeeded at accomplishing all of their life goals. Think of this as the realization of all of their life dreams.” The patient is then asked to write down what they imagined. These positive interventions have been shown to decrease depression,&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolier L, Haverman M, Westerhof GJ, Riper H, Smit F, Bohlmeijer E | title = Positive psychology interventions: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 13 | pages = 119 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23390882 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-13-119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and interventions focusing on strengths and positive emotions can, in fact, be as effective in treating disorder as other more commonly used approaches such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seligman ME, Steen TA, Park N, Peterson C | title = Positive psychology progress: empirical validation of interventions | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 410–21 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16045394 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.60.5.410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sin2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sin NL, Lyubomirsky S | title = Enhancing well-being and alleviating depressive symptoms with positive psychology interventions: a practice-friendly meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 467–87 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19301241 | doi = 10.1002/jclp.20593 | url = http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~sonja/papers/SL2009.pdf | access-date = 2017-06-14 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120120164432/http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~sonja/papers/SL2009.pdf# | archive-date = 2012-01-20 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the apparent effect of PPIs cannot be caused by [[publication bias]], according to a [[meta-analysis]] on 49 studies (2009). PPIs studied included producing gratitude letters, performing optimistic thinking, replaying positive life experiences, and socializing with people.&lt;ref name=Sin2009 /&gt;

Also, in a newer meta-analysis (39 studies, 6,139 participants, 2012), the [[standardized mean difference]] was 0.34 higher for subjective well-being, 0.20 for psychological well-being and 0.23 for depression. Three to six months after the intervention, the effects for subjective well-being and psychological well-being were still significant, so effects seem fairly sustainable. However, in high-quality studies the positive effect was weaker, though positive, so authors considered further high-quality studies necessary to strengthen the evidence. They claimed that the above-mentioned meta-analysis (2009) did not put enough weight on the quality of studies.
PPIs found positive included blessings, kindness practices, taking personal goals, and showing gratitude.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The interventions called "Gratitude Journaling" and "Three Good Things" seem to operate via gratitude.&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013"/&gt; There is evidence that, when gratitude journaling, focussing on quality over quantity as well as people more than possessions, yields greater benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal|title=Tips for Keeping a Gratitude Journal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence of a diminished effect from gratitude journaling if it is done more than once or twice a week. Journaling sans gratitude is effective in decreasing negative emotions in general, which suggests that the act of journaling, rather than gratitude alone, is involved in the treatment effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/romantic-relationships.aspx|title=Breakups aren't all bad: Coping strategies to promote positive outcomes|website=www.apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive psychology seeks to inform clinical psychology of the potential to expand its approach, and of the merit of the possibilities. Given a fair opportunity, positive psychology might well change priorities to better address the breadth and depth of the human experience in clinical settings.

==== Post-traumatic growth ====
[[Posttraumatic growth]] (PTG) is a possible outcome after a traumatic event, besides [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). Following a traumatic event, for instance rape, incest, cancer, attack, or combat, "it is normal to experience debilitating symptoms of depression and anxiety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Reivich K, Shatte A |year=2003|title=The Resilience Factor: Seven Essential Skills For Overcoming Life's Inevitable Obstacles|publisher=Three Rivers Press|edition=Reprint|pages=9–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who shows PTG however, will experience these negative outcomes for a time and then show an increase in well-being, higher than it was before the trauma occurred. [[Martin Seligman]], a founder of positive psychology, emphasizes that "arriving at a higher level of psychological functioning than before" is a key point in PTG.&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Seligman ME |year=2011|title=Flourish: A visionary new understanding of happiness and wellbeing|location=New York, NY|publisher=Free Press|chapter=Ch. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; If instead an individual experiences a depressive period but recovers from an incident and returns to their normal level of psychological functioning, they are demonstrating [[Psychological resilience|resilience]].&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt; This suggests that in PTG, the trauma acts as a turning point for the person to achieve greater well-being. Seligman recognizes "the fact that trauma often sets the stage for growth" and given the right tools, individuals can make the most of that opportunity."&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt;

When reflecting on a traumatic growth, Seligman suggests using the following five elements to facilitate PTG: understand the response to trauma, reduce anxiety, utilize constructive disclosure, create a trauma narrative, and articulate life principles and stances that are more robust to challenge.&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt; Someone experiencing PTG will achieve elements of Seligman’s "good life" theory, including a more meaningful and purposeful valuing of life, improved positive relationships, accomplishment, and a more optimistic and open mindset according to the [[Broaden-and-build|broaden-and-build theory]].&lt;ref name="pmid8827649"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tedeschi RG, Calhoun LG | title = The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory: measuring the positive legacy of trauma | journal = Journal of Traumatic Stress | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 455–71 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8827649 | doi = 10.1002/jts.2490090305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-traumatic growth in constructive journalism ====
The phenomenon of PTG is applicable to many disciplines. The construct is important not only for just soldiers, emergency responders, and survivors of traumatic events, but on average, for everyday citizens facing typical adversity. One way to expose citizens to stories of PTG is through constructive journalism. Constructive journalism, as defined by PhD student Karen McIntyre at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, is "an emerging style of journalism in which positive psychology techniques are applied to news work with the aim of engaging readers by creating more productive news stories, all while maintaining core journalistic functions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = McIntyre K |year=2014|title=My current research focus is the subject of my dissertation: constructive journalism|url=http://karenmcintyre.org/research-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cathrine Gyldensted, an experienced reporter with a Masters in applied positive psychology and coauthor of two books, demonstrated that typical news reporting, which is associated with negative valence, harms mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | vauthors = Gyldensted C |year=2011|title= Innovating News Journalism through Positive Psychology|type=Master Thesis|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/mapp_capstone/20/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using PTG to focus on victims' strengths and instances of overcoming adversity encourages readers to implement similar ideals in their own lives. "So the goal of positive psychology in well-being theory is to measure and to build human flourishing."&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011" /&gt; Combining positive psychology constructs like PTG, PERMA, and "broaden and build" with journalism could potentially improve affect and inspire individuals about the benefits of positive psychology.

PERMA not only plays a role in our own personal lives but also can be used for public major news stories. With this model, journalists can instead focus on the positives of a story and ask questions about how conflicts or even tragedies have brought people together, how someone has experienced post-traumatic growth, and more. News stories then shift the perspective from a victimizing one to an uplifting one. Positive psychology is slowly but steadily making its way through news reporting via constructive journalism. PERMA helps journalists ask the right questions to continue that progress by bringing the focus of a potentially negative story to the positives and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/cathrine-gyldensted/2013072426851|title=Hurricane Sandy, Utoya, Homelessness: Constructive News out of Loss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Affect - ratio of positive to negative affect ====
Fredrickson and Losada postulated in 2005 that the [[ratio]] of positive to negative [[affect (psychology)|affect]], known as the [[critical positivity ratio]], can distinguish [[individual]]s that flourish from those that do not. Languishing was characterized by a ratio of positive to negative affect of 2.5. Optimal functioning or flourishing was argued to occur at a ratio of 4.3. The point at which flourishing changes to languishing is called the [[Losada line]] and is placed at the positivity ratio of 2.9. Those with higher ratios were claimed to have broader behavioral repertoires, greater [[flexibility (personality)|flexibility]] and resilience to [[adversity]], more social [[resources]], and more optimal functioning in many areas of their life.&lt;ref name="Frederickson, B.L., &amp; Losada, M.F."&gt;Fredrickson, B. L., &amp; Losada, M. F. (2005). Positive affect and complex dynamics of human flourishing. American Psychologist, 60, 678-686.&lt;/ref&gt; The model also predicted the existence of an upper limit to happiness, reached at a positivity ratio of 11.5. Fredrickson and Losada claimed that at this limit, flourishing begins to disintegrate and productivity and creativity decrease. They suggested as positivity increased, so to "appropriate negativity" needs to increase. This was described as time-limited, practicable [[feedback]] connected to specific circumstances, i.e. [[constructive criticism]].&lt;ref name="Frederickson, B.L., &amp; Losada, M.F." /&gt;

This positivity ratio theory was widely accepted until 2013, when Nick Brown, a graduate student in applied positive psychology, co-authored a paper with [[Alan Sokal]] and Harris Friedman, showing that the mathematical basis of the paper was invalid.&lt;ref name=pmid23855896&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown NJ, Sokal AD, Friedman HL | title = The complex dynamics of wishful thinking: the critical positivity ratio | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 801–13 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23855896 | doi = 10.1037/a0032850 | arxiv = 1307.7006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fredrickson partially retracted the paper, agreeing that the math may be flawed, but maintaining that the empirical evidence is still valid.&lt;ref name=pmid23855895&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fredrickson BL | title = Updated thinking on positivity ratios | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 814–22 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23855895 | doi = 10.1037/a0033584 }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Brown and colleagues insist there is no evidence for the critical positivity ratio whatsoever.&lt;ref name=pmid25197848&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown NJ, Sokal AD, Friedman HL | title = The persistence of wishful thinking | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 629–32 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25197848 | doi = 10.1037/a0037050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In relation with basic emotions ===
Most [[psychologist]]s focus on a person's most basic [[List of emotions|emotions]]. There are thought to be between seven and fifteen basic [[emotion]]s. The [[emotion]]s can be combined in many ways to create more subtle variations of [[emotional]] experience. This suggests that any attempt to wholly eliminate negative emotions from our life would have the unintended consequence of losing the variety and subtlety of our most profound emotional experiences. Efforts to increase positive emotions will not automatically result in decreased negative [[emotion]]s, nor will decreased negative emotions necessarily result in increased positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmack, U. (2005). The structure of subjective well-being. In M. Eid &amp; R. Larsen (Eds.) The science of subjective well-being. New York, NY, US: Guilford Press, pp. 97–123.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell and Feldman Barrett (1992) described emotional reactions as core affects, which are primitive emotional reactions that are consistently experienced but often not acknowledged; they blend pleasant and unpleasant as well as activated and deactivated dimensions that we carry with us at an almost unconscious level.&lt;ref name=pmid10353204&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Russell JA, Barrett LF | title = Core affect, prototypical emotional episodes, and other things called emotion: dissecting the elephant | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 76 | issue = 5 | pages = 805–19 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10353204 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.76.5.805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence suggests negative emotions can be damaging. In an article titled "The undoing effect of positive emotions", [[Barbara Fredrickson]] et al. hypothesized positive emotions undo the cardiovascular effects of negative emotions. When people experience [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], they show increased [[heart rate]], higher [[blood sugar]], [[immune suppression]], and other adaptations optimized for immediate action. If unregulated, the prolonged physiological activation can lead to illness, [[coronary heart disease]], and heightened mortality. Both lab and survey research substantiate that positive emotions help people under stress to return to a preferable, healthier physiological baseline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fredrickson BL, Mancuso RA, Branigan C, Tugade MM | title = The Undoing Effect of Positive Emotions | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 237–258 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 21731120 | pmc = 3128334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research shows that improved mood is one of the various benefits of physical exercise.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,197466,00.html Best Benefit of Exercise? Happiness] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626155303/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,197466,00.html# |date=2012-06-26 }}, Robin Loyd, [[Fox News]], May 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Behavioral repertoire ====
The [[broaden-and-build]] theory of positive emotions suggests positive emotions (e.g. [[happiness]], [[Interest (emotion)|interest]], [[Anticipation (emotion)|anticipation]])&lt;ref name="IPP2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Compton|first=William C | name-list-format = vanc |title=An Introduction to Positive Psychology|publisher=[[Wadsworth Publishing]]|year=2005|pages=23–40|chapter=2|isbn=0-534-64453-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; broaden one's awareness and encourage novel, varied, and exploratory thoughts and actions. Over time, this broadened behavioral repertoire builds skills and resources. For example, curiosity about a landscape becomes valuable navigational knowledge; pleasant interactions with a stranger become a supportive friendship; aimless physical play becomes exercise and physical excellence. Positive emotions are contrasted with negative emotions, which prompt narrow survival-oriented behaviors. For example, the negative emotion of [[anxiety]] leads to the specific [[fight-or-flight response]] for immediate survival.&lt;ref name="IPP2"/&gt;

==== Elevation ====
After several years of researching [[disgust]], [[Jonathan Haidt]], and others, studied its opposite; the term "elevation" was coined. Elevation is a pleasant moral emotion, involving a desire to act morally and do "good". As an emotion it has a biological basis, and is sometimes characterized by a feeling of expansion in the chest or a tingling feeling on the skin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Haidt|Haidt, Jonathan]] (2005). ''[[The Happiness Hypothesis]]''. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2003). [http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.elevation-and-positive-psychology.manuscript.html Elevation and the positive psychology of morality]. In C. L. M. Keyes &amp; J. Haidt (Eds.) ''Flourishing: Positive Psychology and the Life Well-lived''. Washington DC: American Psychological Association. (pp.&amp;nbsp;275–289).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The concept of "flourishing" ===
{{Main|Flourishing}}

The term flourishing, in positive psychology, refers to optimal human functioning. It comprises four parts: goodness, generativity, growth, and [[psychological resilience|resilience]] (Fredrickson, 2005).&lt;ref name=pmid16221001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fredrickson BL, Losada MF | title = Positive affect and the complex dynamics of human flourishing | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 60 | issue = 7 | pages = 678–86 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16221001 | pmc = 3126111 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.60.7.678 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fredrickson (2005), goodness is made up of: happiness, contentment, and effective performance; generativity is about making life better for future generations, and is defined by “broadened thought-action repertoires and behavioral flexibility”; growth involves the use of personal and social assets; and resilience reflects survival and growth after enduring a hardship.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; A flourishing life stems from mastering all four of these parts. Two contrasting ideologies are languishing and psychopathology. On the mental health continuum, these are considered intermediate mental health disorders, reflecting someone living an unfulfilled and perhaps meaningless life. Those who languish experience more emotional pain, psychosocial deficiency, restrictions in regular activities, and missed workdays.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; 
	
Fredrickson &amp; Losada (2005) conducted a study on university students, operationalizing positive and negative affect.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; Based on a mathematical model which has been strongly criticized,&lt;ref name=pmid23855896/&gt; and now been formally withdrawn by Fredrickson as invalid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0034435 |title='Positive affect and the complex dynamics of human flourishing': Correction to Fredrickson and Losada (2005) |journal=American Psychologist |volume=68 |issue=9 |page=822 |year=2013 |last1=Fredrickson |first1=Barbara L |last2=Losada |first2=Marcial F | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fredrickson &amp; Losada claimed to have discovered a [[critical positivity ratio]], above which people would flourish and below which they would not. Although Fredrickson claims that her experimental results are still valid,&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Fredrickson, B. L. (2013). [http://www.unc.edu/peplab/publications/Fredrickson%202013%20Updated%20Thinking.pdf Updated thinking on positivity ratios]. American Psychologist. Electronic publication ahead of print.&lt;/ref&gt; these experimental results have also been questioned due to poor statistical methodology, and [[Alan Sokal]] has pointed out that "given [Fredrickson and Losada's] experimental design and method of data analysis, no data whatsoever could possibly give any evidence of any nonlinearity in the relationship between "flourishing" and the positivity ratio — much less evidence for a sharp discontinuity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/fredrickson-losada-positivity-ratio-paper-partially-withdrawn/|title=Fredrickson-Losada "positivity ratio" paper partially withdrawn|publisher=Retraction Watch|date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study surveyed a U.S. sample of 3,032 adults, aged 25–74. Results showed 17.2 percent of adults were flourishing, while 56.6 percent were moderately mentally healthy. Some common characteristics of a flourishing adult included: educated, older, married and wealthy. The study findings suggest there is room for adults to improve as less than 20 percent of Americans are living a flourishing life. (Keyes, 2002).&lt;ref name = "Keyes_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keyes CL | year = 2002 | title = The Mental Health Continuum: From Languishing to Flourishing in Life | url = | journal = Journal of Health &amp; Social Behavior | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 207–222 | doi=10.2307/3090197| jstor = 3090197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefits from living a flourishing life emerge from research on the effects of experiencing a high ratio of positive to negative affect. The studied benefits of positive affect are increased responsiveness, "broadened behavioral repertoires", increased instinct, and increased perception and imagination.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; In addition, the good feelings associated with flourishing result in improvements to immune system functioning, cardiovascular recovery, lessened effects of negative affect, and frontal brain asymmetry.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; Other benefits to those of moderate mental health or moderate levels of flourishing were: stronger psychological and social performance, high resiliency, greater cardiovascular health, and an overall healthier lifestyle (Keyes, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keyes CL | title = Promoting and protecting mental health as flourishing: a complementary strategy for improving national mental health | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 62 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–108 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17324035 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.62.2.95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The encountered benefits of flourishing suggest a definition: "[flourishing] people experience high levels of emotional, psychological and social well being due to vigor and vitality, self-determination, continuous self- growth, close relationships and a meaningful and purposeful life" (Siang-Yang, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;70).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siang-Yang | first1 = T. | year = 2006 | title = Applied Positive Psychology: Putting Positive Psychology into Practice | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology &amp; Christianity | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 68–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Happiness ===
==== Happiness measurement ====
===== Oxford Happiness Questionnaire =====
Psychologists Peter Hills and [[Michael Argyle (psychologist)|Michael Argyle]] developed the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/oxford-happiness-questionnaire/214/ Oxford Happiness Questionnaire] by Michael Argyle and Peter Hills, a survey of current level of happiness. See also discussion in Hills, P., &amp; Argyle, M. (2002). The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire: a compact scale for the measurement of psychological well-being. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 33, 1073–1082.&lt;/ref&gt; as a broad measure of psychological well-being. The approach was criticized for lacking a theoretical model of happiness and for overlapping too much with related concepts such as [[self-esteem]], sense of purpose, social interest, [[kindness]], sense of [[humor]] and aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Todd B. | last = Kashdan | url = http://mason.gmu.edu/~tkashdan/publications/happy.PDF | title = The assessment of subjective well-being (issues raised by the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire) | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | year = 2004 | pages = 1225–1232 | volume = 36 | doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(03)00213-7 | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Satisfaction with Life Scale =====
"Happiness" encompasses different emotional and mental phenomena. One method of assessment is [[Ed Diener]]'s Satisfaction with Life Scale. According to Diener, this five-question survey corresponds well with impressions from friends and family, and low incidence of [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2014}}

Rather than long-term, big picture appraisals, some methods attempt to identify the amount of positive affect from one activity to the next. Scientists use beepers to remind volunteers to write down the details of their current situation. Alternatively, volunteers complete detailed diary entries each morning about the day before.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; A discrepancy arises when researchers compare the results of these short-term "experience sampling" methods, with long-term appraisals. Namely, the latter may not be very accurate; people may not know what makes their life pleasant from one moment to the next. For instance, parents' appraisals mention their children as sources of pleasure, while "experience sampling" indicates parents were not enjoying caring for their children, compared to other activities.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/daniel_kahneman_the_riddle_of_experience_vs_memory.html |title=Daniel Kahneman: The riddle of experience vs. memory &amp;#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Daniel Kahneman]] explains this discrepancy by differentiating between happiness according to the "experiencing self" compared to the "remembering self": when asked to reflect on experiences, [[List of memory biases|memory biases]] like the Peak-End effect (e.g. we mostly remember the dramatic parts of a vacation, and how it was at the end) play a large role. A striking finding was in a study of [[colonoscopy]] patients. Adding 60 seconds to this invasive procedure, Kahneman found participants reported the colonoscopy as ''more'' pleasant. This was attributed to making sure the colonoscopy instrument was not moved during the extra 60 seconds – movement is the source of the most discomfort. Thus, Kahneman was appealing to the remembering self's tendency to focus on the end of the experience. Such findings help explain human error in [[affective forecasting]] – people's ability to predict their future emotional states.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
Humans exhibit a variety of abilities. This includes an ability of emotional ''Hedonic Adaptation'', an idea suggesting that beauty, fame and money do not generally have lasting effects on happiness (this effect has also been called the [[Hedonic treadmill]]). In this vein, some research has suggested that only recent events, meaning those that occurred within the last 3 months, affect happiness levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suh E, Diener E, Fujita F | title = Events and subjective well-being: only recent events matter | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 70 | issue = 5 | pages = 1091–102 | date = May 1996 | pmid = 8656337 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.70.5.1091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tendency to adapt, and therefore return to an earlier level of happiness, is illustrated by studies showing lottery winners are no happier in the years after they've won.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; Other studies have shown [[Paraplegia|paraplegics]] are nearly as happy as control groups that are not paralyzed,&lt;ref name=Seligman2002&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Seligman | first1 = Martin E. P. | name-list-format = vanc | authorlink = Martin Seligman|title = Authentic Happiness: Using the New Positive Psychology to Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment | year = 2002 | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-7432-2297-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; after equally few years. Daniel Kahneman explains: "they are not paraplegic full time... It has to do with allocation of attention". Thus, contrary to our [[impact bias]]es, lotteries and paraplegia do not change experiences to as great a degree as we would believe.

However, in a newer study (2007), winning a medium-sized lottery prize had a lasting mental wellbeing effect of 1.4 GHQ points on Britons even two years after the event.&lt;ref name=jgao&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner J, Oswald AJ | title = Money and mental wellbeing: a longitudinal study of medium-sized lottery wins | journal = Journal of Health Economics | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–60 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 16949692 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhealeco.2006.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, adaptation can be a very slow and incomplete process. Distracting life changes such as the death of a spouse or losing one's job can show measurable changes in happiness levels for several years.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; Even the "adapted" paraplegics mentioned above did ultimately report lower levels of pleasure (again, they were happier than one would expect, but not fully adapted).&lt;ref name=Diener&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/significant-results/201304/5-myths-positive-psychology|title=5 Myths of Positive Psychology| first = Robert | last = Biswas-Diener | name-list-format = vanc |work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, adaptation is a complex process, and while it ''does'' mitigate the emotional effects of many life events it cannot mitigate them entirely.

===== Happiness set point =====
The happiness set point idea is that most people return to an average level of happiness – or a set point – after temporary highs and lows in emotionality. People whose set points lean toward positive emotionality tend to be cheerful most of the time and those whose set points tend to be more negative emotionality tend to gravitate toward pessimism and anxiety. Lykken found that we can influence our level of well-being by creating environments more conductive to feelings of happiness and by working with our genetic makeup.&lt;ref name="Lykken" /&gt; One reason that subjective well-being is for the most part stable is because of the great influence genetics have. Although the events of life have some effect on subjective well-being, the general population returns to their set point.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, S. J., Snyder, C. R. "The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology". Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LyubomirskyHappiness.jpg|thumb|right|In the recipe for one person's happiness, it is nonsensical to blame one ingredient (because all are necessary). However, when comparing two people's happiness, ingredients like genetics can account for as much as half the difference.]]
In her book ''[[The How of Happiness]]'', [[Sonja Lyubomirsky]] similarly argued people's happiness varies around a genetic set point. [[Robert Biswas-Diener|Diener]] warns, however, that it is nonsensical to claim that "happiness is influenced 30–50% by genetics". Diener explains that the recipe for happiness for an individual always requires genetics, environment, and behaviour too, so it is nonsensical to claim that an individual's happiness is due to only one ingredient.

Only differences in happiness can be attributed to differences in factors. In other words, Lyubomirsky's research does not discuss happiness in one individual; it discusses differences in happiness between two or more people. Specifically, Lyubomirsky suggests that 30–40% of the difference in happiness levels is due to genetics (i.e. [[heritable]]). In other words, still, Diener says it makes no sense to say one person's happiness is "due 50% to genetics", but it does make sense to say one person's difference in happiness is 50% due to differences in their genetics (and the rest is due to behaviour and environment).&lt;ref name="Lykken" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Diener/&gt;

Findings from twin studies support the findings just mentioned. Twins reared apart had nearly the same levels of happiness thereby suggesting the environment is not entirely responsible for differences in people's happiness.&lt;ref name="Lykken" /&gt; Importantly, an individual's baseline happiness is not ''entirely'' determined by genetics, and not even by early life influences on one's genetics. Whether or not a person manages to elevate their baseline to the heights of their genetic possibilities depends partly on several factors, including actions and habits. Some happiness-boosting habits seem to include gratitude, appreciation, and even altruistic behavior.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; Other research-based habits and techniques for increasing happiness are discussed on this page.

Besides the development of new habits, the use of antidepressants, effective exercise, and a healthier [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] have proven to affect mood significantly. There is evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faunalytics.org/veganism-help-reduce-stress-anxiety/|title=Does Veganism Help Reduce Stress and Anxiety? - Faunalytics|date=25 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a vegan diet reduces stress and anxiety. [[Exercise]] is sometimes called the "miracle" or "wonder" drug – alluding to the wide variety of proven benefits it provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Association of Kidney Patients|title=Physical Activity and Exercise: The Wonder Drug|url=http://www.aakp.org/aakp-library/Physical-Activity-and-Exercise/|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927221329/http://www.aakp.org/aakp-library/Physical-Activity-and-Exercise/#|archive-date=2011-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pimlott N | title = The miracle drug | journal = Canadian Family Physician Medecin De Famille Canadien | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | pages = 407, 409 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20463262 | pmc = 2868602 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is worth mentioning that a recent book, ''[[Anatomy of an Epidemic]]'', challenges the use of non-conservative usage of medications for mental patients, specially with respect to their long-term positive feedback effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/__data/assets/file/0009/407961/20110706MartinSeligman.mp3|title=Seligman, Martin E.P. (6 July 2011). "Flourish". Royal Society of Arts. audio|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche]] has said that neuro scientists have found that with meditation, an individual's happiness baseline can change.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/science-has-proved-that-meditation-can-improve-quality-of-life-buddhist-master/articleshow/58200304.cms|title=Science has proved that meditation can improve quality of life: Buddhist master - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meditation has been found to increase happiness in several studies.A study on Brahma Kumaris [[Raja yoga]] meditators showed them having higher [[happiness]] (Oxford happiness questionnaire) than the control group.&lt;ref name=pmid24298493&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramesh MG, Sathian B, Sinu E, Kiranmai SR | title = Efficacy of rajayoga meditation on positive thinking: an index for self-satisfaction and happiness in life | journal = Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research | volume = 7 | issue = 10 | pages = 2265–7 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24298493 | doi = 10.7860/JCDR/2013/5889.3488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Evidences against the happiness set point theory =====
In recent large panel studies divorce, death of a spouse, unemployment, disability and similar events have been shown to change the long-term subjective well-being, even though some adaptation does occur and inborn factors affect this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00479.x |jstor=20183166 |title=Adaptation and the Set-Point Model of Subjective Well-Being |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=75–9 |year=2016 |last1=Lucas |first1=Richard E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujita and Diener found that 24% of people changed significantly between the first five years of the study and the last five years. Almost one in four people showed changes in their well-being over the years; indeed sometimes those changes were quite dramatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fujita F, Diener E | title = Life satisfaction set point: stability and change | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 158–64 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15631581 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.88.1.158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Headey found that 5–6% of people dramatically increased their life satisfaction over a 15- to 20-year period and that the goals people pursued significantly affected their life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Headey | first1 = B. | year = 2008 | title = Life goals matter to happiness: A revision of set-point theory | url = | journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 86 | issue = 2| pages = 312–231 | doi = 10.1007/s11205-007-9138-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Personal training to increase happiness =====
The easiest and best possible way to increase one's happiness is by doing something that increases the ratio of positive to negative emotions. Contrary to some beliefs, in many scenarios, people are actually very good at determining what will increase their positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thayer RE, Newman JR, McClain TM | title = Self-regulation of mood: strategies for changing a bad mood, raising energy, and reducing tension | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 910–25 | date = November 1994 | pmid = 7983582 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.67.5.910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many techniques developed to help increase one's happiness.

A first technique is known as the "Sustainable Happiness Model (SHM)." This model proposes that long-term happiness is determined upon: (1) one's genetically determined [[#Happiness set point|set-point]], (2) circumstantial factors, and (3) intentional activities. Lyubomirsky, Sheldon and Schkade suggest to make these changes in the correct way in order to have long-term happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyubomirsky S, Sheldon KM, Schkade D | year = 2005 | title = Pursuing happiness: The architecture of sustainable change | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 111–131 | doi = 10.1037/1089-2680.9.2.111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggestion of how to increase one's happiness is through a procedure called "Hope Training." Hope Training is primarily focused on hope due to the belief that hope drives the positive emotions of well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Lopez SJ, Floyd RK, Ulven JC, Snyder CR |year=2000|contribution=Hope therapy: Building a house of hope|editor=C.R. Snyder|title=The handbook of hope: Theory, measures, and applications|pages=123–148|location=New York|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This training is based on the hope theory, which states that well-being can increase once people have developed goals and believe themselves to achieve those goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Rand, Kevin L., &amp; Cheaven, Jennifer S|year=2009|contribution=Hope theory|title=Oxford handbook of positive psychology|edition=2nd |editors= Lopez, Shane, J., Snyder, C.R. |location=New York, NY, US|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=323–333}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main purposes of hope training is to eliminate individuals from false hope syndrome. False hope syndrome particularly occurs when one believes that changing their behavior is easy and the outcomes of the change will be evidenced in a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00076 |title=The False-Hope Syndrome |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=9 |issue=4 |page=128 |year=2016 |last1=Polivy |first1=Janet |last2=Herman |first2=C. Peter  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are coaching procedures based on positive psychology, which are backed by scientific research, with availability of intervention tools and assessments that positive psychology trained coaches can utilize to support the coaching process. Positive psychology coaching uses scientific evidence and insights gained in these areas to work with clients in their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Biswas-Diener | first = Robert | name-list-format = vanc |year=2010|title=Practicing Positive Psychology Coaching: Assessment, Diagnosis, and Intervention | isbn = 978-0-470-53676-6|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Time and happiness ====
[[File:Slavyansky-Family portrait.jpg|thumb|A portrait commemorating a family's day together]]
[[Philip Zimbardo]] suggests we might also analyze happiness from a "time perspective". He suggested the sorting of people's focus in life by valence (positive or negative) and also by their time perspective (past, present, or future orientation). Doing so may reveal some individual conflicts, not over whether an activity is enjoyed, but whether one prefers to risk delaying gratification further. Zimbardo also believes research reveals an optimal balance of perspectives for a happy life; commenting, our focus on reliving positive aspects of our past should be high, followed by time spent believing in a positive future, and finally spending a moderate (but not excessive) amount of time in enjoyment of the present.&lt;ref name=ZimbardoTime&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/philip_zimbardo_prescribes_a_healthy_take_on_time.html |title=Philip Zimbardo prescribes a healthy take on time &amp;#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "flow" ===
In the 1970s Csikszentmihalyi's started to study ''[[Flow (psychology)|flow]]'', a state of absorption where one's abilities are well-matched to the demands at-hand. Flow is characterized by intense concentration, loss of self-awareness, a feeling of being perfectly challenged (neither bored nor overwhelmed), and a sense "time is flying". Flow is intrinsically rewarding; it can also assist in the achievement of goals (e.g., winning a game) or improving skills (e.g., becoming a better chess player).&lt;ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Csikszentmihalyi | first1 = Mihaly | title = Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience | year = 1990 | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | location = New York | isbn = 0-06-016253-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone can experience flow, in different domains, such as play, creativity, and work.

Flow is achieved when the challenge of the situation meets one's personal abilities. A mismatch of challenge for someone of low skills results in a state of anxiety; insufficient challenge for someone highly skilled results in boredom.&lt;ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990/&gt; The effect of challenging situations means that flow is often temporarily exciting and variously stressful, but this is considered [[Eustress]], which is also known as "good" stress. Eustress is arguably less harmful than [[chronic stress]], although the pathways of stress-related systems are similar. Both can create a "wear and tear" effect; however, the differing physiological elements and added psychological benefits of eustress might well balance any wear and tear experienced.

Csikszentmihalyi identified nine indicator elements of flow:
1. Clear goals exist every step of the way, 2. Immediate feedback guides one's action, 3. There is a balance between challenges and abilities, 4. Action and awareness are merged, 5. Distractions are excluded from consciousness, 6. Failure is not worrisome, 7. Self-consciousness disappears, 8. Sense of time is distorted, and 9. The activity becomes "[[autotelic]]" (an end in itself, done for its own sake)&lt;ref name="In zone"&gt;{{cite web |title="In the zone": enjoyment, creativity, and the nine elements of "flow" |publisher=MeaningandHappiness.com|url=http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/zone-enjoyment-creativity-elements-flow/26/|access-date=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; His studies also show that flow is greater during work while happiness is greater during leisure activities.&lt;ref name="Lopez, S. J. 2009. p. 200"&gt;Lopez, S. J., Snyder, C. R. ''The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology''. Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health ===

==== Addiction ====
Arguably, some people pursue ineffective shortcuts to feeling good. These shortcuts create positive feelings, but are problematic, in part because of the lack of effort involved. Some examples of these shortcuts include shopping, drugs, chocolate, loveless sex, and TV. These are problematic pursuits because all of these examples have the ability to become addictive. When happiness comes to us so easily, it comes with a price we may not realize. This price comes when taking these shortcuts is the only way to become happy, otherwise viewed as an [[addiction]].&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krentzman AR | title = Review of the application of positive psychology to substance use, addiction, and recovery research | journal = Psychology of Addictive Behaviors | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 151–65 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 22985057 | pmc = 3531570 | doi = 10.1037/a0029897 }} (Date is for advance online publication. The final form was published in March 2013.)&lt;/ref&gt; A review by Amy Krentzman on the Application of Positive Psychology to Substance Use, Addiction, and Recovery Research, identified, in the field of positive psychology, three domains that allow an individual to thrive and contribute to society.

One of these, A Pleasant Life, involves good feelings about the past, present, and future. To tie this with addiction, they chose an example of [[alcoholism]]. Research on positive affect and alcohol showed a majority of the population associates drinking with pleasure. The pleasure one feels from alcohol is known as somatic pleasure, which is immediate but a short lived sensory delight. The researchers wanted to make clear pleasure alone does not amount to a life well lived; there is more to life than pleasure. Secondly, the Engaged Life is associated with positive traits such as strength of character. A few examples of character strength according to ''Character Strength and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification'' by [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] and Peterson (2004) are bravery, integrity, citizenship, humility, prudence, gratitude, and hope, all of which are shown in the rise to recovery. To descend into an addiction shows a lack of character strength; however, rising to recovery shows the reinstatement of character strengths, including the examples mentioned above. Thirdly, the Meaningful Life is service and membership to positive organizations. Examples of positive organizations include family, workplace, social groups, and society in general. Organizations, like [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], can be viewed as a positive organization. Membership fosters positive affect, while also promoting character strengths, which as seen in the Engaged Life, can aid in beating addiction.&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013"/&gt;

==== Emotional health ====
Researcher Dianne Hales described an ''emotionally healthy'' person as someone who exhibits flexibility and adaptability to different circumstances, a sense of meaning and affirmation in life, an "understanding that the self is not the center of the universe", compassion and the ability to be unselfish, an increased depth and satisfaction in intimate relationships, and a sense of control over the mind and body.&lt;ref name=twsMay18&gt;{{cite news | first = Dianne | last = Hales | name-list-format = vanc  |title= An Invitation to Health, Brief: Psychological Well-Being 2010–2011 Edition | publisher = Wadsworth Cengage Learning  |page=26 |year= 2010 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oP91HVIMPRIC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mental health ====
[[Richard Layard|Layard]] and others show that the most important influence on happiness is mental health.&lt;ref name="voxeu1"/&gt;

L.M. Keyes and Shane Lopez illustrate the four typologies of mental health functioning: flourishing, struggling, floundering and languishing. However, complete mental health is a combination of high emotional well-being, high psychological well-being, and high social well-being, along with low mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Keyes, C.L.M., &amp; Lopez, S.J. (2002). Toward a science of mental health: Positive directions in diagnosis and interventions. In C.R. Snyder &amp; S.J. Lopez (Eds.), ''Handbook of positive psychology'' (pp. 45–59). London: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although health is part of well-being, some people are able to maintain satisfactory wellbeing despite the presence of psychological symptoms.&lt;ref name= Bos&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bos EH, Snippe E, de Jonge P, Jeronimus BF | title = Preserving Subjective Wellbeing in the Face of Psychopathology: Buffering Effects of Personal Strengths and Resources | journal = PLOS One | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = e0150867 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26963923 | pmc = 4786317 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1150867B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical health ====
Meta-analyses published between 2013 and 2017 show that exercise is associated with reductions in depressive symptoms, fatigue and QoL plus improvements in attention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, social functioning, schizophrenic symptoms, and verbal fluency in various special populations. However, aerobic exercise has no significant effect on anxiety disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kspope.com/ethics/exercise-meta-analyses.php|title=Meta-Analyses: Exercise's Psychological &amp; Physical Effects on Health, Disorders, &amp; Quality of Life|website=kspope.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a study conducted by Andrew Steptow and Michael Marmot at University College London, found that happiness is related to biological markers that play an important role in health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steptoe A, Wardle J, Marmot M | title = Positive affect and health-related neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and inflammatory processes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 18 | pages = 6508–12 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15840727 | pmc = 1088362 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0409174102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.6508S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers aimed to analyze whether there was any association between well-being and three biological markers: heart rate, [[cortisol]] levels, and plasma fibrinogen levels. The participants who rated themselves the least happy had cortisol levels that were 48% higher than those who rated themselves as the most happy. The least happy subjects also had a large plasma fibrinogen response to two stress-inducing tasks: the Stroop test, and tracing a star seen in a mirror image. Repeating their studies three years later Steptow and Marmot found that participants who scored high in positive emotion continued to have lower levels of cortisol and fibrinogen, as well as a lower heart rate.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In Happy People Live Longer (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frey BS | title = Psychology. Happy people live longer | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6017 | pages = 542–3 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21292959 | doi = 10.1126/science.1201060 | bibcode = 2011Sci...331..542F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Frey reported that happy people live 14% longer, increasing longevity 7.5 to 10 years and [[Richard Davidson]]'s bestseller (2012) ''The Emotional Life of Your Brain'' argues that positive emotion and happiness benefit long-term health.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

However, in 2015 a study building on earlier research found that happiness has no effect on mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu B, Floud S, Pirie K, Green J, Peto R, Beral V | title = Does happiness itself directly affect mortality? The prospective UK Million Women Study | journal = Lancet | volume = 387 | issue = 10021 | pages = 874–81 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26684609 | pmc = 5075047 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01087-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "This "basic belief that if you're happier you're going to live longer. That's just not true."&lt;ref name=Harriet20151213&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/unsw-research-finds-happy-people-do-not-live-longer-when-ill-health-is-removed-from-equation-20151209-glj3rl.html |title=UNSW research finds happy people do not live longer when ill health is removed from equation |last=Alexander |first=Harriet  | name-list-format = vanc |date=13 December 2015 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=15 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent results are that "apart from good health, happy people were more likely to be older, not smoke, have fewer educational qualifications, do strenuous exercise, live with a partner, do religious or group activities and sleep for eight hours a night."&lt;ref name=Harriet20151213/&gt;

Happiness does however seem to have a protective impact on immunity.

==== Alternative medicine ====
Health consumers sometimes confuse the terms "wellness" and "well-being". Wellness is a term more commonly associated with alternative medicine which may or may not coincide with gains in subjective well-being. In 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/australian-government-response-review-medicines-and-medical-devices-regulation|title=Australian Government Response to the Review of Medicines and Medical Devices Regulation| publisher = Australian Government Department of Health. Therapeutic Goods Administration|date=15 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Australian Government reviewed the effectiveness of numerous complementary therapies: they found low-moderate quality evidence that the Alexander technique, Buteyko, massage therapy (remedial massage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amt.org.au/downloads/submissions/Evidence-Based-Massage-2009.pdf |title=Evidence based massage |website=www.amt.org.au |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;), tai chi and yoga are helpful for certain health conditions. On the other hand, the balance of evidence indicates that homeopathy, aromatherapy, bowen therapy, Feldenkrais, herbalism, homeopathy, iridology, kinesiology, pilates, reflexology and rolfing shiatsu were classed as ineffective.

==== Fruit and vegetable consumption ====
There is growing evidence that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is related to greater happiness, life satisfaction, and positive mood as well. This evidence cannot be entirely explained by demographic or health variables including [[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic status]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]], [[smoking]], and [[body mass index]], suggesting a causal link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Conner TS, Brookie KL, Richardson AC, Polak MA | title = On carrots and curiosity: eating fruit and vegetables is associated with greater flourishing in daily life | journal = British Journal of Health Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 413–27 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25080035 | doi = 10.1111/bjhp.12113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies have found that fruit and vegetable consumption predicted improvements in positive mood the next day, not vice versa. On days when people ate more fruits and vegetables, they reported feeling calmer, happier, and more energetic than normal, and they also felt more positive the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White BA, Horwath CC, Conner TS | title = Many apples a day keep the blues away--daily experiences of negative and positive affect and food consumption in young adults | journal = British Journal of Health Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 782–98 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23347122 | doi = 10.1111/bjhp.12021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cross-sectional study|Cross-sectional studies]] worldwide support a relationship between happiness and fruit and vegetable intake.

=== Hedonic well-being ===
Eudaimonic well-being has been found to be empirically distinguishable from hedonic well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10902-015-9683-z |title=Revisiting the Empirical Distinction Between Hedonic and Eudaimonic Aspects of Well-Being Using Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=17 |issue=5 |page=2023 |year=2015 |last1=Joshanloo |first1=Mohsen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Joshanloo M | title = A New Look at the Factor Structure of the MHC-SF in Iran and the United States Using Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 72 | issue = 7 | pages = 701–13 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 26990960 | doi = 10.1002/jclp.22287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identity ===
Individual roles play a part in cognitive well-being. Not only does having social ties improve cognitive well-being, it also improves psychological health.&lt;ref name="Thoits 1992 237"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thoits|first=Peggy | name-list-format = vanc |title=Identity Structures and Psychological Well-Being: Gender and Marital Status Comparisons|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=September 1992|volume=55|issue=3|page=237|doi=10.2307/2786794|jstor=2786794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having multiple identities and roles helps individuals to relate to their society and provide the opportunity for each to contribute more as they increase their roles, therefore creating enhanced levels of cognitive well-being. Each individual role is ranked internally within a [[hierarchy]] of salience. [[Salience (neuroscience)|Salience]] is “...the subjective importance that a person attaches to each identity”.&lt;ref name="Thoits 1992 237"/&gt;

Different roles an individual has have a different impact on their well-being. Within this hierarchy, higher roles offer more of a source to their well-being and define more meaningfulness to their overall role as a human being.

[[Ethnic Group|Ethnic identity]] may play a role in an individual's cognitive well-being. Studies have shown that “...both social psychological and developmental perspectives suggest that a strong, secure ethnic identity makes a positive contribution to [[cognitive]] well-being”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phinney | first1 = Jean S. | last2 = Horenczyk | first2 = Gabriel | last3 = Liebkind | first3 = Karmela | last4 = Vedder | first4 = Paul | name-list-format = vanc | title = Ethnic Identity, Immigration, and Well-Being: An Interactional Perspective | journal = Journal of Social Issues |date=September 2001|volume=57|issue=3|pages=493–510|doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those in an acculturated society may feel more equal as a human being within their culture, therefore experiencing increased well-being.

=== Optimism and helplessness ===
[[File:Fluorescent Lamp.jpg|thumb|left|[[J.B. MacKinnon]] recommended taking full responsibility for one small, but clear improvement for the world (the way energy-saving activists did by promoting a new kind of lamp). Inspired by sociological research, MacKinnon said "vertical agitation" helps reduce feelings of helplessness.]]

[[Learned optimism]] refers to development of one's potential for a [[sanguine]] outlook.{{clarify|date=May 2018}} Optimism is learned as personal efforts and abilities are linked to personally desired outcomes. In short, it is the belief one can influence the future in tangible and meaningful ways. Learned optimism contrasts with [[learned helplessness]], which consists of a belief, or beliefs, one has no control over what occurs, and that something external dictates outcomes, e.g., success. Optimism is learned by consciously challenging negative [[Intrapersonal communication|self talk]]. This includes self talk on any event viewed as a personal failure that permanently affects all areas of the person's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2012.12.004 |title=Great expectations: A meta-analytic examination of optimism and hope |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=54 |issue=7 |page=821 |year=2013 |last1=Alarcon |first1=Gene M |last2=Bowling |first2=Nathan A |last3=Khazon |first3=Steven  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrapersonal, or internal, dialogues influence one's feelings. In fact, reports of happiness are correlated with the general ability to "rationalize or explain" social and economic inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Conservatives Happier Than Liberals | first = Jeanna
 | last = Bryner | name-list-format = vanc |work=LiveScience.com|url=http://www.livescience.com/health/080507-liberal-conservative.html|access-date=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hope]] is a powerful positive feeling, linked to a learned style of goal-directed thinking. Hope is fostered when a person utilizes both ''pathways thinking'' (the perceived capacity to find routes to desired goals) and ''agency thinking'' (the requisite motivations to use those routes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Snyder CR | year = 2000 | title = Handbook of hope: Theory, measures, and applications. | location = San Diego, CA | publisher =  Academic Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and journalist [[J.B. MacKinnon]] suggested the cognitive tool of "Vertical Agitation" can assist in avoiding helplessness (e.g., paralysis in the face of Earth's many problems). The concept stemmed from research on denial by sociologist [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]]. Cohen explained: in the face of massive problems people tend towards learned helplessness rather than confronting the [[Cognitive dissonance|dissonant]] facts of the matter. Vertical Agitation involves focusing on one part of a problem at a time, while holding oneself accountable for solving the problem – all the way to the highest level of government, business and society (such as advocating strongly for something: [[Compact fluorescent lamp|eco-friendly lightbulbs]]). This allows each individual in society to make vital "trivial" (read: small) changes, without being intimidated by the work needed to be done as a whole. Mackinnon added: a piecemeal approach also keeps individuals from becoming too 'holier than thou' (harassing friends and family about ''every'' possible improvement), where widespread practice of Vertical Agitation would lead to much improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utne.com/environment/Eco-Uncertainty-JB-MacKinnon-Explore.aspx |title=In an Age of Eco-Uncertainty: Vertical Agitation, Eco-Douchebags, Cohen' s Rule, and Lifestyle as Social Change |publisher=Utne.com |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal finances ===

[[File:Niavaranpalacemirror.jpg|thumb|right|Money, once one reaches middle class, may be best spent ensuring one's job and social ties.]]
Well-being has traditionally focused on improving physical, [[emotional]] and mental quality of life with little understanding of how dependent they all are on financial health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=de Chavez|first1=Anna Cronin|last2=Backett-Milburn|first2=Kathryn|last3=Parry|first3=Odette|last4=Platt|first4=Stephen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Understanding and researching wellbeing: Its usage in different disciplines and potential for health research and health promotion|journal=Health Education Journal|date=27 July 2016|volume=64|issue=1|pages=70–87|doi=10.1177/001789690506400108}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, financial stress often manifests itself in physical and [[emotional]] difficulties that lead to increased healthcare costs and reduced productivity.&lt;ref name="rodalenews.com"&gt;{{cite web | authors = Main E | date = 2 March 2010 | title = Why financial stress is the costliest for your health | url = http://www.rodalenews.com/stress-health-problems | work = Rodale Wellness }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) | date = April 2014 | title = Employee financial wellness survey: 2014 results. | url = http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/private-company-services/publications/assets/pwc-employee-financial-wellness-survey-2014-results.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more inclusive paradigm for well-being would acknowledge money as a source of [[empowerment]] that maximizes physical and [[emotional]] health by reducing financial [[stress (psychological)|stress]].&lt;ref name="rodalenews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = Alyssa | last1 = Brown | first2 = Lindsey | last2 = Sharpe | date = 7 July 2014 | name-list-format = vanc | work = Gallup | title = Americans' financial well-being is lowest, social highest. | url = http://www.gallup.com/poll/172109/americans-financial-lowest-social-highest.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Taylor M, Jenkins S, Sacker A | year = 2009 | title = Financial capability and wellbeing: Evidence from the BHPS. | publisher = UK Financial Services Authority | url = http://hb.betterregulation.com/external/OP34.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a model would provide individuals with the financial knowledge they need, as well as enable them to gain valuable insight and understanding regarding their financial habits, as well as their thoughts, feelings, fears and attitudes about money.

It has been argued that money cannot effectively "buy" much happiness unless it is used in certain ways, and that "Beyond the point at which people have enough to comfortably feed, clothe, and house themselves, having more money – even a lot more money – makes them only a little bit happier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bennett|first1=Drake | name-list-format = vanc | title = Happiness: A buyer’s guide | url = http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/08/23/happiness_a_buyers_guide/ |access-date=1 April 2017|work=The Boston Globe|date=23 August 2009|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[Stumbling on Happiness]]'', psychologist [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]] described research suggesting money makes a significant difference to the poor (where basic needs are not yet met), but has a greatly diminished effect once one reaches middle class (i.e. the [[Easterlin paradox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Easterlin RA, McVey LA, Switek M, Sawangfa O, Zweig JS | title = The happiness-income paradox revisited | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 52 | pages = 22463–8 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21149705 | pmc = 3012515 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1015962107 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/12/08/1015962107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10722463E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every dollar earned is just as valuable to happiness up to a $75,000 annual income,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://80000hours.org/articles/money-and-happiness/|title=Everything you need to know about whether money makes you happy - 80,000 Hours|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereafter, the value of each additional dollar earns a diminishing amount of happiness. According to the latest&lt;ref name="liu.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iei.liu.se/nek/730g80/artiklar/1.421852/Happywhatmakesus.pdf|title=Linköping University|website=www.iei.liu.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; systematic review of the economic literature on life satisfaction, one's perception of their financial circumstances fully mediates the effects of objective circumstances on one’s well-being. People overestimate the influence of wealth by 100%.&lt;ref name=Aknin09&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17439760903271421 |title=From wealth to well-being? Money matters, but less than people think |journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology |volume=4 |issue=6 |page=523 |year=2009 |last1=Aknin |first1=Lara B |last2=Norton |first2=Michael I |last3=Dunn |first3=Elizabeth W | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of Economics [[Richard Easterlin]] noted that [[job satisfaction]] does not depend on salary. In other words, having extra money for luxuries does not increase happiness as much as enjoying one's job or social network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Easterlin R |year=2008|title=Income and happiness: towards a unified theory|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=11|issue=473|pages=465–484|doi= 10.1111/1468-0297.00646|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/everything/easterlin2001a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert is thus adamant, people should go to great lengths to figure out which jobs they would enjoy, and to find a way to do one of those jobs for a living (that is, provided one is also attentive to social ties).

Unemployment is detrimental to individual well-being. However, that does not hold true in countries where unemployment is widespread. Psychology Today&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-mindful-self-express/201110/preserving-mental-health-during-unemployment|title=Preserving Mental Health During Unemployment|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports that the impact of unemployment is dampened in those for whom work is less central to their identity, those who receive less criticism and less negative judgments from others, those who can meet their immediate financial obligations and those who do not see their unemployment as high stress and negative. Other protective factors include the expectation of reemployment, routines that structure one's time and evaluating oneself as worthy, competent and successful. According to the latest&lt;ref name="liu.se"/&gt; systematic review of the economic literature on life satisfaction, unemployment is worse for wellbeing for those that are right wing or live in high income countries. Not all unemployment is bad, however: international data from sixteen Western countries indicates that retirement at any age yields large increases in subjective well-being that returns to trend by age 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-012-9399-2|title=Subjective Well-Being and Retirement: Analysis and Policy Recommendations | first = Elizabeth Mokyr | last = Horner | name-list-format = vanc |date=1 February 2014|publisher=|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|volume=15|issue=1|pages=125–144|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/s10902-012-9399-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive coaching, a workplace intervention for well-being and performance, is proven to work in certain contexts, according to a 2013 independent quantitative scientific summary synthesising high quality scientific research on coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leadingchangenetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Structuring-and-Understanding-the-Coaching-Industry.pdf |title=Structure and understanding |website=leadingchangenetwork.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It tells us that standard effect sizes for the outcomes of performance/skills, well-being, coping, goal-attainment and work/career attitudes range from 0.43 to 0.74.

A more recent study has challenged the [[Easterlin paradox]]. Using recent data from a broader collection of countries, a positive link was found between GDP and well-being; and there was no point at which wealthier countries' subjective well-being ceased to increase. It was concluded economic growth does indeed increase happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Stevenson, B., Wolfers, J.|year=2008|title=Economic growth and subjective well-being: Reassessing the Easterlin paradox|journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity|volume=39|issue=1|pages=1–102|doi=10.3386/w14282|url=http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/EasterlinParadox.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wealth is strongly correlated with life satisfaction but the correlation between money and emotional well-being is weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kahneman D, Deaton A | title = High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 38 | pages = 16489–93 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20823223 | pmc = 2944762 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1011492107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10716489K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pursuit of money may lead people to ignore leisure time and relationships, both of which may cause and contribute to happiness.&lt;ref name=Aknin09/&gt; The pursuit of money at the risk of jeopardizing one's personal relationships and sacrificing enjoyment from one's leisure activities seems an unwise approach to finding happiness.

Money, or its hectic pursuit, has been shown to hinder people's [[savoring]] ability, or the act of enjoying everyday positive experiences and emotions. In a study looking at working adults, wealthy individuals reported lower levels of savoring ability (the ability to prolong positive emotion) relative to their poorer peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Quoidbach J, Dunn EW, Petrides KV, Mikolajczak M | title = Money giveth, money taketh away: the dual effect of wealth on happiness | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 759–63 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20483819 | doi = 10.1177/0956797610371963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have routinely shown that nations are happier when people's needs are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/07/14/world-happiest-countries-lifestyle-realestate-gallup-table.html |title=Forbes article "Table: The World's Happiest Countries" |publisher=Forbes.com |date=2010-07-14 |access-date=2011-11-12 |first=Francesca |last=Levy  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some studies suggest, however, that people are happier after spending money on experiences, rather than physical things,&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunn EW, Aknin LB, Norton MI | title = Spending money on others promotes happiness | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5870 | pages = 1687–8 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18356530 | doi = 10.1126/science.1150952 | bibcode = 2008Sci...319.1687D }}&lt;/ref&gt; and after spending money on others, rather than themselves.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; However, purchases that buy ‘time’, for instance, cleaners or cooks typically increase individual well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whillans AV, Dunn EW, Smeets P, Bekkers R, Norton MI | title = Buying time promotes happiness | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 114 | issue = 32 | pages = 8523–8527 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28739889 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1706541114 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/8523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lottery winners report higher levels of happiness immediately following the event. But research shows winner's happiness levels drop and return to normal baseline rates within months to years. This finding suggests money does not cause long-term happiness (1978).&lt;ref name="Brickman_1978"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brickman P, Coates D, Janoff-Bulman R | title = Lottery winners and accident victims: is happiness relative? | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 36 | issue = 8 | pages = 917–27 | date = August 1978 | pmid = 690806 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.36.8.917  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a more recent British study on lottery prizes between £1,000 and £120,000, a positive effect even two years after the event was found, the return to normal being only partial and varying.&lt;ref name=jgao /&gt;

One&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1877163 |title=The American Dream or the American Delusion? The Private and External Benefits of Homeownership for Women |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |year=2011 |last1=Bucchianeri |first1=Grace Wong }}&lt;/ref&gt; 600 women strong 2011 study shows that house owners are no happier than renters. Degree of ownership also matter:
“...housing property rights matter for subjective well-being. Specifically, using subjective well-being data from China, the authors find that homeownership is associated with higher levels of life satisfaction, although this happiness premium is larger for people who have full ownership compared to those who have only a minor ownership stake in their home.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2016.10.001 |title=Institutions and well-being |journal=European Journal of Political Economy |volume=45 |page=1 |year=2016 |last1=Bennett |first1=Daniel L |last2=Nikolaev |first2=Boris |last3=Aidt |first3=Toke S  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the latest&lt;ref name="liu.se"/&gt; systematic review of the economic literature on life satisfaction, living in rural areas seems to have some association with well-being, because the included studies tend to control for income and rural areas tend to be poor. Income has a high effect on happiness and incomes are higher in urban areas, so chasing a rural lifestyle at the expense of income may be a ‘grass is always greener’ move.

Adults who live with parents also tend to have&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/living-at-home-with-your-parents/8135918|title=Adults living with their parents are Australia’s least happy, survey finds|first=Ange|last=McCormack | name-list-format = vanc |date=20 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; poorer levels of well-being.

=== Mindfulness ===
{{Main|Mindfulness (psychology)}}
[[File:Rollercoaster Tornado Avonturenpark Hellendoorn Netherlands.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Researchers recommend attending to the past to find fond memories, and the future to find hope, but ultimately focussing mostly on the present.&lt;ref name=ZimbardoTime/&gt; Daydreaming usually precedes drops in happiness. Mindfulness and activities that bring focus to the present (like roller coasters) may bring happiness partly by shifting people's focus away from the slightly saddening question "Am I happy?".&lt;ref name=GilbertWandering/&gt;&lt;ref name=KillingsworthMoment/&gt;]]

[[Mindfulness (psychology)|Mindfulness]] is an intentionally focused awareness of one's immediate experience. "Focused awareness" is a conscious moment-by-moment attention to situational elements of an experience: i.e., thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, and surroundings. An aim of mindfulness is to become grounded in the present moment; one learns to observe the arising and passing of experience. One does not judge the experiences and thoughts, nor do they try to "figure things out" and draw conclusions, or change anything – the challenge during mindfulness is to simply observe.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, J. (2003) Insight Meditation: The Practice of Freedom, Shambala, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Gunaratana H | year=1992|title=Mindfulness in Plain English|publisher=Wisdom Publications|quote="It should be noted that mindfulness is not an evolving term. It has a very distinct longstanding meaning that has remained the same since it was introduced over 2500 years ago. The practice is challenging and requires determination and dedication, particularly when one is starting out. As time passes, the practice becomes more natural."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits of mindfulness practice include reduction of stress, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown KW, Ryan RM, Creswell JD  | year = 2007 | title = Mindfulness: Theoretical foundations and evidence for its salutary effects | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 211–237 | doi=10.1080/10478400701598298}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Reverence (emotion)]].

Ellen J. Langer argued people slip into a state of "mindlessness" by engaging in rote behavior, performing familiar, scripted actions without much cognition, as if on autopilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Wayne | last1 = Weiten | first2 = Dana S. | last2 = Dunn | first3 = Elizabeth Yost | last3 = Hammer | name-list-format = vanc |title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|page=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of focusing on present experiences also mention research by Psychologist [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]], who suggested daydreaming, instead of a focus on the present, may impede happiness.&lt;ref name=GilbertWandering&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Killingsworth MA, Gilbert DT | title = A wandering mind is an unhappy mind | journal = Science | volume = 330 | issue = 6006 | pages = 932 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21071660 | doi = 10.1126/science.1192439 | bibcode = 2010Sci...330..932K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=When the Mind Wanders, Happiness Also Strays | first = John | last = Tierney | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2010-11-15|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/science/16tier.html?_r=1&amp;hp|access-date=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow researcher, Matt Killingsworth, found evidence to support the harm of daydreaming. Fifteen thousand participants from around the world provided over 650 000 reports (using an online application on their phones that requested data at random times). Killingsworth found people who reported daydreaming soon reported less happiness; daydreaming is extremely common.&lt;ref name=KillingsworthMoment&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_killingsworth_want_to_be_happier_stay_in_the_moment.html |title=Matt Killingsworth: Want to be happier? Stay in the moment|work=ted.com|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimbardo (see "Time Perspectives" above) bestowed the merits of a present-focus, and recommended occasional recall of past positive experiences. Reflecting on past positive experiences can influence current mood, and assist in building positive expectations for the future.

There is research that suggests a person's focus influences level of happiness, where thinking too much about happiness can be counter-productive. Rather than asking: "Am I happy?" – which when posed just 4 times a day, starts to decrease happiness, it might well be better to reflect on one's values (e.g., "Can I muster any hope?").&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/2011/06/20/say-no-to-happiness/|publisher=CBC Ideas|title=Say no to happiness|time=about 10 minutes in| first = Todd | last = Kashdan | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asking different questions can assist in redirecting personal thoughts, and perhaps, lead to taking steps to better apply one's energies. The personal answer to any particular question can lead to positive actions, and hopefulness, which is a very powerful, and positive feeling. Hopefulness is more likely to foster happiness, while feelings of hopelessness tend to undermine happiness.

Todd Kashdan, researcher and author of "Designing Positive Psychology", explained early science's findings should not be overgeneralized or adopted too uncritically. Mindfulness to Kashdan is very resource-intensive processing; he warned it is not simply better at all times. To illustrate, when a task is best performed with very little conscious thought (e.g., a paramedic performing practiced, emergency maneuvers).&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; Nevertheless, development of the skill lends to its application at certain times, which can be useful for the reasons just described; Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry Richard J. Davidson highly recommends "mindfulness [[meditation]]" for use in the accurate identification and management of emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/training-the-emotional-brain|title=Training the Emotional Brain – An Interview with Richard J.

Some schools of thought, such as [[Neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP), have been criticised as pseudoscience.

[[Ed Diener]] et al. (1999) suggested this equation: positive emotion – negative emotion = subjective well-being. Since tendency to positive emotion has a correlation of 0.8 with [[extroversion]] and tendency towards negative emotion is indistinguishable from [[neuroticism]], the above equation could also be written as extroversion – neuroticism = happiness. These two traits could account for between 50% to 75% of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Diener | first1 = Ed | last2 = Suh | first2 = Eunkook M. | last3 = Lucas | first3 = Richard E. | last4 = Smith | first4 = Heidi L. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Subjective well-being: Three decades of progress.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1 January 1999 |volume=125|issue=2|pages=276–302|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.276}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are all referring to the [[Big Five personality traits]] model of personality.

An emotionally stable (the opposite of [[Neuroticism|Neurotic]]) [[personality psychology|personality]] correlates well with happiness. Not only does emotional stability make one less prone to negative emotions, it also predicts higher social intelligence – which helps to manage relationships with others (an important part of being happy, discussed below).&lt;ref name="EcoAgeHap"/&gt;

Cultivating an [[Extroversion|extroverted]] [[temperament]] may correlate with happiness for the same reason: it builds relationships and support groups. Some people may be fortunate, from the standpoint of [[Personality psychology|personality theories]] that suggest individuals have control over their long-term behaviors and cognitions. Genetic studies indicate genes for personality (specifically [[extroversion]], [[neuroticism]] and [[conscientiousness]]), and a general factor linking all 5 traits, account for the heritability of [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss A, Bates TC, Luciano M | title = Happiness is a personal(ity) thing: the genetics of personality and well-being in a representative sample | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–10 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18315789 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02068.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests there is a happiness gene, the 5-HTT gene.&lt;ref name="Journal of Human Genetics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordqvist|first=Christian| name-list-format = vanc |title=Happiness Gene Located | url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/224536.php | publisher=Medical News Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Purpose in life ===
Purpose in life refers broadly to the pursuit of life satisfaction. It has also been found that those with high purpose in life scores have strong goals and sense of direction. They feel there is meaning to their past and present life, and hold beliefs that continue to give their life purpose. Research in the past has focused on purpose in the face of adversity (what is awful, difficult, or absurd in life). Recently, research has shifted to include a focus on the role of purpose in personal fulfillment and self-actualization.

The [[self-control]] approach, as expounded by [[C. R. Snyder]], focusses on exercising self-control to achieve self-esteem by fulfilling goals and feeling in control of our own success. This is further reinforced by a sense of intentionality in both efforts and outcomes.&lt;ref name="FeldmanSnyder2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feldman|first1=David B.|last2=Snyder|first2=C. R.  | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Hope and the Meaningful Life: Theoretical and Empirical Associations Between Goal–Directed Thinking and Life Meaning|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume=24|issue=3|year=2005|pages=401–421|issn=0736-7236|doi=10.1521/jscp.24.3.401.65616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[intrinsic motivation]] approach of [[Viktor Frankl]] emphasized finding value in three main areas: creative, experiential, and attitudinal. Creative values are expressed in acts of creating or producing something. Experiential values are actualized through the senses, and may overlap the hedonistic view of happiness. Attitudinal values are prominent for individuals who are unable to pursue the preceding two classes of values. Attitudinal values are believed to be primarily responsible for allowing individuals to endure suffering with dignity.&lt;ref name="FeldmanSnyder2005"/&gt;

A personal sense of responsibility is required for the pursuit of the values that give life meaning, but it is the realization that one holds sole responsibility for rendering life meaningful that allows the values to be actualized and life to be given true purpose. Determining what is meaningful for one's self provides a sense of autonomy and control which promotes self-esteem.&lt;ref name="FeldmanSnyder2005"/&gt;

Purpose in life is positively correlated with education level and volunteerism. However, it has also been found to decrease with age.
Purpose in life is both highly individual, and what specifically provides purpose will change over the course of one's lifetime.&lt;ref name="RyffSinger2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryff|first1=Carol D.|last2=Singer|first2=Burton H.  | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Know Thyself and Become What You Are: A Eudaimonic Approach to Psychological Well-Being|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|volume=9|issue=1|year=2006|pages=13–39|issn=1389-4978|doi=10.1007/s10902-006-9019-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three of the above theories have self-esteem at their core. Self-esteem is often viewed as the most significant measure of psychological well-being, and highly correlated with many life-regulating skills. Purpose in life promotes and is a source of self-esteem; it is not a by-product of self-esteem.

=== Self-efficacy ===
[[Self-efficacy]] refers to a belief that one's ability to accomplish a task is a function of personal effort. Low self-efficacy, or a disconnect between ability and personal effort, is associated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]]; by comparison, high self-efficacy is associated with positive change, including overcoming abuse, overcoming eating disorders, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. High self-efficacy also has positive benefits for one's [[immune system]], aids in stress management, and decreases pain.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; A related concept, [[Personal effectiveness]], is primarily concerned with planning and the implementation of methods of accomplishment.

=== Sports ===
According to Bloodworth and McNamee sports and physical activities are a key contributor to the development of people's well-being. The influence of sports on well-being is conceptualized within a framework which includes impermanence, its [[hedonistic]] shallowness and its [[epistemological]] inadequacy.{{clarify|date=February 2015}} Researching the effect of sport on well-being is difficult as some societies are unable to access sports, a deficiency in studying this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bloodworth | first1 = Andrew | first2 = Mike | last2 = McNamee | name-list-format = vanc |title=Sport, physical activity and well-being: An objectivist account|journal=Sport, Education and Society|date=August 2012|volume=17|issue=4|page=18|doi=10.1080/13573322.2011.608948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suffering ===
{{Quote box|align=left|width=30%| quoted=1 |quote= Research has shown it is possible to help suffering people by building their strengths. In addition, prevention researchers have discovered strengths act as buffers against mental illness.

[[File:Dalai Lama and Seattle Mayor Norm Rice, 1993.jpg|thumb|right|According to Peterson, the Buddhist saying that "life is suffering" can be understood as a reality that humans must accept, as well as a call to cultivate virtues.]]
In reference to the Buddhist saying "Life is suffering", researcher and clinical psychologist [[Jordan Peterson]] suggested this view as realistic, not pessimistic, where acceptance of the reality life is harsh, provides a freedom from the expectation one should always be happy. This realization can assist in the management of inevitable suffering. To Peterson, virtues are important because they provide people with essential tools to escape suffering (e.g., the strength to admit [[cognitive dissonance|dissonant]] truths to themselves). Peterson maintained suffering is made worse by false philosophy (i.e., denial that natural suffering is inevitable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvo.org/TVO/WebObjects/TVO.woa?videoid%3F713852509001 |title=TVO.ORG &amp;#124; Video &amp;#124; TVO – Jordan Peterson on The Necessity of Virtue |publisher=TVO |date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2011-02-07 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] believes positive psychology is "not a luxury", saying "most of Positive Psychology is for all of us, troubled or untroubled, privileged or in privation, suffering or carefree. The pleasures of a good conversation, the strength of gratitude, the benefits of kindness or wisdom or spirituality or humility, the search for meaning and the antidote to "fidgeting until we die" are the birthrights of us all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/newsletter.aspx?id=52 |title=Martin P Seligman.

Positive coping is defined as "a response aimed at diminishing the physical, emotional, and psychological burden that is linked to stressful life events and daily hassles"&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 1999 pp. 3-19"&gt;Snyder, C. R., &amp; Dinoff, B. L. (1999). Coping: Where have you been? In C. R. Snyder (Ed.), ''Coping: The psychology of what works'' (pp. 3–19). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is found that proper coping strategies will reduce the burden of short-term stress and will help relieve long-term stress. Stress can be reduced by building resources that inhibit or buffer future challenges. For some people, these effective resources could be physiological, psychological or social.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 1999 pp. 3-19"/&gt;

=== Terror management ===
[[Terror management theory]] maintains that people suffer [[cognitive dissonance]] (anxiety) when they are reminded of their inevitable death. Through terror management, individuals are motivated to seek consonant elements – symbols which make sense of mortality and death in satisfactory ways (i.e. boosting self-esteem).

Research has found that strong belief in religious ''or'' secular meaning systems affords psychological security and hope. It is moderates (e.g. agnostics, slightly religious individuals) who likely suffer the most anxiety from their meaning systems. Religious meaning systems are especially adapted to manage anxiety about death or dying because they are unlikely to be disconfirmed (for various reasons), they are all encompassing, and they promise literal immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vail KE, Rothschild ZK, Weise DR, Solomon S, Pyszczynski T, Greenberg J | title = A terror management analysis of the psychological functions of religion | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–94 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19940284 | doi = 10.1177/1088868309351165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doubtreligion.blogspot.com/2011/03/episode-81-sacrificial-lambs.html|title=Reasonable Doubts: Episode 81 Sacrificial Lambs|author=Fletcher|work=doubtreligion.blogspot.com}}{{self-published inline|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether emotional effects are beneficial or adverse seems to vary with the nature of the belief. Belief in a benevolent God is associated with lower incidence of general anxiety, social anxiety, paranoia, obsession, and compulsion whereas belief in a punitive God is associated with greater symptoms. (An alternative explanation is that people seek out beliefs that fit their psychological and emotional states.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Silton NR, Flannelly KJ, Galek K, Ellison CG | title = Beliefs about God and mental health among American adults | journal = Journal of Religion and Health | volume = 53 | issue = 5 | pages = 1285–96 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 23572240 | doi = 10.1007/s10943-013-9712-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens of the world's poorest countries are the most likely to be religious, and researchers suggest this is because of religion's powerful coping abilities.&lt;ref name=GallupE&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx Religiosity Highest in World's Poorest Nations], Gallup Global Reports, August 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/116449/Religion-Provides-Emotional-Boost-World-Poor.aspx Religion Provides Emotional Boost to World’s Poor], Gallup Global Reports, March 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Luke Galen also supports terror management theory as a partial explanation of the above findings.

== Relational factors ==

=== Love and caring ===
The capacity for loving attachments and relationships, especially with parents, is the strongest predictor of well-being later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vaillant|first1=George E. | name-list-format = vanc |authorlink1=George Eman Vaillant|title=Triumphs of Experience|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674067424|page=191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPobx78zuj8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q=loving%20relationship&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 April 2017|language=en|date=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===
[[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] writes: "Unlike money, which has at most a small effect, marriage is robustly related to happiness... In my opinion, the [[Correlation does not imply causation|jury is still out on what causes]] the proven fact married people are happier than unmarried people." (pp.&amp;nbsp;55–56&lt;ref name="Seligman2002"/&gt;). Married persons report higher levels of happiness and well-being than single people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orden SR, Bradburn NM |title=Dimensions of Marriage Happiness |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=715–731 |date=May 1968 |jstor=2775777 |doi=10.1086/224565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other data has shown a spouse's happiness depends on the happiness of their partner. When asked, spouses reported similar happiness levels to each other. The data also shows the spouses' happiness level fluctuates similarly to one another. If the husband is having a bad week, the wife will similarly report she had a bad week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoppmann CA, Gerstorf D, Willis SL, Schaie KW | title = Spousal interrelations in happiness in the Seattle Longitudinal Study: considerable similarities in levels and change over time | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21038942 | pmc = 3133667 | doi = 10.1037/a0020788 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little data on alternatives like [[polyamory]], although one study stated wife order in polygyny did not have a substantial effect on life or marital satisfaction over all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gwanfogbe PN, Schumm WR, Smith M, Furrow JL |title=Polygyny and marital/life satisfaction: An exploratory study from rural Cameroon |journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=55–71  |date=January 1997|jstor=41603479}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study also found younger wives were happier than older wives.

On the other hand, at least one large study in Germany found no difference in happiness between married and unmarried people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200303/marriage-is-not-the-key-happiness|title=&lt;/font&gt;Marriage Is Not the Key to Happiness| first = Anne | last = Becker | name-list-format = vanc |work=Psychology Today|date=March 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that married couples are consistently happier and more satisfied with their life than those who are single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Diener E, Suh EM |year=2000|title=Culture and subjective well-being|location=&lt;/font&gt;Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research findings have indicated that marriage is the only real significant bottom-up predictor of life satisfaction for men and women, and that those people who have a higher life satisfaction prior to marriage, tend to have a happier marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Diener, M., &amp; Diener McGavran, M.

Self-reported satisfaction typically drops as the years of marriage roll on, particularly for couples who have children compared to those who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201710/defy-the-odds-heres-how-keep-your-relationship-happy|title=Defy the Odds: Here's How to Keep Your Relationship Happy|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this decline include a drop in affectionate behaviour. One team of researcher from Northwestern University who summarised the literature in 2013, identifies that this trend does not reverse throughout the marital period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/eli-finkel/documents/InPress_FinkelSlotterLuchiesWaltonGross_PSci_000.pdf |title=A Brief Intervention to Promote Conflict Reappraisal Preserves Marital Quality Over Time |website=faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprisingly, there has been a steady decline in the positive relationship between marriage and well-being in the United States since the 1970s. This decline is due to women reporting being less happy than previously and single men reporting being happier than previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glenn ND, Weaver CN | year = 1988 | title = The changing relationship of marital status to reported happiness | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume = 50 | issue = 2| pages = 317–324 | doi=10.2307/351999| jstor = 351999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research does exist, however, suggesting that compared to single people, married people have better physical and psychological health and tend to live longer.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socec.2005.11.043 |title=Does marriage make people happy, or do happy people get married? |journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics |volume=35 |issue=2 |page=326 |year=2006 |last1=Stutzer |first1=Alois |last2=Frey |first2=Bruno S  | name-list-format = vanc  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this, a two-factor theory of love was developed by Barnes and Sternberg. This theory is composed of two components: passionate love and companionate love. Passionate love is considered to be an intense longing for a loved one. This love is often experienced through joy and sexual fulfillment, or even through rejection. On the other hand, companionate love is associated with affection, friendship and commitment. Stutzer and Frey (2006) found that the absence of loneliness and the emotional support that promotes self-esteem are both important aspects that contribute to individual well-being within marriage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Both passionate and companionate love are the foundations for every variety of love that one may experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes ML, Sternberg RJ | year=1997|contribution=A hierarchical model of love and its prediction of satisfaction in close relationships|editors=R.

Hojjatt|title=Satisfaction in close relationships|pages=79–101|location=New York|publisher=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; When passionate and companionate love are compromised in a marital relationship, satisfaction is decreased and the likelihood of divorce increases.&lt;ref name=pmid26168263&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sullivan KT, Pasch LA, Lawrence E, Bradbury TN | title = Physical aggression, compromised social support, and 10-year marital outcomes: Testing a relational spillover model | journal = Journal of Family Psychology | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 931–7 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26168263 | doi = 10.1037/fam0000125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the lack of positive support and validation increases the risk for divorce.

Because of the expansive research done on the significance of social support within a marriage, it is important to understand that this research was inspired by a theory called the attachment theory perspective. Attachment theory stresses the importance of support and care giving in a relationship for the development of trust and security. Attachment theory, as conceptualized by Collins and Feeney (2000) is an interpersonal, transactional process that involves one partners caregiving responses.&lt;ref name=pmid10870908&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collins NL, Feeney BC | title = A safe haven: an attachment theory perspective on support seeking and caregiving in intimate relationships | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 1053–73 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10870908 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.78.6.1053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parenthood ===
While the mantle of parenting is sometimes held as the necessary path of adulthood, study findings are actually mixed as to whether parents report higher levels of happiness relative to non-parents. Folk wisdom suggests a child brings partners closer; research has found couples actually become less satisfied after the birth of the first child.&lt;ref name=Twenge03&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2003.00574.x |title=Parenthood and Marital Satisfaction: A Meta-Analytic Review |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |volume=65 |issue=3 |page=574 |year=2003 |last1=Twenge |first1=Jean M |last2=Campbell |first2=W.

By contrast, parents' self-report levels of happiness are higher than those of non-parents. This may be due to already happy people having more children than unhappy people. In addition, it might also be that, in the long-term, having children gives more meaning to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

However, when adults without children are compared to empty nest parents, parenthood is positively associated with emotional well-being.&lt;ref name=Evenson05/&gt; People found parenthood to be more stressful in the 1970s than they did in the 1950s.

Males apparently become less happy after the birth of a child due to added economic pressure and taking on the role of being a parent.&lt;ref name=Twenge03/&gt; A conflict between partners can arise when the couple does not desire traditional roles, or has an increasing number of roles.&lt;ref name=Twenge03/&gt; Unequal responsibilities of child-rearing between men and women account for this difference in satisfaction. Fathers who worked and shared an equal part in child-raising responsibilities were found to be the least satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Ferri, E., Smith, K. (1996). ''Parenting in the 1990s''.

Researchers implemented the Huta &amp; Ryan Scale: Four Eudaimonic Measurement Questionnaire to analyze the participants eudaimonic motives, through motivation towards activities. The investigation was conducted on Canadian university undergraduates. The four eudaimonic pursuits as described by Huta &amp; Ryan are: 
# "Seeking to pursue excellence or a personal ideal" 
# "Seeking to use the best in yourself" 
# "Seeking to develop a skill, learn, or gain insight into something" 
# "Seeking to do what you believe in".&lt;ref name="Huta"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huta|first1=Veronika|title=Huta, Veronika. "Linking Peoples' Pursuit of Eudaimonia and Hedonia with Characteristics of Their Parents: Parenting Styles, Verbally Endorsed Values, and Role Modeling. |journal=Journal of Happiness|date=2011|volume=13|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study determined that participants derived well-being from eudaimonic pursuits only if their parents had role modeled eudaimonia, but not if their parents had merely verbally endorsed eudaimonia.&lt;ref name="Huta"/&gt;

Studies were also conducted on responsiveness and demandingness. The studies participants were American university undergraduates. The terms are described as follows; responsiveness satisfies the basic psychological need for autonomy. This is relevant to eudaimonia because it supports and implements the values of initiative, effort, and persistence, and integration of one's behaviour's values, and true-self. Autonomy is an important psychological factor because it provides the individual with independence. Demandingness cultivates many of the qualities needed for eudaimonia, including structure, self-discipline, responsibility, and vision. Responsiveness and demandingness are reported to be good aspects of parenting. The studies report both of these qualities as important factors to well-being.&lt;ref name="Huta"/&gt;

The study addressed parenting style by assessing and using adaptions of Baumrind's Parent Behaviour Rating Interview. Adaptions of this interview were made into a seventy-five question based survey; participants answered questions organized into fifteen subscales. The study determined that eudaimonically oriented participants reported their parents had been both demanding and responsive towards them. A [[multiple regression]] showed that demandingness and responsiveness together explained as much as twenty-eight percent of the variance in eudaimonia, this suggests parenting played a major role in the development of this pursuit. This supported the expectation that eudaimonia is cultivated when parents encourage internal structure, self-discipline, responsibility, and vision, and simultaneously fulfill a child's needs for autonomy. The research concludes that parents who want their children to experience eudaimonia must firstly themselves "mentor" their children in the approaches to attain eudaimonia. To encourage eudaimonia verbally is not sufficient enough to suffice eudaimonia into adulthood. Parents must clearly role model eudaimonia for it to truly be present in the child's life.&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt;

=== Social ties ===
In the article "Finding Happiness after Harvard", [[George Eman Vaillant|George Vaillant]] concluded a study on what aspects of life are important for "successful living". In the 1940s, Arlie Bock, while in charge of the Harvard Health Services, started a study, selecting 268 Harvard students from graduating classes of 1942, '43, and '44. He sought to identify the aspects of life contributing to "successful living". In 1967, the psychiatrist George Vaillant continued the study, undertaking follow-up interviews to gauge the lives of many of the students. In 2000, Vaillant again interviewed these students as to their progress in life. Vaillant observed: health, close relationships, and how participants dealt with their troubles. Vaillant found a key aspect to successful living is healthy and strong relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shenk J |title=Finding happiness After Harvard |journal=Wilson Quarterly |volume=33 |pages=73–74 |date=Autumn 2009 |url=http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?AT=0&amp;AID=1501 |access-date=2017-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027190526/http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?AT=0&amp;AID=1501# |archive-date=2012-10-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely publicized study from 2008 in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' reported happiness in [[social network]]s may spread from person to person.&lt;ref name=Fowler08&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fowler JH, Christakis NA | title = Dynamic spread of happiness in a large social network: longitudinal analysis over 20 years in the Framingham Heart Study | journal = BMJ | volume = 337 | issue = 768 | pages = a2338 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19056788 | pmc = 2600606 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.a2338 | author1-link = James H. Fowler }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers followed nearly 5000 individuals for 20 years in the long-standing [[Framingham Heart Study]] and found clusters of happiness and unhappiness that spread up to 3 degrees of separation on average. Happiness tended to spread through close relationships like friends, siblings, spouses, and next-door neighbors; researchers reported happiness spread more consistently than unhappiness through the network. Moreover, the structure of the social network appeared to affect happiness, as people who were very central (with many friends, and friends of friends) were significantly happier than those on the network periphery. People closer with others are more likely to be happy themselves.&lt;ref name=Fowler08/&gt; Overall, the results suggest happiness can spread through a population like a virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/health/05happy-web.html|title=Strangers May Cheer You Up, Study Says  |publisher=New York Times|date=December 5, 2008 | first=Pam | last=Belluck | name-list-format = vanc |access-date=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rob Stein,[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/04/AR2008120403537.html "Happiness Can Spread Among People Like a Contagion, Study Indicates,"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', December 5, 2008, Page A08&lt;/ref&gt; Having a best friend buffers one's negative life experiences.

Neuroeconomist Paul Zak studies morality, oxytocin, and trust, among other variables. Based on research findings, Zak recommends: people hug others more often to get into the habit of feeling trust. He explains "eight hugs a day, you'll be happier, and the world will be a better place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_zak_trust_morality_and_oxytocin.html|title=Trust, morality -- and oxytocin?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Anderson et al. found that [[sociometric status]] (the amount of respect one has from face-to-face peer group) is significantly and causally related to happiness as measured by [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson C, Kraus MW, Galinsky AD, Keltner D | title = The local-ladder effect: social status and subjective well-being | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 764–71 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22653798 | doi = 10.1177/0956797611434537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutional factors ==

=== Education ===

==== Education and intelligence ====
Research suggests neither a good education nor a high IQ reliably increases happiness.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap&gt;{{cite news |last=Wallis |first=Claudia | name-list-format = vanc  | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1015902-1,00.html |title=Science of Happiness: New Research on Mood, Satisfaction |publisher=TIME |date=2005-01-09 |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115020515/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1015902-1%2C00.html |archivedate=2010-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Anders Ericsson]] argued an IQ above 120 has a decreasing influence on success. Presumably, IQs above 120 do not additionally cause other happiness indicators like success (with the exception of careers like [[Theoretical physics]], where high IQs are more predictive of success). Above that IQ level, other factors, like social skills and a good mentor, matter more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Making of an Expert

Studies has shown that enjoyment in things as simple as role playing increases a person's IQ and their happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klesen|first1=M|title=Using Theatrical Concepts for Role-plays with Educational Agents|date=2005|doi=10.1080/08839510590910237|volume=19|issue=3–4|journal=Applied Artificial Intelligence|pages=413–431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Seligman]] has said: "As a professor, I don't like this, but the cerebral virtues—curiosity, love of learning—are less strongly tied to happiness than interpersonal virtues like kindness, gratitude and capacity for love."&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;

=== Educational goals ===
John White (2013) investigated the educational goals at public schools in Britain. School-education involves both cognitive and conceptual [[learning]], but also the development social skills and personal development. Ideally, children develop self-confidence, and create purpose for themselves. According to White, in the past schools only focused on [[knowledge]] and [[education]] but now [[United Kingdom|Britain]] has moved to a broader direction. White's Every Child Matters initiative seeks to enhance children's well-being across the range of children's services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=John| name-list-format = vanc |title=Education in Well-Being|journal=The Oxford handbook of happiness|pages=540–550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical education ====
As a basic building block to a better existence, positive psychology aims to improve the quality of experiences. Within its framework, students could learn to become excited about physical activity. Playing comes natural to children; positive psychology seeks to preserve this zest (a sense of excitement and motivation for life)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.positive-living-now.com/increase-your-happiness-add-some-zest-to-your-life/|title = Increase your happiness: add some zest to your life|date = January 18, 2013|accessdate = April 6, 2015|website = Positive-Living-Now|publisher = |last = Minarik|first = Susan K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; for movement in growing and developing children. If offered in an interesting, challenging and pleasurable way physical activity would thus internalize an authentic feeling of happiness in students. Positive psychology's approach to physical activity could give students the means of acquiring an engaged, pleasant and meaningful life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cherubini|first=Jeffrey| name-list-format = vanc |title=Positive Psychology and Quality Physical Education|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|date=September 2009|volume=80|issue=7|pages=42–47, 51|doi=10.1080/07303084.2009.10598356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== School education ====
&lt;!-- I don't object to the addition of this study, but it is not appropriately concise, and should accordingly be drastically cut down. --&gt;
Positive psychology is beneficial to schools and students because it encourages individuals to strive to do their best, whereas scolding has the opposite effect. Clifton and Rath&lt;ref name="Clifton, D 2005, pp. 47-51"&gt;Clifton, D, Rath, T 2005, ‘Every moment matters’, How full is your bucket? Positive strategies for work and life, Gallup Press, New York, pp. 47–51&lt;/ref&gt; discussed research conducted by Dr. Elizabeth Hurlock in 1925, where fourth, fifth and sixth graders were either praised, criticized or ignored, based on their work on math problems. Praised students improved by 71%, those criticized improved by 19%, and students provided with no feedback improved a mere 5%. Praise seems an effective method of fostering improvement.

According to Clifton and Rath&lt;ref name="Clifton, D 2005, pp. 47-51"/&gt; ninety nine out of one hundred people prefer the influence of positive people. The benefits include: increased productivity, and contagious positive emotions, which assists one in working to the best of her, or his, abilities. Even a single negative person can ruin the entire positive vibe in an environment. Clifton and Rath&lt;ref name="Clifton, D 2005, pp. 47-51"/&gt; cited ‘positive emotions as an essential daily requirement for survival’.

In 2008, in conjunction with the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania, a whole-of-school implementation of Positive Psychology was undertaken by Geelong Grammar School (Victoria, Australia). This involved training of teaching staff in the principles and skills of positive psychology. Ongoing support was provided by The Positive Psychology Center staff, who remained in-residence for the entire year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seligman M, Ernst R, Gillham J, Reivich K, Links M |title=Positive education: positive psychology and classroom interventions |journal=Oxford Review of Education |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=293–311 |year=2009 |doi=10.1080/03054980902934563 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staats, Hupp and Hagley (2008) used positive psychology to explore academic honesty. They identified positive traits displayed by heroes, then determined if the presence of these traits in students predicted future intent to cheat. The results of their research: ‘an effective working model of heroism in the context of the academic environment’ (Staats, Hupp &amp; Hagley, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Staats S, Hupp JM, Hagley AM | title = Honesty and heroes: a positive psychology view of heroism and academic honesty | journal = The Journal of Psychology | volume = 142 | issue = 4 | pages = 357–72 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18792648 | doi = 10.3200/JRLP.142.4.357-372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== School grades of children ====
According to a study reported in the ''NY Post'' newspaper, 48% of parents reward their children's good grades with cash or something else of meaning. Among many families in the United States, this is controversial. Although psychology experts support the offer of reward for good behavior as a better alternative than the use of punishment for bad behavior, in some circumstances, families cannot afford to give their children an average of 16 dollars for every good grade earned. Alternatives for money include allowing a child extra time on a computer or staying up later than usual. Some psychology experts believe the best reward is praise and encouragement because material rewards can cause long-term negative effects for children.
 
A study, regarding rewards for children, conducted in 1971 by psychologist, Edward L. Deci, at the University of Rochester, is still referenced today. Featured in the ''New York Times'', it focused on the short- and long-term effects of rewards for positive behavior. Deci suggested rewards for positive behavior is an effective incentive for only a short period. At the outset, rewards can support motivation to work hard and strive towards personal goals. However, once rewards cease, children showed less interest in the task relative to participants who never received rewards. Deci pointed out, at a young age, children's natural instinct is to resist people who try to control their behavior, which he cited as support for his conclusion rewards for good behavior have limited effectiveness.

In contrast, the ''New York Times'' featured research findings that supported the merits of offering rewards to children for good behavior. Expert economists argued children experiencing trouble with their behavior or schoolwork should have numerous helpful options, including rewards. Although children might well experience an initial attraction to financial or material, a love for learning could develop subsequently. Despite the controversy regarding the use of rewards, some experts believe the best way to motivate a child is to offer rewards at the beginning of the school year, but if unsuccessful they recommend teachers and parents stop using the reward system. Because of individual differences among children, no one method will work for everyone. Some children respond well to the use of rewards for positive behavior, while others evidence negative effects. The results seem to depend on the person.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==== Youth development ====
[[Positive Youth Development]] focuses on the promotion of healthy development rather than viewing youth as prone to problems needing to be addressed. This is accomplished through programs and efforts by communities, schools, and government agencies.&lt;ref name="website- Aspe.hhs.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Positive Youth Development in the U.S.: Research Findings on Evaluations of Positive Youth Development Programs|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/HSP/PositiveYouthDev99/index.htm|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Work ===
{{Main|Happiness at work}}

It has been argued that [[happiness at work]] is one of the driving forces behind positive outcomes at work, rather than just being a resultant product.&lt;ref name="Boehm &amp; Lyubomirsky 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boehm JK, Lyubomirsky S |title=Does Happiness Promote Career Success? |journal=Journal of Career Assessment |volume=16 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=101–16 |doi=10.1177/1069072707308140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a large body of positive [[psychological research]] into the relationship between happiness and productivity,&lt;ref name="test3"&gt;Carr, A.: "Positive Psychology: The Science of Happiness and Human Strengths" Hove, Brunner-Routledge 2004{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Isen |first1=A. |chapter=Positive Affect and Decision-making |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Lewis |editor2-first=Jeannette M. |editor2-last=Haviland-Jones | name-list-format = vanc |title=Handbook of Emotions |edition=2nd  |pages=417–36 |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-57230-529-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid11392858&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buss DM | title = The evolution of happiness | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–23 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 11392858 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; happiness at work has traditionally been seen as a potential by-product of positive outcomes at work, rather than a pathway to success in business. However a growing number of scholars, including Boehm and Lyubomirsky, argue that it should be viewed as one of the major sources of positive outcomes in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Boehm &amp; Lyubomirsky 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid16351326&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyubomirsky S, King L, Diener E | title = The benefits of frequent positive affect: does happiness lead to success? | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 131 | issue = 6 | pages = 803–55 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16351326 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.131.6.803 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Human Resource Management ====
A practical application of positive psychology is to assist individuals and organizations in identifying strengths so as to increase and sustain well-being. Therapists, counselors, coaches, various psychological professionals, HR departments, business strategists, and others, are using new methods and techniques to broaden and build upon the strengths of a wide population of individuals. This includes those not suffering from mental illness or disorder. &lt;!-- The phrase "broaden and build" is a reference to the prominent positive psychology theory of Barbara Fredrickson. --&gt;

==== Workplace ====
{{main|Positive psychology in the workplace}}
Positive psychology has been implemented in business management practice, but has faced challenges. Wong &amp; Davey (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/sl_proceedings/2007/wong-davey.pdf |title=Wong &amp; Davey (2007) |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted managers can introduce positive psychology to a workplace, but they might struggle with positive ways to apply it to employees. Furthermore, for employees to welcome and commit to positive psychology, its application within an organization must be transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=P. Alex |last1=Linley |first2=Susan |last2=Harrington  | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology and Work |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JR51T4KHf3AC&amp;pg=PA327 |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-533544-6 |page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managers must also understand the implementation of positive psychology will not necessarily combat any commitment challenges that exist. However, with its implementation employees might become more optimistic and open to new concepts or management practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pambritton.com/what-is-happiness-psychology-and-why-should-smart-entrepreneurs-care/|title=What Is Happiness Psychology and Why Should Smart Entrepreneurs Care?|last=Britton|first=Pam| name-list-format = vanc |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their article "The Benefits of Frequent Positive Affect: Does Happiness Lead to Success?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyubomirsky S, King L, Diener E | title = The benefits of frequent positive affect: does happiness lead to success? | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 131 | issue = 6 | pages = 803–55 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16351326 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.131.6.803 | url = http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-1316803.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; S. Lyubomirsky et al. report: "Study after study shows that happiness precedes important outcomes and indicators of thriving, including fulfilling and productive work".

Positive psychology, when applied correctly, can provide employees with a greater opportunity to use skills and vary work duties. However, changing work conditions and roles can lead to stress among employees if they are improperly supported by management. This is particularly true for employees who must meet the expectations of organizations with unrealistic goals and targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Snyder, C &amp; Lopez, J.|year=2002|title= Handbook of Positive Psychology|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.deakin.eblib.com.au/patron/FullRecord.aspx?p=271581&amp;userid=WEAuOX57P1tMHeNgDQM4dA%3d%3d&amp;tstamp=1273278299&amp;id=9E207671A9591844A5DE424F74A348322954B1F4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas and Tasker (2010) showed less worker autonomy, fewer opportunities for development, less-enriched work roles, and lower levels of supervisor support reflected the effect of industry growth on job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas JC, Tasker TE | year = 2010 | title = Life, liberty, work, and the pursuit of happiness | url = | journal = Psyccritiques | volume = 55 | issue = 51| pages = | doi = 10.1037/a0022089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Can an organization implement positive change? Lewis et al. (2007) developed [[appreciative inquiry]] (AI), which is an integrated, organizational-level methodology for approaching [[organizational development]]. Appreciative inquiry is based on the generation of organizational resourcefulness, which is accomplished by accessing a variety of human psychological processes, such as: positive emotional states, imagination, social cohesion, and the social construction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lewis S, Passmore J, Cantore S |title=Positive psychology and managing change |journal=The Psychologist |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=932–4 |year=2008 |doi= |url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/positive-psychology-managing-change/#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively new practice in the workplace is recruiting and developing people based on their strengths (what they love to do, are naturally good at and energises them). Standard Chartered Bank pioneered this approach in the early 2000s. More and more organisations are realising the benefit of recruiting people who are in their element in the job as opposed to simply having the right competencies for the job. Aviva, Morrisons (a large UK supermarket) and Starbucks have all adopted this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engagingminds.co.uk/sbr/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/How-strengths-based-recruitment-transforms-organisations.pdf|title=How Strengths-based Recruitment Transforms Organisations|work=engagingminds.co.uk|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Howard Gardner]] has extensively researched the merit of undertaking good work at one's job. He suggested young generations (particularly in the United States) are taught to focus on the selfish pursuit of money for its own sake, although having money does not engender happiness, and psychological studies show that there is a strong correlation between the wealthy and experience of intensively negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/balance/news/20060630/study-money-wont-make-you-happy|title=Study: Money Won't Make You Happy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner's proposed alternatives loosely follow the pleasant/good/meaningful life classifications outlined above; he believes young people should be trained to pursue excellence in their field, as well as engagement (see flow, above) in accordance with their moral belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Gardner, TVOpodcast ''Excellence in education'', http://www.tvo.org/TVOsites/WebObjects/TvoMicrosite.woa?bi?1260050400000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Societal factors ==
[[File:Child well-being is better in more equal rich countries.jpg|thumb|Child well-being is better in more equal rich countries.]]

=== Criminology ===

==== Offender rehabilitation ====
Traditional work with offenders has focused on their deficits (e.g., with respect to socialization, and schooling) and other "criminogenic" risk-factors. Rehabilitation more often than not has taken the form of forced treatment or training, ostensibly for the good of the offender, and the community. Arguably, this approach has shortcomings, suggesting a need to make available additional positive options to treatment staff so they can best assist offenders, and so that offenders can better find their way forward. Positive psychology has made recent inroads with the advent of the "Good Lives Model", developed by Tony Ward, Shadd Maruna, and others. With respect to rehabilitation: "Individuals take part ... because they think that such activities might either improve the quality of their life (an intrinsic goal) or at least look good to judges, parole boards and family members (an extrinsic goal)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Tony | last1 = Ward | first2 = Shadd | last2 = Maruna  | name-list-format = vanc |title=Rehabilitation|location=London, New York|publisher=Routledge |year=2007|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Positive criminology and positive victimology ====
[[Positive criminology]] and positive victimology are conceptual approaches, developed by the Israeli criminologist Natti Ronel and his research team, that follow principles of positive psychology and apply them into the fields of criminology and victimology, respectively. Positive criminology and victimology both place an emphasis on social inclusion and on unifying and integrating forces at individual, group, social and spiritual levels that are associated with the limiting of crime and recovery from victimization. In traditional approaches the study of crime, violence and related behaviors emphasizes the negative aspects in people's lives that are associated with deviance, criminality and victimization. A common understanding is that human relationships are affected more by destructive encounters than by constructive or positive ones. Positive criminology and victimology argue that a different approach is viable, based on three dimensions – social integration, emotional healing and spirituality – that constitute positive direction indicators.

=== Economics ===
{{merge|Happiness_economics|discuss=Talk:Happiness_economics#Merger proposal|date=April 2018}}
In [[economics]], the term well-being is used for one or more [[Numerical data|quantitative]] measures intended to assess the [[quality of life]] of a group, for example, in the [[capabilities approach]] and the [[Happiness economics|economics of happiness]].

=== Political views ===

== Cultural factors ==
{{main|Culture and positive psychology}}

=== Culture ===
People base their own well-being in relation to their environment and the lives of others around them. Well-being is also subject to how one feels other people in their environment perceive them, whether that positively or negatively. Whether or not other cultures are subject to internal culture appraisal is based on that culture's type. According to Diener and Suh,
{{quote|[[Collectivistic]] cultures are more likely to use norms and the social appraisals of others in evaluating their subjective well-being, whereas those [individualistic] societies are more likely to heavily weight the internal [frame of reference] arising from one’s own happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diener|first1=Ed|last2=Suh|first2=Eunkook M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Culture and subjective well-being|date=2003|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0-262-54146-6|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Different views on well-being ===
Various cultures have various perspectives on the nature of positive human functioning. For example, studies on [[aversion to happiness]], or fear of happiness, indicates that some individuals and cultures are averse to the experience of happiness, because they believe happiness may cause bad things to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|last2=Weijers|first2=Dan | name-list-format = vanc |title=Aversion to Happiness Across Cultures: A Review of Where and Why People are Averse to Happiness|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=15 December 2013|volume=15|issue=3|pages=717–735|doi=10.1007/s10902-013-9489-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical evidence indicates that there are fundamental differences in the ways well-being is construed in Western and non-Western cultures, including the Islamic and East Asian cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|title=A Comparison of Western and Islamic Conceptions of Happiness|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=15 December 2012|volume=14|issue=6|pages=1857–1874|doi=10.1007/s10902-012-9406-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploring various cultural perspectives on well-being, Joshanloo (2014) identifies and discusses six broad differences between Western and non-Western conceptions of well-being. For example, whereas Western cultures tend to emphasize the absence of negative emotions and autonomy in defining well-being, Eastern cultures tend to emphasize virtuous or religious activity, self-transcendence, and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|title=Eastern Conceptualizations of Happiness: Fundamental Differences with Western Views|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=21 March 2013|volume=15|issue=2|pages=475–493|doi=10.1007/s10902-013-9431-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eunkook M. Suh (University of California) and Shigehiro Oishi (University of Minnesota; now at University of Virginia) examined the differences of happiness on an international level and different cultures' views on what creates well-being and happiness. In a study, of over 6,000 students from 43 nations, to identify mean life satisfaction, on a scale of 1–7, the Chinese ranked lowest at 3.3; and Dutch scored the highest at 5.4. When asked how much subjective well-being was ideal, Chinese ranked lowest at 4.5, and Brazilians highest at 6.2, on a scale of 1–7. The study had three main findings: (1) People living in individualistic, rather than collectivist, societies are happier; (2) Psychological attributes referencing the individual are more relevant to Westerners; (3) Self-evaluating happiness levels depend on different cues, and experiences, from one's culture.&lt;ref name="free-books-online.org"&gt;{{cite web| vauthors = Eunkook S |year=2002|title=Subjective Well-Being Across Cultures|accessdate= November 23, 2012|url=http://free-books-online.org/psychology/cross-cultural-psychology/subjective-well-being-across-cultures/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408081703/http://free-books-online.org/psychology/cross-cultural-psychology/subjective-well-being-across-cultures/|archivedate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of a study by Chang E. C. showed that Asian Americans and Caucasian Americans have similar levels of optimism but Asian Americans are far more pessimistic than Caucasian Americans. However, there were no major differences in depression across cultures. On the other hand, pessimism was positively linked to [[problem solving]] behaviors for Asian Americans, but was negatively linked for Caucasian Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lopez SJ, Snyder CR | title = The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | page = 53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion and spirituality ===
Religiousness and spirituality are closely related but distinct topics. [[Religion]] is any organized, and often [[Institutionalisation|institutionalized]], system of cultural practices and beliefs pertaining to the meaning of human existence. It occurs within a traditional context such as a formal religious institution.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[[Raymond Paloutzian|Paloutzian, R. F.]], &amp; Park, C. L. (Eds.). (2005). Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality. New York, NY, US: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spirituality]], on the other hand, is a general term applied to the process of finding meaning and a better understanding of one's place in the universe. It is the individual or collective search for that which is sacred or meaningful in life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = George LK, Larson DB, Koenig HG, McCullough ME | year = 2000 | title = Spirituality and health: What we know, what we need to know | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 102–116 | doi=10.1521/jscp.2000.19.1.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; One may therefore be religious but not spiritual, and vice versa.

==== Religion ====
{{see also|Psychology of religion|}}

There have been some studies of how [[Religion and happiness|religion relates to happiness]]. Causal relationships remain unclear, but more religion is seen in happier people. Consistent with PERMA, religion may provide a sense of meaning and connection to something bigger, beyond the self. Religion may also provide community membership and hence relationships. Another component may have to do with ritual.&lt;ref&gt;2009 article in Frontiers in Evolutionary Neuroscience{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion and happiness have been studied by a number of researchers, and [[religion]] features many elements addressing the components of happiness, as identified by [[positive psychology]]. Its association with happiness is facilitated in part by the social connections of organized religion,&lt;ref name=Routledge2012&gt;{{cite web | title = Are Religious People Happier Than Non-religious People?

There are a number of mechanisms through which religion may make a person happier, including social contact and support that result from religious pursuits, the mental activity that comes with optimism and volunteering, learned coping strategies that enhance one's ability to deal with stress, and psychological factors such as "reason for being." It may also be that religious people engage in behaviors related to good health, such as less [[substance abuse]], since the use of psychotropic substances is sometimes considered abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baetz M, Toews J | title = Clinical implications of research on religion, spirituality, and mental health | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry.

The ''[[Handbook of Religion and Health]]'' describes a survey by Feigelman (1992) that examined happiness in Americans who have given up religion, in which it was found that there was little relationship between religious disaffiliation and unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig. Harold G., Larson, David B., and Mcculloug, Michael E. – ''[[Handbook of Religion and Health]]'' (see [[Handbook of Religion and Health|article]]), p. 122, Oxford University Press (2001), {{ISBN|0-8133-6719-0}}&lt;br /&gt;Feigelman et al. (1992) examined happiness in Americans who have given up religion. Using pooled data from the General Social Surveys conducted between 1972 and 1990, investigators identified more than 20,000 adults for their study. Subjects of particular interest were “disaffiliates”—those who were affiliated with a religion at age 16 but who were not affiliated at the time of the survey (disaffiliates comprised from 4.4% to 6.0% of respondents per year during the 18 years of surveys). “Actives” were defined as persons who reported a religious affiliation at age 16 and a religious affiliation at the time of the survey (these ranged from 84.7% to 79.5% of respondents per year between 1972 and 1990). Happiness was measured by a single question that assessed general happiness (very happy, pretty happy, not too happy). When disaffiliates (n = 1,420) were compared with actives (n = 21,052), 23.9% of disaffiliates indicated they were “very happy, ” as did 34.2% of actives. When the analysis was stratified by marital status, the likelihood of being very happy was about 25% lower (i.e., 10% difference) for married religious disaffiliates compared with married actives. Multiple regression analysis revealed that religious disaffiliation explained only 2% of the variance in overall happiness, after marital status and other covariates were controlled. Investigators concluded that there was little relationship between religious disaffiliation and unhappiness (quality rating 7)&lt;/ref&gt; A survey by Kosmin &amp; Lachman (1993), also cited in this handbook, indicates that people with no religious affiliation appear to be at greater risk for depressive symptoms than those affiliated with a religion.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig. Harold G., Larson, David B., and Mcculloug, Michael E. – ''[[Handbook of Religion and Health]]''(see [[Handbook of Religion and Health|article]]), p. 111, Oxford University Press (2001)&lt;br /&gt;Currently, approximately 8% of the U.S. population claim no religious affiliation (Kosmin &amp; Lachman, 1993). People with no affiliation appear to be at greater risk for depressive symptoms than those affiliated with a religion. In a sample of 850 medically ill men, Koenig, Cohen, Blazer, Pieper, et al. (1992) examined whether religious affiliation predicted depression after demographics, medical status, and a measure of religious coping were controlled. They found that, when relevant covariates were controlled, men who indicated that they had "no religious affiliation" had higher scores on the [[Hamilton Depression Rating Scale]] (an observer-administered rating scale) than did men who identified themselves as moderate Protestants, Catholics, or nontraditional Christians.&lt;/ref&gt; A review of studies by 147 independent investigators found, "the correlation between religiousness and depressive symptoms was -.096, indicating that greater religiousness is mildly associated with fewer symptoms."&lt;ref name=PsyB129 /&gt;

The [[Legatum Prosperity Index]] reflects the repeated finding of research on the science of happiness that there is a positive link between religious engagement and well-being: people who report that God is very important in their lives are on average more satisfied with their lives, after accounting for their income, age and other individual characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;The 2008 Legatum Prosperity Index, Summary p. 40.&lt;br&gt; Research suggests that religious people's happiness is less vulnerable to fluctuations in economic and political uncertainty, personal unemployment and income changes. The Prosperity Index identifies similar effects at the country level, with a number of highly religious countries reporting higher levels of happiness than might be expected based on the standard of living alone: this effect is most pronounced in Mexico, El Salvador, the Dominican republic, Indonesia, Venezuela and Nigeria.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys by [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], the [[National Opinion Research Centre]] and the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Organisation]] conclude that spiritually committed people are twice as likely to report being "very happy" than the least religiously committed people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Is Religion Dangerous?]]p156, citing [[David Myers (academic)|David Myers]] ''The Science of Subjective Well-Being'' Guilford Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of over 200 social studies contends that "high religiousness predicts a lower risk of depression and drug abuse and fewer suicide attempts, and more reports of satisfaction with sex life and a sense of well-being.
However, the links between religion and happiness are always very broad in nature, highly reliant on scripture and small sample number. To that extent there is a much larger connection between religion and suffering (Lincoln 1034)."&lt;ref name=PsyB129&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith TB, McCullough ME, Poll J | title = Religiousness and depression: evidence for a main effect and the moderating influence of stressful life events | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 129 | issue = 4 | pages = 614–36 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12848223 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.129.4.614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And a review of 498 studies published in peer-reviewed journals concluded that a large majority of them showed a positive correlation between religious commitment and higher levels of perceived well-being and self-esteem and lower levels of [[hypertension]], depression, and clinical delinquency.&lt;ref&gt;[[Is Religion Dangerous?]] cites similar results from the''Handbook of Religion and Mental Health'' [[Harold Koenig]] (ed.) {{ISBN|978-0-12-417645-4}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of 34 recent studies published between 1990 and 2001 found that religiosity has a salutary relationship with psychological adjustment, being related to less psychological distress, more life satisfaction, and better [[self-actualization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hackney |first1=Charles H. |last2=Sanders |first2=Glenn S. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Religiosity and Mental Health: A Meta-Analysis of Recent Studies |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |volume=42 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=43–55 |doi=10.1111/1468-5906.t01-1-00160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a recent systematic review of 850 research papers on the topic concluded that "the majority of well-conducted studies found that higher levels of religious involvement are positively associated with indicators of psychological well-being (life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and higher morale) and with less depression, suicidal thoughts and behaviour, drug/alcohol use/abuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moreira-Almeida A, Neto FL, Koenig HG | title = Religiousness and mental health: a review | journal = Revista Brasileira De Psiquiatria | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 242–50 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16924349 | doi = 10.1590/S1516-44462006005000006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there remains strong disagreement among scholars about whether the effects of religious observance, particularly attending church or otherwise belonging to religious groups, is due to the spiritual or the social aspects—i.e. those who attend church or belong to similar religious organizations may well be receiving only the effects of the social connections involved. While these benefits are real enough, they may thus be the same one would gain by joining other, secular groups, clubs, or similar organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert D. Putnam]] makes this argument in his book (with David Campell) ''American Grace'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2012).{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religiousness has often been found to correlate with positive health attributes. People who are more religious show better emotional well-being and lower rates of delinquency, alcoholism, drug abuse, and other social problems.&lt;ref name = "Donahue_1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Donahue MJ, Benson PL | year = 1995 | title = Religion and the well-being of adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 51 | issue = 2| pages = 145–160 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1995.tb01328.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six separate factors are cited as evidence for religion's effect on well-being: religion (1) provides social support, (2) supports healthy lifestyles, (3) promotes personality integration, (4) promotes generativity and altruism, (5) provides unique coping strategies, and (6) provides a sense of meaning and purpose.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Emmons, R. A. (1999) ''The psychology of ultimate concerns: Motivation and spirituality in personality.'' New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious individuals experience emotions that create positive connections among people and allow them to express their values and potential. These four emotions are known as "sacred emotions," which are said to be (1) gratitude and appreciation, (2) forgiveness, (3) compassion and empathy, and (4) humility.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Emmons, R. A., (2005). Emotion and Religion. In: Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality. Paloutzian, Raymond F. (Ed), Park, Crystal L.

Social interaction is necessarily a part of the religious experience. Religiosity has been identified to correlate positively with prosocial behavior in trauma patients, and prosocial behavior is furthermore associated with well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2012-03828-001|title = The relation between trauma exposure and prosocial behavior.|last = Frazier|first = Patricia | name-list-format = vanc |date = May 2013|journal = Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has stronger associations with well-being in individuals genetically predisposed towards social sensitivity in environments where religion prioritizes social affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Religion and Well-being The Moderating Role of Culture and the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) Gene|url = http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/42/8/1394|journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|date = 2011-11-01|access-date = 2015-04-12|issn = 0022-0221|pages = 1394–1405|volume = 42|issue = 8|doi = 10.1177/0022022111412526|first = Joni Y.|last = Sasaki|first2 = Heejung S.|last2 = Kim|first3 = Jun|last3 = Xu | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been linked to greater resilience against stress&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://hdl.handle.net/1805/14103|title = Religiosity and Spirituality as Resiliency Resources: Moderation, Mediation, or Moderated Mediation?|last1 = Reuter|first1 = Kirby K.|last2 = Bigatti|first2 = Silvia M. | name-list-format = vanc |date = March 2014|journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|doi = 10.1111/jssr.12081| hdl = 1805/14103|pmid = |volume=53 |pages=56–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as higher measures of self-actualization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graff RW, Ladd CE | title = POI correlates of a religious commitment inventory | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 502–4 | date = October 1971 | pmid = 5115658 | doi = 10.1002/1097-4679(197110)27:4&lt;502::AID-JCLP2270270431&gt;3.0.CO;2-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and success in romantic relationships and parental responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Religion or spirituality has positive impact on romantic/marital relationships, child development, research shows|url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/12/141208105320.htm|access-date = 2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These benefits, while being correlational, may come about as a result of becoming more religiously involved. The benefit of having a secure social group likely plays a key part in religion's positive effects. One form of Christian counseling uses religion through talk therapy and assessments to promote mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/1268720312?accountid=14816|title = Clinical Appraisal of Spirituality: In Search of Rapid Assessment Instruments (RAIs) for Christian Counseling|last = Greggo|first = Stephen P | name-list-format = vanc |date = 2012|journal = Journal of Psychology and Christianity|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, people who were not Buddhist, but were exposed to Buddhist concepts, scored higher on measures of outgroup acceptance and prosociality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Study finds being exposed to Buddhist concepts reduces prejudice and increases prosociality – The Mirror Post|url = http://www.themirrorpost.com/2015/04/study-finds-being-exposed-to-buddhist.html|website = www.themirrorpost.com|accessdate = 2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect was found not only in Western countries, but also in places where Buddhism is prevalent, indicating a general association of Buddhism with acceptance. This finding seems to indicate that merely encountering a religious belief system such as Buddhism may allow some of its effects to be transferred to nonbelievers.

However, many disagree that the benefits the religious experience are due to their beliefs, and some find there to be no conclusive psychological benefits of belief at all. For example, the health benefit that the elderly gain from going to church may in fact be the'' ''reason they are able to go to church; the less healthy cannot leave their homes. Meta analysis has found that find studies purporting the beneficial results of religiosity often fail to fully represent data correctly due to a number of issues such as self-report bias, the use of inappropriate comparison groups, and the presence of criterion contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does religious belief promote prosociality?

Religion has power as a cohesive social force, and whether or not it is always beneficial is debated. Irrespective of a group's beliefs, many find that simply belonging to a tight social group reduces anxiety and mental health problems. In addition, there may be a degree of self-selectivity amongst the religious; the behavioral benefits they display may simply be common aspects of those who choose to or are able to practice religion. As a result, whether or not religion can be prescribed scientifically as a means of self-betterment is unclear.

==== Spirituality ====
While religion is often formalised and community-oriented, [[spirituality]] tends to be individually based and not as formalised. In a 2014 study, 320 children, ages 8–12, in both public and private schools, were given a Spiritual Well-Being Questionnaire assessing the correlation between spirituality and happiness. Spirituality – and not religious practices (praying, attending church services) – correlated positively with the child's happiness; the more spiritual the child was, the happier the child was. Spirituality accounted for about 3–26% of the variance in happiness.&lt;ref name = "Holder_2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holder |first1=Mark D. |last2=Coleman |first2=Ben |last3=Wallace |first3=Judi M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Spirituality, Religiousness, and Happiness in Children Aged 8–12 Years |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=11 |issue=2 |year=2008 |pages=131–50 |doi=10.1007/s10902-008-9126-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meditation has been found to lead to high activity in the brain's left prefrontal cortex, which in turn has been found to correlate with happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shontell|first1=Alyson|title=A 69-year-old monk who scientists call the 'world's happiest man' says the secret to being happy takes just 15 minutes a day|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-be-happier-according-to-matthieu-ricard-the-worlds-happiest-man-2016-1|website=Business Insider|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study using the Oxford happiness questionnaire on Brahma Kumaris [[Raja yoga]] meditators showed them having higher happiness than the control group.&lt;ref name=pmid24298493/&gt; [[Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche]] has said that neuro scientists have found that with meditation, an individual's happiness baseline can change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/science-has-proved-that-meditation-can-improve-quality-of-life-buddhist-master/articleshow/58200304.cms|title=Science has proved that meditation can improve quality of life: Buddhist master|work=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people describe themselves as both religious and spiritual, but [[spirituality]] represents just one particular function of religion. Spirituality as related to positive psychology can be defined as "a search for the sacred".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pargament KI | year = 1999 | title = The psychology of religion and spirituality? Yes and no. | url = | journal = International Journal for the Psychology of Religion | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 3–16 | doi=10.1207/s15327582ijpr0901_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is defined as sacred can be related to God, life itself, or almost any other facet of existence. It simply must be viewed as having spiritual implications which are transcendent of the individual.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Snyder, C. R., Lopez, Shane|year=2002|title=Handbook of Positive Psychology|location= New York|publisher= Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual well-being addresses this human need for [[Self-transcendence|transcendence]] and involves social as well as existential well-being. Spiritual [[well-being]] is associated with various positive outcomes such as better physical and psychological well-being, lower anxiety, less depression, [[self-actualization]], positive relationships with parents, higher rates of positive personality traits and acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=James M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Psychology, Religion, and Spirituality|date=2009|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media, LLC|location=New York|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have cautioned to differentiate between correlative and causal associations between spirituality and psychology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schuurmans-Stekhoven | first1 = James | year = 2011 | title = Is it God or just the data that moves in mysterious ways?

Reaching the sacred as a personal goal, also called spiritual striving, has been found to correlate highest with well-being compared to other forms of striving.&lt;ref name=jstor27522349/&gt; This type of striving can improve a sense of self and relationships and creates a connection to the transcendent&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002"/&gt; Additionally, multiple studies have shown that self-reported spirituality is related to lower rates of mortality and depression and higher rates of happiness.&lt;ref name = "Holder_2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fehring RJ, Miller JF, Shaw C | title = Spiritual well-being, religiosity, hope, depression, and other mood states in elderly people coping with cancer | journal = Oncology Nursing Forum | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 663–71 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9159782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strawbridge WJ, Cohen RD, Shema SJ, Kaplan GA | title = Frequent attendance at religious services and mortality over 28 years | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 87 | issue = 6 | pages = 957–61 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9224176 | pmc = 1380930 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.87.6.957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, most research on spirituality examines ways in which spirituality can help in times of crisis. Spirituality has been found to remain constant when experiencing traumatic events and/or life stressors such as accidents, war, sickness, and death of a loved one. When confronted with an obstacle, people might turn to prayer or meditation. [[Coping (psychology)|Coping]] mechanisms involving spirituality include meditative meditation, creating boundaries to preserve the sacred, spiritual purification to return to the righteous path, and spiritual reframing which focuses on maintaining belief. One clinical application of spirituality and positive psychology research is the "psychospiritual intervention," which represents the potential that spirituality has to increase well-being.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002" /&gt; These coping mechanisms that aim to preserve the sacred have been found by researchers to increase well-being and return the individual back to the sacred.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002"/&gt;

Overall, spirituality is a process that occurs over a lifetime and includes searching, conserving, and redefining what is sacred in an extremely individualized manner. It does not always have a positive effect and in fact has been associated with very negative events and life changes. Research is lacking in spirituality but it is necessary because spirituality can assist in enhancing the experiences of the uncontrollable parts of life.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Other factors ==

=== Modernity ===
Much research has pointed at the rising rates of depression, leading people to speculate that modernization may be a factor in the growing percentage of depressed people. One study found that women in urban America were much more likely to experience depression than those in rural Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Colla J, Buka S, Harrington D, Murphy JM | title = Depression and modernization: a cross-cultural study of women | journal = Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology | volume = 41 | issue = 4 | pages = 271–9 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16520885 | doi = 10.1007/s00127-006-0032-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found a positive correlation between a country's GDP per capita, as quantitative measure of modernization, and lifetime risk of a mood disorder trended toward significance (p=0.06).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hidaka BH | title = Depression as a disease of modernity: explanations for increasing prevalence | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 140 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–14 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22244375 | pmc = 3330161 | doi = 10.1016/j.jad.2011.12.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people believe it is the increased number of pressures and expectations, increased isolation, increased individualism, and increased inactivity that contribute to higher rates of depression in modern societies.

=== Weather ===
Some evidence suggests sunnier climates do not predict happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lucas RE, Lawless NM | title = Does life seem better on a sunny day? Examining the association between daily weather conditions and life satisfaction judgments | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 104 | issue = 5 | pages = 872–84 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23607534 | pmc = 3695376 | doi = 10.1037/a0032124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study both Californians and Midwesterners expected the former's happiness ratings to be higher due to a sunnier environment. In fact, the Californian and Midwestern happiness ratings did not show a significant difference.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schkade|first1=David A.|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel | name-list-format = vanc |title=Does Living in California Make People Happy?

That is not to say weather is never a factor for happiness. Perhaps the changing norms of sunlight cause [[seasonal affective disorder]], which undermines level of happiness.

== Additional future research ==
Positive psychology research and practice is currently conducted and developed in various countries throughout the world. To illustrate, in Canada, Charles Hackney of Briercrest College applies positive psychology to the topic of personal growth through martial arts training; [[Paul T. P. Wong|Paul Wong]], president of the International Network on Personal Meaning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meaning.ca/ |title=International Network on Personal Meaning and Meaning of Life |publisher=Meaning.ca |date=1999-03-15 |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is developing an existential approach to positive psychology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wong PT | year = 2009 | chapter = Existential positive psychology | veditors = Lopez SJ | title = Encyclopedia of positive psychology | volume = 1 | pages = 361–368 | location = Oxford, UK | publisher = Wiley Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wong PT, Ivtzan I, Lomas T | year = 2016 | chapter = Good work: A meaning-centred approach | veditors = Oades LG, Steger MF, Fave AD, Passmore J | title = The Wiley Blackwell handbook of the psychology of positivity and strengths-based approaches at work | location = West Sussex, UK | publisher = Wiley Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is framed in the [[second wave positive psychology]] (PP 2.0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong PT | year = 2011 | title = Positive psychology 2.0: Towards a balanced interactive model of the good life | url = | journal = Canadian Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 69–81 | doi = 10.1037/a002251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ivtzan I, Lomas T, Hefferon K, Worth P | year = 2015 | title = Second wave positive psychology: Embracing the dark side of life. | location = London, UK | publisher = Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Mention MAPP program in England, school based on positive psychology in Australia, etc.--&gt;

The research program ‘Understanding Positive Emotions’ at Human Science Lab, [[London]], investigates how material [[well-being]] and [[perceptual]] well-being work as relative determinants in conditioning our [[mind]] for positive emotions.&lt;ref name="Understanding Positive Emotions"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk| title=Understanding Positive Emotions |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive and behavioral change, although sometimes slight and complex, can produce an 'intense affect'.

Isen (2009) remarked that further progress requires suitable research methods, and appropriate theories on which to base contemporary research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Isen AM |year=2009|contribution=Positive Affect as a Source of Human Strength| veditors = Snyder CR, Lopez SJ |title=Handbook of positive psychology|pages=179–195|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang (2008) suggested that researchers have a number of paths to pursue regarding the enhancement of emotional intelligence, even though emotional intelligence does not guarantee the development of positive affect; in short, more study is required to track the gradient of positive affect in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Chang KB | year=2008|chapter=Can We Improve Emotional Intelligence|title=Emotional Intelligence; Perspectives on Educational and Positive Psychology|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing Inc.|location= New York|pages=25–45|isbn=9781433101960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilfred Cantwell Smith''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} (July 21, 1916 &amp;ndash; February 7, 2000) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] professor of [[comparative religion]] who from 1964&amp;ndash;1973 was director of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Center for the Study of World Religions]]. The ''Harvard Gazette'' said he was one of the field's most influential figures of the past century.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/11.29/27-memorialminute.html|title=Wilfred Cantwell Smith: In Memoriam|work=Harvard University Gazette|accessdate=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1962 work ''The Meaning and End of Religion'' he notably and controversially questioned the validity of the concept of [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W.C. (1962) ''The Meaning and End of Religion''. First Fortress Press Edition 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Smith was born in [[Toronto]] to parents Victor Arnold Smith and Sarah Cory Cantwell. He was the younger brother of [[Arnold Smith]] and the father of [[Brian Cantwell Smith]].

He received a [[B.A]]. with honours in [[Languages of Asia|oriental languages]] in 1938 from the [[University of Toronto]]. After his thesis was rejected by [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], supposedly for its [[Marxist]] critique of the [[British Raj]], he and his wife Muriel Mackenzie Struthers spent seven years in Pre-Independence [[India]] (1940–1946), during which he taught [[Indian history|Indian]] and [[Islamic history]] at [[Forman Christian College]] in [[Lahore]].

In 1948 he obtained a [[Ph.D]] in oriental languages at [[Princeton University]], after which he taught at [[McGill University|McGill]], founding in 1952 the university's [[McGill University Institute of Islamic Studies|Institute of Islamic Studies]]. From 1964 to 1973 Smith taught at [[Harvard Divinity School]]. He left Harvard for [[Dalhousie University]] in [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, NS]], where he founded the Department of Religion. He was also among the original Editorial Advisors of the scholarly journal ''[[Dionysius (journal)|Dionysius]]''. In 1978 he returned to Harvard. In 1979 he received an honorary doctorate from [[Concordia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.concordia.ca/smith-w|title=Honorary Degree Citation - Wilfred Cantwell Smith* {{!}} Concordia University Archives|website=archives.concordia.ca|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement from teaching, he was appointed a senior research associate in the Faculty of Divinity at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]], University of Toronto, in 1985. He died on February 7, 2000.&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;

==Views on religion==
In his best known and most controversial work, Smith contends that the [[concept]] of religion, rather than being a universally valid category as is generally supposed, is a peculiarly [[Europe]]an [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] of recent origin.  Religion, he argues, is a static concept that does not adequately address the complexity and flux of religious lives. Instead of the concept of religion, Smith proffers a new conceptual apparatus: the dynamic dialectic between ''cumulative tradition'' (all historically observable rituals, art, music, theologies, etc.) and ''personal faith''. (p.&amp;nbsp;194)

Smith sets out chapter by chapter to demonstrate that none of the founders or followers of the world's major religions had any understanding that they were engaging in a defined system called religion. The major exception to this rule, Cantwell Smith points out, is [[Islam]] which he describes as the most "entity like"' (p.&amp;nbsp;85). In a chapter titled ''The special case of Islam'', Smith points out that the term Islam appears in the [[Qur'an]], making it the only religion not named in opposition to or by another tradition. (p.&amp;nbsp;80). Other than the prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], only the prophet [[Muhammad]] was conscious of the establishment of a religion.  (p.&amp;nbsp;106). Smith points out that the [[Arabic]] language does not have a word for religion, strictly speaking: he details how the word ''din'', customarily translated as such, differs in significant important respects from the European concept.

The terms for major world religions today, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism, did not exist until the 19th century.  Smith suggests that practitioners of any given faith do not historically come to regard what they do as ''religion'' until they have developed a degree of cultural self-regard, causing them to see their collective spiritual practices and beliefs as in some way significantly ''different'' from the ''other''. Religion in the contemporary sense of the word is for Smith the product of both [[identity politics]] and [[apologetics]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One's own 'religion' may be piety and faith, obedience, worship, and a vision of God. An alien 'religion' is a system of beliefs or rituals, an abstract and impersonal pattern of observables. A dialectic ensues, however. If one's own 'religion' is attacked, by unbelievers who necessarily conceptualize it schematically, or all religion is, by the indifferent, one tends to leap to the defence of what is attacked, so that presently participants of a faith - especially those most involved in argument - are using the term in the same externalist and theoretical sense as their opponents. Religion as a systematic entity, as it emerged in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, is a concept of polemics and apologetics" (p. 43).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By way of an [[etymology|etymological]] study of ''religion'' (''religio'', in [[Latin]]), Smith further contends that the term, which at first and for most of the centuries denoted an attitude towards a relationship between [[God]] and ''man'' (p.&amp;nbsp;26), has through conceptual slippage come to mean a "system of observances or beliefs" (p.&amp;nbsp;29), a historical tradition which has been institutionalized through a process of [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]].  Whereas ''religio'' denoted personal [[piety]], ''religion'' came to refer to an [[abstract entity]] (or [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] signifier) which, Smith says, does not exist.

He argues that the term as found in [[Lucretius]] and [[Cicero]] was internalized by the [[Catholic Church]] through [[Lactantius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].  During the [[Middle Ages]] it was superseded by the term ''faith'', which Smith favors by contrast. In the [[Renaissance]],  via the Christian [[Platonist]] [[Marsilio Ficino]], ''religio'' becomes popular again, retaining its original emphasis on personal practice, even in [[John Calvin]]'s ''Christianae Religionis Institutio'' (1536). During 17th Century debates between Catholics and [[Protestant]]s, religion begins to refer to an abstract system of beliefs, especially when describing an oppositional structure. Through the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] this concept is further reified, so that by the nineteenth century [[Hegel]] defines religion as ''Begriff'', "a self-subsisting transcendent idea that unfolds itself in dynamic expression in the course of ever-changing history ... something real in itself, a great entity with which man has to reckon, a something that precedes all its historical manifestation" (p.&amp;nbsp;47).

Smith concludes (p.&amp;nbsp;48-9) by arguing that the term religion has now acquired four distinct senses: 
# personal piety (e.g. as meant by the phrase "he is more religious than he was ten years ago");
# an overt system of beliefs, practices and values, related  to a particular community manifesting itself as the ''ideal'' religion that the theologian tries to formulate, but which he knows transcends him (e.g. 'true Christianity');
# an overt system of beliefs, practices and values, related  to a particular community manifesting itself as the ''empirical phenomenon'', historical and sociological (e.g. the Christianity of history);
# a generic summation or universal category, i.e. ''religion in general''.

''The Meaning and End of Religion'' remains Smith's most influential work.
The [[anthropologist]] and writer on religion and [[post-colonial studies]] [[Talal Asad]] has said ''The Meaning and End of Religion'' is a modern classic and a masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talal Asad]] (2001) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3176697 ''Reading a Modern Classic: W.
