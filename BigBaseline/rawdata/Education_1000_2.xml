==Conduct==
The primary aim of this test, which was standardized all over India, was to make medical education available on an equitable basis to all regions of the nation and to foster inter-regional exchange. Until 2006, the AIPMT was unusual as it was one of the few all-India competitive examinations (along with the examinations for the defense services) based completely on merit and without any reservations. However, from 2006, under pressure from the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Human Resources ministry]] headed by Arjun Singh, reservation for OBC has also been introduced in AIPMT.

Every Year AIPMT was conducted on first Sunday in the month of May.
In 2016, AIPMT/NEET Phase-1 was conducted on 1 May 2016 and NEET Phase-2 was conducted on 24 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aipmt.nic.in/aipmt/ShowPdf.aspx?Type=50C9E8D5FC98727B4BBC93CF5D64A68DB647F04F&amp;ID=D435A6CDD786300DFF204EE7C2EF942D3E9034E2 AIPMT 2016 Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

Time Line How AIPMT is Scrapped -

On 2012 - 
The Medical Council of India (MCI) and Dental Council of India (DCI) conducted NEET for the admissions in UG and PG programmes in government and Private colleges in India. This exam is delayed by a year due to several reasons.

On 18 July 2013 -
NEET Exam is scrapped by the Supreme court in favor of 115 petitions. They also announced that private medical colleges should not conduct their own UG and PG exams on the basis of NEET.

Academic Session 2016-17
On 11 April -
The Supreme court decided to hear the Medical Council of India. On 28 April 2016 the court announced that their will only one common entrance test just before the 2 days of AIPMT which is called as NEET Phase 1 exam.

On 18 April - 
In the session on 2016-17 the SC agreed to hold the NEET in 2 phase. Those candidates who did not appear in the phase 1 exam, AIPMT will be considered as phase 2.

On 1 May -
CBSE conducted NEET phase 1 and almost 6 lakhs of the candidates appeared in the exam.

On 25 May -
The SC cleared all the confusions that private colleges would no longer be conducted their separate exam for medical admissions.

On 9 May - 
The SC rejected the plea filed by the state governments and minority institutions to take the separate entrance exam for MBBS and BDS courses for the current year as well.

On 20 May -
The National Defence Agency came out in order to keep state govt. exam out of the field of the common test.

On 23 May -
The Delhi govt finally made the decision to make NEET the only exam for the admission to medical colleges.

On 24 May -
President of India finally signed an order the common medical entrance exam on hold for a year.

==Exam pattern==

===Exam changes===
In 2010, the pattern of AIPMT was changed. The examination was replaced by a two-tier or two-stage test – The AIPMT Prelims and the AIPMT Mains, in which the AIPMT Prelims was used to be objective exam and AIPMT Mains was used to be subjective exam. The candidates who could qualify the AIPMT Prelims were eligible to give the AIPMT Mains test. Finally, those who scored good in the AIPMT Mains were selected for admission based purely on the merit of the candidate in the AIPMT Mains. Admission was done rank-wise

In 2013, the pattern changed again - The two-tier examination was replaced by the [[National Eligibility cum Entrance Test]] (NEET-UG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cbseneet.nic.in/cbseneet/welcome.aspx | title = NEET-UG 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a nationwide test through which admissions were to be done for all seats of MBBS and BDS in all the colleges which were covered by previous exam.

From 2014 onwards, the exam was named AIPMT again, and done for 15% seats only, as was done earlier to [[National Eligibility cum Entrance Test]] (NEET-UG). See current exam pattern below for more details.

===Current exam pattern===
The exam was conducted in a single stage that usually occurred on the first Sunday of May.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://aipmt.nic.in/aipmt/ShowPdf.aspx?Type=50C9E8D5FC98727B4BBC93CF5D64A68DB647F04F&amp;ID=F1ABD670358E036C31296E66B3B66C382AC00812 | title = Information Bulletin AIPMT 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The examination consisted of one paper containing 180 objective type questions from Physics, Chemistry and Biology (Botany &amp; Zoology), having 45 questions from each subject. The exam duration was 3 hours. Each question carried 4 marks. For each incorrect response, one mark used to be deducted from the total score. However, no deduction from the total score was made if no response was indicated for an item. Indication of more than one answer for a question was deemed an incorrect response and negatively marked.

*(c) 27% seats are reserved for non-creamy layer OBC candidates &lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://aipmt.nic.in/aipmt/ShowPdf.aspx?Type=50C9E8D5FC98727B4BBC93CF5D64A68DB647F04F&amp;ID=F1ABD670358E036C31296E66B3B66C382AC00812 | title = Information Bulletin AIPMT 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

AIPMT is criticized for being conducted only in [[English language|English]] and [[Hindi]], making it harder for students where vernacular languages such as [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]] or [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] are more prominent. As an example, in September 2011, the [[Gujarat High Court]] acted on [[Public Interest Litigation]] by the [[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]] for conducting the exams in Gujarati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-20/ahmedabad/30179701_1_regional-languages-entrance-tests-raghuveer-chaudhary |title=Sahitya Parishad demands entrance tests in Gujarati |work=The Times of India |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second petition was made in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-21/ahmedabad/30306229_1_entrance-tests-regional-language-gujarati-language |title=Another PIL seeks entrance tests in Gujarati |work=The Times of India |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== AIPMT 2015, 2016 : The banning of scarfs' controversy ==
The AIPMT in 2015 had listed scarfs in banned items' list, creating controversy and outrage especially in the state of Kerala, where in a nun was refused to appear for the test as she refused to remove her headgear. This comes after the Supreme Court upheld the CBSE's banning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/aipmt-supreme-court-refuses-to-allow-hijab-in-test/|title=SC to PMT students: Faith won’t disappear if you don’t wear scarf (hijab) one day|date=2015-07-25|website=The Indian Express|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kerala HC had permitted two Muslim girls to wear a headscarf and a full-sleeve dress on the condition that they be frisked had the invigilator deemed necessary. However, in the case of Sister Seba, the official had disallowed even while she  ready for any frisking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/cbse-wont-relax-pmt-dress-code-kerala-nun-barred-from-writing-test-after-refusing-to-take-off-scarf-2362808.html|title=CBSE won't relax PMT dress code: Kerala nun barred from writing test after she refuses to take off scarf - Firstpost|website=Firstpost|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIPMT kept the same norm in its 2016 instructions, sparking protests by the [[Campus Front of India]] in front of the CBSE office in Kerala on 13 April. The subsequent protest led to the detention of several girl protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.siasat.com/news/muslim-students-fight-dress-code-946026/|title=Muslim students fight against dress code - The Siasat Daily|website=The Siasat Daily|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus CBSE challenged a Kerala High Court single bench order and granted permission to Muslim girls to wear the Hijab for All India Pre-Medical Test 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBSE challenges Kerala HC order on HIijab for All India Pre Medical Test|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/cbse-kerala-hc-hijab-aipmet-2755060.html|website=First post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Muhammed Mushtaq had permitted all candidates who want to wear headscarf and full sleeved length dress to appear for the examination but on a condition that they would be present at the hall half an hour before the exam for frisking, if necessary by women invigilators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBSE challenges Kerala HC order on hijab for All India Pre Medical Test|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/cbse-kerala-hc-hijab-aipmet-2755060.html|website=First post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order was issued while hearing a petition for changing the dress code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/cbse-kerala-hc-hijab-aipmet-2755060.html|website=first post| title = CBSE challenges kerala HC orde on hijab for AIPT | date = 2016-04-28 |access-date = 2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AIPMT 2015 paper leak==
In AIPMT 2015 (3 May 2015), Haryana (Rohtak) police caught four people, including two dentists and an MBBS student, from Rohtak for allegedly passing on answer keys of AIPMT 2015 Exam to candidates during the exam, using [[vests]] with SIM card units and Bluetooth enabled earpieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studplex.com/aipmt-retest-court-case |title=AIPMT 2015 Court Case|work=StudPlex}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CBSE, the Examination results were earlier scheduled to be declared on 5 June 2015, but due to Supreme Court's stay order on declaration, the results were not announced.  The Supreme Court had asked Haryana Police to investigate the matter and identify the beneficiaries as soon as possible.  Approximately 6.3 [[lakh]] students had appeared for the examination which was conducted on 3 May 2015.  Later, the results were rescheduled to be declared on June 12, 2015.  On 15 June 2015 the Supreme Court asked CBSE to re-conduct the AIPMT 2015 Exam within 4 weeks (by 12 July 2015).  After a hearing on the pleas of CBSE, Supreme Court had decided to re-conduct exam on 25 July 2015.  The exam was conducted safely and successfully across the country on the scheduled date (25 July 2015).  The result of Re-AIPMT was declared on 17 August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/cbse-re-conducts-all-india-pre-medical-test-successfully-1200555 AIPMT re test conducted successfully]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Curriculum''' is a [[national curriculum]] for all primary and secondary schools in [[Australia]] under progressive development, review, and implementation. The curriculum is developed and reviewed by the [[Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority]], an independent statutory body. Since 2014 all [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]] in Australia have begun implementing aspects of the Foundation to Year 10 part of the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority [http://www.acara.edu.au/_resources/ACARA_infographic.pdf infographic]&lt;/ref&gt;

Credentialing, and related assessment requirements and processes, remain the responsibility of states and territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently asked questions|url=http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/australian-curriculum/faq.html#affect-assessment-credentialling|publisher=www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A nationwide curriculum has been on the political agenda in [[Australia]] for several decades. In the late 1980s a significant push for a [[national curriculum]] in Australia was mounted by the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] Federal Labor government. Draft documentation was produced but failure to achieve agreement from the mainly [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] State governments led to the abandonment of this initiative in 1991.

In 2006, then Liberal Prime Minister [[John Howard]] called for a "root and branch renewal" of Australian history teaching at school level, ostensibly in response to building criticism of Australian students' (and Australians more widely) perceived lack of awareness of historical events.  The Howard government convened the Australian History Summit in August 2006 to commence the process of drafting a national History curriculum.  The Summit recommended that Australian History be a compulsory part of the curriculum in all Australian schools in years 9 and 10.  The Australian History External Reference Group was then commissioned by the government to develop a ''Guide to Teaching Australian History in Years 9 and 10''.  The Reference Group comprised [[Geoffrey Blainey]], [[Gerard Henderson]], [[Nicholas Brown (historian)|Nicholas Brown]] and [[Elizabeth Ward (historian)|Elizabeth Ward]], and was presented with a draft proposal prepared earlier by the historian [[Tony Taylor (historian)|Tony Taylor]].  The ''Guide'' was released to the public on 11 October 2007, but little was achieved toward its implementation following the Howard government's defeat at the federal election in November 2007. The current Labor initiated National History Curriculum remains politically contentious.

In April 2008, the Rudd Government established the independent [[National Curriculum Board (Australia)|National Curriculum Board]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deewr.gov.au/Ministers/Gillard/Media/Releases/Pages/Article_081107_114135.aspx Minister for Education: Media release: Delivering Australia's First National Curriculum, 12 October 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Taylor, who had written the original draft for the Howard government-appointed Australian History External Reference Group, told ''[[The Age]]'' that he expected that the Reference Group's ''Guide to Teaching Australian History'' would be discarded by the new Board.  Taylor had expressed public disapproval of the changes made to his original draft, both by the Reference Group and, Taylor suspected, by Howard himself.  Taylor was of the opinion that the ''Guide'' had sought to establish a curriculum that was "too close to a nationalist view of Australia's past", and hoped that the new Board would produce a curriculum that was more in line with what Taylor saw as Rudd's "regional and global world view".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rudd to scrap Howard's history|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2008/01/09/1199554741706.html|publisher=www.theage.com.au|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, the Board appointed four academics to draft "framing documents" which would establish a broad direction for the National Curriculum in each of four subject areas: History ([[Stuart Macintyre]]), English ([[Peter Freebody]]), Science ([[Denis Goodrum]]) and Mathematics ([[Peter Sullivan (pedagogue)|Peter Sullivan]]). In May 2009 the [[Statutory authority|statutory]] Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) was established to oversee the implementation of the planned nationwide curriculum initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deewr.gov.au/Ministers/Gillard/Media/Releases/Pages/Article_090603_143742.aspx Minister for Education: Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority: Joint Media Release with the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment Training and Youth Affairs, 3 June 2009] In March 2010 a draft national curriculum was released.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation issues and criticism==

The Australian Curriculum has experienced implementation issues due to reluctance or slowness by some States in changing state curricula. New South Wales in particular has delayed its roll out of the new curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education: NSW goes slow on primary curriculum as Commonwealth chalks up changes|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/education-nsw-goes-slow-on-primary-curriculum-as-commonwealth-chalks-up-changes-20150920-gjqpd1.html|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Anna Patty, an education editor for the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', criticised the Australian Curriculum on the basis that it "threatens to water down the content" for senior students, compared with the existing Higher School Certificate. Under the new curriculum, students would have to learn statistics in mathematics, while the Extension 1 and 2 topics would be replaced with an easier specialist maths course.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=National curriculum content not up to scratch: critics|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/national-curriculum-content-not-up-to-scratch-critics-20100514-v4gt.html|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patty said that the English courses would focus more on language and literacy, and less on literature, and that the curriculum would disadvantage gifted students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In September 2010, the NSW Board of Studies criticised the then draft Australian Curriculum, saying that it was inferior to the NSW curriculum.  Among other criticisms, the Board said that the draft K-10 curriculum lacked an overarching framework, was overcrowded with content, diminished the teaching of literature, and that the maths curriculum failed to cater to the full range of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/new-curriculum-slammed-by-studies-board-20100912-156ze.html|title=New curriculum slammed by studies board|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, Peter Brown, a mathematics lecturer of the [[University of New South Wales]], criticised the Australian Curriculum for lack of flexibility within the Year 9-10 and the Year 11-12 syllabuses by the removal of extension maths courses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/letters/no-water-to-throw-on-heated-debate-20101015-16nlj|title=No water to throw on heated debate|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown also said that the National Curriculum would "dumb down" the year 12 curriculum then offered in NSW.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In October 2013, conservative economist [[Judith Sloan]] criticised the business and economics components of the Australian Curriculum in particular, and offered the general criticism that "[t]he real rationale for a national school curriculum relates to the pursuit of centralised control by the federal government and the scope to impose fashionable values dressed up as the pursuit of educational excellence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='National curriculum mired in half-baked fads'|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/national-curriculum-mired-in-half-baked-fads/news-story/4dea704318ad475c218038da10e67178|website=The Australian|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bachelor of Integrated Studies''' ('''BIS''') is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] [[bachelor's degree]] offered by several universities in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It allows students to design a customized and specific course of study to best suit their educational and professional objectives. Generally, this degree is sponsored by two or more [[Academic department|departments]] within the university. Schools which confer the degree include the [[University of North Texas]], [[Northern Kentucky University]], [[Utah Valley University]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uvu.edu/is/ Integrated Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miami University in Ohio]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://miamioh.edu/regionals/academics/departments/ics/academics/majors/integrative-studies/index.html Bachelor of Integrative Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pittsburg State University]], [[George Mason University]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://integrative.gmu.edu/ School of Integrative Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weber State University]], [[Washburn University]], [[Ferris State University]], [[Jacksonville State University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsu.edu/degreelist.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kennesaw State University]], [[Oakland University]], [[Nevada State College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsc.nevada.edu/888.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312010520/http://nsc.nevada.edu/888.asp|title=Integrated Studies - Your Degree, Your Way.|archivedate=12 March 2012|deadurl=yes|publisher=Nevada State College|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dixie State University]], and the [[University of New Brunswick]], [[Florida Gulf Coast University]], among others. 

According to materials issued by Weber State University:&lt;blockquote&gt;The program best suits students who have developed a sense of their educational and life goals, and who are looking for ways to express those goals through a self-designed and self-directed university program. The BIS Program serves the needs of students who want to individualize or create a unique academic program; students who want to obtain a broad [[liberal education]]; and/or students who want to prepare for specific career goals and/or [[graduate school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weber.edu/BIS/program.html|title=Weber State University BIS Program|author=|date=|website=weber.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14178">A '''behavioral cusp''' is any [[behavior]] change that brings an organism's behavior into contact with new contingencies that have far-reaching consequences.&lt;ref name="rosales97"/&gt; A behavioral cusp is a special type of behavior change because it provides the learner with opportunities to access new reinforcers, new contingencies, new environments, new related behaviors (generativeness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alessi | first1 = G. | year = 1987 | title = Generative strategies and teaching for generalization | url = | journal = The Analysis of Verbal Behavior | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 15–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and competition with archaic or problem behaviors. It affects the people around the learner, and these people agree to the behavior change and support its development after the intervention is removed.

The concept has far reaching implications for every individual, and for the field of developmental psychology, because it provides a behavioral alternative to the concept of [[Developmental psychology|maturation]] and change due to the simple passage of time, such as [[developmental milestones]]. The cusp is a behavior change that presents special features when compared to other behavior changes.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==History==
The concept was first proposed{{when|date=August 2014}} by [[Sidney W. Bijou]], an American developmental psychologist.&lt;ref&gt;Bosch, S. and Hixson, M.D. (2004). The Final Piece to a Complete Science of Behavior: Behavior Development and Behavioral Cusps. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 5 (3), 244–253 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the cusp was to link behavioral principles to rapid spurts in development (see [[Behavior analysis of child development]]).

A behavioral cusp as conceptualized by Jesus Rosales-Ruiz &amp; [[Donald M. Baer|Donald Baer]] in 1997 is an important behavior change that affects future behavior changes.&lt;ref name="rosales97"&gt;{{citation |last= Rosales-Ruiz |first=J. |last2=Baer |first2=D.M. |year=1997 |chapter=Behavioral cusps: a developmental and pragmatic concept for behavior analysis |title=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=30 |pages= 533–544 |pmc=1284066 |pmid=9316263 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1997.30-533}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavioral cusp, like the [[reinforcer]], is apprehended by its effects. Whereas a reinforcer acts on a single response or a group of related responses, the effects of a behavioral cusp regulate a large number of responses in a more distant future.

The concept has been compared to a [[developmental milestone]], however, not all cusps are milestones. For example, learning to play soccer is not a milestone, but it was life-changing for [[Pelé]]. As a result of learning to kick grapefruits (the initial important change or cusp), Pelé accessed (1) new environments, (2) new reinforcers, (3) new soccer moves, (4) dropped competing behaviors (smoking), and (5) gained international acclaims for his skill. Soccer is not a [[developmental milestone]] because it is not a necessary skill in most environments.

==Properties==
The following properties are special features of a behavioral change that lead to more change, and an increased likelihood of social adaptation, independence, and [[cultural fitness]].

===New reinforcers===
New reinforcers are accessible and enrich the perspective of the learner. Additionally these reinforcers may lead to an increase in the variety of behaviors. If the reinforcers are promoting health and social behaviors, they will lead to an improved quality of life.

====Case example====
A child who learns to open a door may access the swing for the first time and learns to use the swing.&lt;ref name="rosales97"/&gt; Here, the new skill (swinging motion is the reinforcer) may lead to more complex and social activities such as (1) turn taking, (2) asking someone to share the swing, (3) taking turns pushing someone, which in turn (4) may provide more social opportunities to speak and (5) interact with the play partners, etc.

====Case non-example====
A child learns to open a door and walks outside. He finds some ants behind a shrubbery and watches the ants. His parents are looking for him, they get worried and are calling him. The child is unusually mesmerized by columns of ants on the ground and does not hear the calls. His parents find him shortly after, but they are frantic from their 5-minute search and accidentally scare him from going outside. In this non-example, learning to open doors that lead outside resulted in consequences that did not directly benefit the child and maybe decrease important skills related to exploration and search. In this case, no new reinforcers were contacted and learning to open the backyard door (that has a special latch) was effectively a waste of time because the child's parents don't usually approve being alone in the backyard.

===New contingencies of reinforcement===
New contingencies are responsible for the selection of novel and more [[adaptive behaviors]] while decreasing problematic or archaic behaviors. Contingencies of reinforcement (before&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;R&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Reinforcer) produce and maintain each and every learned behavior. New contingencies establish the control of new stimuli over our behaviors, and therefore make us more sensitive and aware of our surrounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Selection by Consequences |url=http://www.bfsr.org/element1.html |publisher=Walden Fellowship, Inc. |year=1999 |accessdate=23 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716171113/http://www.bfsr.org/element1.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

===New environments===
New environments are geographical and/or virtual areas of potential change (receiving environments). New environments regulate, maintain, and set the micro-cultural boundaries for reinforcers (and punishers), and their antecedents. They include tools and stakeholders controlling the pace and content of instruction and, as a result, they regulate boundary of what the learner learns (e.g., school curriculum). New environments must contain some of the stakeholders' preferences and reinforcers to create lasting [[positive reinforcement]] practices for the learner.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

===Generativeness===
Generativeness describes the ability of the receiving environment to regulate novel responses, functions, values or response products derived from the original cusp response. For a behavior, it is the ability to recombine or merge into more complex units, or the ability to contact environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosch | first1 = S. | last2 = Fuqua | first2 = R.W. | year = 2001 | title = Behavioral cusps: a model for selecting target behaviors | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 123–125 | doi=10.1901/jaba.2001.34-123| pmc = 1284293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case example====
{{NPOV|reason=Seems partisan in favor of the pro-phonics camp|date=July 2015}}
A child learns [[phonetic reading]] and can recombine the 50 or so English phonemes into 50,000 words by recombining the individual sounds he has learned to read. The generative index for this act of learning the basic English phonemes is approximately 10,000 (where one new behavior results in a potential 10,000 applications).

====Case non-example====
{{NPOV|reason=Seems partisan in favor of the pro-phonics camp|date=July 2015}}
A child learns [[Look-say|sight reading]] for 50 words. When a new word is presented, the child learns by listening to a teacher and memorizes the words rather than using what he has previously learned, thus becoming able to read only 50 words using this method. Additionally, he is now dependent on someone for learning each new vocabulary word.

===Competition with archaic behaviors===
Behavior competition is the ability of cusp behaviors to displace previously established behaviors on a continuum of intensity and rate, across repertoires, and environments. Competing archaic behaviors occur on a corresponding continuum of severity.

===Effect on stakeholders===
Effect on others comes from the learner's behavior affecting the stakeholders who control reinforcers and punishers in a specific environment. It is important to identify these stakeholders' motivations and reinforcers in selecting potential cusps. Effect refers to the changes in values and behaviors of the stakeholder resulting from a cusp in the learner. The initial and gradually more complex behaviors that constituted the entry point for an important behavior change that, once initiated, so profoundly alters, displaces, or transforms one's behavioral repertoire that it renders preexisting behavioral repertoires obsolete. A behavioral cusp is an important behavior change that alters the probability of the learner's future repertoires and interactions with stakeholders' repertoires.

===Social validity===
[[Social validity]] is an indicator of social acceptability of a behavior and its consequences for the stakeholders representing the communities which the learner is accessing or will access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = I. | last2 = Baer | first2 = D. | year = 1991 | title = Social validity Assessment: Is current practice state of the art? | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 189–204 | doi=10.1901/jaba.1991.24-189| pmc = 1279564 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some seemingly insignificant changes in a stakeholder may dramatically affect the learner. All stakeholders (e.g., government officials, teachers, parents, and other interventionists) should agree to the goals, methods, and tools for the intervention and the norms from the local community suggest the boundaries of what should be learned.

==Applications==

===Life span/development guidelines===
The behavioral cusp has implications for the selection and sequencing of skills during the life span. While milestones are mainly concerned with the chronology of behaviors, the concept of behavioral cusp is concerned with the fitness of the behavior within a context or a [[receiving environment]]. As Rosales-Ruiz and Baer (1997) stated, "One child's cusp may be another child's waste of time." Thus, there is a great need for empirically-based guidelines in making decisions related to the initial selection of skills.

===Prediction and control of development over longer periods of time===
The applications of the concepts are related to the prediction, selection, and retention of successful and adaptive behaviors to the treatment of [[childhood autism]], [[Down syndrome]], and other [[developmental disabilities]] is humane and based on evidence from the field of [[behavior analysis]]. The first applications of the concept derive from a set of guidelines proposed by Bosch and Fuqua in ''The [[Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis]]''.

===Development of new technology===
A new technology and methodology, necessary to measure the effects of a small change over time, will reveal a strong dependence on the initial conditions selected by a cusp specialist ([[butterfly effect]]).

==Future research==
Future research will elucidate the nature and parameters of the criteria and the tools used in the selection and sequencing of skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bosch |first=S. |last2=Hixson |first2=M.D. |year=2004 |chapter=The final piece to a complete science of behavior: behavior development and behavioral cusps |title=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |pages=244–254 |url=http://www.baojournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hixson |first=M.D. |year=2004 |chapter=Behavioral cusps, basic behavioral repertoires, and cumulative-hierarchical learning |title=The Psychological Record |volume=54 |pages=387–403}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As importantly, the existing parameters (proposed by Rosales-Ruiz, Baer, Bosch, &amp; Fuqua) provides justifications for behavioral interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stokes | first1 = John V. | last2 = Cameron | first2 = Michael J. | last3 = Dorsey | first3 = Michael F. | last4 = Fleming | first4 = Elizabeth | year = 2004 | title = Task analysis, correspondence training, and general case instruction for teaching personal hygiene skills | url = | journal = Behavioral Interventions | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 121–135 | doi=10.1002/bin.153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = D.E. | last2 = Greer | first2 = D.R. | year = 2003 | title = Generalized imitation and the mand: introducing first instances of speech in young children with autism | url = | journal = Research in Developmental Disabilities | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 58–74 | doi=10.1016/s0891-4222(02)00167-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ala'i-Rosales, S.; Smith, G.J. &amp; Edelen-Smith, P.J.

'''Bejan''' (Fr. ''bejaune'', from ''bec jaune'', "yellow beak," in allusion to unfledged birds, and the equivalent to Ger. ''Gelbschnabel'') was a term for [[First year|freshmen]], or [[Undergraduate education|undergraduates]] of the first year, in the [[Universities in Scotland#Middle Ages|Scottish universities]]. The term is rarely used today except at the [[University of Aberdeen]] Aberdeen; at the [[University of St Andrews]] the word has mutated to "Bejant" (female: Bejantine).

The phrase was introduced from the [[List of colleges and universities in France|French universities]], where the levying of ''bejaunium'' ("footing-money") had been prohibited by the statutes of the [[Orléans#University_and_other_education|university of Orleans]] in 1365 and by those of [[University of Toulouse|Toulouse]] in 1401. In 1493 the election of an ''Abbas Bejanorum'' (Abbot of the Freshmen) was forbidden in the [[university of Paris]].

'''''Bildung''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbɪldʊŋ|lang}}, ''[[wikt:Bildung#German|"education, formation, etc."]]'') refers to the German tradition of self-cultivation (as related to the German for: creation, image, shape), wherein philosophy and education are linked in a manner that refers to a process of both personal and cultural maturation. This maturation is described as a harmonization of the individual's mind and heart and in a unification of selfhood and identity within the broader society, as evidenced with the literary tradition of ''[[Bildungsroman]]''.

In this sense, the process of harmonization of mind, heart, selfhood and identity is achieved through personal transformation, which presents a challenge to the individual's accepted beliefs. In [[Hegel]]'s writings, the challenge of personal growth often involves an agonizing alienation from one's "natural consciousness" that leads to a reunification and development of the self.  Similarly, although social unity requires well-formed institutions, it also requires a diversity of individuals with the [[Positive liberty|freedom]] (in the positive sense of the term) to develop a wide-variety of talents and abilities and this requires personal [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]].  However, rather than an end state, both individual and social unification is a process that is driven by unrelenting negations.

In this sense, education involves the shaping of the human being with regard to his/her own [[Human condition|humanity]] as well as his/her innate intellectual skills. So, the term refers a process of becoming that can be related to a process of becoming within [[Existentialism]].

The term ''Bildung'' also corresponds to the [[Humboldtian model of higher education]] from the work of Prussian philosopher and educational administrator [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (1767–1835). Thus, in this context, the concept of education becomes a lifelong process of human development, rather than mere training in gaining certain external knowledge or skills.  Such training in skills is known by the German words ''Erziehung'', and ''Ausbildung''. ''Bildung'' in contrast is seen as a process wherein an individual's spiritual and cultural sensibilities as well as life, personal and social skills are in process of continual expansion and growth. Bildung is seen as a way to become more free due to higher self-reflection. Von Humboldt wrote with respect to ''Bildung'' in 1793/1794: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Education [''Bildung''], truth and virtue" must be disseminated to such an extent that the "concept of mankind" takes on a great and dignified form in each individual (GS, I, p. 284). However, this shall be achieved personally by each individual, who must "absorb the great mass of material offered to him by the world around him and by his inner existence, using all the possibilities of his receptiveness; he must then reshape that material with all the energies of his own activity and appropriate it to himself so as to create an interaction between his own personality and nature in a most general, active and harmonious form".&lt;ref&gt;"Theory of Bildung" by Wilhelm von Humboldt, Chapter 3 in ''Teaching As A Reflective Practice: The German Didaktik Tradition'' edited by Ian Westbury, Stefan Hopmann, Kurt Riquarts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Most explicitly in Hegel's writings, the ''Bildung'' tradition rejects the pre-Kantian metaphysics of being for a post-Kantian metaphysics of experience that rejects universal narratives.  Much of Hegel's writings were about the nature of education (both ''Bildung'' and ''Erziehung''), reflecting his own role as a teacher and administrator in German secondary schools, and in his more general writings.&lt;ref&gt;see Allen W. Wood "Hegel on Education, in Amélie O. Rorty (ed.) ''Philosophy as Education''.  London: Routledge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
A more contemporary view was developed by Tony Waters: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Bildung'', I discovered in my 2 years in Germany, is an organizing cultural principle for German higher education that trumps both careerism and disciplinary silos. It is generally translated as "education", but in fact it means more—dictionary definitions often refer to "self-cultivation", "philosophy", "personal and cultural maturation" and even "existentialism". Bildung is the cry of the land of poets and thinkers against the demands of credentialism, professionalism, careerism and the financial temptations dangled to graduating students.&lt;ref&gt;"Teach Like You Do in America: Personal Reflections on Teaching Across Borders in Tanzania and Germany."  ''Palgrave Communications'' 1, Article number: 15026 (2015) doi:10.1057/palcomms.2015.26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this way, fulfillment is achieved through practical activity that promotes the development of one's own individual talents and abilities which in turn lead to the development of one's society. In this way, Bildung does not simply accept the socio-political status quo, but rather it includes the ability to engage in a critique of one's society, and to ultimately challenge the society to actualize its own highest ideals.

L. |authorlink= Ernest Boyer |year= 1990 |title= Scholarship reconsidered: Priorities of the professoriate. |publisher= Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching |url= https://depts.washington.edu/gs630/Spring/Boyer.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Boyer, traditional research, or the scholarship of discovery, had been the center of academic life and crucial to an institution's advancement but it needed to be broadened and made more flexible to include not only the new social and environmental challenges beyond the campus but also the reality of contemporary life. His vision was to change the research mission of universities by introducing the idea that scholarship needed to be redefined.

He proposed that scholarship include these four different categories:

* The scholarship of discovery that includes original research that advances knowledge (i.e., [[basic research]]);
* The scholarship of integration that involves synthesis of information across disciplines, across topics within a discipline, or across time (i.e., [[interprofessional education]], or [[science communication]]);
* The scholarship of application (also later called the [[engaged scholarship|scholarship of engagement]]) that goes beyond the service duties of a faculty member to those within or outside the University and involves the rigor and application of disciplinary expertise with results that can be shared with and/or evaluated by peers (i.e., [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service]], or [[science diplomacy]]; and
* The [[scholarship of teaching and learning]] that the systematic study of teaching and learning processes. It differs from scholarly teaching in that it requires a format that will allow public sharing and the opportunity for application and evaluation by others.

Boyer's model has been embraced across academia{{cn|date=March 2016}} with occasional refinement, such as specific applications for different disciplines.

'''Capitation fee''' refers to an illegal transaction whereby an organisation that provides educational services collects a fee that is more than what is approved by regulatory norms.

==Definition==
In the context of [[India]]n law, a capitation fee refers to the collection of payment by educational bodies not included in the prospectus of the institution, usually in exchange for admission to the institution.

The Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical Educational Institutions, Medical Institutions and Universities Bill 2010 defines it as any amount that

*Demanded or charged or collected, directly or indirectly, for, or, on behalf of any institution, or paid by any person in consideration for admitting any person as student in such institution; and which is in excess of the fee payable towards tuition fee and other fees and other charges declared by any institution in its prospectus for admitting any person as student in such institution; or
*Paid or demanded or charged or collected, by way of [[donation]], for, or, on behalf of any institution, or paid by any person in consideration for admitting any person as a student in such institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical Educational Institutions, Medical Educational Institutions and Universities Act, 2010, Bill No. 56 of 2010 Lok  Sabha|url=http://164.100.24.167/newcommittee/press_release/bill/Committee%20on%20HRD/The%20Prohibition%20of%20Unfair.pdf|format=PDF|website=164.100.24.167|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A submission by counsel, F.S. Nariman, in the P.A. Inamdar case (August 2005) defines capitation fee as "something taken over and above what the institution needs by way of revenue and capital expenditure plus a reasonable surplus.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prayatna.typepad.com/education/2005/06/what_exactly_do.html|title=Education in India: The definition of capitation fee in the context of education in India|website=Prayatna.typepad.com|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions for capitation fee also include "any amount, by whatever name called, paid or collected directly or indirectly in excess of the fee prescribed...",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tndte.com/ACT%20AND%20REGULATIONS.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220064648/http://www.tndte.com/ACT%20AND%20REGULATIONS.pdf# |archive-date=2016-12-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "any amount by whatever name called whether in cash or in kind paid or collected or received directly or indirectly in addition to the fees determined"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfhha.org/images/pdf/Hospital_Laws/Kerala_profes_sional_colleges%20_or_institution_ammendment%20act_%202006.pdf|format=PDF|title=No. 11510/Leg.Uni.3/06/Law|website=Rfhha.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "any amount, by whatever name called, whether in cash or kind, in excess of the prescribed or, as the case may be, approved, rates of fees..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/libweb/acts/1988.06.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025114132/http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/libweb/acts/1988.06.pdf# |archive-date=2016-10-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
[[File:Tagore Gandhi.jpg|thumb|Tagore and Gandhi; 'Knowledge without Character' and 'Commerce without Morality' were social sins for Mahatma Gandhi.]]
This practice is widely prevalent in private colleges and universities in India, especially those that grant baccalaureate degrees in engineering, IT and the sciences for which the demand for admissions exceeds the supply, though a number of technical educations has been closing down in recent years and many seats go vacant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livechennai.com/detailnews.asp?newsid=26452 |title=100 engineering colleges to be closed throughout India: Details on Tamil Nadu colleges,AICTE,engineering colleges to be closed ,India,Tamil Nadu, colleges |publisher=Live Chennai |date=2016-05-13 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaeducationreview.com/news/aicte-approves-closure-150-private-colleges |title=AICTE approves closure of 150 private colleges |publisher=India Education Review |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ample evidence to the collection of capitation fee exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shammi Prabhakar/Mathrubhumi News |url=http://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/kerala/capitation-fee-for-medical-admissions-evidence-out-i-audio-capitation-fee-medical-admissions-1.1392480 |title=Capitation fee for medical admissions: Evidence out I Audio - Kerala-Mathrubhumi Kerala News, Latest Kerala News, Kerala Breaking News, Kerala Politics |publisher=English.mathrubhumi.com |date=2016-09-30 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Correspondent |first=Our |url=http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/kerala-vigilance-probe-capitation-fee-self-finance-medical-admis.html |title=Capitation fee: Kerala CM orders vigilance probe |publisher=English.manoramaonline.com |date=2016-09-30 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

Capitation fee has been one of the major contributors to corruption in education and society. Those who complete their course by paying capitation fee are looking for a "return on investment". This attempt to recover the investment fuel unethical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Sudhir|title=Human Resources Management|date=2009|publisher=Tata McGraw Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-01-bmj-action-illegal-payments-india.html |title=The BMJ calls for action over illegal payments to India's private medical colleges |publisher=Medicalxpress.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capitation fee has been considered to be one of the reason for the exorbitant hike in healthcare costs and deteriorating medical standards.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeetha D’Silva, journalist, Mumbai |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h106 |title=India’s private medical colleges and capitation fees |publisher=The BMJ |date=2015-01-21 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1150215/jsp/7days/story_3404.jsp |title=Have money, can prescribe |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capitation fee comes as a surprise to the student when the student may have forsaken admission deadlines at other institutions. Choosing not to pay additional fee may even lead to a form of extortion, by withholding the degree from students. Parents often pay so that there is no ill bearing that affects their wards scores or standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Capitation fee: ‘early bird' phenomenon continues |publisher=The Hindu |date=23 May 2011 |url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/05/23/stories/2011052362280300.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130125193611/http://www.hindu.com/2011/05/23/stories/2011052362280300.htm |archivedate=25 January 2013 |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fee might not be uniformly applied. The donation money is often not accounted, and its usage and allocation are mismanaged and not reported to income tax. In such cases of malpractice, students overpay for substandard education.

Students are also misguided. Some institutions add the capitation fee along with the fee approved by regulatory norms. This combined fee is projected as the actual fee to the students.

==Arguments for and against capitation fees==
[[File:Nalanda.jpg|thumb|[[Nalanda]], an ancient centre for higher learning; 'Speak the Truth', 'Live Righteousness' says the Upanishads ('Sathyam Vada, Dharmam Chara')]]
Capitation fees are generally seen as a main revenue generator that private institutions may charge, which contend that admissions that cater to affordable sections of society somehow affects the overall number of students educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaeducationreview.com/news/ugc-decide-fee-structure-private-deemed-universities|title=UGC to decide fee structure of private deemed universities - IndiaEducationReview|date=14 March 2011|website=Indiaeducationreview.com|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.indiaeducationreview.com/news/private-universities-in-himachal-to-be-regulated-by-law# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819032529/http://www.indiaeducationreview.com/news/private-universities-in-himachal-to-be-regulated-by-law# |archive-date=2016-08-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also controls the seat allocation, number and ratio of management, payment and free seats. That limits the institutions' ability to raise money through tuition, leaving institutions in need for money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dolphinlifesciences.com//|title=The Secret of Successful best college |accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashanet.org/projects-new/documents/678/SupremeCourtJudgementForClauseImplementation.pdf|format=PDF|title=Supreme Court's double whammy for elite schools |website=Ashanet.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collecting donations becomes a side effect of the government laws that disallow institutions from setting their fees, but some parents genuinely donate to improve the infrastructure of their wards' college.

The practice of charging capitation fees by various institutions and universities has been subjected to criticism on various grounds. It has been often referred as 'killing of merit'. In its emphatic judgement in the [[Mohini Jain V/s State of Karnataka case]], Supreme Court declared that charging of capitation fee was arbitrary, unfair, and in violation of the fundamental right to equality in Article 14 of the Constitution. The Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical Educational Institutions, Medical Institutions and Universities Bill 2010 recognized capitation fee as a cognizable offence.

On the other hand, various private colleges have defended capitation fee on the ground that it avails institutions with funds to reinvest in the institution to impart quality education. V Raghunathan, former professor, IIM-Ahmedabad said "For engineering colleges in most states, the permitted fee for unaided private colleges is in the vicinity of Rs 30,000 per student per annum. Given that even most kindergarten schools charge a higher fee in the cities, one wonders exactly how the private institutions are expected to provide high quality technical education for this fee".&lt;ref name="financialexpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/pvt-colleges-defend-capitation-fee/593749/0 |title=Pvt colleges defend capitation fee |publisher=Financialexpress.com |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faking News has written an article 'School Principal elected for the coveted 'Business Person of the Year' award' acknowledging the practices of some of the private schools in India, while also noting that "a school principal winning a business award created unrest among the top business leaders in India".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/india/school-principal-elected-coveted-business-person-year-award-17096|website=Faking News |title=School Principal elected for the coveted 'Business Person of the Year' award |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, institutions (business schools, engineering colleges, medical colleges) that take capitation fee also receive significant amount of funding from governmental funding agencies like AICTE, DST, UGC and various ministries under central government and state government. The funds support infrastructure ranging from faculty laptops, printers, lab facilities and trading rooms in business schools.

Educational regulatory agencies, at the national level&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/1842250_deemedregulation2014.PDF |title=Extraordinary|website=Ugc.ac.in |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also at the regional level,&lt;ref name="asckerala1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asckerala.org/sites/default/files/MBA%20DIRECTIVES%20ISSUED%20TO%20ALL%20SELF-FINANICNG%20MANAGEMENT%20INSTITUTUES%20ON%2011.05.2015.pdf |title=ADMISSION SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE &amp; FEE REGULATORY COMMITTEE FOR PROFESSIONAL COLLEGES OF KERALA|website=Asckerala.org|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; has mandated that an institution should include the fee in the prospectus. Institutions has been charging fee from students under various categories, that the fee regulatory committee of Karnataka Government has listed 99 different categories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kea.kar.nic.in/cet2014/NOTICE_FRC.pdf |title=Fee Regulatory Committee of Karnataka Government|website=Kea.kar.nic.in |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; through which the institutions may be collecting fee from the students.

==Controversies==
Various renowned and prestigious private schools and colleges across India have been found demanding capitation fee. It was found that sum of Rs 500,000 was allegedly paid by a student through a demand draft to Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering (SVCE), a private college in Pennalur, Sriperumbudur, near Chennai. The incident came into light through a surprise check drive initiated by the government in Tamil Nadu at 142 self-financing engineering colleges in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/31/stories/2007073154040600.htm |title=Archive News |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scam exposed by a popular news channel, Times Now, suggested that Information and Broadcasting Minister for State Jagathrakshakan was allegedly associated with the Shree Balaji Medical College in malpractices in admissions. The minister later denied having associated with the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kLeDd0bqG4 |title=College capitation fee scam |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-06-04 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jagathrakshakan said, "I have never been the Chairman.

Income Tax Department has been conducting raids on some of the organisations that take capitation fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bangalore Mirror Bureau |url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/bangalore/cover-story/I-T-dept-makes-record-seizure-of-Rs43cr-cash-from-Vydehi-Institute-trustee/articleshow/54551833.cms?prtpage=1 |title=I-T dept makes record seizure of Rs43cr cash from Vydehi Institute trustee |publisher=Bangalore Mirror |date=2016-09-28 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil_nadu/Income-tax-raids-in-Tamil-Nadu-Pondy-yield-80-crore/2016/06/25/article3499219.ece|newspaper=[[The New Indian Express]] |title=Income tax raids in Tamil Nadu, Pondy yield 80 crore |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626133559/http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil_nadu/Income-tax-raids-in-Tamil-Nadu-Pondy-yield-80-crore/2016/06/25/article3499219.ece |archivedate=26 June 2016 |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil_nadu/Capitation-fee-draws-Income-Tax-sleuths-to-top-schools-in-Namakkal/2013/06/14/article1633889.ece|newspaper=[[The New Indian Express]] |title=Capitation fee draws Income-Tax sleuths to top schools in Namakkal |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/d-y-patil-group-income-tax-raid-cash-unaccounted-jewellery-seized-2950621/|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]] |title=Rs 30 crore, 40 kg bullion seized from D Y Patil Group by Income Tax |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrests have been made related to cheating associated with admissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/srm-chairmans-arrest-warning-andhra-govt-it-parades-private-unis-amarvati-49231 |title=SRM chairman’s arrest a warning to Andhra govt as it parades private universities in Amaravati|website=Thenewsminute.com |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal implications==
The Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical Educational Institutions, Medical Institutions and Universities Bill 2010 was introduced as a strict measure to bring about the transparency in the educational system regarding the fee structures and other crucial issues. Charging or accepting capitation fee is considered as violation of Provision 6, which prohibits any institution from demanding or accepting capitation fee, directly or indirectly. If found guilty, the institution will be liable to a penalty of up to Rs.5,000,000 and maximum imprisonment for three years. The bill has been criticized by various private institutions essentially for restricting the autonomy of the institution in such matters. J Philip, President, Xavier Institute of Management Education, Bangalore and former director, IIM – Bangalore, said, "The Bill promises to be beneficial. But it also runs the risk of curbing the autonomy and the freedom of institutions and challenge dynamic functioning. Again, it could be misused by students or anyone trying to settle scores".&lt;ref name="financialexpress1"/&gt; However, this bill lapsed, before it became a law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livelaw.in/prashant-bhushan-writes-lodha-committee-systematic-changes-structure-functioning-medical-council/ |title=Prashant Bhushan writes to Lodha Committee for systematic changes in the structure and functioning of Medical Council|website=Livelaw.in |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media reports indicate that black money in education in India is generating more than 40,000 crores, while black money generation in medical education would be more than 10,000 crores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praja.in/en/blog/murali772/2016/02/01/business-medical-education |title=The business of medical education &amp;#124; Praja |publisher=Praja.in |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing into black money practices in India has started its probe into the area, which was outside the ambit of SIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/black-money-sit-set-to-crack-down-on-donations-capitation-fee/article1-1326761.aspx |title=Special team probing black money set to crack down on unaccounted funds in education sector &amp;#124; india |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=2016-04-22 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suggestions to curb practice ==
Concerns have been raised on how capitation fee has been charged in the name of donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teachers-vow-to-fight-unitary-university-plan-capitation-fee/article128385.ece |title=Teachers vow to fight ‘unitary university’ plan, capitation fee - TAMIL NADU |publisher=The Hindu |date=2009-12-30 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, the Supreme Court appointed Mr Salman Khurshid, former Union Law Minister, as an amicus curiae and asked him to come out with suggestions and methodologies to end this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/424408/sc-names-khurshid-amicus-curiae.html|title=SC names Khurshid amicus curiae|newspaper=[[Deccan Herald]]|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to stringent legal actions, other practices that government can adopt to curb the practice include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/errorpage/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103165110/http://www.thehindu.com/errorpage/# |archive-date=2018-01-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Audited financial statements of educational institutions, and the 'charitable trusts' that owns these institutions, to be made available in the website of these institutions and trusts, on an annual basis.&lt;ref name="business-standard1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/madras-hc-orders-issue-of-notice-to-it-department-116070401144_1.html|website=Business Standard |title=Madras HC orders issue of notice to IT department |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Funding organisations like DST, UGC, AICTE, Ministry of Education and other ministries under the central and state governments should stop funding research projects and programmes in institutions taking capitation fee.&lt;ref name="wordpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://myfightagainstcapitationfee.wordpress.com/2014/12/07/how-can-we-stop-the-practice-of-capitation-fee/|title=How can we stop the practice of charging capitation fee?

&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Revoking exemptions/ canceling registrations of these organisations that take capitation fee&lt;ref name="business-standard1"/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(4) Legal measures against "minority institutions" - linguistic, religious etc. - that operates in an illegal manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2314/stories/20060728003710600.htm|title=Act of promise|website=Frontline.in|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(5) Articles in a leading international medical journal discussing about the capitation fee practices in medical colleges in India suggested that those who complete their courses from capitation fee taking colleges should not be allowed for postings abroad.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h237|title=We need to discuss India’s reliance on private medical colleges|first=Sanjay|last=Nagral|date=22 January 2015|journal=BMJ|volume=350|pages=h237|accessdate=19 October 2017|doi=10.1136/bmj.h237|pmid=25608848}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(6) Instituting a maximum fee limit has been on discussions. For example, Sri Krishna committee has recommended a fee band for professional colleges, with an upper limit for the fee that can be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/aicte-accepts-panel-proposal-on-fee-cap-for-private-institutes/ |title=AICTE accepts panel proposal on fee cap for private institutes|website=Indianexpress.com |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(7) A centralised fee collection process, with a time-bound mechanism to channelise the collected fee to the institutes.&lt;ref name="wordpress1"/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(8) A single common entrance exam for each of the courses (medicine, engineering, pharmacy, hotel management, business management, law and other courses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/editorial/netting-the-best/article8969699.ece|title=Netting the best|date=10 August 2016|website=Thehindubusinessline.com|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.successcds.net/engineeringentranceexam/why-not-a-single-common-entrance-exam-for-engineering-admissions.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024085100/http://www.successcds.net/engineeringentranceexam/why-not-a-single-common-entrance-exam-for-engineering-admissions.html# |archive-date=2016-10-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student Advisory==
[[File:Sacred lotus Nelumbo nucifera.jpg|thumb|Indian Ethos considers education to be a sacred endeavor]]
===Technical Education / Higher Education===
All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), the regulatory body for technical education in India, has called "upon the students, parents and the general public not to pay any capitation fee or any other fee other than that mentioned in the Prospectus of the Institutions for consideration of admission.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aicte-india.org/downloads/notice_prohibition_capitation_fee.pdf|format=PDF|title=Notice : Accepting/Paying Capitation Fees is Strictly Prohibited|website=Aicte-india.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; AICTE also mentions that the fee charged from students, including for programs such as PGDM, has to be approved by the fee regulatory committee of the state, and the institute should mention the fee in its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aicte-india.org/downloads/ApprovalProcessHandbook2016-17.pdf |title=All India Council for Technical Education: Approval Process Handbook: (2016 – 2017)|website=Aicte-india.org |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per AICTE norms, the business schools are not meant to charge a fee higher than what is mentioned in the prospectus. Educational regulatory agencies, at the national level&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and also at the regional level,&lt;ref name="asckerala1"/&gt; has mandated that an institution should include the fee in the prospectus.

===School education===
Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) states that a school should be run as a service and not as a business and that commercialization does not take place in the school. The Board has mentioned that "No capitation fee or voluntary donations for gaining admission in the school or for any other purpose should be charged/collected in the name of the school. In case of such malpractices, the Board may take drastic action leading to disaffiliation of the school". The school is also punishable with fine which may extend to ten times the capitation fee charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbse.nic.in/Circular%20No.%2002-2016%20dated%2003.06.2016.pdf|format=PDF|title=Adherence to Rules of Affiliation|website=Cbse.nic.in|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBSE has issued notification/s asking schools affiliated to CBSE to mention fee details in the school website, and also in the CBSE website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbse.nic.in/newsite/mdnew.pdf|format=PDF|title=INFORMATION REQUIRED UNDER MANDATORY DISCLOSURE|website=Cbse.nic.in|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbse.nic.in/newsite/md.pdf|format=PDF|title=Extension of date of filing disclosures|website=Cbse.nic.in|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar notifications have been released by regional educational departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schooleducation.tripura.gov.in/sites/default/files/Notification%20on%20Admission.pdf|format=PDF|title=Admission in privately-owned unfunded schools over capitation fees|website=Schooleducation.tripura.gov.in|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic Search Complete. Web. 1 Apr. 2016" /&gt;'''Classroom management''' is a term [[teacher|teachers]] use to describe the process of ensuring that classroom [[lesson|lessons]] run smoothly without [[Challenging behavior|disruptive behavior]] from [[student|students]] compromising the delivery of instruction. The term also implies the prevention of disruptive behavior  preemptively, as well as effectively responding to it after it happens.

It is a difficult aspect of teaching for many teachers. Problems in this area causes some to leave teaching. In 1981 the US [[National Educational Association]] reported that 36% of teachers said they would probably not go into teaching if they had to decide again. A major reason was negative student attitudes and discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1  = Wolfgang | first1 = Charles H | last2 = Glickman  | first2 = Carl D  |title=Solving Discipline Problems |url= |accessdate= |year= 1986 |publisher= Allyn and Bacon |location= |isbn=0205086306 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classroom management is crucial in classrooms because it supports the proper execution of curriculum development, developing best teaching practices, and putting them into action. Classroom management can be explained as the actions and directions that teachers use to create a successful learning environment; indeed, having a positive impact on students achieving given learning requirements and goals (Soheili, Alizadeh, Murphy, Bajestani, Ferguson and Dreikurs). In an effort to ensure all students receive the best education it would seem beneficial for educator programs to spend more time and effort in ensuring educators and instructors are well versed in classroom management. 

Teachers do not focus on learning classroom management, because higher education programs do not put an emphasis on the teacher attaining classroom management; indeed, the focus is on creating a conducive learning atmosphere for the student (Eisenman, Edwards, and Cushman). These tools enable teachers to have the resources available to properly and successfully educate upcoming generations, and ensure future successes as a nation.
According to Moskowitz &amp; Hayman (1976), once a teacher loses control of their classroom, it becomes increasingly more difficult for them to regain that control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moskowitz |first1=G. |last2=Hayman Jr. |first2=J.L. |year=1976 |title=Success strategies of inner-city teachers: A year-long study |journal=Journal of Educational Research |volume=69 |issue=8 |pages=283–289 |publisher= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Also, research from Berliner (1988) and Brophy &amp; Good (1986) shows that the time a teacher must take to correct misbehavior caused by poor classroom management skills results in a lower rate of academic engagement in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner, D. C. (1988). Effective classroom management and instruction: A knowledge base for consultation. In J. L. Graden, J. E. Zins, &amp; M. J. Curtis (Eds.), Alternative educational delivery systems: Enhancing instructional options for all students (pp.&amp;nbsp;309–325). Washington, DC: National Association of School Psychologists.Brophy, J. E., &amp; Good, T. L. (1986). Teacher behavior and student achievement. In M. C. Wittrock (Ed.), Handbook of research on teaching (3rd ed., pp.&amp;nbsp;328–375). New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; From the student's perspective, effective classroom management involves clear communication of behavioral and academic expectations as well as a cooperative learning environment.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, J.D. (1986). Classroom management: students' perspectives, goals, and strategies. American Educational Research Journal, 23, 437-459.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporal punishment===
{{seealso|School corporal punishment}}
Until recently, [[corporal punishment]] was widely used as a means of controlling disruptive behavior but it is now illegal in most schools. It is still advocated in some contexts by religious leaders such as [[James Dobson]], but his views "diverge sharply from those recommended by contemporary mainstream experts" and are not based on empirical testing, but rather are a reflection of his faith-based beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartkowski|first1=John P.|last2=Ellison|first2=Christopher G.|title=Divergent Models of Childrearing in Popular Manuals: Conservative Protestants vs. the Mainstream Experts|journal=Sociology of Religion 56|date=1995|volume=1|pages=21–34|doi=10.2307/3712036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to studies taboo physical punishments like spanking or procedures used in Asia in the classroom such as standing do not make students or children more aggressive. Consistency seems to play a greater role on whether outcomes could be negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Truth About Physically Punishing Children {{!}} ESLinsider|url = http://www.eslinsider.com/blog/truth-about-physically-punishing-children-and-students|website = www.eslinsider.com|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporal punishment is now banned in most schools in the [[United States]], and most [[developed countries]]. Although its effectiveness was never proven, the punishment was very disproportionately met. African American males were the most punished group. In a study conducted in 2006, 17.1 percent of students who experienced corporal punishment were African Americans, and 78.3 percent of total students were males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2013/10/23/09spanking_ep.h33.html|title=Corporal Punishment Persists in U.S. Schools|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Good teacher-student relationships===

Some characteristics of having good teacher-student relationships in the classroom involves the appropriate levels of dominance, cooperation, and awareness of high-needs students. Dominance is defined as the teacher's ability to give clear purpose and guidance concerning student behavior and their academics. By creating and giving clear expectations and consequences for student behavior, this builds effective relationships. Such expectations may cover classroom etiquette and behavior, group work, seating arrangements, the use of equipment and materials, and also classroom disruptions. Assertive teacher behavior also reassures that thoughts and messages are being passed on to the student in an effective way. Assertive behavior can be achieved by using erect posture, appropriate tone of voice depending on the current situation, and taking care not to ignore inappropriate behavior by taking action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marzano|first1=Robert J.|title=The Key to Classroom Management|journal=Educational Leadership|date=September 2003|volume=61|issue=1|pages=6–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventive techniques===

Preventive approaches to classroom management involve creating a positive classroom community with mutual respect between teacher and student. Teachers using the preventive approach offer warmth, acceptance, and support unconditionally – not based on a student's behavior. Fair rules and consequences are established and students are given frequent and consistent feedback regarding their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bear, G.G. (2008). Best practices in classroom discipline. In Thomas, A. &amp; Grimes, J. (Eds.), Best Practices in School Psychology V (1403-1420). Bethesda, MD: National Association of School Psychologists&lt;/ref&gt; One way to establish this kind of classroom environment is through the development and use of a classroom contract.  The contract should be created by both students and the teacher.  In the contract, students and teachers decide and agree on how to treat one another in the classroom. The group also decides on and agrees to what the group will do if someone violates the contract.  Rather than a consequence, the group should decide how to fix the problem through either class discussion, peer mediation, counseling, or by one on one conversations leading to a solution to the situation.

Preventive techniques also involve the strategic use of praise and rewards to inform students about their behavior rather than as a means of controlling student behavior. To use rewards to inform students about their behavior, teachers must emphasize the value of the behavior that is rewarded and also explain to students the specific skills they demonstrated to earn the reward. Teachers should also encourage student collaboration in selecting rewards and defining appropriate behaviors that earn rewards.&lt;ref&gt;Bear, G.G., Cavalier, A., &amp; Manning, M. (2005). Developing self-discipline and preventing and correcting misbehavior. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rote discipline ===
Also known as "lines", rote discipline is a sanction used for [[behavior management]]. It involves assigning a disorderly student sentences or the classroom rules to write repeatedly. Among the many types of classroom management approaches, it is very commonly used.

==Systematic approaches==

=== Assertive discipline ===

[[Assertive discipline]] is an approach designed to assist educators in running a teacher-in-charge classroom environment. Assertive teachers react to situations that require the management of student behavior confidently. Assertive teachers do not use an abrasive, sarcastic, or hostile tone when disciplining students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.behavioradvisor.com/AssertiveDiscipline.html|title=Assertive Discipline {{!}} Child Discipline in the Classroom|website=www.behavioradvisor.com|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Assertive discipline is one of the most widely used classroom management tactics in the world. It demands student compliance and requires teachers to be firm. This method draws a clear line between aggressive discipline and assertive discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.behavioradvisor.com/AssertiveDiscipline.html|title=Assertive Discipline|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standards and rules set in place by assertive discipline are supported by positive reinforcement as well as negative consequences. Teachers using this approach carry themselves confidently and have no tolerance for class disruption. They are not timid, and remain consistent and just.&lt;ref&gt;"Lee Canter's assertive discipline; positive behavior management for today's classroom, 4th ed."&amp;nbsp;''Reference &amp; Research Book News'', Feb. 2010.&amp;nbsp;''Academic OneFile'',&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A224421968/AONE?u=txshracd2575&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=ab58f676&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed 11 Dec. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constructivist discipline ===

A constructivist, student-centered approach to classroom management is based on the assignment of tasks in response to student disruption that are "(1) easy for the student to perform, (2) developmentally enriching, (3) progressive, so a teacher can up the ante if needed, (4) based on students' interests, (5) designed to allow the teacher to stay in charge, and (6) foster creativity and play in the classroom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helman|first1=Daniel|title=Constructivist Discipline for a Student-Centered Classroom|url=https://www.academia.edu/35104244/Constructivist_Discipline_for_a_Student-Centered_Classroom|website=Academia.edu|publisher=Academic Exchange Quarterly|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compliance rests on assigning disciplinary tasks that the student will want to do, in concert with the teacher rapidly assigning more of the task if the student does not initially comply. Once the student complies, the role of the teacher as the person in charge (i.e. in loco parentis) has been re-established peacefully, creatively, and with respect for students' needs. Claimed benefits include increased student trust and long-term emotional benefits from the modeling of creative solutions to difficulties without resorting to a threat of violence or force.

=== Culturally responsive classroom management ===

Culturally responsive classroom management (CRCM) is an approach to running classrooms with all children [not simply for racial/ethnic minority children] in a culturally responsive way. More than a set of strategies or practices, CRCM is a pedagogical approach that guides the management decisions that teachers make.  It is a natural extension of culturally responsive teaching, which uses students' backgrounds, rendering of social experiences, prior knowledge, and learning styles in daily lessons. Teachers, as culturally responsive classroom managers, recognize their biases
and values and reflect on how these influence their expectations for behavior and their interactions with students as well as what learning looks like. There is extensive research on traditional classroom management and a myriad of resources available on how to deal with behavior issues.  Conversely, there is little research on CRCM, despite the fact that teachers who lack cultural competence often experience problems in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culturally Responsive Classroom Management Strategies|url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/scmsAdmin/uploads/005/121/Culturally%20Responsive%20Classroom%20Mgmt%20Strat2.pdf|website=www.steinhardt.nyu.edu/metrocenter|publisher=Metropolitan Center for Urban Education|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discipline without Stress, Punishments or Rewards ===

Discipline without Stress (or DWS) is a K-12 discipline and learning approach developed by Marvin Marshall described in his 2001 book, ''Discipline without Stress, Punishments or Rewards''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Marvin|title=Discipline without Stress, Punishments or Rewards|year=2001|publisher=Piper Press|location=Los Alamitos|isbn=0-9700606-1-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The approach is designed to educate young people about the value of internal motivation.   The intention is to prompt and develop within youth a desire to become responsible and self-disciplined and to put forth effort to learn. The most significant characteristics of DWS are that it is totally noncoercive (but not permissive) and takes the opposite approach to Skinnerian behaviorism that relies on external sources for reinforcement.

=== Provide flexible learning goals ===

Instructors can demonstrate a suitable level of strength by giving clear learning objectives, they can also pass on fitting levels of participation by giving learning objectives that can be changed based on the classes needs. Allowing students to participate in their own learning goals and outcomes at the start of a unit brings a sense of cooperation and mutual understanding between the instructor and student. One way of involving the students and in turn making them feel heard in the decision making of the class is by asking what topics they would find most intriguing in learning based on a guided rubric. This approach will engage and send a message to the students that the teacher is interested in the student's interests. The student in turn will bring greater learning outcomes as well as a mutual respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/sept03/vol61/num01/The-Key-to-Classroom-Management.aspx|title=Educational Leadership:Building Classroom Relationships:The Key to Classroom Management|first=|last=ASCD|website=www.ascd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== The Good Behavior Game ===

The Good Behavior Game (GBG) is a "classroom-level approach to behavior management"&lt;ref&gt;Responding to rule violations or rule following: A comparison of two versions of the Good Behavior Game with kindergarten students. Journal of School Psychology, 48, 337-355.&lt;/ref&gt; that was originally used in 1969 by Barrish, Saunders, and Wolf. The Game entails the class earning access to a reward or losing a reward, given that all members of the class engage in some type of behavior (or did not exceed a certain amount of undesired behavior). The GBG can be used to increase desired behaviors (e.g., question asking) or to decrease undesired behaviors (e.g., out of seat behavior). The GBG has been used with preschoolers as well as adolescents, however most applications have been used with typically developing students (i.e., those without developmental disabilities). In addition, the Game "is usually popular with and acceptable to students and teachers."&lt;ref&gt;Tingstrom, D.H., Sterling-Turner, H.E., Wilczynski, S.M. (2006). The Good Behavior Game: 1969-2002. Behavior Modification, 30, 2, 225-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive classrooms ===
[[Robert DiGiulio]] has developed what he calls "[[positive classrooms]]". DiGiulio sees positive classroom management as the result of four factors: how teachers regard their students (spiritual dimension), how they set up the classroom environment (physical dimension), bow skillfully they teach content (instructional dimension), and how well they address student behavior (managerial dimension). In positive classrooms student participation and collaboration are encouraged in a safe environment that has been created. A positive classroom environment can be encouraged by being consistent with expectations, using students' names, providing choices when possible, and having an overall trust in students. So As educators, we have daily opportunities to help students grow confidence and feel good about themselves. Despite all the negativity that may be around them within their households. Through such actions as boosting their self-esteem through praise, helping them work through any feelings of alienation, depression, and anger, and helping them realize and honor their intrinsic worth as human beings. May result in better behavior in the long line jeopardy of the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/tools/15923.htm|title=Feeling Good About Themselves|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lucero|first1=Rodrick|title=Building a Positive Classroom Culture and Climate|url=http://teaching.colostate.edu/tips/tip.cfm?tipid=136|website=Teaching @ CSU|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a process==

In the ''Handbook of Classroom Management: Research Practice and Contemporary Issues'' (2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinstein|first=edited by Carolyn M. Evertson ; Carol S.|title=Handbook of classroom management : research, practice, and contemporary issues|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, N.J|isbn=0-8058-4753-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evertson and Weinstein characterize classroom management as the actions taken to create an environment that supports and facilitates academic and social–emotional learning.  Toward this goal, teachers must (1) develop caring, supportive relationships with and among students; (2) organize and implement instruction in ways that optimize students’ access to learning; (3) use group management methods that encourage students’ engagement in academic tasks; (4) promote the development of students’ social skills and self–regulation; and (5) use appropriate interventions to assist students with behavior problems.

==As time management==

In their introductory text on teaching, Kauchak and Eggen (2008)&lt;ref&gt; Kauchak, D., and Eggen, P. (2008). Introduction to teaching: Becoming a professional (3rd ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; explain classroom management in terms of time management. The goal of classroom management, to Kauchak and Eggen, is to not only maintain order but to optimize student learning. They divide class time into four overlapping categories, namely allocated time, instructional time, engaged time, and academic learning time.

===Academic learning time===

Academic learning time occurs when students 1) participate actively and 2) are successful in learning activities. Effective classroom management maximizes academic learning time.

=== Allocated time ===
Allocated time is the total time allotted for [[teaching]], [[learning]], routine classroom procedures, checking attendance, and posting or delivering announcements.

Allocated time is also what appears on each student's schedule, for example "[[Introductory Algebra]]: 9:50-10:30 a.m." or "[[Fine Arts]] 1:15-2:00 p.m."

===Engaged time===

Engaged time is also called time on task. During engaged time, students are participating actively in learning activities—asking and responding to questions, completing worksheets and exercises, preparing skits and presentations, etc.

===Instructional time===

Instructional time is what remains after routine classroom procedures are completed. That is to say, instructional time is the time wherein teaching and learning actually takes place. Teachers may spend two or three minutes taking attendance, for example, before their instruction begins. The time it takes for the teacher to do routine tasks can severely limit classroom instruction. Teachers must get a handle on classroom management to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teachers: Classroom Management Plan|url = http://teachersindex.com/classroommanagement.html|website = teachersindex.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common mistakes==

In an effort to maintain order in the classroom, sometimes teachers can actually make the problems worse. Therefore, it is important to consider some of the basic mistakes commonly made when implementing classroom behavior management strategies. For example, a common mistake made by teachers is to define the problem behavior by how it looks without considering its function.&lt;ref name="barbetta2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barbetta|first=Patricia M.|author2=Norona, Kathleen Leong |author3=Bicard, David F. |title=Classroom Behavior Management: A Dozen Common Mistakes and What to Do Instead|journal=Preventing School Failure: Alternative Education for Children and Youth|year=2005|volume=49|issue=3|pages=11–19|doi=10.3200/PSFL.49.3.11-19|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3200/PSFL.49.3.11-19|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interventions are more likely to be effective when they are individualized to address the specific function of the problem behavior. Two students with similar looking misbehavior may require entirely different intervention strategies if the behaviors are serving different functions. Teachers need to understand that they need to be able to change the ways they do things from year to year, as the children change. Not every approach works for every child. Teachers need to learn to be flexible. Another common mistake is for the teacher to become increasingly frustrated and negative when an approach is not working.&lt;ref name="barbetta2005" /&gt;

The teacher may raise his or her voice or increase adverse consequences in an effort to make the approach work. This type of interaction may impair the teacher-student relationship. Instead of allowing this to happen, it is often better to simply try a new approach.

Inconsistency in expectations and consequences is an additional mistake that can lead to dysfunction in the classroom.&lt;ref name="barbetta2005" /&gt; Teachers must be consistent in their expectations and consequences to help ensure that students understand that rules will be enforced. To avoid this, teachers should communicate expectations to students clearly and be sufficiently committed to the classroom management procedures to enforce them consistently.

"Ignoring and approving" is an effective classroom management strategy. This involves ignoring students when they behave undesirably and approving their behavior when it is desirable. When students are praised for their good behavior but ignored for their bad behavior, this may increase the frequency of good behavior and decrease bad behavior. Student behavior may be maintained by attention; if students have a history of getting attention after misbehavior, they may continue this behavior as long as it continues to get attention. If student misbehavior is ignored, but good behavior results in attention, students may instead behave appropriately to acquire attention.&lt;ref name=Madesen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madesen|first1=Charles|title=Rules, Praise, And Ignoring:  Elements Of Elementary Classroom Control|journal=Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1968|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~educy520/sec5982/week_8/madsen68.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clinical clerkships''' encompass a period of [[medical education]] in which students – [[medical student|medical]], [[nursing school|nursing]], [[dentistry school|dental]], or otherwise – practice medicine under the supervision of a health practitioner.&lt;ref name="unm-glossary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unm.edu/~unmreg/Curriculum/ScheduleTypeGlossary1-9-06.htm |title=Clinical clerkship |work=UNM Course Type Glossary |accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical clerkships ==
In [[medical education]], a '''clerkship''', or '''rotation''', refers to the practice of [[medicine]] by [[medical students]] ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]], [[Doctor of Podiatric Medicine|D.P.M]]) during their final year(s) of study. Traditionally, the first half of [[medical school]] trains students in the classroom setting, and the second half takes place in a [[teaching hospital]]. Clerkships give students experiences in all parts of the hospital setting, including the [[operating room]], [[emergency department]], and various other departments that allow learning by viewing and doing.

During this training, students are required to rotate through different [[medical specialties]] and treat [[patient]]s under the supervision of [[physicians]].  Students elicit [[medical history|patient histories]], complete [[physical examination]]s, write [[progress note]]s, and assist in [[surgery|surgeries]] and [[medical procedure]]s. The work hours are that of a full-time job, generally similar to that of [[residency (medicine)|residents]]. Students may also be required to work on weekends and to be on call.
For [[medical student]]s, [[Clerkship (medicine)|clerkships]] occur after the [[basic science]] curriculum, and are supervised by medical specialists at a [[teaching hospital]] or [[medical school]]. Typically, certain clerkships are required to obtain the [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree or the [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degree in the United States (e.g., [[internal medicine]], [[surgery]], [[pediatrics]]), while others are elective (e.g., [[dermatology]], [[pathology]], and [[neurology]]).

The intent of the clinical clerkship is to teach the medical student the fundamentals of clinical examination, evaluation, and care provision, and to enable the student to select the course of further study. During the clinical clerkship, the medical student will interact with real patients much as a [[physician]] does, but their evaluation and recommendations will be reviewed and approved by more senior physicians.

===United States===
In the United States, [[Medical school in the United States|medical school]] typically lasts four years.  Medical students spend the third and fourth years rotating through a combination of required clerkship and electives.  Most medical schools require rotations in [[internal medicine]], [[surgery]], [[pediatrics]], [[psychiatry]], [[obstetrics and gynecology]], [[family medicine]], [[radiology]], and [[neurology]].  Some schools additionally require [[emergency medicine]] and [[intensive-care medicine]].  Furthermore, a common graduation requirement is to complete a [[sub-internship]] in a specialty, where the medical student acts as an [[internship (medicine)|intern]].

'''Coaching''' is a form of development in which a person called a ''coach'' supports a learner or client in achieving a specific personal or professional goal by providing training and guidance.&lt;ref name="Passmore"&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Jonathan |editor-last=Passmore |title=Excellence in Coaching: The Industry Guide |location=London; Philadelphia |publisher= [[Kogan Page]] |year= 2016 |origyear= 2006 |edition=3rd |isbn=9780749474461 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-_ADCwAAQBAJ |oclc=927192333 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learner is sometimes called a ''coachee''. Occasionally, ''coaching'' may mean an informal relationship between two people, of whom one has more experience and expertise than the other and offers advice and guidance as the latter learns; but coaching differs from [[Mentorship|mentoring]] in focusing on specific tasks or objectives, as opposed to more general goals or overall development.&lt;ref name="Passmore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Renton"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jane |last=Renton |title=Coaching and Mentoring: What They are and How to Make the Most of Them |location=New York |publisher=[[Bloomberg Press]] |year=2009 |isbn=9781576603307 |oclc=263978214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/infosys/2011/12/20/business-leadership-for-smarter-org-2/ |title=The Difference Between Coaching And Mentoring |last=Chakravarthy |first=Pradeep |date=20 December 2011 |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Origins==
The first use of the term "coach" in connection with an instructor or trainer arose around 1830 in [[Oxford University]] slang for a tutor who "carried" a student through an exam.&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{Citation | title = coach| url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=coach| publisher = Online Etymology Dictionary| accessdate = 4 July 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "coaching" thus identified a process used to transport people from where they are to where they want to be. The first use of the term in relation to [[sport]]s came in 1861.&lt;ref name="etymonline"/&gt; Historically the development of coaching has been influenced by many fields of activity, including [[adult education]], the [[Human Potential Movement]], [[large-group awareness training]] (LGAT) groups such as "[[Erhard Seminars Training|est]]", [[leadership studies]], [[personal development]], and [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="CompleteHandbook"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cox |editor1-first=Elaine |editor2-last=Bachkirova |editor2-first=Tatiana |editor3-last=Clutterbuck |editor3-first=David |year=2014 |origyear=2010 |edition=2nd |title=The Complete Handbook of Coaching |place=Los Angeles; London |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |isbn=9781446276150 |oclc=868080660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wildflower |first1=Leni |title=The Hidden History of Coaching |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IKGSyKsY-hkC |series=Coaching in practice series |location=Maidenhead |publisher=[[Open University Press]] |date=2013 |isbn=9780335245406 |oclc=820107321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Professional coaching uses a range of communication skills (such as targeted restatements, listening, questioning, clarifying etc.) to help clients shift their perspectives and thereby discover different approaches to achieve their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cox |first=Elaine |year=2013 |title=Coaching Understood: a Pragmatic Inquiry into the Coaching Process |place=Los Angeles; London |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |isbn=9780857028259 |oclc=805014954}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These skills can be used in almost all types of coaching. In this sense, coaching is a form of "meta-profession" that can apply to supporting clients in any human endeavor, ranging from their concerns in health, personal, professional, sport, social, family, political, spiritual dimensions, etc. There may be some overlap between certain types of coaching activities.&lt;ref name="CompleteHandbook"/&gt; Coaching approaches are also influenced by cultural differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosinski |first=Philippe |date=2003 |title=Coaching Across Cultures: New Tools for Leveraging National, Corporate, and Professional Differences |location=London; Yarmouth, Maine |publisher=[[Nicholas Brealey Publishing]] |isbn=1857883012 |oclc=51020293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] coaching was first introduced in 1994 by [[psychiatrist]]s Edward M. Hallowell and John J. Ratey  in their book ''[[Driven to Distraction (ADHD)|Driven to Distraction]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hallowell |first= Edward M. |last2=Ratey |first2=John J. |title=Driven to Distraction: Recognizing and Coping with Attention Deficit Disorder from Childhood Through Adulthood |date=2011 |origyear=1984 |edition=Revised |location=New York |publisher=[[Anchor Books]] |isbn=9780307743152 |oclc=699763760}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADHD coaching is a specialized type of [[#Life|life coaching]] that uses specific techniques designed to assist individuals with [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]]. The goal of ADHD coaching is to mitigate the effects of [[Executive dysfunction|executive function deficit]], which is a typical impairment for people with ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barkley |first1=Russell A. |title=Executive Functions: What They Are, How They Work, and Why They Evolved |date=2012 |location=New York |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |isbn=9781462505357 |oclc=773666263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coaches work with clients to help them better [[Time management|manage time]], organize, set goals and complete projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hamilton |first=Jeff |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/pills-dont-teach-skills/201101/26-benefits-adult-adhd-coaching |title=26 Benefits of Adult ADHD Coaching |publisher=[[Psychology Today]] |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to helping clients understand the impact ADHD has had on their lives, coaches can help clients develop "[[Coping skill|work-around]]" strategies to deal with specific challenges, and determine and use individual strengths. Coaches also help clients get a better grasp of what reasonable expectations are for them as individuals, since people with ADHD "brain wiring" often seem to need external mirrors for accurate self-awareness about their potential despite their impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Knouse |first1=Laura E. |last2=Bagwell |first2=Catherine L. |last3=Barkley |first3=Russell A. |last4=Murphy |first4=Kevin R. |date=May 2005 |title=Accuracy of Self-Evaluation in Adults with ADHD: Evidence from a Driving Study |journal=Journal of Attention Disorders |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=221–234 |doi=10.1177/1087054705280159 |pmid=16110052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[psychologist]]s or [[psychotherapy|psychotherapists]], ADHD coaches do not provide any therapy or treatment: their focus is only on daily functioning and behaviour aspects of the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McCarthy |first=Laura Flynn |title=What You Need to Know about ADHD Coaching |url=http://www.additudemag.com/adhd/article/4002-2.html |publisher=ADDitude Magazine |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of ADHD coaching is to help clients develop an "inner coach", a set of self-regulation and reflective planning skills to deal with daily life challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shenfield |first=Tali |url=http://www.psy-ed.com/wpblog/inner-coach-adhd-and-executive-function/ |title=How to Develop an 'Inner Coach' in Teens with ADHD and Executive Dysfunction |publisher=Advanced Psychology: Child Psychology and Parenting Blog |date=16 October 2014 |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 study from [[Wayne State University]] evaluated the effectiveness of ADHD coaching on 110 students with ADHD.

===Business and executive===
Business coaching is a type of [[human resource development]] for business leaders. It provides positive support, feedback and advice on an individual or group basis to improve personal effectiveness in the business setting, many a time focusing on behavioural changes through [[psychometrics]] or [[360-degree feedback]]. Business coaching is also called executive coaching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stern |first=Lewis R. |date=2004 |title=Executive Coaching: A Working Definition |journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=154–162 |doi=10.1037/1065-9293.56.3.154 |url=http://opm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Executive-coaching-definition-Stern043.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; corporate coaching or leadership coaching. Coaches help their clients advance towards specific professional goals. These include career transition, interpersonal and professional communication, [[performance management]], organizational effectiveness, managing career and personal changes, developing executive presence, enhancing strategic thinking, dealing effectively with conflict, and building an effective team within an organization. An [[Industrial and organizational psychology|industrial organizational psychologist]] is one example of executive coach. Business coaching is not restricted to external experts or providers. Many organizations expect their senior leaders and middle managers to coach their team members to reach higher levels of performance, increased job satisfaction, personal growth, and career development. Research studies suggest that executive coaching has a positive impact on workplace performance with some differences in the impact of internal and external coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Rebecca J. |last2=Woods |first2=Stephen A. |last3=Guillaume |first3=Yves R. F. |date=June 2016 |title=The Effectiveness of Workplace Coaching: A Meta-Analysis of Learning and Performance Outcomes from Coaching |journal=[[Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology]] |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=249–277 |doi=10.1111/joop.12119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, there is no certification or licensing required to be a business or executive coach, and membership of a coaching organization is optional. Further, standards and methods of training coaches can vary widely between coaching organizations. Many business coaches refer to themselves as [[consultant]]s, a broader business relationship than one which exclusively involves coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/independentstreet/2008/04/10/executive-coaching-worth-the-money/ |last=Lorber |first=Laura |title=Executive Coaching – Worth the Money? |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=10 April 2008 |accessdate=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career ===
{{See also|Career counseling}}
[[Career]] coaching focuses on work and career and is similar to [[career counseling]]. Career coaching is not to be confused with life coaching, which concentrates on personal development. Another common term for a career coach is [[career guide]].

===Christian ===
{{See also|Christian counseling}}
A Christian coach is not a pastor or counselor (although the coach may also be qualified in those disciplines), but rather someone who has been professionally trained to address specific coaching goals from a distinctively Christian or biblical perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of Christian Coaching |url=https://christiancoaches.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CCNI-Christian-Coaching-Distinctions.pdf |website=christiancoaches.com |publisher=Christian Coaches Network International |date=October 2017 |accessdate=2018-03-20 |quote=Christian coaching is an approach to the practice of professional coaching—whether focused on personal or professional growth—that integrates the biblical worldview when working with clients to recognize their potential and effect personal change.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Co-coaching===
{{Main article|Co-coaching}}
Co-coaching is a structured practice of coaching between peers with the goal of learning improved coaching techniques.

===Dating===
{{main|Dating coach}}
Dating coaches offer coaching and related products and services to improve their clients' success in dating and relationships.

===Financial ===
{{See also|Financial planner}}
Financial coaching is a relatively new form of coaching that focuses on helping clients overcome their struggle to attain specific financial goals and aspirations they have set for themselves. Financial coaching is a one-on-one relationship in which the coach works to provide encouragement and support aimed at facilitating attainment of the client's financial plans. A ''financial coach'', also called ''money coach'', typically focuses on helping clients to restructure and reduce debt, reduce spending, develop saving habits, and develop financial discipline. In contrast, the term ''[[financial adviser]]'' refers to a wider range of professionals who typically provide clients with financial products and services. Although early research links financial coaching to improvements in client outcomes, much more rigorous analysis is necessary before any causal linkages can be established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=J. Michael |last2=Olive |first2=Peggy |last3=O'Rourke |first3=Collin M. |date=February 2013 |title=Financial Coaching's Potential for Enhancing Family Financial Security |url=http://www.joe.org/joe/2013february/a8.php |journal=Journal of Extension |volume=51 |issue=1 |page=1FEA8 |accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and wellness ===
{{Main article|Health coaching}}
Health coaching is becoming recognized as a new way to help individuals "manage" their illnesses and conditions, especially those of a chronic nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Engel |first=Reed Jordan |date=2011 |title=An Examination of Wellness Coaches and Their Impact on Client Behavioral Outcomes |url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI3479465/ |publisher=[[Purdue University]] |accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coach will use special techniques, personal experience, expertise and encouragement to assist the coachee in bringing his/her behavioral changes about, while aiming for lowered health risks and decreased healthcare costs.&lt;ref name="NSHC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Health Coaches &amp; Health Coaching: Definition, Qualifications, Risk and Responsibility, and Differentiation from Wellness Coaching |publisher=National Society of Health Coaches |url=http://www.nshcoa.com/pdf/NSHCPositionStatementFinal2015.pdf |accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Society of Health Coaches (NSHC) has differentiated the term ''health coach'' from ''wellness coach''.&lt;ref name="NSHC"/&gt; According to the NSHC, health coaches are qualified "to guide those with acute or chronic conditions and/or moderate to high health risk", and wellness coaches provide guidance and inspiration "to otherwise 'healthy' individuals who desire to maintain or improve their overall general health status".&lt;ref name="NSHC"/&gt;

===Homework ===
{{Main article|Homework coach}}
[[Homework]] coaching focuses on equipping a student with the study skills required to succeed academically. This approach is different from regular tutoring which typically seeks to improve a student's performance in a specific subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/08/nyregion/08homework.html |title=Like a Monitor More Than a Tutor |last=Maslin Nir |first=Sarah |date=8 November 2010 |page=A21 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In education===
{{See also|Tutor#Academic coaching}}
Coaching in [[education]] is seen as a useful intervention to support students, faculty and administrators in educational organizations.&lt;ref name="Nieuwerburgh"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nieuwerburgh |first=Christian van |authorlink=Christian van Nieuwerburgh |date=2012 |title=Coaching in Education: Getting Better Results for Students, Educators, and Parents |series=Professional Coaching Series |location=London |publisher=Karnac Books |isbn=9781780490793 |oclc=778418798 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XcO5DRcAGqIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; For students, opportunities for coaching include collaborating with fellow students to improve grades and skills, both academic and social; for teachers and administrators, coaching can help with transitions into new roles.&lt;ref name="Nieuwerburgh"/&gt;

===Life ===
Life coaching is the process of helping people identify and achieve personal goals through developing skills and attitudes that lead to self-empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Cognitive behavioural coaching: Distinctive features|last=Neenan|first=Michael|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781351188555|location=New York|pages=|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although life coaches may have studied [[counseling psychology]] or related subjects, a life coach does not act as a [[Psychotherapy|therapist]], [[Mental health counselor|counselor]], or [[health care provider]], and [[psychological intervention]] lies outside the scope of life coaching. 

===Relationship ===
{{See also|Relationship counseling}}
Relationship coaching is the application of coaching to personal and [[Business relationship management|business relationships]].&lt;ref name="YossiIves2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yossi |first1=Ives |last2=Cox |first2=Elaine |date=2015 |title=Relationship Coaching: The Theory and Practice of Coaching with Singles, Couples and Parents |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kz-LBQAAQBAJ |location=Hove, East Sussex; New York |publisher= [[Routledge]] |isbn=0415737958 |oclc=881498486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports coaching===
{{Main article|Coach (sport)}}
In [[sports]], a coach is an individual that provides supervision and training to the sports team or individual players. Sports coaches are involved in administration, athletic training, competition coaching, and representation of the team and the players.

==Ethics and standards==
{{See also|Licensure|Professional certification|Professional ethics}}
Since the mid-1990s, coaching [[professional association]]s such as the Association for Coaching (AC), the [[European Mentoring and Coaching Council]] (EMCC), the International Association of Coaching (IAC), and the [[International Coach Federation]] (ICF) have worked towards developing training standards.&lt;ref name="Passmore"/&gt;{{rp|287–312}}&lt;ref name="Grant Cavanagh"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grant |first1=Anthony M. |last2=Cavanagh |first2=Michael J. |date=2011 |chapter=Coaching and Positive Psychology: Credentialing, Professional Status, and Professional Bodies |editor1-last=Sheldon |editor1-first=Kennon M. |editor2-last=Kashdan |editor2-first=Todd B. |editor3-last=Steger |editor3-first=Michael F. |title=Designing Positive Psychology: Taking Stock and Moving Forward |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |pages=295–312 |isbn=9780195373585 |oclc=610144651 |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195373585.003.0019 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=5itnDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Jonathan Passmore noted in 2016:&lt;ref name="Passmore"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;While coaching has become a recognized intervention, sadly there are still no standards or licensing arrangements which are widely recognized. Professional bodies have continued to develop their own standards, but the lack of regulation means anyone can call themselves a coach. [...] Whether coaching is a profession which requires regulation, or is professional and requires standards, remains a matter of debate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the challenges in the field of coaching is upholding levels of professionalism, standards and ethics.&lt;ref name="Grant Cavanagh"/&gt; To this end, coaching bodies and organizations have codes of ethics and member standards.&lt;ref name="Passmore"/&gt;{{rp|287–312}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Passmore |first1=Jonathan |last2=Mortimer |first2=Lance |date=2011 |chapter=Ethics in Coaching |editor1-last=Hernez-Broome |editor1-first=Gina |editor2-last=Boyce |editor2-first=Lisa A. |title=Advancing Executive Coaching: Setting the Course for Successful Leadership Coaching |series=The Professional Practice Series |location=San Francisco |publisher=[[Jossey-Bass]] |isbn=9780470553329 |oclc=635455413 |pages=205–227|chapterurl=http://www.jonathanpassmore.com/resources/Ethics%20in%20Coaching%20-%20Passmore%20&amp;%20Mortimer%202011.pdf |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because these bodies are not regulated, and because coaches do not need to belong to such a body, ethics and standards are variable in the field.&lt;ref name="Grant Cavanagh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite web |url=http://coachfederation.org/about/landing.cfm?ItemNumber=854&amp;navItemNumber=634 |title=Code of Ethics |publisher=International Coach Federation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209161631/http://coachfederation.org/about/landing.cfm?ItemNumber=854&amp;navItemNumber=634 |archivedate=9 February 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2016}} And: {{cite web |url=http://www.nfhs.org/nfhs-for-you/coaches/coaches-code-of-ethics/ |title=Coaches Code of Ethics |publisher=National Federation of State High School Associations |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317034840/http://nfhs.org/nfhs-for-you/coaches/coaches-code-of-ethics/ |archivedate=17 March 2015 |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, the AC and the EMCC launched a "Global Code of Ethics" for the entire industry; individuals, associations, and organizations are invited to become signatories to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Woods |first1=Declan |last2=Sleightholm |first2=David |title=For Joint Release on 5th February 2016 - Global Code of Ethics for Coaches and Mentors |publisher=[[PRWeb]] |date=5 February 2016 |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/02/prweb13201905.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208080737/http://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/02/prweb13201905.htm |archivedate=8 February 2016 |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Iordanou |first1=Ioanna |last2=Hawley |first2=Rachel |last3=Iordanou |first3=Christiana |date=2017 |title=Values and Ethics in Coaching |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |isbn=9781473919563 |oclc=948548464 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yuAqDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

With the growing popularity of coaching, many colleges and universities now offer coach training programs that are accredited by a professional association.&lt;ref&gt;For example, a list a programs accredited by the ICF: {{cite web |title=List of All Accredited Coaching Training Programs (ACTP): Hour List |url=http://apps.coachfederation.org/eweb/dynamicpage.aspx?webcode=actpHourList |publisher=[[International Coach Federation]] |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some courses offer a life coach certificate after just a few days of training,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mitchelson |first=Tom |date=6 September 2010 |title=The Life Coach Con: Can You Really Trust Someone to Solve Your Problems? |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1309344/The-life-coach-Can-really-trust-solve-problems.html |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but such courses, if they are accredited at all, are considered "à la carte" training programs, "which may or may not offer start to finish coach training," according to the ICF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Approved Coaching Specific Training Hours (ACSTH): Program Accreditation |url=http://coachfederation.org/program/landing.cfm?ItemNumber=3352 |publisher=[[International Coach Federation]] |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some "all-inclusive" training programs accredited by the ICF require a minimum of 125 student contact hours, 10 hours of mentor coaching and a performance evaluation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Accredited Coaching Training Program (ACTP): Program Accreditation |url=http://coachfederation.org/program/landing.cfm?ItemNumber=2151&amp;navItemNumber=3354 |publisher=[[International Coach Federation]] |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Associate Certified Coach (ACC) – Individual Credentialing – ICF |url=https://www.coachfederation.org/credential/landing.cfm?ItemNumber=2199&amp;navItemNumber=744 |publisher=[[International Coach Federation]] |accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is very little training in comparison to the training requirements of some other helping professions: for example, [[licensure]] as a [[Counseling psychology|counseling psychologist]] in the State of [[California]] requires 3,000 hours of supervised professional experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An Overview of Licensure as a Psychologist |publisher=California Board of Psychology |url=http://www.psychology.ca.gov/applicants/license.shtml |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ICF, for example, offers a "Master Certified Coach" credential that requires demonstration of "2,500 hours (2,250 paid) of coaching experience with at least 35 clients"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Master Certified Coach (MCC) – Individual Credentialing – ICF |url=https://www.coachfederation.org/credential/landing.cfm?ItemNumber=2205&amp;navItemNumber=746 |publisher=[[International Coach Federation]] |accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "Professional Certified Coach" credential with fewer requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Professional Certified Coach (MCC) – Individual Credentialing – ICF |url=https://coachfederation.org/credential/landing.cfm?ItemNumber=2202 |publisher=[[International Coach Federation]] |accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other professional bodies similarly offer entry-level, intermediate, and advanced coach accreditation options.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=-_ADCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA298 "Table 17.1 The different levels of accreditation provided by different professional bodies"], in {{harvtxt|Passmore|2016|p=298}}, for a comparison of different coach accreditation options offered by the AC, EMCC, IAC, ICF, and other professional bodies.&lt;/ref&gt; Some coaches are both certified coaches and licensed counseling psychologists, integrating coaching and counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Popovic |first1=Nash |last2=Jinks |first2=Debra |date=2014 |title=Personal Consultancy: A Model for Integrating Counselling and Coaching |location=London; New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9780415833929 |oclc=842330076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan''' (CSFP) is an international programme under which [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] governments offer scholarships and fellowships to citizens of other Commonwealth countries.

==History==
The plan was originally proposed by Canadian statesman [[Sidney Earle Smith]] in a speech in Montreal on 1 September 1958&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Corbett, "Sidney Earle Smith", University of Toronto Press, 1961, pp 65-66&lt;/ref&gt; and was established in 1959, at the first Conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers (CCEM) held in Oxford, Great Britain. Since then, over 25,000 individuals have held awards, hosted by over twenty countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfp-online.org/about.html About CSFP&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108055153/http://www.csfp-online.org/about.html |date=8 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSFP is one of the primary mechanisms of pan-Commonwealth exchange.

==Organisation==
There is no central body which manages the CSFP. Instead, participation is based on a series of bi-lateral arrangements between home and host countries. The participation of each country is organised by a national nominating agency, which is responsible for advertising awards applicable to their own country and making nominations to host countries.

In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], which is the biggest contributor to the Plan, this process is managed by the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in Britain, a [[non-departmental public body]], and funded by the [[Department for International Development]]. Since 2008, the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] no longer contributes financially to the plan &lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/7306689.stm&lt;/ref&gt; and the number and type of scholarships available for students from more developed Commonwealth countries (Australia, The Bahamas, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Cyprus, Malta, New Zealand, and Singapore) to study in Britain has been reduced.[https://web.archive.org/web/20100629161921/http://www.cscuk.org.uk/apply/developedcommonwealthscholarships.asp]. Other countries, such as Australia, no longer offer scholarships as part of the CSFP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cscuk.org.uk/apply/developedcommonwealthscholarships.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629161921/http://www.cscuk.org.uk/apply/developedcommonwealthscholarships.asp |archivedate=29 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New reforms were developed to strategically align scholarships with mutual interests for business and innovation between Commonwealth nations. During the state visit of President [[Tony Tan]] to the UK in October 2014, Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] announced that the Royal Commonwealth Society of Singapore would be re-established to promote the Commonwealth and to provide new Commonwealth Scholarships and Fellowships in Innovation for Singaporeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/2014/10/reformed-royal-commonwealth-society-of-singapore-to-support-new-commonwealth-scholarships-in-innovation/|title=Reformed Royal Commonwealth Society of Singapore to support new Commonwealth Scholarships in innovation {{!}} Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the UK|website=cscuk.dfid.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship for Innovation were presented in August 2017 to [http://joshuacheong.mit.edu/ Joshua Cheong] and Dr [[Khoo Hsien Hui]] by the Rt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12887">[[File:Shimer comping 66 Recondite.jpg|thumb|[[Shimer College]] students taking a comprehensive exam, 1966.]]
In higher education, a '''comprehensive examination''' (or comprehensive exam or exams), often abbreviated as "comps", is a specific type of [[Test (assessment)|examination]]&lt;ref Name="SDSU"&gt;{{cite web|title=EDTEC Comprehensive Examination |work= |publisher=San Diego State University |year=2006 |url=http://coe.sdsu.edu/comps/ |format=Web |doi= |accessdate=2007-12-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912181627/http://coe.sdsu.edu/comps/ |archivedate=September 12, 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; that must be completed by graduate students in some disciplines and courses of study, and also by undergraduate students in some institutions and departments.  Unlike [[final examination]]s, comprehensive examinations are not linked to any particular course, but rather test knowledge across one or more general fields of study.&lt;ref name="hillmon"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_fSBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58|page=58|title=Getting a Ph.D. in Economics|first=Stuart J.|last=Hillmon|isbn=9780812222883|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduate-level comprehensive examinations are sometimes also known as '''preliminary examinations''' ("[[prelims]]"), '''general examinations''' ("generals"), '''qualifying examinations''' ("quals"), or as '''major field examinations'''.  If these examinations are held orally, they may be known colloquially as "orals". The comps most commonly come after the student has completed required coursework and before starting on the [[dissertation]]; successful passage of the comps is sometimes required for a student to be considered a "Ph.D. candidate".&lt;ref name="tewari"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20120705085036324|title=PhDs – What model works for developing countries?
|first=Devi D|last=Tewari|date=2012-07-08|accessdate=2015-01-11|issue=229|work=University World News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form and general requirements for the comprehensive exam vary according to the [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] or department, [[academic degree|degree]] sought, [[university]], and [[country]], but typically tests knowledge of the student's subject area and two or more related areas, and may be used to determine a candidate's eligibility to continue his or her course of study. At the graduate level, the purpose of the comprehensive exam is to ensure the student is familiar enough with her area of research to make original contributions.

There is no standard definition for what such exams entail, with some universities having almost no exam, whilst at other universities the process is quite rigorous. The exams thus take a number of forms, including an informal meeting of just a few hours, a critical review of one's academic portfolio, the submission of an academic paper which may take several hours or months to write, or a series of proctored exams taking anywhere from a few hours to two days.{{sfn|Rossman|2002|p=62}}

The comprehensive examination system is used primarily in US and Canadian higher education, but it has also been adopted by some programs in other countries such as [[Pakistan]]{{sfn|Bernstein|2014|p=25}} and [[India]].&lt;ref name="tewari"/&gt;  Other countries use alternative forms of evaluating Ph.D. candidates: in the [[United Kingdom]], for example, students typically must first enroll in an [[M.Phil.]] program and are then admitted to doctoral study only upon successfully defending their research proposal.&lt;ref name="tewari"/&gt;{{sfn|Bernstein|2014|p=25-26}}

==Undergraduate==
Some colleges or universities in the United States require undergraduate students to pass comprehensive examinations in order to receive their degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vggNcSIVIwsC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;|page=106|title=Investing in Your College Education|year=2009|isbn=9780547199856|first=Kathleen|last=Hartman|author2=Stewart, Thomas  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[Wabash College]], [[Kenyon College]], [[Bethany College (West Virginia)|Bethany College]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethanywv.edu/about-bethany/news/2005-06-news-archive/bethany-college-seniors-take-comprehensive-exami BETHANY COLLEGE SENIORS TAKE COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATIONS] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120724142846/http://www.bethanywv.edu/about-bethany/news/2005-06-news-archive/bethany-college-seniors-take-comprehensive-exami |date=2012-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Catholic University of America]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://policies.cua.edu/academicundergrad//acregsfull.cfm Academic Regulations for Undergraduates] -Catholic University of America&lt;/ref&gt; [[The University of Iowa]], [[Maryville College]], [[Occidental College]], [[Reed College]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reed.edu/academic/gbook/acad_pol/qual.html Guidebook Junior qualifying examination] – Reed College&lt;/ref&gt; [[The University of the South]], [[Eckerd College]], [[Millsaps College]], [[Earlham College]], [[Hanover College]], [[Rosemont College]], [[St. Anselm College]], [[Shimer College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shimer.edu/about/academics/curriculum/comps.php|title=The Comprehensive Exams|publisher=Shimer College|accessdate=2015-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Whitman College]], [[North South University]] and [[University of Dallas]].

Many degree programs require students to pass comprehensive examinations within colleges or universities that don't otherwise require them.  The same is true for many schools and colleges within larger universities. These include Texas A&amp;M-Commerce Honors College, [[The University of Virginia]]'s Politics Honors Program,&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.virginia.edu/honors/ Politics Honors at UVa] - Politics Honors&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]]'s Mass Communications program.

==Graduate==

===Master's===
In some terminal non-[[thesis]] Master's programs, successful completion of a comprehensive examination, conducted online or through the university's testing center, is a requirement for graduation during a student's last semester of coursework. A prominent example of such is the [[Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration]] (MFT-MBA) which has been used in the MBA programs of over 300 U.S. universities.&lt;ref name="2013 4FMF Data Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |title=2013 Major Field Test Comparative Data Guide: Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration (MBA) |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=November 2, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194137/http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |archivedate=January 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive exam may also be required for a master's degree earned on the way to the completion of a [[doctoral]] program. In such cases, students might take an [[oral exam]] and/or field exam in order to both earn a Master's in their field and advance to the status of doctoral or [[PhD candidate]]. Typically, one exam will question the student on [[theory]] while the other will show competency or expertise in their chosen subfield (or [[major field]]) within their program.  This also allows students enrolled in the program who do not wish to continue to the completion of a doctoral degree to leave early and in [[good standing]] with a Master's.

===Doctoral===
In most doctoral programs, students must take a series of written cumulative examinations on the subject of their study in the first year or two of the PhD program. These cumulative exams are often given on a pass/fail basis and a graduate student who seeks to continue in the PhD program must pass a minimum number of these cumulative exams. After this minimum number of cumulative exams is passed, this degree requirement is considered to be met, and the PhD student no longer takes these exams but continues work on other PhD requirements. In some fields, such as [[history]], the student must pass the comprehensive examinations before submitting a [[dissertation]] proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Navigating World History: Historians Create a Global Past|first=Patrick |last=Manning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5SXIAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA335|page=335|isbn=9781403973856|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, comprehensive exams consist of either a written or an oral exam, but some programs require both.{{sfn|Gonsalves|2011|p=204}} In others, a written exam is taken, and depending on the grade, the student may or may not have to continue with an oral exam. In some fields, the level of detailed knowledge required is relatively limited, while in others such as economics the level of detail is similar to a final exam.&lt;ref name="hillmon"/&gt;

Comprehensive examinations are often based on a reading list agreed upon by the student and his or her committee, which is staffed by the primary supervisor and several advisors, normally professors at the university, but not necessarily in the same faculty. They also frequently have a standardized component for all students in the discipline, or may be entirely standardized.{{sfn|Rossman|2002|p=63}} This reading list may comprise dozens or hundreds of books and other works.

For some social science and many humanities disciplines, graduate students might not have studied the discipline at the undergraduate level. These examinations will be the first set of comprehensive exams, and be based either on graduate coursework or on specific preparatory reading (sometimes up to a year's work in reading).

Preparing for comprehensive exams is normally both stressful and time consuming.{{sfn|Gonsalves|2011|p=203}} Passing them allows the student to stay, begin doctoral research, and rise to the status of a doctoral candidate. Failing usually results in the student leaving the program or re-taking the test after some time has passed.{{sfn|Gonsalves|2011|p=212}} A second failure normally guarantees dismissal from the graduate program, though progress on previous attempts may convince the student's program to grant a third, final attempt. Some schools have an intermediate category, passing at the master's level, which does not permit the student to continue doctoral study, but does allow the student to leave with a master's degree despite not having completed a thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Duke University Graduate School|title=Qualifying exams|accessdate=2015-01-11|url=http://www.math.duke.edu/graduate/qual.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some U.S. graduate programs, particularly in the natural sciences, the majority of students do not have master's degrees when they begin doctoral work, and the successful students will earn doctorates without getting master's degrees on the way. In these programs, a student who does not pass "comps" or "prelims" on the second attempt will generally be allowed to earn a terminal master's degree but is not permitted to become a candidate for a doctoral degree. At some institutions, students who pass the exam and are formally accepted as PhD candidates are technically entitled to a Master of Arts or Master of Sciences degree, but submitting an application is required, so no master's degree will be awarded unless the student specifically requests it.  Other institutions issue an [[All But Dissertation]] certificate after a student has passed the comprehensive exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://manoa.hawaii.edu/graduate/content/doctorate|publisher=University of Hawaii Manoa|accessdate=2015-01-11|title=Degree Requirements: Doctorate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PhD students at some Canadian universities must complete their comprehensive exams by the end of their second year; those who fail to pass with a sufficiently high mark may retake the examination usually only once. Failure to pass a second time will normally result in expulsion from the program. Students who pass are distinguished with the title "PhD candidate."{{sfn|Bernstein|2014|p=25}}

'''''Demand-side learning''''' is a phrase coined by Ramon Casadesus-Masanell and [[Pankaj Ghemawat]] of [[Harvard Business School]] in the article ''[[Microsoft]] vs. [[Open Source]]: Who Will Win?'' by Sean Silverthorne from June 6, 2005. 

Demand-side learning refers to [[open source software]]'s ability to be modified by the user community at large as needs and wants those who use the software at no charge, they have the incentive to modify the software and learn about how it works. Ramon Casadesus-Masanell and Pankaj Ghemawat also suggest that regardless of the strength of Linux's demand-side learning this alone is not sufficient for Linux to win the competitive battle against Windows.

'''Education Otherwise''' (EO) is a registered [[Charitable organization|charity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1055120}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[England]] for families whose children are being educated otherwise than at school, and for those who wish to uphold the freedom of families to take responsibility for the education of their children. It provides support and information online, by telephone and through a [[bi-monthly]] newsletter to members throughout the [[UK]] and overseas.

Established in the mid-1970s, it took its name from the (then current) [[Education Act 1944|1944 Education Act]] (Section 36) which stated that parents are responsible for the education of their children, "either by regular attendance at school or '''otherwise'''". This clause has been retained in subsequent [[:Category:United Kingdom Education Acts|Education Acts]] (currently section 7 of the 1996 Education Act)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1996/ukpga_19960056_en_2#pt1-ch1-pb3-l1g7 Education Act 1996 (Section 7)]&lt;/ref&gt; and remains an indication of the validity afforded to an education other than by schooling.&lt;ref&gt;Scotland and Northern Ireland have similar legislation. In Scotland the wording is "or by other means" rather than "otherwise"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In 1972, Royston Lambert, head of [[Dartington Hall#Dartington Hall School|Dartington Hall School]] asked Dick Kitto, who had been working there since 1955, to set up a project in conjunction with [[Northcliffe School (Conisbrough)|Northcliffe School]] to provide education for a group of non-academic students who would have to take another year in school due to the pending [[Raising of school leaving age in the UK#Leaving age raised to 16|raising of the school leaving age]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Duane (head teacher)|Duane, Michael]]. ''The Terrace: An Educational Experiment in a State School''. [[Freedom Press (UK)|Freedom Press]]. 1995. {{ISBN|0-900384-78-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kitto established a free school or [[democratic school]] model for the running of the project and was impressed by the qualities of the students even though they had effectively [[Unschooling|unschooled]] themselves within the school system, where they were perceived as trouble makers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Interview with Dick Kitto, ''Education Otherwise Newsletter'' (Number 61), August 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitto's ''school'' caught the attention of Stan Windass, who had been working for a [[children's rights]] centre in [[London]], through which he had become aware of several families who were educating their own children. Windass had just taken the lease of [[Lower Shaw Farm]] and wanted to establish it as a centre to explore ideas for an alternative society. Windass asked Kitto to become the warden at Lower Shaw Farm after the Northcliffe School project ended.

Kitto was familiar with ideas about unschooled education through reading [[John Caldwell Holt|John Holt]] and Joy Baker's ''Children in Chancery''&lt;ref&gt;Published by [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]] in 1964 - now out of print&lt;/ref&gt; along with his experiences at the Northcliffe School project. He and Windass were able to contact several families who were educating otherwise and arranged an informal network, and occasional meetings, between them throughout 1975 and 1976.

During 1976, [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]] made a programme about the group which resulted in around 200 enquiries and expanded the membership to over 50.  The informal nature of the group could not handle such a level of interest and so, at a meeting in September 1976 which included five [[deschooling]] families, a more formal structure for the group was established with stated aims and a regular newsletter. In 1977, Kitto presented a [[BBC Television|BBC TV]] ''[[Open Door (BBC TV)|Open Door]]'' programme about the ideas behind the organisation. This resulted in over 2,000 enquiries and increased the membership to around 250.&lt;ref&gt;A tribute to Dick Kitto, ''Education Otherwise Newsletter'' (Number 130), October 1999 - citing obituaries from the ''Daily Telegraph'' and ''The Guardian'' newspapers.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oldeotriangle.png|left|thumb|Original EO logo]]
The original logo (based on a UK traffic sign) was intended to represent a child breaking-out of the confines of school, and pointing towards a different way. It was submitted to a printer with the request that, before printing, the 'foot' be made to look more as though it was kicking the triangle open; the originator of the drawing had always remained unhappy with that foot and at a later opportunity the logo was amended slightly to make it less like what the originator saw as a "goose-step".{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Conflict and development==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Eo newsletter 50 1986.jpg|right|thumb|EO Newsletter Cover Dec. 1986 - 10 Years issue]] --&gt;
With the steady growth in numbers of members, around 1,500 in 1986 (tenth anniversary) rising to 2,278 in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;Chairpersons Report, ''EO Newsletter'' April/May 1992 (issue 85)&lt;/ref&gt; it was recognised that a trend away from the original [[ethos]] of EO was developing. There was much debate about its structure. The April/May 1993 newsletter (Issue 91) featured an EO Restructuring Supplement presenting various options for "the way forward". By the mid-1990s, it was being recognised that people were joining EO due to a "crisis" and wanted to get their child out of the school system, rather than coming to it with an interest in exploring alternative education provision.&lt;ref&gt;''The Changing Face of EO'' (''Newsletter'' 98, June 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; There was disaffection with the way the organisation was run via national gatherings which were seen as alienating the majority of members. The debate broadly split into those that wanted to follow a structured style of education with a "managed" organisation and those who valued an informal approach and rejecting the status of charitable trust and company limited by guarantee.

A short lived faction, Education Otherwise Unlimited, laid out the conflicting areas with the organisation's structure in a table:&lt;ref&gt;August/September 1994 ''Newsletter'' (Issue 99)&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Original EO Ethos
! Present Structure
|-
| Decisions reached by consensus, everyone had an equal voice. No exclusive meetings.
| Directors hold meetings, at which "non-directors should not really interrupt proceedings"&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of directors meeting 19 March 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| People got together from all over the country for discussion &amp; to share ideas, chance to examine lifestyle, outlook etc.
| Limited company status - said to be needed for protection against legal action.
|-
| Moral support was intrinsic. Children welcome and integral to meetings.
| Single day meetings. Adult only meetings.
|}

The original "ethos" grew out of the attitudes and aspirations of the original members. It was not laid down from the start. Kitto saw EO in broad [[human rights]] terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As far as I'm concerned, E.O. does not have a particular kind of education to which it is committed. It is committed to the right of families to do what they want to do. It is a humans ([[sic]]) rights organisation. I don't feel we must do this, or we must do that. It is up to the members. To me it is not a specific thing where children have to run wild in the country, or have to pay visits to [[Winchester Cathedral]], or anything else. There is this huge variation. Some people join EO in order to give their children a good classical education which they cannot get at school. I have a fundamental belief in the [[freedom of choice]]. We must all be allowed to make our own mistakes. We don't want to be dictated to by a [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|curriculum from central government]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Parent's Charter==
In 1991, the government introduced a Parent's Charter (subtitled: "You and Your Child's Education") which promised parents reports about their children and their schools. In 1994, a revised version of the Parent's Charter (subtitled: Our Children's Education) was issued.  Page 9 included the sentence - "You have a duty to make sure that your child goes to school until he or she is 16." EO members were concerned that this [[misinformation]] should be corrected as it was being delivered to every household.

They appointed [[Solicitor#England and Wales|solicitor]] Peter Liell who sent "Letters Before Action" notices to the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)#History|Department for Education]] and to the [[Welsh Office]]. A reply by [[Eric Forth]] (9 July 1994) for the DfE claimed that the Parent's Charter could not be taken as a definitive guide to the law - the Charter "cannot take in every exception or reflect all points of detail". The department stated that there were no plans to issue a [[Erratum|corrigendum]]. The Welsh Office response was a confirmation that the Charter for Parents in Wales had been revised and would reflect the fact that not all children were educated in schools.

The matter was raised by [[Don Foster (politician)|Don Foster]] in a [[Parliamentary question#Question time in the UK|Parliamentary Question]] which was responded to by [[Robin Squire]] stating that [[John Patten, Baron Patten|John Patten]], the [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Secretary of State for Education]], saw no need to issue a correction or to make a statement about the mistake.

As English and Welsh education law are identical there were no grounds for the variation in the responses of the two bodies. The solicitor notified the DfE that he had been instructed to prepare an application for leave to apply for [[Judicial review in English Law|judicial review]] of the decision as stated in Forth's letter. This threat caused an immediate response from the department that they "would want to find a different - in your eyes more satisfactory - wording for any further editions". The solicitor responded seeking confirmation, by 31 August 1994, that a future edition would include reference to the fact that children do not have to go to school. Forth once again responded accepting the need for a revised text: "I am, however, happy to confirm, in the light of your client's concerns, our intention that any future edition of the Parent's Charter in England will include a reference, be it explicit or implicit, to a parent's lawful right to ensure that his child is suitably educated otherwise than at school."

It was felt that this was as far as EO could go with the matter and the application for judicial review was withdrawn. The whole process had cost EO almost £4,000 but had generated a lot of publicity and raised awareness of the issue as many members had raised their concerns with their own [[Member of Parliament|MP]].

'''Education sciences''' (traditionally often called '''pedagogy''')&lt;ref&gt;[https://ies.ed.gov/director/board/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://learn.org/articles/What_is_Education_Science.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; and '''education theory''' seek to describe, understand, and prescribe educational policy and practice. Education sciences include many topics, such as [[pedagogy]], [[andragogy]], [[curriculum]], [[Learning theory (education)|learning]], and education [[policy]], [[organizational theory|organization]] and [[leadership]]. Educational thought is informed by many disciplines, such as [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[sociology]], and [[psychology]]. 

Faculties, departments, degree programs, and degrees on educational sciences are often called simply ''Faculty of Education'' etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uta.fi/en/faculty-of-education ]&lt;/ref&gt; It is likewise common, especially in North America, to say ''she is studying education'', which is generally called ''studying educational science(s)'' nowadays and was traditionally called ''studying pedagogy'' (in English) in most European countries.

For example, a cultural theory of education considers how education occurs through the totality of culture, including prisons, households, and religious institutions as well as schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Philip H. Phenix| title = Educational Theory and Inspiration| journal = Educational Theory| volume = 13| issue = 1| pages = 1–64| date = January 1963| doi=10.1111/j.1741-5446.1963.tb00101.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

''Foundations of American Education'', 6th Ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merill, pp. 77-80,192-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known attempts to understand education in Europe were by [[Ancient Greeks|classical Greek]] [[philosophers]] and [[sophists]], but there is also evidence of contemporary (or even preceding) discussions among Arabic, Indian, and Chinese scholars.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Educational thought==
{{see also|Philosophy of education|History of Education}}
Educational thought is not necessarily concerned with the construction of theories as much as the "reflective examination of educational issues and problems from the perspective of diverse disciplines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Journal of Thought| url = http://www.journalofthought.com| accessdate = 19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normative theories of education==
Normative theories of education provide the norms, goals, and standards of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theradicalacademy.org/phillangames1.html|title=Philosophy of Education and Wittgenstein's Concept of Language-Games|website=www.theradicalacademy.org|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational philosophies===
{{Main|Philosophy of education}}
"Normative philosophies or theories of education may make use of the results of [philosophical thought] and of factual inquiries about human beings and the psychology of learning, but in any case they propound views about what education should be, what dispositions it should cultivate, why it ought to cultivate them, how and in whom it should do so, and what forms it should take.  In  a full-fledged philosophical normative theory of education, besides analysis of the sorts described, there will normally be propositions of the following kinds:
1.	Basic normative premises about what is good or right;
2.	Basic factual premises about humanity and the world;
3.	Conclusions, based on these two kinds of premises, about the dispositions education should foster;
4.	Further factual premises about such things as the psychology of learning and methods of teaching; and
5.	Further conclusions about such things as the methods that education should use."&lt;ref name=POEE&gt;{{Citation   | last1 = Frankena   | first1 = William K.   | last2 =  Raybeck   | first2 = Nathan | last3 =  Burbules   | first3 = Nicholas | contribution =  Philosophy of Education  | year = 2002   | title = Encyclopedia of Education, 2nd edition   | editor-last =  Guthrie  | editor-first = James W.  | place =  New York, NY  | publisher =  Macmillan Reference  | isbn= 0-02-865594-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of the purpose of schools include:&lt;ref&gt;Webb, DL, A Metha, and KF Jordan (2010). ''Foundations of American Education'', 6th Ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merill, pp. 55-91&lt;/ref&gt; to develop reasoning about perennial questions, to master the methods of scientific inquiry, to cultivate the intellect, to create change agents, to develop spirituality, and to model a democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, W. (2012). ''Is Modern American Public Education Promoting a Sane Society'', in "International Journal of Science" 2nd Ed. ISSN 2225-7063, pp. 69-81, http://issuu.com/ijosc.net/docs/ijosc?mode=window&amp;viewMode=doublePage&lt;/ref&gt;

Common educational philosophies include: [[educational perennialism]], [[educational progressivism]], [[educational essentialism]], [[critical pedagogy]], [[montessori method|Montessori education]], [[Waldorf education]], and [[democratic education]].

===Curriculum theory===
{{Main|Curriculum theory}}
Normative [[curriculum theory|theories of curriculum]] aim to "describe, or set norms, for conditions surrounding many of the concepts and constructs" that define [[curriculum]].&lt;ref name="Beauchamp pp. 23–27"&gt;{{Cite journal   | last = Beauchamp  | first = George A. | title = Curriculum Theory: Meaning, Development, and Use   | journal = Theory into Practice   | volume = 21  |number = 1 | pages =23–27   | date = Winter 1982 | doi=10.1080/00405848209542976}}&lt;/ref&gt; These normative propositions differ from those above in that normative curriculum theory is not necessarily untestable.&lt;ref name="Beauchamp pp. 23–27"/&gt;  A central question asked by normative curriculum theory is: given a particular educational philosophy, what is worth knowing and why? Some examples are: a deep understanding of the [[Great Books]], direct experiences driven by student interest, a superficial understanding of a wide range knowledge (e.g. [[Core knowledge]]), social and community problems and issues, knowledge and understanding specific to cultures and their achievements (e.g. [[African-Centered Education]]).

=== Feminist educational theory ===

==== Background ====
Scholars such as Robyn Wiegman argue that, “academic feminism is perhaps the most successful institutionalizing project of its generation, with more full-time faculty positions and new doctoral degree programs emerging each year in the field it inaugurated, Women's Studies”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Feminism against Itself|last = Wiegman|first = Robyn|date = 2002|journal = NWSA Journal|volume=14.2|pp=18-37|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist educational theory stems from four key tenets, supported by empirical data based on surveys of feminist educators.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Feminist Pedagogy in Theory and Practice: An Empirical Investigation|last = Hoffmann|first = Frances L|date = 1998|journal = NWSA Journal|volume=10.1|pp=79-97|doi = |pmid = |first2 = Jayne E|last2 = Stake}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first tenet of feminist educational theory is, “Creation of participatory classroom communities”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Participatory classroom communities often are smaller classes built around discussion and student involvement. The second tenet is, “Validation of personal experience”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Classrooms in which validation of personal experience occur often are focused around students providing their own insights and experiences in group discussion, rather than relying exclusively on the insight of the educator. The third tenet is, “Encouragement of social understanding and activism”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This tenet is generally actualized by classrooms discussing and reading about social and societal aspects that students may not be aware of, along with breeding student self-efficacy. The fourth and final tenet of feminist education is, “Development of critical thinking skills/open-mindedness”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Classrooms actively engaging in this tenet encourage students to think for themselves and prompt them to move beyond their comfort zones, working outside the bounds of the traditional lecture-based classroom. Though these tenets at times overlap, they combine to provide the basis for modern feminist educational theory, and are supported by a majority of feminist educators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Feminist educational theory derives from the [[feminist movement]], particularly that of the early 1970s, which prominent feminist [[bell hooks]] describes as, “a movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminism is for Everybody|last = hooks|first = bell|publisher = South End Press|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic feminist Robyn Weigman recalls that, “In the early seventies, feminism in the U.S. academy was less an organized entity than a set of practices: an ensemble of courses listed on bulletin boards often taught for free by faculty and community leaders”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While feminism traditionally existed outside of the institutionalization of schools (particularly universities), feminist education has gradually taken hold in the last few decades and has gained a foothold in institutionalized educational bodies. “Once fledgling programs have become departments, and faculty have been hired and tenured with full-time commitments”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Opposition ====
Opposition to feminist educational theory comes from both those who oppose feminism in general and feminists who oppose feminist educational theory in particular. Critics of feminist educational theory argue against the four basic tenets of the theory, “… [contesting] both their legitimacy and their implementation”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Lewis Lehrman]] particularly describes feminist educational ideology as, “… 'therapeutic pedagogy' that substitutes an 'overriding' (and detrimental) value on participatory interaction for the expertise of the faculty” (Hoffman). Lehrman argues that the feminist educational tenets of participatory experience and validation of person experience hinder education by limiting and inhibiting the educator’s ability to share his or her knowledge, learned through years of education and experience.

Others challenge the legitimacy of feminist educational theory, arguing that it is not unique and is instead a sect of liberatory education. Even feminist educational scholars such as Frances Hoffmann and Jayne Stake are forced to concede that, “feminist pedagogy shared intellectual and political roots with the movements comprising the liberatory education agenda of the past 30 years”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These liberatory attempts at the democratization of classrooms demonstrate a growth in liberatory education philosophy that some argue feminist educational theory simply piggybacks off of.

The harshest critiques of feminist educational theory often come from feminists themselves. Feminist scholar Robyn Wiegman argues against feminist education in her article “Academic Feminism against Itself,” arguing that feminist educational ideology has abandoned the [[intersectionality]] of feminism in many cases, and has also focused exclusively on present content with a singular perspective. Wiegman refers to feminist scholar James Newman's arguments, centered around the idea that, “When we fail… to challenge both students and ourselves to theorize alterity as an issue of change over time as well as of geographic distance, ethnic difference, and sexual choice, we repress… not only the ‘thickness’ of historical difference itself, but also… our (self) implication in a narrative of progress whose hero(in)es inhabit only the present”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Newman (and Wiegman) believe that this presentist ideology imbued within modern academic feminism creates an environment breeding antifeminist ideologies, most importantly an abandonment of the study of difference, integral to feminist ideology. Wiegman believes that feminist educational theory does a great disservice to the feminist movement, while failing to instill the critical thinking and social awareness that feminist educational theory is intended to.

==== Support ====
There are supporters of feminist education as well, many of whom are educators or students. Student-turned-professor Becky Ropers-Huilman recounts one of her positive experiences with feminist education from the student perspective, explaining that she “… felt very ‘in charge’ of [her] own learning experiences,” and “… was not being graded-or degraded... [while completing] the majority of the assigned work for the class (and additional work that [she] thought would add to class discussion),” all while “… [regarding] the teacher’s feedback on [her] participation as one perspective, rather than the perspective”.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Scholarship on the Other Side: Power and Caring in Feminist Education|last = Ropers-Huilman|first = Becky|date = 1998|journal = NWSA Journal|volume=11.1|pp=118-135|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ropers experienced a working feminist classroom that successfully motivated students to go above and beyond, succeeding in generating self-efficacy and caring in the classroom. When Ropers became a teacher herself, she embraced feminist educational theory, noting that, “[Teachers] have an obligation as the ones who are vested with an assumed power, even if that power is easily and regularly disrupted, to assess and address the effects that it is having in our classrooms”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ropers firmly believes that educators have a duty to address feminist concepts such as the use and flow of power within the classroom, and strongly believes in the potential of feminist educational theory to create positive learning experiences for students and teachers as she has personally experienced.

Becky Ropers-Huilman also celebrates the feminist classroom’s inclusivity, noting that in a feminist classroom, “in which power is used to care about, for, and with others… educational participants can shape practices aimed at creating an inclusive society that discovers and utilizes the potential of its actors”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ropers believes that a feminist classroom carries the ability to greatly influence the society as a whole, promoting understanding, caring, and inclusivity. Ropers actively engages in feminist education in her classes, focusing on concepts such as [[active learning]] and [[critical thinking]] while attempting to demonstrate and engage in caring behavior and atypical classroom settings, similar to many other feminist educators.

Leading feminist scholar bell hooks argues for the incorporation of feminism into all aspects of society, including education, in her book ''[[Feminism is for Everybody]].'' hooks notes that, “Everything [people] know about feminism has come into their lives thirdhand”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; hooks believes that education offers a counter to the, “… wongminded notion of feminist movement which implied it was anti-male”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; hooks cites feminism’s negative connotations as major inhibitors to the spread and adoption of feminist ideologies. However, feminist education has seen tremendous growth in adoption in the past few decades, despite the negative connotations of its parent movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Descriptive theories of education==
Descriptive theories of education provide descriptions or explanations of the processes of education.

===Curriculum theory===
{{Main|Curriculum theory}}
Descriptive theories of curriculum explain how curricula "benefit or harm all publics it touches".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last =  Connelly  | first =  F. Michael   | last2 =  Fang He  | first2 =  Ming  | last3 =  JoAnn  | last4 = Phillion | title =  The SAGE Handbook of Curriculum and Instruction  | publisher =  Sage  | year =  2008  | chapter = Curriculum in Theory  | page = 394 | isbn = 978-1-4129-0990-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal   | last = Scott  | first = Harry V. | title = A Primer of Curriculum Theory: Descriptive Theory   | journal = Educational Theory   | volume = 18  |number = 2 | pages =118–124   | date = April 1968 | doi=10.1111/j.1741-5446.1968.tb00342.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[hidden curriculum]] describes that which is learned simply by being in a [[learning environment]]. For example, a student in a teacher-led classroom is learning submission. The hidden curriculum is not necessarily intentional.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Jane. “What Should We Do with a Hidden Curriculum When We Find One?” The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. Ed. Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 122–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instructional theory===
{{main|Pedagogy}}
{{see also|Educational technology}}
Instructional theories focus on the methods of instruction for teaching [[curriculum|curricula]].  Theories include the methods of: [[Self-paced instruction|autonomous learning]], [[coyote teaching]], [[inquiry-based instruction]], [[lecture]], [[maturationism]], [[socratic method]], [[outcome-based education]], [[taking children seriously]], [[transformative learning]]

===The nature of the learner and of learning===
{{main|Philosophical anthropology|Philosophy of education|Educational psychology|Educational neuroscience}}

'''Philosophical Anthropology'''

[[Philosophical anthropology]] is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] study of [[human nature]].  In terms of learning, examples of descriptive theories of the learner are: a mind, soul, and spirit capable of emulating the Absolute Mind ([[Idealism]]); an orderly, sensing, and rational being capable of understanding the world of things ([[Philosophical realism|Realism]]), a rational being with a soul modeled after God and who comes to know God through reason and revelation ([[Neo-Thomism]]), an evolving and active being capable of interacting with the environment ([[Pragmatism]]), a fundamentally free and individual being who is capable of being authentic through the making of and taking responsibility for choices ([[Existentialism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Webb, DL, A Metha, and KF Jordan (2010). ''Foundations of American Education'', 6th Ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merill, pp. 55-62&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophical concepts for the process of education include ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726015042/http://www.eaea.org/index.php?k=15098 Bildung]'' and ''[[paideia]]''.

'''Educational Psychology'''

[[Educational psychology]] is an [[Empiricism#Scientific usage|empirical science]] that provides descriptive theories of how people learn.  Examples of theories of education in psychology are: [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]], [[behaviorism]], [[Cognitive psychology|cognitivism]], and [[Motivational Theory|motivational theory]]

'''Educational Neuroscience'''

[[Educational neuroscience]] is an emerging field that brings together researchers in diverse disciplines to explore the interactions between biological processes and education.&lt;ref name = AnsariCoch&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ansari | first1 = D | authorlink1 = | last2 = Coch | first2 = D | year = 2006 | title = Bridges over troubled waters: Education and cognitive neuroscience | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 146–151 | publisher = Elsevier Science | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2006.02.007 | pmid = 16530462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology of education===
{{main|Sociology of education}}
The [[sociology of education]] is the study of how public [[institution]]s and individual experiences affect [[education]] and its outcomes. It is most concerned with the public schooling systems of modern industrial societies, including the expansion of [[higher education|higher]], [[further education|further]], [[adult education|adult]], and [[continuing education|continuing]] education.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Gordon Marshall (ed) ''A Dictionary of Sociology'' (Article: Sociology of Education), Oxford University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of theories of education from sociology include: [[Sociology of education#Structural functionalism|functionalism]], [[Sociology of education#Education and social reproduction|conflict theory]], [[social efficiency]], and [[social mobility]].

===Educational anthropology===
{{main|Educational anthropology}}
[[Educational anthropology]] is a sub-field of [[anthropology]] and is widely associated with the pioneering work of [[George Spindler]].  As the name would suggest, the focus of educational anthropology is obviously on education, although an anthropological approach to education tends to focus on the cultural aspects of education, including informal as well as formal education. As education involves understandings of who we are, it is not surprising that the single most recognized dictum of educational anthropology is that the field is centrally concerned with cultural transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Comitas, L. and Dolgin, J. 1979. '[http://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1220&amp;context=faculty_scholarship On Anthropology and Education: Retrospect and Prospect]'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15037">The '''generation effect''' is a phenomenon where information is better [[memory|remembered]] if it is generated from one's own mind rather than simply [[reading (process)|read]].&lt;ref name="jacoby"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacoby |first= L.L. |year=1978 |title=On interpreting the effects of repetition: Solving a problem versus remembering a solution |journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=649–668 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-5371(78)90393-6 |url=http://psych.wustl.edu/amcclab/Manuscripts/Jacoby/Jacoby%20(1978)/Retention%20Effects%20of%20Solving%20vs.%20Remembering.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have struggled to account for why generated information is better recalled than read information, but no single explanation has been sufficient.

==In experiments==
The generation effect is typically achieved in [[cognitive psychology]] experiments by asking participants to generate words from word fragments.&lt;ref name=crutcher&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crutcher |first=R.J. |author2=Healy, A.F. |year=1989 |title=Cognitive operations and the generation effect |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=669–675  |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.15.4.669}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has also been demonstrated using a variety of other materials, such as when generating a word after being presented with its [[antonym]]&lt;ref name="mulligan" /&gt; or [[synonym]],&lt;ref name="jacoby"/&gt; generating keywords in paragraphs,&lt;ref name="dewinstanley"&gt;{{cite journal |last=deWinstanley |first=P.A. |author2=Bjork, E.L. |year=2004 |title=Processing strategies and the generation effect: Implications for making a better reader |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=945–955|doi=10.3758/BF03196872}}&lt;/ref&gt; pictures,&lt;ref name=kinjo&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kinjo |first= H. |author2=Snodgrass, J.G. |year=2000 |title=Does the generation effect occur for pictures? |journal=The American Journal of Psychology |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=95–121 |doi=10.2307/1423462|pmid=10742845 |jstor=1423462}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arithmetic problems.&lt;ref name="crutcher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcnamara"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McNamara |first=D.S. |author2=Healy, A.F. |year=2000 |title=A procedural explanation of the generation effect for simple and difficult multiplication problems and answers |journal=Journal of Memory and Language |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=652–679  |doi=10.1006/jmla.2000.2720 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the generation effect has been found in studies using [[free recall]], [[cued recall]], and recognition tests.&lt;ref name="mulligan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mulligan |first=N.W. |year=2001 |title=Generation and hypermnesia |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=436–450|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.27.2.436}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, the subject was provided with a stimulus word, the first letter of the response, and a word relating the two. For example, with the rule of opposite, the stimulus word "hot", and the letter "c", the word cold would be generated. This methodology has since been used in the majority of experiments investigating the generation effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport|last=McNamara|first=Danielle|title=The Generation Effect: A Detailed Analysis of the Role of Semantic Processing|url=http://ics.colorado.edu/techpubs/pdf/92-02.pdf|publisher=Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Colorado|id=92-02|date=1992|citeseerx=10.1.1.20.3266|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818140359/http://ics.colorado.edu/techpubs/pdf/92-02.pdf|archivedate=2007-08-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

===Lexical activation hypothesis===
According to the lexical activation hypothesis, the participant must search his or her [[semantic memory]] during the process of generation. The search activates [[semantic]] features in memory that are related to the target item. During the retrieval of the target item at testing, the semantic features serve as retrieval cues and aid in the recall of the target item.&lt;ref name="crutcher"/&gt; One study done by Payne, Neely, and Burns further tested this hypothesis. Their research question was: will the generation effect occur for words only or also [[non-word]]s? To test this they studied 168 Purdue undergraduate students. The researchers divided the participants up into two groups. The first group had word or non word pairs that rhymed and were told to read both out loud. The second group had a word or non word and the first letter of the next followed by blanks, and were told to read the first word out loud and generate a word that rhymed with the first word and started with the letter presented. The results were as expected. Participants were only generating words rather than non words according to the lexical activation hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Payne|first=David |author2=James Neely |author3=Daniel Burns|title=The Generation Effect: Further Tests of the Lexical Activation Hypothesis|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|date= 1986|volume=14|issue=3 |pages=246–252|doi=10.3758/BF03197700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedural account===
The procedural account, which builds upon the lexical activation hypothesis, argues that people are more likely to engage in particular [[cognitive]] procedures during the encoding of items when generating than when reading. The process of generation induces people to connect the item to information in memory (unlike the lexical activation hypothesis, the information in memory does not necessarily reside in the [[lexicon]]). The generation effect occurs if the procedures used during encoding are reinstated during the memory test.&lt;ref name="mcnamara"/&gt; Procedural account is also linked to transfer-appropriate processing in that they both cause or do not cause the generation effect depending on encoding and retrieval processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeWinstanley|first=Patricia|author2=Elizabeth Bjork|title=Processing Strategies and the Generation Effect: Implications for Making a Better Reader|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|year=2004|volume=32|issue=6|pages=945–955|doi=10.3758/BF03196872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multifactor transfer-appropriate processing account===
According to the multifactor transfer-appropriate processing account, the generation task forces participants to focus their processing on the type of information needed to solve the generation task. When a later test is sensitive to the same type of information, a generation effect occurs. However, when there is not a match between the type of information processed to solve the generation task and the type of information needed to do well on a later test, the generation effect does not occur.&lt;ref name="deWinstanley2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=deWinstanley |first=P.A. |author2=Bjork, E.L. |author3=Bjork, R.A. |year=1996 |title =Generation effects and the lack thereof: The role of transfer-appropriate processing |journal=Memory |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=31–48  |doi=10.1080/741940667 |pmid=8821084}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a participant that is required to generate same-category targets from distinctive semantic cues (e.g., PURR-C_T, SADDLE-H_RS_) is likely to notice similarities between the targets (e.g., they are all animals). This type of manipulation would promote whole-list relational processing, which may enhance generation performance on a free recall test. Other manipulations can emphasise cue-target processing, thus helping generation performance on cued recall tests.&lt;ref name="mcdaniel"&gt;{{cite journal |year=1988 |title=A contextual account of the generation effect: A three-factor theory |journal=Journal of Memory and Language |volume=27 |pages=521–536 |doi=10.1016/0749-596X(88)90023-X |issue=5|last1=McDaniel |first1=Mark A |last2=Waddill |first2=Paula J |last3=Einstein |first3=Gilles O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been found that the generation effect was invariable across the different types of memory encoding.
&lt;ref name=mcnamara /&gt;

==Limitations==
By manipulating materials or instructions, experimenters have reduced or eliminated the generation effect. This suggests that there are instances in which [[reading (process)|reading]] can have the same memorial gains as generating. For example, when participants are given instructions to process information in a manner that was similar to the processing performed by the participants in the generate condition, the generation advantage between the groups was eliminated.&lt;ref name="mcdaniel"/&gt; In another study, participants who used a processing strategy (imagery) that was more effective than reading performed just as well as those who generated.&lt;ref name="begg"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Begg |first=I. |author2=Vinski, E. |author3=Frankovich, L. |author4=Holgate, B.  |year=1991 |title=Generating makes words memorable, but so does effective reading |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=487–497 |doi=10.3758/BF03199571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the generation effect is a robust finding, there are some studies that have found no memorial benefits of generating compared to reading. For example, one study did not find the generation effect when they used legal non-words and found a reduced generation effect when they used material unfamiliar to the participants. They concluded that generating may have limited effectiveness when applied to new or unfamiliar material. This warrants some concern because if the generation effect is to be incorporated into educational practices such as classroom teaching, we would want it to help students learn new material.&lt;ref name= "lutz"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lutz |first=John |author2=Briggs, A. |author3=Cain, K. |year=2003 |title=An examination of the value of the generation effect for learning new material |journal=The Journal of General Psychology |volume=130 |issue=2 |pages=171–188 |doi=10.1080/00221300309601283 |pmid=12773019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the generation effect may cause a trade-off in encoding item information and associative information.&lt;ref name="mulligan2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mulligan |first=Neil W. |year=2004 |title=Generation and memory for contextual detail |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=838–855 |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.30.4.838 |pmid=15238028}}&lt;/ref&gt; The processing of item-specific features of the target item may be enhanced when generating, and generating may also enhance the processing of cue-target relation. But, encoding requires limited-capacity resources, so the better encoding of one type of information may occur at a cost to the encoding of other information.&lt;ref name=mulligan2/&gt;&lt;ref name="jurica"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jurica |first=P.J. |author2=Shimamura, A.P. |year=1999 |title=Monitoring item and source information: Evidence for a negative generation effect in source memory |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=648–656 |doi=10.3758/BF03211558}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also has implications for applying generation to educational practices because even if generation improves the recall of specific words, the memory for the contextual information surrounding those words may suffer.

==Practical applications==
{{tone|section|date=June 2016}}
The generation effect appears promising as a strategy for learning, and particularly for remembering educational material. Currently, researchers at [[UCLA]] and [[UC Berkeley]] are investigating ways to incorporate learning strategies such as the generation effect, as well as other "desirable difficulties", into the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;http://iddeas.psych.ucla.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some ways that you could use generation to aid in [[memory retention]]. Here are some examples:
* Read a section of your book. Then, close the book and generate (and answer) questions about what you just read.
* If there are review questions at the end of a chapter, answer those questions without looking back at the pages.
* Use [[flashcards]] to test yourself.
* If you are an educator (or if you want to write a practice test for a friend), create tests that require fill-in-the-blank, short answer, or essay responses rather than [[multiple-choice]] responses.

==Exceptions==

There are several reports in the literature that suggest that individuals diagnosed with DAT (which stands for dementia of the Alzheimer type) do not show the generation effect. One study included 42 healthy adults, 23 with very mild DAT, and 26 with mild DAT. Researchers Kristi S. Multhaup and David A. Balota had participants  read  some  sentences  (e.g.,  "The  horse  jumped  the fence") and  generate  the  endings  to  other sentences  (e.g., "The  gentleman  opened  the  ").  Later, participants were  given the  subjects of the sentences  (e.g.,  "horse"; "gentleman")  and  asked to recall  the  object  that  had  been paired  with the  words in  the previous  sentences  (e.g., "fence";  "door").  Healthy older adults  showed  higher recall  for  words  that they  had  generated  compared  with 383 words  that  they  had  read  (i.e.,  a  significant  generation effect). In contrast, individuals diagnosed with DAT did not show a difference in recall for words that they had generated and words that they had read. Similarly, another study reported four experiments with the  same  group  of  18  DAT  individuals  and  found  little evidence  for  a  generation  effect  in  word  recall,  word recognition, or recall of action instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~dbalota/Generation%20effects%20and%20source%20memory%20Multhuap%20Balota.pdf|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.11.3.382|pmid=9223142|title=Generation effects and source memory in healthy older adults and in adults with dementia of the Alzheimer type|journal=Neuropsychology|volume=11|issue=3|pages=382–391|year=1997|last1=Multhaup|first1=Kristi S.|last2=Balota|first2=David A.|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614100324/http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~dbalota/Generation%20effects%20and%20source%20memory%20Multhuap%20Balota.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nonhuman animals==

There is some evidence that animals also display the generation effect during learning.&lt;ref name="kornell"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kornell |first=N. |author2=Terrace, H.S. |year=2007 |title=The Generation Effect in monkeys |journal=Psychological Science |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=682–685 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01959.x|pmid=17680937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent work challenges the idea animals display the generation effect.&lt;ref name="staniland"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Staniland |first=J. |author2=Colombo, M. |author3=Scarf, D.|year=2015 |title=The Generation Effect or Simply Generating an Effect? |journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology |volume=129 |issue=4 |pages=329–333 |doi=10.1037/a0039450|pmid=26147702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''homework coach''' is a category of [[tutor]] whose mission is to help a student's overall academic success as opposed to providing remedial instruction in a specific subject. A parent might hire a homework coach when their child is struggling in school not because they have difficulties with the academic material but because of problems with study skills, organization, [[executive function]] skills and motivation. The goal of the coach is to teach the child to become a successful student by learning to plan assignments, organize materials, manage time effectively and, in the case of an ADHD student, learn ways to manage the symptoms of their attention deficit disorder. As such, the role of a homework coach is similar to [[ADHD coaching]] but is focused specifically on success in school. Some providers use the term "homework helper" as well as "homework coach."

==Applicability==
A homework coach is indicated for any student whose poor performance in school or college appears to be more related to organization and study skills rather than difficulty understanding the instructional material. Such students may show signs of ADHD or Executive Function disorder. Current statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control show that as many as 11% of school children 4–17 years in age had received an ADHD diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/features/key-findings-adhd72013.html&lt;/ref&gt; Among ADHD students, about 33% will not graduate high school with their peers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395610002001 | doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.06.014 | volume=45 | title=Childhood and adolescent onset psychiatric disorders, substance use, and failure to graduate high school on time | journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research | pages=295–301| pmc=2962709 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is about twice the rate of the non-ADHD student population.  By hiring a homework coach, parents hope that the added support in building study skills, helping plan assign assignments, test-taking strategies and general homework monitoring will keep their children on track in school and increase their chances of graduating on time.&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.wsj.com/juggle/2010/12/01/homework-helpers-helicopter-parenting/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
The efficacy of homework coaching is in general measured by parents in terms of higher grades and less discord in the household over their student's homework habits. One study of 110 ADHD college students found that coaching was "highly effective in helping students improve executive functioning and related skills as measured by the Learning and Study Strategies Inventory." &lt;ref&gt;https://edgefoundation.org/blog/2010/11/12/edge-announces-study-results-11-12-10/&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many anecdotal news stories and case studies relating how a homework coach has helped students improve their grades and self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/08/nyregion/08homework.html&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity and tempo of homeworkes affect stress resistance and quite emmotsionalny state of the pupil. The correct approach to the implementation of tasks will allow to perform all tasks with maximum efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.assignmentexpert.com/blog/&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''interactive course''' typically describes material of an [[education]]al nature delivered in a format which allows the user to directly impact the materials' content, pace, and outcome. Interactive, as defined by the [[Merriam-Webster]] [[online dictionary]], is "involving the actions or input of a user".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interactive|title=Definition of INTERACTIVE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such material would be a [[computer]]-based presentation requiring a user to select the correct answer to a given question before proceeding to the next topic.

These types of courses are almost always computer-based, and most likely to be delivered to the user through the [[Internet]]. Due to their convenient delivery, availability, and almost endless subject matter, interactive [[Course (education)|course]]s have become a major tool for those seeking to provide, as well as to obtain, [[Higher education|education]], training, or [[certification]] in a given area of study.

With growing accessibility and availability of computers and the Internet, many schools, [[university|universities]], businesses, and government agencies are turning to interactive courses to train and educate their [[student]]s and staff through [[Massive open online course|MOOC's]] and customized internal [[learning platform]]s by third-party providers.

'''K-5''' (pronounced "kay through five") is an [[United States|American]]  term for the [[education]] period from [[kindergarten]] to [[fifth grade]].  It receives equal amounts of criticism and support in the educational industry.  While many [[early childhood]] experts deem it too closely aligned with more developmentally inappropriate "watered-down" early elementary teaching methods, [[Administration (government)|administrator]]s and policy-makers see it as a way to integrate kindergarten under the guise of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001.

'''Man: A Course of Study''', usually known by the acronym '''MACOS''' or '''M.A.C.O.S.''', was an [[United States|American]] [[humanities]] teaching program, popular in America and Britain in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/collection/films/fiche/?id=51241|title=Through These Eyes|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the theories of [[Jerome Bruner]], particularly his concept of the "[[spiral curriculum]]". This suggested that a concept might be taught repeatedly within a [[curriculum]], but at a number of levels, each level being more complex than the first. The process of repetition would thus enable the child to absorb more complex ideas easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/jerome-s-bruner-influential-psychologist-of-perception-dies-at-100/2016/06/07/033e5870-2cc3-11e6-9b37-42985f6a265c_story.html|title=Jerome S. Bruner, Influential Psychologist of Perception, Dies at 100|publisher=The Washington Post|first=Matt|last=Schudel|date=June 7, 2016|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infed.org/mobi/jerome-bruner-and-the-process-of-education/|title=Jerome Bruner and the Process of Education|publisher=Infed|first=Mark|last=Smith|date=2002|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In MACOS, the concept was "the chain of [[life]]" or a "lifeline": the entire history of a living thing. The course started with a simple lifespan in the form of the Pacific Coast [[salmon]]. It then moved on to the more complex life form of the [[herring gull]], introducing concepts such as nurturing. The lifespan of the [[baboon]] was next examined, particularly within the societal context afforded by the [[baboon#Society|baboon troop]]. The differences between [[innate behaviour]] and [[learning|learned]] behaviour were introduced. Finally, the study opened up into a study of a man's lifespan with a case study of [[Netsilik Inuit]]. This also included the interaction between the Netsilik and other life forms, such as [[reindeer]] and [[pinniped|seals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/04/25/archives/the-proper-study-of-mankind-.html|title=The Proper Study of Mankind|publisher=The New York Times|first=Lee|last=Dembart|date=April 25, 1976|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The course comprised a self-contained kit of course materials, film cassettes, visual aids, and games. Some of the activities were very imaginative; a game based upon reindeer [[wikt:migration|migration]] had a loaded [[dice|die]] to introduce discussion about instincts, and a paper seal would be cut up and shared among class members representing various people in the [[Netsilik]] community, according to a ritual governing who was entitled to which part of the animal.

The emphasis of the course was upon learning particular skills within the teaching process, not upon the significance of the content. This included the necessity to ask questions, discuss, and reach conclusions based on evidence and argument.

The course was much criticized in the United States because of its emphasis upon questioning aspects of life, including belief and morality. It was particularly targeted by [[fundamentalist]] groups, evidenced by quotations included in the course booklet. In 2004, the [[National Film Board of Canada]] produced  ''Through These Eyes'', a documentary about the controversy surrounding MACOS, and more generally about the interplay between politics and education.&lt;ref&gt;Kincheloe,  Joe L. &amp;  Horn, Raymond A.(Eds).

'''MicroMasters''' programs are a series of [[Massive open online course|online graduate level courses]] launched by [[edX]] that one can take to develop standalone skills for career advancement or earn [[Microdegree|graduate level credentials]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamgordon/2018/02/13/voice-of-employers-rings-out-as-moocs-go-from-education-to-qualification/#3b27ffd2564b|title='MicroMasters' Surge As MOOCs Go From Education To Qualification|last=Gordon|first=Adam|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; from its respective universities, equivalent to a semester of a full master's degree&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/04/college-online-degree-blended-learning/557642/|title=The Future of College Looks Like the Future of Retail|last=Selingo|first=Jeffrey|date=2018-04-16|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was designed to be the bridge between a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, allowing employees to continue advancing their education without affecting their employment and personal commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/micromasters-degree-4149968|title=MicroMasters: The Bridge Between a Bachelor’s Degree and a Graduate Degree|last=Williams|first=Terri|date=2017-11-19|website=ThoughtCo|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

First launched in September 2016 with 19 MicroMasters programs as an extension of its [[Mooc|MOOC]], edX eventually expanded to include 17 additional programs in February 2017. As of November 2018, 51 different MicroMasters programs are being offered, with 47 in English, 3 in Spanish, and 1 in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edx.org/micromasters|title=MicroMasters Programs {{!}} edX|date=2016-08-15|work=edX|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each MicroMasters program is sponsored by at least one industry partner, including [[General Electric|GE]], [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]], [[Hootsuite]], [[Fidelity International|Fidelity]], [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], [[Walmart]], [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PWC]], [[Booz Allen Hamilton|Booz-Allen Hamilton]], and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamgordon/2018/02/13/voice-of-employers-rings-out-as-moocs-go-from-education-to-qualification/#39c0fc72564b|title='MicroMasters' Surge As MOOCs Go From Education To Qualification|last=Gordon|first=Adam|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are designed to bridge the gap between job candidates with a bachelor's degree and companies that want employees with an advanced degree by offering credentials that are equivalent to 25 to 50 percent of a master's degree or 20 to 30 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodcall.com/news/micromasters-next-stop-graduate-degrees-09048|title=MicroMasters: The Next Big Thing After a Bachelor’s Degree?|last=Williams|first=Terri|date=2016-10-21|website=GoodCall|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other existing microcredentials, the MicroMasters programs offer both the benefit of gaining relevant skills in a particular field that can support career development and a pathway to advanced credits in the respective universities offering the course. This includes many of the top universities in the world such as [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Columbia University]], [[Delft University of Technology]], and [[Indian Institutes of Management|Indian Institute of Management]]. The idea of the MicroMasters program started out as an iteration of the existing MOOC model when [[Coursera]] first started offering specializations for its various disciplines and a response to the changing nature of work as well as the [[Skills mismatch|major skills shortage]] currently impacting businesses around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning/reflecting-original-big-idea-moocs|title=Reflecting on the Original Big Idea for MOOCs {{!}} Inside Higher Ed|website=www.insidehighered.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program Structure ==

=== Prerequisites ===
All MicroMasters programs are currently running on the edX MOOC platform, where learners are free to audit any of the courses. Depending on the program, there are prerequisites ranging from graduate level understanding of various specific disciplines or work experienced. However, these prerequisites serve as recommended guidelines for the learners rather than a strictly enforced rule so there are no specific degree requirements for any of the courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/14/skip-college-and-go-to-graduate-school-with-new-mit-program.html|title=Here's how to skip college and go straight to grad school—at MIT|last=Montag|first=Ali|date=2017-07-14|website=CNBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, learners will have to pay if they wish to pursue a verified certificate.

=== Certification ===
To qualify for a certificate for successfully completing a MicroMasters Program, all learners are required to complete a series of [[Interactive course|interactive courses]] as specified in the respective MicroMasters program and achieve a minimum grade according to the institution awarding the certification.  

For learners interested in developing skills for professional advancement, the certificate for completing a MicroMasters Program may be sufficient.

=== Continuing Education ===
For learners interested in academic credit, the learner must be admitted into the university's respective master's program. Some programs, such as the MicroMasters Program in Supply Chain Management by MIT also operate on a [[blended learning]] model which include a timed examination as well as a final proctored examination. Admission requirements for its on-campus blended learning program differ from its traditional residential admission requirements as applicants are not required to submit scores in a [[Graduate Record Examinations|GRE]] or [[Graduate Management Admission Test|GMAT]] as performance in the Micromasters program will be taken as a substitute for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scm.mit.edu/blended-admissions|title=SCMb Masters Degree Admissions {{!}} MIT Supply Chain Management|website=scm.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other programs still follow usual admission guidelines and the MicroMasters program has little to no impact on their application apart from receiving advanced credits upon admission into its respective programs. Generally, most courses include practice exercises which are ungraded as well as graded assignments with limited attempts.

The following is a list of the current MicroMasters programs offered as well as the respective graduate degree options available for each program upon graduation of the MicroMasters program.

The '''Midday Meal Scheme''' is a [[school meal]] programme of the [[Government of India]] designed to better the [[nutrition]]al standing of school-age  children  nationwide.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://home.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/newsroom/wfp207424.pdf|title = India: A Desk Review of the Mid-Day Meals Programme|date=July 2007|last=Chettiparambil-Rajan |first=Angelique|format=PDF|accessdate = 28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme supplies free lunches on working days for children in primary and upper primary classes in government, government aided, local body, Education Guarantee Scheme, and alternate innovative education centres, ''[[Madarsa]]'' and ''Maqtabs'' supported under [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]], and National Child Labour Project schools run by the ministry of labour.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdm.nic.in/Files/Right%20to%20information/Frequently_Asked_Questions_on_MDM.pdf |title=Frequently Asked Questions on Mid Day Meal Scheme |accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serving 120,000,000 children in over 1,265,000 schools and Education Guarantee Scheme centres, it is the largest of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdm.nic.in/aboutus.html |title=About the Mid Day Meal Scheme |publisher=Mdm.nic.in |date= |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme has undergone many changes since its launch in 1995. The Midday Meal Scheme is covered by the [[National Food Security Act, 2013]]. The legal backing to the Indian school meal programme is akin to the legal backing provided in the US through the [[National School Lunch Act]].

==           History          ==

=== Pre-independence and post-independence initiatives ===
The roots of the programme can be traced back to the pre-independence era, when a mid day meal programme was introduced in 1925 in [[Madras Corporation]] by the British administration.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A mid day meal programme was introduced in the Union Territory of [[Puducherry]] by the French administration in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mdm.nic.in/Files/PAB/PAB-2011-12/AWP-Write%20up/Puducherry.pdf|title = National Programme of Mid-Day Meals in Schools Annual Work Plan and Budget 2011–12|publisher=Union Territory of Puducherry|accessdate = 28 July 2013|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiatives by state governments to children began with their launch of a mid day meal programme in primary schools in the  1962–63 school year. [[Tamil Nadu]] is a pioneer in introducing mid day meal programmes in India to increase the number of kids coming to school; Thiru [[K. Kamaraj]], then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, introduced it first in Chennai and later extended it to all districts of Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nihfw.org/NationalHealthProgramme/MID_DAYMEAL.html |title=Mid-Day Meal Programme |publisher=National Institute of Health &amp; Family Welfare |date=2009 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1982, July 1st onwards, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Thiru. [[M. G. Ramachandran]] upgraded the existing Mid-day meal scheme in the state to 'Nutritious food scheme' keeping in the mind that 68 lakh children suffer malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mgr-midday-nutritious-meal-scheme-a-shrewd-political-move/1/392281.html |title=Tamil Nadu: Midday Manna |publisher=India Today Archive |date=15 November 1982 |accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gujarat]] was the second state to introduce an MDM scheme in 1984, but it was later discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mdm.nic.in/Files/PAB/PAB%202010-11/STATE%20PPTS/Gujarat%20gajarat.pdf|title = Annual Work Plan &amp; Budget 2010–11, Mid-Day Meal Scheme, Gujarat State|format=PDF|publisher=Government of Gujarat|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A midday meal scheme was introduced in  [[Kerala]] in 1984, and was gradually expanded to include more schools and grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mdm.nic.in/Files/PAB/PAB2013-14/Kerala/Appraisal_Note-Kerala.pdf|title = Appraisal Note: State: Kerala | publisher = Government of India Ministry of Human Resource Development |format=PDF|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990–91, twelve states were funding the scheme to all or most of the students in their area: [[Goa]], [[Gujarat]], [[Kerala]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Mizoram]], [[Nagaland]], [[Sikkim]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Tripura]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. [[Karnataka]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], and West Bengal received international aid to help with implementation of the programme, and in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Rajasthan]] the programme was funded entirely using foreign aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://pibmumbai.gov.in/English/PDF/E0000_H12.PDF|title = Mid Day Meal|publisher=Press Information Bureau, Government of India |format=PDF|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Karnataka]], [[Children's LoveCastles Trust]] started to provide mid-day meals in 1997. A total of eight schools were adopted and a [[food bank]] programme and an Angganwasi milk Programme were started. The food-bank programme was replaced by the State Government midday meal scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-neighbourhood/lessons-outside-the-classroom/article483116.ece|title = Lessons Outside the Classroom |work=The Hindu |accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiatives by the central government===
The government of India initiated the National Programme of Nutritional Support to Primary Education (NP-NSPE) on 15 August 1995.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The objective of the scheme is to help improve the effectiveness of primary education by improving the nutritional status of primary school children. Initially, the scheme was implemented in 2,408 blocks of the country to provide food to students in classes one through five of government, government-aided and local body run schools. By 1997–98, the scheme had been implemented across the country. Under this programme, a cooked mid day meal with 300 calories and 12 grams of protein is provided to all children enrolled in classes one to five. In October 2007, the scheme included students in upper primary classes of six to eight in 3,479 educationally backward blocks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mid-Day Meal for the Poor, Privatised Education for the Non-Poor|date = 27 July 2013|url = http://www.epw.in/special-articles/mid-day-meal-poor-privatised-education-non-poor.html|first = Manisha |last=Garg |first2=Kalyan Sankar |last2=Mandal|journal = Economic and Political Weekly|accessdate = 28 July 2013|volume = 48|issue = 30|page = 155}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name was changed from National Programme for Nutrition Support to Primary Education to National Programme of Mid Day Meals in Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mdm.nic.in/Files/Monitoring/NSCMC/Agenda_Note_for_NSMC_meeting_21_12_12.pdf|title = Agenda note of 5th meeting of National Steering and Moitoring Committee meeting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though cooked food was to be provided, most states (apart from those already providing cooked food) chose to provide "dry rations" to students. "Dry rations" refers to the provision of uncooked 3&amp;nbsp;kg of wheat or rice to children with 80% attendance.

=== Supreme court order ===
In April 2001, the [[People's Union for Civil Liberties|People’s Union for Civil Liberties]] (PUCL) initiated the [[Public-interest litigation (India)|public interest litigation]] (Civil) No. 196/2001, People’s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India &amp; Others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sccommissioners.org/Reports/Reports/SCC6_1005.pdf|title = Sixth Report Of the Commissioners|last = Dr. N.C. Saxena}}&lt;/ref&gt; – popularly known as the "right to food" case. The PUCL argued that [[s:Constitution of India/Part III#Article 21 .7BProtection of life and personal liberty.7D|article 21]] – "right to life" of the Indian constitution when read together with articles [[s:Constitution of India/Part IV#Article 39 .7BCertain principles of policy to be followed by the State.7D|39]](a) and [[s:Constitution of India/Part IV#Article 47 .7BDuty of the State to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health.7D|47]], makes the right to food a derived [[Fundamental Rights in India|fundamental right]] which is enforceable by virtue of the constitutional remedy provided under [[s:Constitution of India/Part III#Article 32 .7BRemedies for enforcement of rights conferred by this Part.7D|article 32]] of the constitution. The PUCL argued that excess food stocks with the [[Food Corporation of India]] should be fed to hungry citizens. This included providing mid day meals in primary schools. The scheme came into force with the supreme court order dated 28 November 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.righttofoodindia.org/mdm/mdm_scorders.html |title=Right to Food Campaign: Mid Day Meals |publisher=Righttofoodindia.org |date=20 October 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which requires all government and government-assisted primary schools to provide cooked midday meals.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sccommissioners.org/FoodSchemes/Documents/mdm_primer.pdf|title = Mid Day Meals: A Primer|accessdate = 28 July 2013|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementation models ===

==== Decentralised model ====
This is the most widespread practice. In the decentralised model, meals are cooked on-site by local cooks and helpers or [[self-help groups]]. This system has the advantage of being able to serve local cuisine, providing jobs in the area, and minimising waste. It also allows for better monitoring (e.g., by parents and teachers).

In the absence of adequate infrastructure (such as kitchen sheds, utensils etc.), it can lead to accidents and maintaining hygiene can be difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://centreforequitystudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Best-practices-Mid-day-meal.pdf|title = Interrogating 'best practices' for the Implementation of School Nutrition Programmes in Urban India|accessdate = 28 July 2013|format = PDF|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141129050252/http://centreforequitystudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Best-practices-Mid-day-meal.pdf|archivedate = 29 November 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, 87 children died when the thatched roof of a classroom was ignited by sparks from a cooking fire,.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = 87 children die in school fire|date = 17 July 2004|url = http://www.hindu.com/2004/07/17/stories/2004071707570100.htm|accessdate = 28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a child died after succumbing to burn injuries she sustained after accidentally falling into a cooking vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = 'Gravy' mistake: 8-yr-old girl falls in hot sambar, dies|date = 17 December 2011|url = http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-gravy-mistake-8-yr-old-girl-falls-in-hot-sambar-dies-1626938|accessdate = 28 July 2013|newspaper = DNA India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Centralised model ====
In the centralised model, an external organisation cooks and delivers the meal to schools, mostly through [[public-private partnership]]s. Centralised kitchens are seen more in urban areas, where density of schools is high so that transporting food is a financially viable option. Advantages of centralised kitchens include ensuring better hygienic as large scale cooking is done through largely automated processes. Various [[NGO]]s such as the [[Akshaya Patra Foundation]], Ekta Shakti Foundation, Naandi Foundation, and Jay Gee Humanitarian Society &amp; People's Forum provides mid-day meals.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

A study of centralised kitchens in Delhi in 2007 found that even with centralised kitchens, the quality of food needed to be improved.&lt;ref&gt;Towards more advantages from Mid-Day Meals http://www.cordindia.com/images/Midday.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found that when the food arrives and is of inadequate quality, even teachers feel helpless and do not know whom to complain to.

The Ministry of Human Resource Development reported that 95% of tested meal samples prepared by NGOs in Delhi did not meet nutritional standards in 2010–12. In response, the ministry withheld 50% of the payment for the deficient meals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/exclusive/capitals-mcd-schools-mid-day-meal-scheme-fails-nutrition-test_6357.html |title=Capital's MCD schools mid-day meal scheme fails nutrition test! |publisher=Zeenews. india.com |date=23 May 2013 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== International assistance ====
International voluntary and charity organisations have assisted. [[Church World Service]] has provided milk powder to Delhi and Madras Municipal Corporation; [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]] has provided corn soya meal, Bulgar wheat, and vegetable oils; and [[UNICEF]] has provided high proteins foods and educational support.&lt;ref name="teindia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teindia.nic.in/mhrd/50yrsedu/r/2V/7B/2V7B0301.htm |title=Historical Background |work=Nutrition Support to Education: Report of the Committee on Mid-Day Meals | date = May 1995|publisher=Department of School Education and Literacy, Government of India |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, 'Food for Learning' was launched with assistance from the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO). Initially the programme was aimed at scheduled caste and scheduled tribe girls.&lt;ref name="teindia1" /&gt; In 1983, the federal Department of Education prepared a scheme under the auspices of the [[World Food Programme]] to supply meals to 13.6 million scheduled caste girls and 10.09 million scheduled tribe girls in classes one to five in 15 states and three union territories. The value of the food itself was $163.27 million per year.&lt;ref name="teindia1" /&gt; Labour, facilities, and transportation costs were to be paid by the state governments. The reaction among the states and union territories was mixed. Many states were interested, but some were concerned about their ability to afford it if the FAO support were to be withdrawn.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Evaluation of the scheme ==

The MDM scheme has many potential benefits: attracting children from disadvantaged sections (especially girls, [[Dalits]] and [[Adivasis]]) to school, improving regularity, nutritional benefits, socialisation benefits and benefits to women are some that have been highlighted.&lt;ref&gt;Future of Mid-Day Meals http://www.epw.in/special-articles/future-mid-day-meals.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epw.in/perspectives/mid-day-meals-primary-schools.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by economists show that some of these benefits have indeed been realised. The positive effect on enrollment of disadvantaged children (Dreze and Kingdon), on attendance (by Chakraborty, Jayaraman, Pande),&lt;ref&gt;see also http://indiatogether.org/mmassam-education&lt;/ref&gt; on learning effort (by Booruah, Afridi and Somanathan), on improving nutritional inputs (Afridi), on improving nutritional outcomes (by Singh, Dercon and Parker), and so on.

Caste based discrimination continues to occur in the serving of food, though the government seems unwilling to acknowledge this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title = Caste and Gender Based Discrimination Under MDMS|url = http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=90730|date = 14 December 2012|accessdate = 2 August 2013|quote = The teams did not come across any discrimination except in one school in district Boudh in Odisha.|publisher = Press Information Bureau, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2018}} Sukhdeo Thorat and Joel Lee found in their 2005 study that caste discrimination was occurring in conjunction with the Mid Day Meals programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Caste Discrimination and Food Security Programmes|date = 24 September 2005|first1 = Joel|last1= Lee|first2= Sukhdeo|last2= Thorat|journal = Economic and Political Weekly|jstor=4417187|volume = 40 |issue= 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media reports also document the positive effect of the programme for women, especially working women&lt;ref&gt;see http://indiatogether.org/mdmukhand-poverty&lt;/ref&gt; and its popularity among parents, children and teachers alike. Media reports have also highlighted several implementation issues, including irregularity, corruption, hygiene, caste discrimination, etc. A few such incidents are listed below:

- In December 2005, Delhi police seized eight trucks laden with 2,760 sacks of rice meant for primary school children. The rice was being transported from Food Corporation of India godowns [[Bulandshahr district]] to North Delhi. The police stopped the trucks and investigators later discovered that the rice was being stolen by an NGO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Lid off massive scam in Mid-Day Meal Scheme: 2,760 sacks of rice seized| url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060121/delhi.htm| publisher=The Tribune, Delhi| date=20 January 2006| accessdate=2 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- In November 2006, the residents of Pembong village (30&amp;nbsp;km from [[Darjeeling]]) accused a group of teachers of embezzling midday meals.

== Criticism ==
Despite the success of the program, child hunger as a problem persists in India. According to current statistics, 42.5% of the children under 5 are underweight. Some simple health measures such as using iodised salt and getting vaccinations are uncommon in India.&lt;ref&gt;Sengupta, Somini.

Retrieved on 18 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; "India is home to the world's largest food insecure population, with more than 500 million people who are hungry", India State Hunger Index (ISHI) said. Many children don't get enough to eat, which has far-reaching implications for the performance of the country as a whole. "Its rates of child malnutrition is higher than most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa," it noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/Rni3kmxsj03rJ4rjTTqeaI/Madhya-Pradesh-tops-India-State-Hunger-list-of-17.html | title=Madhya Pradesh tops India State Hunger list of 17|publisher=LiveMint|date=14 October 2008|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 [[Global Hunger Index]] ranked India at 65 out of 84 countries. More than 200 million went hungry in India that year, more than any other country in the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5999">The '''Milwaukee Project''' was a program begun in the 1960s designed to improve the [[IQ]]s and scholastic achievement of children at risk and to study the effects of intellectual stimulation on children from deprived environments.

==The Project==
Rick Heber of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] examined the statistics of districts in the city of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]. His attention was drawn towards one district, where the residents had the lowest median income and lowest level of education in the city. The unemployment rate was also very high. Although this district contained only 3% of the city’s population, 33% of all children who had been labeled "mentally retarded" lived there.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Program==
Heber selected 40 newborns from this district. All had a mother with an IQ lower than 80. In many cases the father was absent. The newborns were randomly assigned to an experimental and a [[control group]]. Mothers of children in the experimental group received education, vocational rehabilitation, and training in homemaking and child care. The children were brought to infant stimulation centers, where they received a high quality educational program designed to develop language and cognitive skills. They also received three balanced meals a day. They stayed there five days a week, seven hours a day. When the children were six the program ended. The children then attended local schools. Both the experimental group and the control group were tested an equal number of times throughout the project.&lt;ref name=Edublox&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of Genetics in IQ and Intelligence|url=http://iq-test.learninginfo.org/iq03.htm|work=Article|publisher=Edublox|accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
According to Heber and colleagues, by age six all of the children from the experimental group had higher IQs than all of the children from the control group. Mean IQ was 120 in the experimental group and 87 in the control group. After the children left the program their IQs started declining. By the time both groups were ten years old the IQs of the children of the experimental group had decreased to 105. Mean IQ in the control group was 85.&lt;ref name=Edublox /&gt;

At age 14, the children in the experimental group had a mean IQ ten points above that of the control group, but the scholastic achievement scores of the experimental group were not better than those of the control group. Both groups performed in school as would be expected from children with a mean IQ of 80. For this reason, [[Arthur Jensen]] has suggested that the Milwaukee Project did not produce permanent intelligence gains, but that the IQ gains it showed were due to an indirect form of "[[teaching to the test]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1998, pp. 340–342&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

The Milwaukee Project's claimed success was celebrated in the popular media and by famous psychologists. However, later in the project Rick Heber, the principal investigator, was discharged from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and convicted and imprisoned for large-scale abuse of federal funding for private gain. Two of Heber's colleagues in the project were also convicted for similar abuses. The project's results were not published in any refereed scientific journals, and Heber did not respond to requests from colleagues for raw data and technical details of the study. Consequently, even the existence of the project as described by Heber has been called into question. Nevertheless, many college textbooks in psychology and education have uncritically reported the project's results.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds &amp; Fletcher-Janzen 2001, pp. 462–463, 635–636&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sommer &amp; Sommer 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7454">'''Multi-age classrooms''' or '''composite classes''' are classrooms with students from more than one [[grade level]]. They are created because of a pedagogical choice of a school or school district. They are different from split classes which are formed when there are too many students for one class - but not enough to form two classes of the same [[grade level]]. Composite classes are more common in smaller schools; an extreme form is the [[one-room school]].

Studies of the [[academic achievement|performance of students]] in composite classes shows their academic performance is not substantially different from those in single-grade classrooms; instead, outcomes tend to be a function of the teacher's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Prevalence==
For a given number of students, composite classes allow greater administrative flexibility in allocating students to classes. This allows gender balancing, matching of student needs to teaching expertise, and balancing [[class size]]s. By allocating children to classes according to specific learning needs, it is possible to arrange classes with narrower ranges of abilities.

Schools composed exclusively of composite classes are increasingly common in Australian primary school education; they are not uncommon in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-05-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Composite classes often meet resistance, with parents often believing that their child is disadvantaged by being in one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Advocates of multi-age classrooms point to the lack of age stratification in workplaces, families or other social environments as a reason to create a similar environment in the classroom.

==Cited benefits==
Social benefits often cited are:
*Older children in a composite class get more leadership opportunities and frequently build self-esteem as a sort or role model to the younger class mates. Younger children aspire to do work like the older children in the class.
*The ability for a child to be educated by the one teacher for two years, creating a stronger relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational benefits often cited are:
*Because literacy and numeracy is taught in [[ability grouping|ability groups]], teachers need heightened awareness of individual student's capabilities - they must think of children as individuals.&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt;
*The techniques of [[classroom teaching]] and of [[individual teaching]] can be still applied.
*[[Learning by teaching]] occurs when students at different stages of learning can help each other with their work; children resolve differences in understanding of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ednewsparent.org/teaching-learning/8157-ask-an-expert-are-multi-age-groupings-good-for-kids |title=Expert weighs in on mixed-age classroom settings  |first=Laura |last=Barr |work=ednewsparent.org |date=February 14, 2012 |accessdate=1 April 2012| publisher=EdNews Parent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Roopnarine | first1 = J.

*Composite classes provide a range of levels of work, so the needs of both talented children and slower learners can be catered for, while providing a supportive environment for both.&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt;

At any one time, both composite and single-level classes have groups of students at a variety of levels. This is part of the normal delivery of the curriculum. Education expectations are set at curriculum levels which span across two years; for example, see the [[Victorian Essential Learning Standards]]. Contemporary teaching and learning materials are developed for multi-age classes. By using them, teachers can introduce core concepts to the whole classroom, and then differentiate instruction for the range of learners in the classroom.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

The students will be of a greater range of size, age and maturity which can have both positive and negative implications particularly in class sporting activities and playground interaction.

It can also refer to an individual whose interests span multiple fields or areas, rather than being strong in just one. Such traits are called multipotentialities, while "multipotentialites" has been suggested as a name for those with this trait.

By contrast, those whose interests lie mostly within a single field are called "specialists."

==History==

===Etymology===
An early instance of the term in the record comes from relevant research in giftedness.

In 1972, R.H. Frederickson et al. defined a multipotentialed person as someone who, “when provided with appropriate environments, can select and develop a number of competencies to a high level.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = 27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Barbara Kerr defined multipotentiality as such:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | last = Kerr
 | first = Barbara
 | title = Career Planning for Gifted and Talented Youth. ERIC Digest #E492.

{{Quote
| text = Multipotentiality is the ability to select and develop any number of career options because of a wide variety of interests, aptitudes, and abilities (Frederickson &amp; Rothney, 1972). The broad range of opportunities available tends to increase the complexity of decision making and goal setting, and it may actually delay career selection. Multipotentiality is most commonly a concern of students with moderately high IQs (120-140), those who are academically talented, and those who have two or more outstanding but very different abilities such as violin virtuosity and mathematics precocity. 
| author = Barbara Kerr 
| source = Career Planning for Gifted and Talented Youth. ERIC Digest #E492. }}

In 1999, "multipotentiality" appears in Laurie Diane Shute's doctoral dissertation which was titled "An investigation of multipotentiality among university honors students." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | last = Shute

 | accessdate = 27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, multipotentiality appears again in Tamara Fisher's article in Education week. She defines it thus:&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;
{{Quote
| text = Multipotentiality is the state of having many exceptional talents, any one or more of which could make for a great career for that person. 
| author = Tamara Fisher
| source =  Education week }}

Around 2010 or later, Emilie Wapnick coined{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} the term "multipotentialite", perhaps to establish a shared identity for the community. She defines it this way:&lt;ref name="Terminology"&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Terminology
 | publisher = Puttylike
 | url = http://puttylike.com/terminology/
 | accessdate = 27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Quote
|text= A multipotentialite is a person who has many different interests and creative pursuits in life.

Multipotentialites have no “one true calling” the way specialists do. Being a multipotentialite is our destiny. We have many paths and we pursue all of them, either sequentially or simultaneously (or both).

Multipotentialites thrive on learning, exploring, and mastering new skills. We are excellent at bringing disparate ideas together in creative ways. This makes us incredible innovators and problem solvers.

When it comes to new interests that emerge, our insatiable curiosity leads us to absorb everything we can get our hands on. As a result, we pick up new skills fast and tend to be a wealth of information.

===Relevant terminology===

While the term "multipotentialite" is often used interchangeably with "[[polymath]]" or "Renaissance Person", the terms are not identical. One need not be an [[expert]] in any particular field to be a multipotentialite.

Indeed, Isis Jade makes a clear distinction between multipotentiality and polymaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title =Isn't Polymath and Multipotentiality the Same Thing?
 | publisher = IsisJade
 | url = http://www.isisjade.com/isnt-polymath-and-multipotentiality-the-same-thing/
 | accessdate = 27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multipotentiality refers simply to one's potential in multiple fields owing to his/her diverse interests and attempts. [[Polymath]]s, on the other hand, are distinguished by their mastery and expertise in several fields. In this sense, multipotentialites can be viewed as potential polymaths. 

Other terms used to refer to multipotentialites are "[[Barbara Sher|scanners]]", "slashers", "generalist", "multipassionate", "RP2", and "multipods", among others.&lt;ref name="Terminology"/&gt;

===Context===
With the advent of the industrial age, cultural norms have shifted in favor of specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Division of Labor
 | publisher = Boundless.com
 | url = https://www.boundless.com/sociology/textbooks/boundless-sociology-textbook/economy-16/work-120/importance-of-division-of-labor-676-3157/

 | accessdate = 27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in the modern day, the more narrow the specialization, the higher the pay and respect accorded, for example: [[PhD]] graduates, and specialized lawyers, doctors, and engineers. The aphorism [[Jack of all trades, master of none]] emphasizes this. (Ironically, the article and it's Wiktionary entry mention a longer couplet: "Jack of all trades, master of none,
though oftentimes better than master of one.")  Older emphasis towards generalism and multiple potentials such as [[Renaissance humanism]] and the [[Renaissance man]] were replaced.

However, the convergence economy, Internet age, connectivity, the rise of the Creative Class, and other modern developments are bringing about a return of a more positive opinion for generalists and multipotentialites.

In Specialization, Polymaths And The Pareto Principle In A Convergence Economy, Jake Chapman writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Quote
| text = Economists tell us that the history of human labor is one of continually increasing specialization. In the days of the hunter-gatherer, every member of the tribe would have been expected to command some degree of proficiency with each task.

As we progressed along the economic continuum from hunter-gatherer through agrarian and industrial and now into post-industrial economies, the labor force has become more fragmented, with workers having more and more specialized skill sets.
...
Historically, specialization has been a path to prosperity. Although specialization has certain economic advantages, in the era of technological convergence, well-educated generalists will be those who are the most valuable. It is time for a renaissance of the “Renaissance Man.”
...
The Renaissance thinkers recognized both the potential of individuals as well as the enormous value to being well-rounded.  Unfortunately, somewhere along the way the idea of someone who dabbled in many fields lost its cultural appeal and we began to praise those who sought deep subject matter expertise.

We now live in a world where distinctions between formerly separate industries are breaking down and the real opportunities for growth are where those industries intersect. Harnessing these 21st-century opportunities will require people who are “jacks of all trades, masters of none,” or, perhaps more accurately, master polymaths.
| author = Jake Chapman}}

===Business===
Organizations such as startups that require adaptability and holding multiple roles can employ several multipotentialites and have one specialist as a resource.

In Specialization, Polymaths And The Pareto Principle In A Convergence Economy, Chapman said:
{{Quote
| text = In the modern world, where a very common job might require someone to be a social-media expert, public speaker, writer and data analyst, the polymath wins and the deep subject-matter expert is relegated to a back corner to be used as a resource for others. As an investor, if I were going to pick the perfect team, it would be a group of rock-star polymaths with a single subject matter expert as a resource.

Proponents of specialization above cite excellence and its perceived higher rewards compared to mediocrity in everything. Proponents of multiple capabilities below emphasize the importance of adaptability.

In "Master of Many Trades", Robert Twigger goes so far as to coin the word "monopath": "It means a person with a narrow mind, a one-track brain, a bore, a super-specialist, an expert with no other interests — in other words, the role-model of choice in the Western world." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This sentiment is not new. In [[Time Enough for Love]] (1973), [[Robert A. Heinlein]] wrote:

{{Quote
| text = A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."
| author = Robert A. Heinlein
| source = Time Enough for Love }}In an article on the decline of polymathy, [[Felipe Fernández-Armesto]] wrote, "Universities bear some responsibility for its extinction. Classical Greece, Renaissance Italy and Victorian England all revered and rewarded generalists, for whom today universities have little or no space or patience. Enclosed departments in discrete spaces, with their own journals and jargons, are a legacy of lamentable, out-of-date ways of organising knowledge and work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/comment/columnists/the-passing-of-the-polymaths/2019113.article|title=The passing of the polymaths|date=2015-03-19|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-01-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Tim Ferriss]], a renowned generalist:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fourhourworkweek.com/2007/09/14/the-top-5-reasons-to-be-a-jack-of-all-trades/|title=The Top 5 Reasons to Be a Jack of All Trades|last=Ferris|first=Tim|publisher=Four Hour Work Week|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote | text = In a world of dogmatic specialists, it’s the generalist who ends up running the show. Is the CEO a better accountant than the CFO or CPA? Was Steve Jobs a better programmer than top coders at Apple? No, but he had a broad range of skills and saw the unseen interconnectedness. As technology becomes a commodity with the democratization of information, it’s the big-picture generalists who will predict, innovate, and rise to power fastest. There is a reason military “generals” are called such.}}

'''Caveat:''' The multipotentialite may encounter several problems if they are mediocre or average at everything. It's recommended to be above intermediate or master of at least one.

James Liu, founder/developer of BoxCat Games says this:

{{Quote | text = Over my many years of learning, iterating, and teaching, I’ve arrived at the conclusions that the process of learning, as humans, can be abused, tuned, and scaled easily.

There comes a specific point in your life where you can reach or obtain near mastery of one specific subject. After that, there’s a base of knowledge that you can (and will) build analogies on. By doing so, you take one industry and mirror it into another industry.

I would emphasize, you '''can &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; be a jack-of-all-trades without being a master of at least one.'''

Perhaps it is social skill, doll making, mathematics, language, emotional awareness—you must be a master of at least one in order to be a jack of many others...

Mastery of one trade can be converted into a catalyst for learning other fields. You have something to pull from, complex ideas you can pattern match, and metaphoric analogies that can complete a picture.

The more you learn, the faster you learn.}}

===Disadvantages===
* lose out on the benefits of specialization, ultra long-term commitment
* distraction and burn out&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* depending on person, mastery or competence can take longer to achieve. While there is some dispute{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} as to the degree of prevalence of this phenomenon, it can be a significant problem for those who experience it, leading to overscheduling, high stress levels, confusion, [[paralysis by analysis]], and impulsive or conformist choices in [[gifted]] children, and to feelings of [[social alienation]], purposelessness, [[apathy]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] in the brightest of adults.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

[[Boredom]] is also a frequent occurrence in multipotentialites who have already "mastered" or learned everything they desire to know about a particular topic before moving on.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Strategies===
For the challenges above, several resources have published coping strategies:

* Evaluate whether you're a multipotentialite or a specialist who hasn't found a career path yet: [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/creative-synthesis/201107/multipotentiality-when-high-ability-leads-too-many-options Multipotentiality: When High Ability Leads to Too Many Options] &lt;ref name="Rivero"/&gt;

==Impact==
In a world that overvalues specialization, the term and its increasing popularity (especially among the blogging community) have contributed to the revival of awareness on the importance of generalists. The concept was even mentioned in a Jamaican newspaper as the subject of a competition's training session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the current economy, [[Creativity]] and the rise of the [[Creative Class]] are linked to divergent thinking and innovative solutions to current problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Araki|first1=Michael|title=Polymathic Leadership: Theoretical Foundation and Construct Development|date=2015|publisher=Maxell|location=Rio de Janeiro|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313099026_Polymathic_Leadership_Theoretical_Foundation_and_Construct_Developmen}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Because new ideas can be found in the intersection of multiple fields&lt;ref name="Koestler"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koestler|first1=Arthur|title=The act of creation|date=1964|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Root-Bernstein|first1=Robert|last2=Root-Bernstein|first2=Michele|title=Sparks of genius: The thirteen thinking tools of the world's most creative people|date=2013|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt;, they would benefit from the advantages of multipotentialites.

==Notable examples==
{{Unsourced section|date=January 2017}}
[[Leonardo da Vinci]] may be the most well-known historical example of an acknowledged [[genius]] who struggled from the difficulties associated with multipotentiality.

Other notable multipotentialites throughout history excelled in many fields (hence they're also polymaths) such as:
* [[Avicenna]]
* [[Averroes]]
* [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]]
* [[Ibn al-Haytham]]
* [[Hypatia]]
* [[José Rizal]]
* [[Averroes]]
* [[Thomas Jefferson]]

The "no nit" policy requires the sending home and barring of all children who have head lice, eggs and/or nits on their hair from controlled settings such as school, summer camp or day care facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16911370 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2006.02827.x | volume=45 | title=Head louse infestations: the "no nit" policy and its consequences | date=August 2006 | journal=Int.

The no nit policy involves a number of issues, such as the circumstances under which children will be inspected, the criteria to infer infestation, the procedures for dealing with infested children upon discovery, and the criteria to permit previously infested children to return to school. These issues are controversial.  In particular, a number of health researchers and organizations object to the required removal of nits.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frankowski2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Barbara L.

Contributing to the controversial nature of school head lice policies is a lack of available data on their importance and efficacy.  For example, {{as of|2008|lc=on}}, the transmissibility of head lice in school settings is largely unknown.&lt;ref name="Hootman2002"/&gt;  Further, [[Scientific control|control-matched]] studies of the effect of specific school policies on head lice incidence are also lacking.&lt;ref name="Burgess2004"/&gt;

Schools in developed countries such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]] commonly exclude infested students, and prevent return of those students until all lice, eggs, and nits are removed.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;  Policies in the [[United Kingdom]] extend to legal action against parents of infested students.&lt;ref name="Gratz1997"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Norman G.

==Inspection==

A 1991 survey of American nurses reported that 27% have regular inspection programs in place at their schools.&lt;ref name="Donnelly1991"/&gt;  85% reported inspection on an "as-needed" basis.&lt;ref name="Hootman2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donnelly1991"/&gt; Routine inspection of children is advocated by a variety of nurses, researchers, organizations, and governments.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CA2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clore1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Ellen Rudy Clore |author2=Leah Ann Longyear | date=May 1990 | title = Comprehensive pediculosis screening programs for elementary schools | journal = Journal of School Health | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 212–214 | pmid = 2366522 | doi = 10.1111/j.1746-1561.1990.tb05917.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Head lice cannot live more than a day or two away from a host.&lt;ref name="Chunge1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meinking1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Terri L.

The return of children to this now-clean environment is an ideal time to check for infestations and attempt to keep the environment lice-free.&lt;ref name="Clore1990"/&gt; The California Department of Public Health encourages inspections to be performed on Fridays.&lt;ref name="CA2007"/&gt;

Some health researchers oppose regular inspections.&lt;ref name="Frankowski2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASN2004"/&gt;  This opposition to school inspections coincides with opposition to no-nit policies, and is based on similar reasoning (i.e., that they are ineffective).&lt;ref name="Frankowski2002"/&gt;

Barbara Frankowski, a critic of school screenings, argues that time spent screening children by school nurses is better spent on other tasks.&lt;ref name="Frankowski2004"/&gt;  This attitude reflects those held by some American school nurses themselves, 27% of whom believe that eliminating lice infestations in ''not'' an important role of school nursing.&lt;ref name="Price1999"/&gt;  Even more telling, only 11% of American school nurses find treating head lice to be professionally gratifying.&lt;ref name="Price1999"/&gt;  Similar attitudes exist among Canadian school nurses.&lt;ref name="Mathias1989"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathias RG, Wallace JF | title = Control of headlice: using parent volunteers | journal = Canadian Journal of Public Health | volume = 80 | issue = 6 | pages = 461–463 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2611749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rquote|right|No child should be allowed to miss valuable school time because of head lice.|American Academy of Pediatrics, 2002&lt;ref name="Frankowski2002"/&gt;}}

Keoki Williams and others acknowledge this shortcoming of school screening, and suggest that children found to have nits undergo an additional 5- to 10-minute examination to exclude the presence of live lice.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;  In contrast, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) argues not for increased inspection time, but elimination of the school screenings altogether, with parents being educated and encouraged to inspect their own children at home.&lt;ref name="Frankowski2004"/&gt;  This attitude, coupled with the AAP's opposition to the no-nit policy,&lt;ref name="Frankowski2004"/&gt; would essentially absolve school administrators of responsibility to directly manage pediculosis in their student body.

==Nits==

A [[Nits (lice)|nit]] is the egg of a louse. They are white, resembling dandruff, 0.8&amp;nbsp;mm long, cement to the hair base where they are difficult to remove, and may survive for three weeks away from the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSUMZ5ECEbMC&amp;pg=PA896#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The 5-minute Clinical Consult 2007 |page=896| author=Frank J.

Such children have evidence of infestation (i.e., the nits), but the infestation may be extinct.

Unfortunately, false negative conclusions (i.e., failing to find lice that are, in fact, present) regarding infestation have long been recognized as a problem in head lice diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Greenough1887"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hootman2002"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hootman J | title = Quality improvement projects related to pediculosis management | journal = The Journal of School Nursing : the official publication of the National Association of School Nurses | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 80–6 |date=April 2002 | pmid = 12017250 | doi=10.1177/10598405020180020401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgess1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2001"/&gt;  Depending on the methods used, live lice can be easily missed during inspection.&lt;ref name="Frankowski2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Australia2005"/&gt;  For example, a 1998 Israeli study found that 76% of live lice infestations were missed by visual inspection (as verified by subsequent combing methods).&lt;ref name="Hootman2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2001"/&gt;  Although lice cannot fly or jump, they are fast and agile in their native environment (i.e., clinging to hairs near the warmth of the scalp),&lt;ref name="Frankowski2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maunder1983"/&gt; and will try to avoid the light used during inspection.&lt;ref name="Bacot1917"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bacot A | title = Contributions to the bionomics of ''Pediculus humanus (vestimenti)'' and ''Pediculus capitis'' | journal = Parasitology | volume = 9 | pages = 228–258 | year = 1917 | doi = 10.1017/S0031182000006065}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuttall1919"&gt;{{cite journal | author =George H.

These difficulties have, at times, lead to the recommendation that the presence of nits alone be used to infer infestation:[[File:Fig. 5. Louse nits.jpg|thumb|right|Head louse nits on human hair]]

{{quote|When nymphs or adults are not observed, the presence of nits is diagnostic.|U.S. Centers for Disease Control, 1984&lt;ref name="Darsie1984"&gt;{{cite book  | editor = Darsie RE | title = Controlling Head Lice.

A 1998 American study attempted to clarify the infestation risk associated with a "nits-only" diagnosis.  They found that 18% of children with nits (but no apparent lice) became infested (i.e., lice appeared) 14 days later.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;  Whether these new lice came from viable eggs or via transmission from other hosts was not clear.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;  Transmission from other hosts would tend to overestimate the infestation risk associated with nits.  In addition, some children were treated with [[pediculicide]]s during this 14-day period.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;  Successful treatments (i.e., killing eggs or recently hatched nymphs) would tend to underestimate the infestation risk associated with nits.  These limitations of the study notwithstanding, the authors concluded:

{{quote|Most children with nits alone will not become infested; therefore, excluding these children from school and requiring them to be treated with a pediculicide is probably excessive.|L. Keoki Williams and others (2001)&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;}}

Although "nits-only" children are unlikely to become infested, this is not to say that a nit-free population is without value.  Much of the difficulty in accurately diagnosing head lice stems from the possibility that observed nits are due to an extinct infestation.  However, if a policy of required nit removal is enforced, this is no longer an issue.  Against a background of nit-free children, spotting new infestations through routine screening becomes as easy as spotting the nits.&lt;ref name="Brainerd1998"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;  This ease in screening comes at a price, though, namely the effort expended (typically by parents) in removing nits.  And to the extent that no-nit policies result in absenteeism, the child's education suffers, and the school's funding (e.g., from government sources) may be reduced.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EdSource"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.edsource.org/iss_fin_sys_dollarstodistricts.html | title = Dollars to Districts | accessdate = 2008-12-22 | publisher = EdSource | location = Mountain View, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of infested students==

===Immediate exclusion from school===
Discovery of infested students typically occurs during a school day.  Assuming the presence of live lice is the criteria used to infer infestation, an ethical dilemma is presented to school nurses and administrators.  Should this student, now known to be infectious, be returned to class where transmission to other students could occur?  Or alternatively, should the student be immediately removed from the group setting?  Schools have very limited capacity to individually supervise students outside of the classroom, so removal from the classroom means requesting that the child's parents pick up their child.

Parents often become upset when the school nurse telephones their place of employment to inform them of their child's infestation and to request they come and collect their child.&lt;ref name="Clore1990"/&gt;  Nonetheless, immediate exclusion policies are explicitly advocated by some nurses.&lt;ref name="Clore1990"/&gt;  A 1998 survey revealed that almost all (96%) American [[School nursing|school nurses]] send home infested students upon discovery.&lt;ref name="Donnelly1991"&gt;

Opponents to immediate exclusion policies point out that the discovery of infestation is merely recognition of what has been an infectious condition for a number of months.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maunder1983"/&gt;  Given that context, they argue, one more day of group contact is unlikely to result in more transmission than has already occurred.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maunder1983"/&gt;  This contrasts with more short-term and highly communicable [[virus|viral]] diseases such as [[chickenpox]], [[influenza]], or [[measles]] where immediate exclusion might reasonably reduce disease spread within the school.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The value of immediate exclusion for lice depends to some extent on the frequency of asymptomatic screening at the school.  More frequent screening would tend to decrease the average time between infestation and discovery of that infestation.  This would make the one day associated with immediate exclusion a more significant fraction of the total time the student was infectious.  But even ardent supporters of asymptomatic screening do not advocate screenings more than once every three months.&lt;ref name="Clore1990"/&gt;  This suggests that the effect of immediate exclusion might be an exposure time reduction of as little as 1.6%, even under strict screening guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Three months includes approximately 90 days, which in turn includes approximately 64 weekdays.  One out of 64 days is 0.0156 or 1.6%.&lt;/ref&gt;

These changing attitudes on immediate exclusion appear to be affecting public policy.  For example, in Australia, the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] states that infested children need not be sent home upon discovery.&lt;ref name="Australia2005"/&gt;  Similarly, the California Department of Public Health advocates a head lice policy that does not immediately exclude infested children.&lt;ref name="CA2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cdph.ca.gov/HealthInfo/discond/Documents/2012SchoolGuidanceonHeadLice.pdf | title = Guidelines on head lice prevention and control for school districts and child care facilities | accessdate = 2013-12-30 | author = Infectious Diseases Branch, Division of Communicable Disease Control | year = 2007 | format = pdf | publisher = California Department of Public Health | pages = 1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communicability in school settings===
Evaluating immediate exclusion policies is difficult, because {{as of|2008|lc=on}} the communicability of head lice in school settings has not been carefully studied.&lt;ref name="Hootman2002"/&gt;  This has not, however, prevented authors from confidently asserting their opinion:

{{quote|In some areas... crowded conditions at home may predispose persons to head lice.  Nevertheless, evidence indicates that most transmission actually occurs at school.|Norman G. Gratz, 1997&lt;ref name="Gratz1997"/&gt;}}

{{quote|Lice transmission in schools is rare because close head-to-head contact would have to occur and this generally does not happen in the school setting.|Patricia Sciscione and Cheryl A. Krause-Parello, 2007&lt;ref name="Sciscione2007"&gt;{{cite journal | author =Patricia Sciscione |author2=Krause-Parello CA | title = No-nit policies in schools: Time for change | journal = The Journal of School Nursing | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–20 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1177/10598405070230010301 | pmid = 17253890}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Two studies have noted clustering of head louse infestation by classroom.&lt;ref name="Hootman2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speare1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Richard Speare |author2=Buettner, PG | year = 1999 | title = Head lice in pupils of a primary school in Australia and implications for control | journal = International Journal of Dermatology | volume = 38 | pages = 285–290 | publisher = International Society of Dermatology | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-4362.1999.00680.x | pmid = 10321945 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the authors differ in their interpretation of this clustering.  In 1997, Richard Speare and Petra Buettner noted prevalence ranges of 0% to 72.2% across classrooms in the same grade (3rd) and in the same Australian school.  This led them to favor the idea that "opportunities for transmission are prominent within the classroom".&lt;ref name="Speare1999"/&gt;  Indeed, their data suggest that classrooms synchronize in terms of infestation status.

In contrast, Janis Hootman suggests that school communicability is low.&lt;ref name="Hootman2002"/&gt;  In 1998 she found that infestations within American classrooms were restricted to a minority of chronically infested students.  Hootman concluded that the infested students have access to an infectious source that their classmates do not.  Similarly, she found that clusters of pediculosis within classrooms were associated with social interactions outside school (e.g., [[sleepover]]s).&lt;ref name="Hootman2002"/&gt;  This indicates that transmission can occur between classmates, but again, these transmission events may be occurring away from school grounds.

==Barring return to school==

After identifying and isolating an infested student, school policy typically requires some sort of verification that the student is no longer infectious before being readmitted to the school.  Typically, this involves inspecting the child for evidence of continued infestation (see [[School head lice policy#Criteria to infer infestation|Criteria to infer infestation]] above).  Schools commonly enforce either a "no-nit" policy or a "no-lice" policy.

===The no-nit policy===
The consensus has been changed more recently and the ""no-nit" policy is considered worse than the nits themselves to a child's education and family burden the missed days cause. The EPA, CDC, and NASN all agree "no-nit" policies should be done away with and that kids should remain in school the entire day even if lice is found and notify the parents so they can treat it at home.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/managing-head-lice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nasn.org/advocacy/professional-practice-documents/position-statements/ps-head-lice&lt;/ref&gt;
No-nit policies bar readmission of students found to have lice, eggs, or nits.  This policy is popular with health authorities in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;  A 1998 survey revealed that a majority (61%) of American [[School nursing|school nurses]] prevent return of treated students to school if they are not (also) nit-free.&lt;ref name="Donnelly1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Price1999"/&gt;  A similar percentage (60%) felt that "forced absenteeism of any child who has any nits in their hair is a good idea."&lt;ref name="Price1999"/&gt;  Data from a primarily American study during 1998–1999 revealed even higher prevalence—no-nit policies were present at 82% of the schools attended by children suspected of louse infestation.&lt;ref name="Pollack2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pollack RJ, Kiszewski AE, Spielman A | title = Overdiagnosis and consequent mismanagement of head louse infestations in North America | journal = Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal | volume = 19 | issue = 8 | pages = 689–93 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10959734 | doi=10.1097/00006454-200008000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James H. Price and colleagues estimate that infested students lose two to four days of school for treatment and nit removal.&lt;ref name="Price1999"/&gt;  Based on their 1998 survey of American school nurses, they estimate that approximately 6 million U.S. children lose 12 to 24 million child-schooldays annually due to lice infestation under no-nit policies.&lt;ref name="Price1999"/&gt;

====Controversy surrounding no-nit policy====
{{Rquote|right|The no-nit policies may appeal to laypersons, and it is difficult to explain why they are not effective, particularly when some consumer organizations strongly support them.  Nevertheless, there is no scientific basis to confirm the effectiveness of such programs...|Barbara L. Frankowski (2004)&lt;ref name="Frankowski2004"/&gt;}}

Although the no-nit policy has the appearance of a simple and popular tool against pediculosis transmission, its implementation has been opposed by a number of health researchers and organizations.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frankowski2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frankowski2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASN2004"/&gt;  Opponents argue that enforcement of no-nit policies has not significantly reduced head lice incidence in school settings,&lt;ref name="Frankowski2002"/&gt; and that the risks and disadvantages of the no-nit policies outweigh their associated benefits.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;

As is the case in assessing school screening efforts (see [[School head lice policy#Screening|Screening]] above), assessing the effectiveness of no-nit policies is complicated by the sparseness of head lice prevalence data.&lt;ref name="Donnelly1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Billstein1979"/&gt;  To the extent that no-nit policies increase the efficiency of school screening programs (see [[School head lice policy#Benefits of nit-free population|Benefits of nit-free population]] above), no-nit policies may lead to more rapid containment of head lice outbreaks.  However, {{as of|2008|lc=on}}, the [[correlation]] between no-nit policies and head lice [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] has not been examined.

====Inherent conflict over no-nit policy====
Kosta Y. Mumcuoglu and colleagues indict required nit removal policies as an attempt to minimize the effort expended by school nurses on differentiating active and extinct infestations.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;  They further argue that this minimization comes at the expense of excessive efforts on the part of parents to remove signs of previous infestations (i.e., the nits), which have no clinical importance.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;

The difficulty parents face in advocating more lax attitudes towards children with nits, is that the parents have no concomitant guarantee from school administrators that those admitted children will truly be lice-free.  Indeed, admitting children with nits ''increases'' the difficulty in identifying actively infested students (see [[School head lice policy#Criteria to infer infestation|Criteria to infer infestation]] above).  In contrast to diseases such as [[measles]] or [[influenza]], pediculosis does not inherently prevent school attendance.  The financial incentive for schools, therefore, is to minimize expenditures on lice control and screening programs because (absent a no-nit policy) they have little effect on attendance.&lt;ref name="Sciscione2007"/&gt;  This is a formula for maximizing lice infestation within the student body, not minimizing it.  Thus, while the no-nit policy may be seen as off-loading school nurse responsibilities to parents,&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt; it is perhaps more correctly viewed as imposing parental priorities on school administrators.

In the absence of such policies, school and parental priorities with respect to lice are inherently at odds.  The parents wish to minimize lice transmission. In contrast, schools wish to maximize attendance, which is largely unaffected by lice transmission.  Barring return of children until nits are removed has the effect of transforming the pediculosis "problem" for which schools have no inherent incentive to solve, into an attendance "problem" for which schools have a direct financial interest.  Unfortunately, the solution advocated by many to this attendance "problem" is to simply remove the no-nit policy,&lt;ref name="Frankowski2002"/&gt; leaving the inherent conflict between parents and school administrators unaddressed.

===The no-lice policy===
The no-lice policy bars readmission of students with crawling lice, but are indifferent to the presence of eggs and nits.  These policies are advocated by a number of government agencies, but {{as of|2008|lc=on}}, no data on the overall prevalence of no-lice policies exists.  In Australia, the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] states that treated children can return with nits so long as they are lice-free.&lt;ref name="Australia2005"/&gt;  Similarly, the California Department of Public Health advocates a policy that permits students to return to school with nits.&lt;ref name="CA2007"/&gt;

'''''Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn''''' is a book by [[CUNY Graduate Center]] professor [[Cathy Davidson]] published by [[Viking Press]] on August 19, 2011.

==Summary and key themes==

===Outdated approaches to education===
In ''Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn,'' [[Cathy Davidson]] suggests that breakthroughs in [[cognitive science]] should recalibrate our sense of what it means to learn. According to Davidson, those of us in [[higher education]] are paradoxically obsessed with the implications of living in the "[[Information Age|digital age]]," even though we have “yet to rethink how we need to be organizing our institutions—our schools, our offices—to maximize the opportunities of our digital era” (12). We tend to uphold models of teaching and assessments that no longer serve a generation of students who face a myriad of new challenges, as they attempt to learn to think critically in an era of information overload. Technology in all its forms is playing an increasingly important role in the lives of students. Colleges and universities, therefore, need to pay attention to the impact that the appropriate uses of digital tools can have on extending, enhancing, and enriching the student learning experience, both on and off campus. Moreover, and more importantly, Davidson argues that sustained exposure to such a range of [[digital media]] demands a different kind of attention than we previously required.

===The science of attention===
In ''Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn'' Cathy Davidson examines the phenomenon of [[attention blindness]]: humans perceive only a fraction of everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the [[multi-task]] oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic [[neurological]] feature of the [[human brain]]. In the introduction of ''Now You See It,'' Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed to see someone in a full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t even try to keep count, but instead decided to relax as she watched the tape, and thus, she noticed the gorilla.

Davidson argues that as a culture, our attention blindness represents a significant challenge that we must examine and meet head on; particularly since the [[Internet]] has revolutionized virtually every aspect of how our lives function now. The Internet, Davidson suggests, has catapulted us into an immediate, collaborative, and interconnected existence that is characterized by the sudden breakdown of barriers between private and public, work and play, domestic and foreign, office and home, etc. Davidson notes that although our lives have been irrevocably altered in these fundamental ways, our most important educational, corporate, and social institutions have not substantially changed in correlation with these upheavals. She claims that those in educational and corporate spheres continue to operate in 20th century modes (founded to meet the challenges of [[industrialization]]) as though we were currently not living through momentous, epochal changes.

“With the Internet, we have seen dramatic rearrangements, in a little over a decade, in the most basic aspects of how we communicate, interact, gather knowledge of the world, develop and recognize our [[social networks]] and our communities, do business and exchange goods, understand what is true, and know what counts and is worthy of attention” (11).

“This book starts from certain core questions: 
*Where do our patterns of attention come from? 
*How can what we know about attention help us change how we teach and learn?
*How can the science of attention alter our ideas about how we test and what we measure?
*How can we work better with others with different skills and expertise in order to see what we're missing in a complicated and interdependent world? 
*How does attention change as we age, and how can understanding the science of attention actually help us along the way?” (19-20)

===Changing workplace===
Technology, Davidson argues, re-shapes the way we learn and process new information in some fundamental ways. We surf hundreds of news feeds, immediately discriminating between the ones we need to read and the ones we don't. In our work environments, we are forced to focus, divide, and re-focus our attention as we are dealing with multiple tasks at the same time. Within this multitasking that the new workplace requires, Davidson urges her readers to re-imagine the concept of distraction. We are cultured to imagine that shopping online while finishing a report or answering personal emails and simultaneously working on a project are distractions which are detrimental to our productivity and efficiency. Every time we switch tasks, we are hurting our work. Davidson argues, however, that these small distractions afforded by technology should be thought of as innovations. &lt;blockquote&gt;"When we feel distracted, something’s up. Distraction is really another word for saying that something is new, strange or different. We should pay attention to that feeling… Distraction is one of the best tools for innovation we have at our disposal—for changing patterns of attention and beginning the process of learning new patterns"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Cathy|title=Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn|year=2011|publisher=Viking|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Re-imagined classroom===
In addition to transforming our workplace and everyday life, Davidson argues that technology allows us a great opportunity to rethink the way we teach and organize our education system. In addition to the famous iPod experiment described earlier, Davidson suggests that gaming, blogging, self-grading, and collaborative learning are among the effective and innovative teaching tools and strategies, whose benefits outweigh those offered by the "one-size-fits-all model of standards that evolved over the course of the twentieth century." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Cathy|title=Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn|year=2011|publisher=Viking|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the chapter, "Project Classroom Makeover," Davidson argues that the current education system is blind to the ways in which children learn and solve complex problems today, such as: creating and memorizing names and avatars of online game players, creating and writing simple codes to advance in games, searching internet for new information, and engaging with it in new creative ways. If the education system harnesses these natural curiosities through restructured curricula, it can promote creative and critical thinking and allow students to develop in their own, unique ways, rather than forcing them to fit into the standardized system of skills.

As an example of a Made-Over Classroom, Davidson discusses an experimental school [[Quest 2 Learn]]. Q2L is a school whose curriculum is based on the principles of gaming. There students don't just go from class to class, completing regular assignments, they participate in quests, aimed at solving complex problems, advancing from one level to another, culminating in a final project. This model, according to Davidson, has the potential to address the needs of children who are diagnosed with learning disabilities, such as [[ADHD]] or [[autism]], allowing them to learn in ways that focus on their individual strengths without forcing them into a standardized learning structure, which could be detrimental to their engagement and future achievements.

==Critical reception==

Davidson's ''Now You See It'' has received largely positive reviews. Publishers Weekly called ''Now You See It'' "critically important" and "likely to shape discussions for years to come,"&lt;ref&gt;Rev. of Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn. Publishers Weekly 01 Aug. 2011: n. pag. Publishers Weekly. Web. 26 Mar. 2014. &lt;http://reviews.publishersweekly.com/978-0-670-02282-3&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; while Howard Gardner of Harvard University celebrates Davidson for having "a mind that ranges comfortably over literary arts, literacy, psychology, and brain science" and predicts that her "timely book is certain to attract a lot of attention and to catalyze many discussions."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Now-You-See-Technology-Transform/dp/014312126X&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2015, Amazon.com rated the book 4 out of 5 stars, based on 45 separate reviews.

Although mainly positive, a few critical reactions question Davidson's "youth worship" and her "enthusiasm for anything new and digital and by an almost allergic aversion to any practices or artifacts from the pre-Internet era."&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Annie M. "Who's Afraid of Digital Natives? 22 4 0 Let's Not Get Intimidated by Kids and Their Internet Savvy." Rev. of Now You See It: How Technology and Brain Science Will Transform Schools and Business for the 21st Century. Slate 22 Aug. 2011: n. pag. Slate. 22 Aug. 2011. Web. 26 Mar. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a generally positive review of ''Now You See It,'' in the journal ''portal: Libraries and the Academy,'' Andrew Battista wrote "As inspiring as ''Now You See'' It can be, I would say that Davidson uncritically seeks to apply the doctrines of capitalist efficiency into contemporary learning. In fact, at times her vision of education seems to verge on a kind of fluency that will prepare people to compete in a new globalized economy rather than an altruistic experience that sees learning as the preparation of any fit participant in a democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Battista. "Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn (review)." ''portal: Libraries and the Academy'' 12.1 (2012): 104-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cathy Davidson herself revealed in a comment to an online article titled ''Open Access, Public Intellectualism, and Academic Reform'' that despite not being a neuroscientist herself, she has received only one and a half bad reviews from neuroscientists, while frequently receiving fan notes from other neuroscientists agreeing with her stance on the brain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hastac.org/blogs/trentmkays/2012/01/03/open-access-public-intellectualism-and-academic-reform&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson was appointed by President [[Barack Obama]] to a six-year term on the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/content/cathy-n-davidson National Endowment for the Humanities. Cathy Davidson. Web. 3/28/14]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postgraduate research''' represents a formal area of study that is recognized by a university or institute of higher learning. By definition, the notion of “postgraduate” ([[United States]]) carries the implication that the candidate undertaking such research has already completed a formal [[Master's degree]] and at some instances the [[Doctor of Philosophy |PhD]], at an accredited university or tertiary institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniguru.co.in/studyabroad/postgraduate/us-usa/all-university-courses/harvard-university-courses/72040/1/programs.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting qualifications arising from postgraduate research leads to Post ([[Doctorate]]s).&lt;ref&gt;http://cambridge.net/us/harvard-academics-courses-research/&lt;/ref&gt;
  
==Structure==
The structure of postgraduate research programs can vary significantly from one country to another.  To enter into a PhD program in the United States, students generally must have some form of prerequisite study beyond their basic graduate qualification. This may be a Master’s coursework program, which acts as a qualifier for entry.  In other countries, entry to Doctoral or Master’s research programs is based on the academic track record of the candidates in their undergraduate degrees.

Many students confuse the notion of postgraduate research with “invention” and “discovery”.  Postgraduate research ultimately represents an apprenticeship in the field of research.  In his textbook,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doctortee.net/KeyFactors.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''Key Factors in Postgraduate Research – A Guide for Students''. Dario Toncich explains that the objective of postgraduate research is not necessarily to make a breakthrough invention or, indeed, a major scientific discovery.  

It is, rather, a mechanism by which graduate students learn how to undertake a systematic investigation, founded upon the work built by peers in the field, and then to extend the current state of knowledge.  In the context of assessing a postgraduate research program, it is generally the systematic process of research and investigation that is given more attention than the level to which knowledge is extended.  The title "doctor" emanates from the Latin word ''docera''&amp;mdash;to teach.  Hence there is an expectation that the recipient of a doctorate would go on to become some form of "teacher" in the broad sense of the word.&lt;ref&gt;http://icmr.nic.in/ifc_research.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 19th century, postgraduate research was a rarity, with countries such as the United States only having a small number of candidates across their university spectrum.  However, by the start of the 21st century, postgraduate research, and postgraduate qualifications, had become commonplace.  In any one year, at a global level, there are hundreds of thousands of candidates undertaking postgraduate research programs.  For this reason the nature of postgraduate research has also changed.  

At Doctoral level, there is some recognition that it is no longer reasonable to expect major research breakthroughs as part of a postgraduate research program.  To this end, Doctoral research more commonly now represents an extension of knowledge, rather than some form of breakthrough.  There is also some recognition that modern postgraduate research programs now have to be conducted in the light of massive amounts of previously published work, and hence the [[literature review]] process has become significantly more complex.

The nomenclature associated with titles arising from postgraduate research vary from one institution to another and one country to another. Postgraduate research programs generally result in a thesis/dissertation, which is assessed by independent experts in the field.  The specific nature of the thesis varies from one discipline to another and from one country to another.  In addition, some universities insist that students also undertake a ''viva-voce'' oral examination in which they can defend their research and processes before an expert panel.

In [[India]], generally, the higher the level of the research degree the less association it has with a specific discipline.  For example, at Bachelor's level, it would be common to receive a [[Bachelor of Science |BS]]c(Chemistry).  At Master's level, the corresponding degree would be an MSc (without the specific subdiscipline).  At Doctoral level, the degree would be simply PhD with no discipline stated.  This is intended to show that the recipient of the award has mastered techniques that are more generic than those encapsulated in a specific discipline or subdiscipline.  There are some exceptions to this.  In a professional Doctorate, where the objective is to demonstrate an in-depth research knowledge of a particular area, the discipline is usually included (e.g., Doctor of Business).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isb.edu/fpm/ProgrammeStructure.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In some universities, it is also possible for candidates to achieve what is referred to as a "higher doctorate".  This is generally an award bestowed upon people who have made a substantial contribution to their discipline through their research.  Higher doctorates would normally be awarded after a significant research career and therefore those who receive such awards generally already have a basic PhD to begin with.  Like professional doctorates, higher doctorates generally carry the title of the discipline to which the research contributions have been made&amp;mdash;for example, Doctor of Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.be.seas.upenn.edu/prospective-students/doctoral/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''school leaving age''' is the minimum age a person is legally allowed to cease attendance at an institute of [[compulsory education|compulsory]] [[secondary education]]. Most countries have their school leaving age set the same as their minimum full-time employment age, thus allowing smooth transition from education into employment, whilst a few have it set just below the age at which a person is allowed to be employed.

In contrast, there are numerous countries that have several years between their school leaving age and their legal minimum employment age, thus in some cases preventing any such transition for several years. Countries which have their employment age set below the school leaving age of 5 years old but  (mostly developing countries), risk giving children the opportunity to leave their education early to earn money for their families.

==Leaving age by country==
Some countries have different leaving or employment ages, but in certain countries like China and Japan, the average age at which people graduate is 15, depending upon part-time or full-time learning or employment. The table below states the school leaving ages in countries across the world and their respective minimum employment age, showing a comparison of how many countries have synchronised these ages. All information is taken from the Right to Education Project's table unless otherwise indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.right-to-education.org/node/279 |title=Country Table - At What Age?...are school-children employed, married and taken to court|publisher=The Right to Education Project|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining a havo or vwo diploma, the student is no longer obligated to go to school regardless of their age. Except those students which have done vmbo, they must have a mbo level 2 or higher diploma before quitting school.

Also, all children between those ages, even if they're refugees or new, have to attend school.
Not attending school with-out proper reason for example; sickness or a doctors visit, is illegal and is seen as wagging which is seen as fraud and punishable by law. Until the age of 12 children cannot be punished by law, but as soon as your child or you turn 12 years of age or older, you can be held responsible for wagging.
Punishments can be done as a fine, temporary jail time or a community service job done under supervision. Fines can be up to € 3 900 00.
These punishments can be given to the student and/or his or her legal parent or guardian.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6539">'''Science Education at the Crossroads''' is an annual national [[academic conference]], initially funded by the [[National Science Foundation]], designed to enable various stakeholders in [[science education]] to confer in a legitimate and productive manner.  The conference also claims to offer an alternative to the standard model of conferring and professional development.   Conference creators and coordinators are [[John Settlage]] of the [[University of Connecticut]] and Adam Johnston of [[Weber State University]].

==Philosophy==
Many organizations and conferences exist for science educators.  These include the [[National Science Teachers Association]] (NSTA), the [http://narst.org/ National Association for Research in Science Teaching] (NARST), the [http://aste.chem.pitt.edu/ Association for Science Teacher Education] (ASTE), and many others dedicated to specific fields (e.g., physics and chemistry) within science education.  While these organizations are adept at presenting research results or at sharing innovations in teaching, organizers and many participants in Crossroads feel that none of them provide a means for new research questions, policy directives, or general science education goals to be discussed and deliberated.

Crossroads uses the [[Vexation and Venture]] format for conference sessions in which an "Incubator Forum" allows for an interactive, discussion based and dynamic intersection of views.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, A. &amp; Settlage, J. (2008). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/t6206m3q01x0v750] Framing the professional development of members of the science teacher education community. Journal of Science Teacher Education, 19, 513-521.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, A. &amp; Settlage, J. (2006, January). [http://physics.weber.edu/johnston/research/crossroads_ASTEproceedings_2006.pdf Science Education at the Crossroads]. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Science Teacher Education, Portland, OR.&lt;/ref&gt; This mode of interaction has been shown to engage presenters and participants in a way that new ideas and problems can be proposed, and the group takes on responsibility for a generative session.  In this format, problems (vexations) are dissected and their possible specific solutions (ventures) are proposed.  In this manner, the process of research and innovation is presented in a public forum in its early development stages, rather than after its completion, as would be the case in other [[academic conference]] formats.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, A. &amp; Settlage, J. (2008). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/t6206m3q01x0v750] Framing the professional development of members of the science teacher education community. Journal of Science Teacher Education, 19, 513-521.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Settlage, J., Johnston, A., Meadows, L., Harkins, H., Kittleson, J. (2007, January). [http://physics.weber.edu/johnston/research/ASTE%202007workshop.pdf Professional Development at a Crossroads. Using Vexations as the Focal Point.] Workshop presented at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Science Teacher Education, Clearwater, FL.&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants represent backgrounds from science and education, and represent perspectives from classroom teaching, policy, and research. This variety of perspectives allows each participant to tap into expertise that they might not otherwise encounter within the typical course of their professional lives. In this regard the metaphor of a [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] describes a [[culture]] and place where people can meet.

==History==
Crossroads originated from a disenchantment with more [[professional conference|traditional education conferences]].  As a consequence, Crossroads was designed, utilizing the [[Vexation and Venture]] format, to make generative discussions a deliberate feature of the conference.

Crossroads has a history of finding a specific place and space each year for conferring.  Oscillating from venue to venue has allowed each year to have its own character, as well as allow people from specific regions to have more access to the conference.  Crossroads has been held at the following venues:
* Storrs, CT (2005)
* Ogden, UT (2006)
* Amherst, MA (2007)
* Alta, UT (2008)
* Portland, OR (2009)
* San Antonio, TX (2011)
* Providence, RI (2012)
* Portlandia (2014)
* Cleveland, OH (2015)

Crossroads has a history of inviting poets as keynotes to its conferences.  These have included:
* [[Taylor Mali]] (2005)
* [[Jimmy Santiago Baca]], joined by [http://www.yurcic.com/ Jason Yurcic] (2006)
* [http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/97 Marilyn Nelson] (2007)
* [http://www.herondance.org/David-Lee-Poetry-W191C49.aspx David Lee] (2008)
* [[Lawson Fusao Inada]] (2009)
* [[Naomi Shihab Nye]] (2011)

Additionally, illustrator/artist/educator [http://www.fredlynch.com/ Fred Lynch] contributed the keynote address in 2012.

Crossroads has also established a line of work that has called for scholarly work in science education to reach out to create significant impact in education.  This has been referred to as "scholar activism" by David Moss, Crossroads' first keynote speaker in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, D. M. (2005). Toward scholar activism.  Keynote address given at the Science Education at the Crossroads Conference, October 9–11, University of Connecticut.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other speakers have included John Settlage in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Settlage, J. (2006).  Prospects of pragmatism: The generation of science education adventurists.  Keynote address given at the Science Education at the Crossroads Conference, September 28–30, Ogden, UT.&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Johnston in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, A. (2007). Orchestrations of Science Education Adventurism.  Keynote address given at the Science Education at the Crossroads Conference, September 23–25, Amherst, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidi Carlone in 2008, and Magnia George in 2009.  Conference organizers have contributed joint addresses in 2011 and 2012.

==Future==
''Science Education at the Crossroads'' has moved its conference each fall, from east to west and back again, through the year 2009. Most notably, [[National Science Foundation]] funding was established to fund the conference from 2007 - 2009.  In 2010, the conference organizers are considering next steps for future sequences of the event.

'''Seductive details''' are often used in textbooks, lectures, slideshows, and other forms of educational content to make a course more interesting or interactive. Seductive details can take the form of text, photos, illustrations, sounds or music and are by definition: (1) interesting and (2) not directed toward the learning objectives of a lesson.&lt;ref name=park1 /&gt;  [[John Dewey]], in 1913, first referred to this as “fictitious inducements to attention.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dewey|first1=J.|title=Interest and Effort in Education|date=1913|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; While illustrated text can enhance comprehension, illustrations that are not relevant can lead to poor [[Educational aims and objectives#Learning outcomes|learning outcomes]].&lt;ref name=sanchez&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanchez|first1=C.

Recently, there have been many criticisms of this theory. Critics cite unconvincing and contradictory evidence to argue that seductive details do not always impede understanding and that seductive details can sometimes be motivating for learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goetz|first1=E.

== The research ==
[[File:Carbon sequestration-2009-10-07.svg|thumb|Example of an image that is relevant to the topic of carbon sequestration.]] [[File:Centrale Saint-Denis.jpg|thumb|Example of a seductive detail. This image of a fossil-fuel power plant is tangentially related to carbon sequestration.]] Most studies are conducted through experiments that compare the learning results between two scenarios: an explanation with seductive details and an explanation with no seductive details. The explanation format can vary in form from text-based, video, web-based or presentation style. The seductive details in these experiments varies from extraneous details to irrelevant images or irrelevant video. Learning outcomes of participants are determined through a variety of tests that include both recall abilities and problem-solving abilities. This is known as transfer performance.

Early research showed that adding seductive details did not have the intended effect of improving learning; instead the seductive details tended to be detrimental to the learner's recall. Adding interesting but unimportant sentences to expository texts hindered the learning of the main points of the text and learners would remember the seductive details better than the main text.

An example of a seductive detail in a training context might be a training class that includes cartoons on slides containing tips for effective supervision. Although not necessarily relevant to the topic, the cartoons are designed to make the training material more interesting, but the results of multiple studies suggest that their inclusion will harm recall from the primary training content.

Harp and [[Richard E. Mayer|Mayer]]&lt;ref name=harp&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harp|first1=S.|last2=Mayer|first2=R.|title=How seductive details do their damage: A theory of cognitive interest in science learning|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=1998|volume=90|issue=3|pages=414–434|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.90.3.414}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted an experiment using a lesson about lightning strikes. The effect of lightning strikes on airplanes was added as a seductive detail. In six out of six experiments, learners who studied the base lesson without the seductive details about the strikes on airplanes demonstrated they were three times more likely to recall the structurally important details. They also performed much better on a problem-solving task than learners whose lessons included the seductive details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when learners are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall.&lt;ref name=harp /&gt;

== The psychology ==
Researchers focus on various aspects of [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive theory]] to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an extraneous cognitive load during learning by enticing students to spend their limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, the construction of a coherent [[mental model]] in the learning process. Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous cognitive load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load learning process that requires managing the available cognitive resources. In learning situations that are associated with low [[working memory]] activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function.&lt;ref name=park1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=B.|last2=Moreno|first2=R.|last3=Seufert|first3=T.|last4=Bruken|first4=R.|title=Does cognitive load moderate the seductive details effect? A multimedia study|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=January 2011|volume=27|issue=1|pages=5–10|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metacognition ===
Jaeger and Wiley, in 2015, looked at readers' ability to monitor their own comprehension. Their study used a science text as the base of a lesson and decorative images as the seductive details. They found that readers were less able to monitor their own comprehension of the text when the text was sprinkled with decorative images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=A.|last2=Wiley|first2=J.|title=Do illustrations help or harm metacomprehension accuracy?|journal=Learning &amp; Instruction|date=Dec 2014|volume=34|pages=58–73|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2014.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activating inappropriate prior knowledge ===
A 1998 study by Harp and Mayer determined that it was likely that the seductive details effect created an inappropriate diversion for the learner "by activating an inappropriate base of prior knowledge in the learner". Further, they found that when seductive details were placed at the beginning of a lesson, a learner's performance would be particularly hindered. However, when seductive details were put at the end of a lesson, a student's performance was similar to a student who had not experienced seductive details in their lesson.&lt;ref name=harp /&gt;

=== Strain on working memory ===
A study by Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor learning outcomes because they take up some of the limited space in [[working memory]]. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity.&lt;ref name=sanchez /&gt; It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daneman|first1=M.|last2=Carpenter|first2=P. A.|title=Individual differences in working memory and reading|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning &amp; Verbal Behavior|date=1980|volume=19|pages=450–466|doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(80)90312-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This vulnerability as it relates to low working memory capacity individuals and seductive details within textual information can also be seen as a difference between children and adult learners. Because adults, on average, having a higher working memory capacity than children, adults are less affected by seductive details than children.&lt;ref name=garner /&gt;

=== Transfer of learning ===
The seductive details effect has primarily been demonstrated at the point of [[knowledge acquisition]] (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the schematic representation of information that trainees form during instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=van Dijk|first1=T. A.|last2=Kintsch|first2=W.|title=Strategies of discourse comprehension|date=1983|publisher=Academic|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have described the seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning and they tend to form inappropriate schemas to organize information.&lt;ref name=harp /&gt; However, when learners are applying knowledge, [[Empirical research|empirical studies]] suggest that the distortion of the macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mannes|first1=S.|last2=Kintsch|first2=W.|title=Knowledge organization and text organization|journal=Cognition and Instruction|date=1987|volume=4|pages=91–115|doi=10.1207/s1532690xci0402_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=D. S.|last2=Kintsch|first2=W.|last3=Songer|first3=N. B.|title=Are good texts always better? Interactions of text coherence, background knowledge, and levels of understanding in learning from text|journal=Cognition and Instruction|date=1996|volume=14|pages=1–43|doi=10.1207/s1532690xci1401_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, students who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required an application of the knowledge to problem-solving. This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall will not be as good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems.&lt;ref name=paivio&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paivio|first1=A|title=Mental representations: A dual coding approach.|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sadoski2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadoski|first1=M|last2=Goetz|first2=E. T.|last3=Fritz|first3=J. B.|title=Impact of concreteness, interest, and memory for text implications for dual coding theory and text design.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=1993|volume=85|pages=291–304|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.85.2.291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sadoski1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadoski|first1=M|last2=Goetz|first2=E. T.|last3=Rodriguez|first3=M.|title=Engaging texts: Effects of concreteness on comprehensibility, interest, and recall in four text types|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=2000|volume=92|pages=85–95|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.92.1.85}}&lt;/ref&gt; When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information.

== Criticisms ==
Classic learning theories and the modern [[dual-coding theory]] support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems.&lt;ref name=paivio /&gt;&lt;ref name=sadoski2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sadoski1 /&gt; This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.&lt;ref name=paivio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadoski|first1=M.|last2=Paivio|first2=A.|title=Imagery and text: A dual coding theory of reading and writing|journal=Reading and Writing|date=2001|volume=16|pages=259–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayer|first1=R. E.|last2=Anderson|first2=R. B.|title=Animations need narrations: An experimental test of a dual-coding hypothesis|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=1991|volume=83|pages=484–490|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.83.4.484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several recent studies have shown that adding seductive details does not have a significant impact on learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011)&lt;ref name=park1 /&gt; looked at cognitive load theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied the cognitive load for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low cognitive load environment as compared with all other conditions.&lt;ref name=park1 /&gt; Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high cognitive load text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where the cognitive load was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase learner motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=B.|last2=Flowerday|first2=T.|last3=Brunken|first3=R.|title=Cognitive and affective effects of seductive details in multimedia learning|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=March 2015|volume=44|pages=267–278|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.10.061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>The page included uncited claims about students in self-directed education programs. It also stated that there isn't research on outcomes for students in SDE programs, described a narrow definition of SOLE, and implied that play is a distraction rather than a productive part of a child's development (see the work of Peter Gray and David Lancy). I removed the unsubstantiated claims and explained how the definition of SOLEs has expanded. The spelling of "organized" is still mismatched.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8170">A '''Self Organized Learning Environment''' ('''SOLE''') is a program designed to support self-directed education. [[Sugata Mitra]], an education scientist, first popularized the term in 1999, referencing an approach he developed following his [[Sugata Mitra#Hole in the Wall|Hole in the Wall]] experiments.&lt;ref name="TT SM"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_the_child_driven_education.html | title=Sugata Mitra: The child-driven education | website=TEDGlobal 2010 | date=July 2013 | accessdate=December 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_the_child_driven_education/transcript?language=en | title=Sugata Mitra: The child-driven education (transcript) | website=TEDGlobal 2010 | date=July 2013 | accessdate=December 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitra's experiments demonstrated that groups of kids could learn to navigate computers and the internet by themselves, and "[r]esearch since then has continued to support his startling conclusion that groups of children, with access to the Internet, can learn almost anything by themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/about/|title=About {{!}} School in the Cloud|website=www.theschoolinthecloud.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2014, he's worked with and through the [[School in the Cloud]] project to support the development of SOLEs around the world, adding "Granny" mentors and Big Questions as key components of such programs.

==Initial Experiments &amp; Project SOLE==
One of the things that was learned through the program is that children are often smarter than given credit for. Rather than providing lectures or spoon-feeding information to the students, it is better to ask "engaging, provocative questions" and let them work out the answers. It was also determined to be good to let the students self-direct in the areas that are of interest to them, with the idea that students will then often stretch to comprehend information that might have otherwise been too difficult for them.&lt;ref name="IATEFL" /&gt;

Other findings were that the educational experience is enhanced through collaboration and teamwork, that speech-to-text software is an effective tool for learning to speak a new language, and that tests asking students to solve real-life problems are more effective at prompting students to apply and demonstrate their learning than standard tests.&lt;ref name="IATEFL"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.academia.edu/7475327/Classrooms_in_the_cloud_or_castles_in_the_air |title=Classrooms in the clouds or castles in the air | magazine=Voices | publisher=International Association of Teachers of English as a Foreign Language (IATEFL)|date=July–August 2014 | number=239 | via=academia.edu |author=Michał Paradowski |pages=8–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first student in India to use the program was Gouri Chindarkar (born about 1996) from Sangli in Maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Sunny-Leone-Neha-Singh-on-BBCs-100-most-influential-women-list/articleshow/55559311.cms|title=Sunny Leone, Neha Singh on BBC’s 100 most influential women list - Times of India|newspaper=The Times of India|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianewsbulletin.com/bbc-2016-100-women-list-sunny-leone-mallika-srinivasan-neha-singh-saalumarada-thimmakka-gourichindarkar|title=BBC 100 Women 2016 List: Sunny Leone and 4 Indian women in inspirational and influential list|website=India News Bulletin|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She learned about the program through a mentor, an American woman named Ann Thomas, who met with her at 6:30 in the morning. She used a computer for the first time, and her schoolwork delivered in English; her native language is [[Marathi language|Marathi]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37405969|title=100 Women 2016: The girl who learnt in the cloud|date=2016-11-22|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gouri Chindarkar has since studied Computing Engineering at the [[Kankavli|Kankavali]] campus of [[Mumbai University]] and she was selected as one of the BBC's [[100 Women (BBC)|100 Women in 2016]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Project SOLE was begun in 10 locations in [[Hyderabad]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], with an 11th one in [[Sindhudurg district|Sindhudurg]] rural area of [[Maharashtra]] over a period of 2 years, 2008 to 2009. It is not clear to what extent the learning is effective over the long-term.&lt;ref name="IATEFL" /&gt;

== The School In The Cloud ==
In their own words, "The School in the Cloud platform was originally launched at the 2014 TED conference to help accelerate this research by helping educators — be they teachers, parents or community leaders — to run their own SOLEs and to contribute to the global experiment by sharing their experiences with others. It is now managed by SOLE Central at Newcastle University, a global hub for SOLE research and practice directed by Sugata Mitra."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/about/|title=About {{!}} School in the Cloud|website=www.theschoolinthecloud.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are currently experimenting to refine and increase access to education programs that blend the SOLE approach of encouraging student groups to self-direct online learning with lessons from the [[Philosophy for Children|Philosophy For Children]] (P4C) project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/blogpost/3430/|title=A philosophical approach to SOLE {{!}} School in the Cloud|website=www.theschoolinthecloud.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation Within Institutionalized Education==
Though Mitra's initial experiments focused on children living in unstable environments and in poverty, his findings inspired educators in a wide variety of environments to adapt his work. Teachers in both traditional and progressive environments have found ways to incorporate the SOLE approach in their work, whether for the span of a lesson or a semester. One prominent education blog suggests, "Consider it a tool for introducing and generating interest in a new topic, as well as broadening your students’ understanding of a familiar topic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edutopia.org/blog/getting-started-self-organized-learning-environments-jacquelyn-omalley|title=Getting Started With Self-Organized Learning Environments {{!}} Edutopia|work=Edutopia|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the SOLE is just one element in a larger inquiry or project-based learning cycle.

==Adaptation Beyond Institutionalized Education==
For some, the initial SOLE projects showed the immense potential for learning in settings where students leverage technology and social learning to explore their interests with minimal interference. The US nonprofit Black Mountain SOLE opened a community center "inspired by the idea that human curiosity is the best motivation for learning" and identifying as an adaptation from earlier SOLE projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blackmountainsole.org/about-us/|title=About Us - Blackmountainsole|work=Blackmountainsole|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agile Learning Centers]] and a number of the projects that are part of the Alliance for Self-Directed Education also consider themselves to either be or be inspired by SOLEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://self-directed.org/|title=Alliance for Self-Directed Education {{!}} Home Page|work=Alliance for Self-Directed Education|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In United States education, a '''senior''' is a [[student]] in the fourth year of study (generally high school or college/university study).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/senior?view=uk
|title=Concise Oxford English Dictionary
|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/senior%5B1%5D
|title=Merriam-Webster online
|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High school==
In the United States, the [[twelfth grade]] is usually the fourth and final year of a student's high school period and is referred to as his/her senior year. In [[England]] and [[Wales]], students in their tenth year and above in Secondary School are seniors{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}; in [[Scotland]], students in their fifth year and above are seniors. In the  province of [[Ontario]], high school students in their third year and above are considered to be seniors, while in the province of [[Alberta]], only grade twelves are counted as seniors  even though both provinces are Canadian (due to the fact that high school is only grades ten-twelve in Alberta). In the state of [[Queensland]] in [[Australia]], senior refers to the final two years of high school.

==Higher education==
In the United States, the fourth year that a student has been at a higher institution, is known as the senior year.

===Intercollegiate athletics===
In [[college athletics]], a student in their final year of eligibility is known as a senior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D116.pdf|title = 2015-2016 NCAA Division I Manual - AUGUST VERSION - Available August 2015|publisher = [[NCAA]]|accessdate = 8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Super Senior==
The term super senior is used in the United States to refer to a fifth-year student who has not completed the graduation requirements by the end of the fourth year, and thus is required to stay an additional year to complete said requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://northernstar.info/campus/news/article_e168216a-5137-11e1-acdb-0019bb30f31a.html|title=Super seniors find educational reasons to stay past four years|first=Felix|last=Sarver|date=|website=northernstar.info|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Senioritis''' is a [[Colloquialism|colloquial term]] mainly used in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] to describe the decreased [[motivation]] toward studies displayed by students who are nearing the end of their [[high school]], [[college]], and [[graduate school]] careers, or the end of the school year in general. It combines the word ''senior'' with the suffix ''-itis'', which technically denotes [[inflammation]] but in colloquial speech is assumed to mean a general illness.

== Research ==
Writer [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]], Chairman of the President's Panel of Youth, urged changes in the high school curriculum to address the problem of senioritis. These concerns gave rise to the implementation of a "Senior Semester" in many high schools throughout the country, which allowed seniors to spend time outside of the school or attend seminars in their specific interests. In 1974, for example, [[McKeesport Area High School]] in [[Pennsylvania]] received a grant from the [[Richard King Mellon Foundation]] to establish a "Senior Semester" Program.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The ''Evaluation Report for Senior Semester Program 1974-75 McKeesport Area Senior High School, McKeesport, Pennsylvania'' was produced by the Office of Measurement and Evaluation, University of Pittsburgh, July 1975.  The ''Director's Report for Senior Semester Program 1974-75'' by Dr. Lester F. Jipp can be found at ERIC ED 157 165.

The [[College Board]], the [[National Youth Leadership Council]], and other youth-serving organizations suggest that there are many ways schools can help young people make the most of their senior year instead of succumbing to the temptation to take it easy once graduation is assured. Giving young people opportunities to make their academic work more meaningful through [[service-learning]], or other forms of [[experiential education]], can increase students' academic aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nylc.org/inaction_init_downloads.cfm?oid=3698 Martin et al. "The Impact of Service-Learning on the Transitions to Adulthood", ''Growing to Greatness 2006''] St. Paul: NYLC, page 19.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218185622/http://www.nylc.org/inaction_init_downloads.cfm?oid=3698 |date=December 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==

In some more serious cases where students allow their grades to drop quite significantly, especially failing, [[university|universities]] may rescind offers of [[University and college admissions|admission]]. Those who experience senioritis are often shocked when colleges and universities send them a letter the summer before their fall semester starts telling them that they can no longer attend the college due to failure in the academic rigor that they promised in the interview or application process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Tanya|last= Schevitz|title= Colleges crack down on taking freshmen with 'senioritis'|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/10/BAGL9LLT7J1.DTL&amp;hw=senioritis&amp;sn=031&amp;sc=511 |work= The San Francisco Chronicle|date= October 10, 2006|accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it is widely known that most colleges do not rescind, and even the most elite schools only revoke a very small number of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Jay|last= Mathews|title= In Praise of Senioritis|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/03/AR2008020302355.html |work= The Washington Post|date= February 4, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, senioritis in high school may still cause the incoming college freshmen not to be as adequately prepared for the rigor of college level studies, and may decrease their ability to gain entrance scholarships. Because [[Advanced Placement]], [[International Baccalaureate]], and other advanced classes generally do not have their final exams until early May, they provide a challenge to seniors who are battling with senioritis issues, since most college and university admissions are decided in March and April and students in advanced classes have to overcome the pull of senioritis during the time gap between those two events. In addition, some advanced classes have tests, projects, and other major things relevant to the curriculum spread throughout the second semester; thereby ensuring that students remain busy with a constant stream of deadlines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18024">'''Social justice educational leadership''' emphasizes the belief that all students can and will reach proficiency, without exceptions or excuses, and that schools ought to be organized to advance the [[educational equity|equitable]] learning of all students. Rather than focusing on one group of students who traditionally struggle, or who traditionally succeed, social justice leaders address the learning needs of all students. Social justice educational leadership specifically addresses how differences in race, income, language, ability, gender, and sexual orientation influence the design and effectiveness of learning environments. Social justice leadership draws from [[inclusive education]] practices from disability education, but extends the concepts further to support students from diverse groups with a wide range of needs. Through restructuring staff allocation and assessing student progress through disaggregated data, school leaders strive to create schools with equal access and equitable support for all students.

==Goals==
Social justice [[educational leadership|educational leaders]] recognize the role race, ethnicity, family income, ability, gender, and sexual orientation play in predicting student success in school. They commit to creating schools that address societal inequalities by striving to help all students reach academic proficiency. As described by Scheurich and Skrla, "In striving for both equity and excellence... we are aiming for schools in which there are no persistent patterns of differences in academic success or treatment among students grouped by race, ethnicity, culture, neighborhood, income of parents, or home language. In other words, we are aiming to foster schools that literally serve each and every student really well." (pg. 2).&lt;ref name="Scheurich &amp; Skrla"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glickman|first1=James Joseph Scheurich, Linda Skrla ; foreword by Carl D.|title=Leadership for equity and excellence creating high-achievement classrooms, schools, and districts|date=2003|publisher=Corwin Press|location=Thousand Oaks (Calif.)|isbn=978-0761945864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to assess whether these patterns of difference exist, social justice leaders use data tools, such as equity audits, to uncover structures that create differences in student learning outcomes.&lt;ref name="Johnson &amp; Avelar La Salle" /&gt; Equity audits use data such as standardized test scores, [[school discipline|discipline]] rates, family involvement in schools, advanced course participation, [[special education]] labeling, at-risk identification, and [[Response to Intervention|intervention]] placement to create profiles of achievement for different student groups in the school. Equity audits reveal [[achievement gap]] trends in these areas, in which traditionally [[marginalized]] students frequently perform at lower levels than their more privileged peers.&lt;ref name="Frattura &amp; Capper" /&gt; Many schools find demographically similar groups of students struggling in academics, language, discipline, graduation rates, and other markers of student success. Once these patterns are identified, social justice leaders equip staff and students with the skills necessary to address discrepancies in student learning needs.&lt;ref name="Capper &amp; Frattura"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frattura|first1=Colleen A. Capper, Elise M.|title=Meeting the needs of students of all abilities : how leaders go beyond inclusion|date=2009|publisher=Corwin Press|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=978-1412966955|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student services==

Social justice leadership builds on concepts of [[inclusive education]], in which services are brought to students in the general classroom environment, rather than pulling students out to a resource room. However, social justice leadership diverges somewhat from inclusive education in that full inclusion at all times is not required.&lt;ref name="Capper &amp; Frattura" /&gt; Social justice leaders focus on providing services in classrooms and other flexible spaces that can be accessed by all students, rather than removing students to receive special support in separate classrooms.&lt;ref name=Theoharis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Theoharis|first1=George|title=The school leaders our children deserve : seven keys to equity, social justice, and school reform|date=2009|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0807749517}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social justice leadership also emphasizes assigning students to classrooms and groups using proportional representation. This means that the proportion of students in any classroom or group should match the natural proportion of students from all demographic groups in the school.&lt;ref name="Johnson &amp; Avelar La Salle"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salle|first1=Ruth S. Johnson, Robin Avelar La|title=Data strategies to uncover and eliminate hidden inequities : the wallpaper effect|date=2010|publisher=Corwin|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=978-1412914932}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if 15% of the student body is [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]], then 15% of every classroom should be Latino, only 15% of students who qualify for special education should be Latino and only 15% of students receiving discipline should be Latino.

This method of bringing services to students in general education environments with proportional representation also differs from pull-out models like [[response to intervention]] (RtI). Many pull-out models identify students struggling in the classroom and assign them to interventions led by educator specialists outside the general education classroom, rather than by their classroom teachers. For students with more significant needs, pull-out interventions may be from several staff, such as from the Title I teacher, reading interventionist, speech therapist, and social worker, introducing multiple adults and environments to students who would most benefit from consistency. This practice locates the responsibility for educating students with additional needs with the interventionist, rather than the classroom teacher, reducing their efficacy.&lt;ref name="Capper &amp; Frattura" /&gt;

== Behavior Management ==
Many school behavior management efforts criminalize small infractions, and maintain a focus on retribution rather than restoration.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Heather S.|date=2002|title=Restorative justice in elementary schools|url=|journal=University of Lethbridge|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, combined with institutional and individual bias, results in a significant overrepresentation of students of color in suspension and expulsion rates.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=González|first=Thalia|date=2012|title=Keeping kids in schools: Restorative justice, punitive discipline, and the school to prison pipeline.|url=|journal=JL &amp; Educ|volume=41|pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of social justice in schools purport that exclusionary discipline practices such as suspension and expulsion actively remove students from their school communities and exacerbate feelings of isolation and resentment.

Zero tolerance policies, popularized in the 1990s, have been shown to be ineffective on multiple measures, leaving school leaders looking for alternative strategies to promote safe and orderly learning environments.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; School leaders focused on social justice are additionally compelled to find strategies that disrupt persisting inequities. This is where restorative justice practices, culturally and linguistically responsive practices (CLRP) and Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) come into play as approaches aiming to address both institutional inequities and the need for safe learning environments.

=== CLR-PBIS ===
PBIS comes with a variety of acronyms. Some schools cut out the “intervention” part, going with the proactive-only PBS system. PBIS is more akin to the three-tiered Response to Intervention system. Others add in the necessity of schoolwide (SW) implementation, dubbing the program SWPBIS.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Closing the school discipline gap: Equitable remedies for excessive exclusion|last=Losen|first=Daniel J.|publisher=Teachers College Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8077-5613-3|location=New York, NY|pages=151–165; 207–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever variation is used (here, PBIS), the primary practices included in the system are listed below. PBIS has shown promise in reducing exclusionary discipline practices overall, but has not shown, on its own, to be effective at reducing the racial disparities in student discipline, and in some cases has even been shown to exacerbate the discrepancies by further reducing discipline referrals for White students, but not for students of color.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; These criticisms have led to a call for examination of PBIS, and the integration of CLRP with PBIS in order to address systemic inequities in school discipline.

CLRP has its roots in the work of Gloria Ladson-Billings surrounding culturally relevant pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ladson-Billings|first=Gloria|date=1995|title=Toward a theory of culturally relevant pedagogy|url=|journal=American Educational Research Journal|volume=32 |issue=3|pages=465–491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting on this initial thinking, Ladson-Billings more recently stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;By focusing on student learning and academic achievement versus classroom and behavior management, cultural competence versus cultural assimilation or eradication, and sociopolitical consciousness rather than school-based tasks that have no beyond-school application, I was able to see students take both responsibility for and deep interest in their education. This is the secret behind culturally relevant pedagogy: the ability to link principles of learning with deep understanding of (and appreciation for) culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ladson-Billings|first=Gloria|date=2014|title=Culturally responsive pedagogy 2.0: aka the remix|url=|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=84 |issue=1|pages=74–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other scholars have echoed and built upon this work, giving linguistic relevance footing in the literature, proposing specific practices that may help teachers improve pedagogical relevance, and considering how to best integrate PBIS and CLRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vincent|first=Claudia|last2=Randall|first2=Carla|last3=Cartledge|first3=Gwendolyn|last4=Tobin|first4=Tary|last5=Swain-Bradway|first5=Jessica|date=2011|title=Toward a conceptual integration of cultural responsiveness and schoolwide positive behavior support|url=|journal=Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions|volume=13 |issue=4|pages=219–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culturally and linguistically responsive teaching and learning: Classroom practices for student success|last=Hollie|first=Sharroky|publisher=Shell Educational Publishing, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4258-0686-6|location=Huntington Beach, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Key Features of PBIS ====
* Clearly defining behavioral expectations valued by the school community.
* Proactively teaching what those expected behaviors look like in various school settings at least once a year.
* Frequently rewarding students who comply with behavioral expectations.
* Administering a clearly defined continuum of consequences for behavioral violations.
* Continuously collecting and analyzing data to assess students’ responsiveness to the behavioral support provided.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Restorative Justice ===
Thalia González describes restorative justice in schools as “an approach to discipline that engages all parties in a balanced practice that brings together all people impacted by an issue or behavior.”&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Heather Alexander details the roots of these practices, stating, “The principles of restorative justice are consistent with many indigenous traditions, including Canadian First Nations people and the Maori in New Zealand.”&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; She also links restorative justice to “entangled roots in native, religious, and legal communities.”&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Alexander and González have studied how the underpinnings of various cultural, religious, and judicial practices have made their way into the philosophy and practice of restorative justice.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Multiple scholars advocate for restorative practices as an alternative to exclusionary approaches to discipline, both in schools and in the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karp|first=David R.|last2=Breslin|first2=Beau|date=2001|title=Restorative justice in school communities|url=|journal=Youth &amp; Society|volume=33 |issue=2|pages=249–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Many different practices (including, but not limited to: circles, mediation, conferencing, and youth courts) are labeled as restorative justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mapping Leadership: The tasks that matter for improving teaching and learning in schools.|last=Halverson|first=Richard|publisher=Jossey Bass|year=2017|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=98–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trevor Fronius, et. al describe restorative justice as “a broad term that encompasses a growing social movement to institutionalize peaceful and non-punitive approaches for addressing harm, responding to violations of legal and human rights, and problem solving.”&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fronius|first=Trevor|last2=Persson|first2=Hannah|last3=Guckenburg|first3=Sarah|last4=Hurley|first4=Nancy|last5=Petrosino|first5=Anthony|date=2016|title=Restorative justice in US schools: A research review|url=http://www.antoniocasella.eu/restorative/Fronius_feb16.pdf|journal=WestEd Justice and Prevention Research Center|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition speaks to restorative justice as more of a collection of practices rooted in a common philosophy than a specific “program.” Fronius, et. al go on to say that “the emphasis on the harm done rather than the act is a widely recognized principle across the RJ literature.”&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; and they speak to Dorothy Vaandering’s work surrounding “how to use shame as a path toward reintegration rather than stigmatization."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vaandering|first=Dorothy|date=2010|title=The significance of critical theory for restorative justice in education|url=|journal=Review of Education, Pedagogy &amp; Cultural Studies|volume=32 |issue=2|pages=145–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
'''Key Principles of Restorative Justice''' 
* Repairing Harm, 
* Involving Stakeholders 
* Transforming Community Relationships&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==Staff allocation==

Both inclusive and pull-out models seek to reduce the student to teacher ratio, but inclusive models do so by bringing services and staff expertise to students. Thus, social justice leaders need to strategically plan how to effectively allocate their limited staff resources.&lt;ref name="Frattura &amp; Capper"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Capper|first1=Elise M. Frattura, Colleen A.|title=Leading for social justice : transforming schools for all learners|date=2007|publisher=Corwin Press|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|isbn=978-0761931782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than having several specialists who work with students with specific needs, leaders structure collaborative teams of classroom teachers, cross-categorical special education teachers, and bilingual resource teachers to support classrooms of students.&lt;ref name=Theoharis /&gt;

==Critiques==

Social justice educational leadership has been critiqued in several ways. Some feel social justice leadership reinforces the categorization of students, even though the approach emphasizes reducing unnecessary student labeling.&lt;ref name="Scheurich &amp; Skrla" /&gt; The data equity audits 
focus mostly on identifying inequitable learning outcomes,&lt;ref name="Johnson &amp; Avelar La Salle" /&gt; but few solutions and strategies are suggested for improving these outcomes. By identifying the classroom teacher as responsible for ensuring all students reach proficiency, many teachers feel unsupported in the work and struggle to adequately [[differentiated instruction|differentiate]] lessons for their students. Finally, social justice educational leadership emphasizes proficiency as measured by [[standardized test]] scores,&lt;ref name="Frattura &amp; Capper" /&gt; which limits the space for innovation and teaching that builds higher-order thinking, which is difficult to measure on standardized tests.

== Employment characteristics ==
[[File:Australian Opals in the AIS Strength and Conditioning Gym during day three of the Opals camp.jpg|thumb|A strength and conditioning gym]]
Strength and conditioning coaches may work with sports teams, as well as individuals. Strength and conditioning coaches are often employed by [[higher education]] institutions and professional athletic teams.

Strength and conditioning coaches have the option to specialize in a particular sports team, type of performance, training type, training philosophy, or work in the collegiate level, where they are assigned a sport. The general description and duty of a strength and conditioning coach is to develop an exercise prescription plan that modulates aerobic, resistance, and/or flexibility training to suit the metabolic and physical demands of the sport in question.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  With [[aerobic exercise]] prescription, strength and conditioning coaches determine the type, duration, and frequency of each exercise.  For [[resistance exercise]] prescription, the type of exercise, total session volume, rest period, frequency, and intensity are determined.&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, WJ. Exercise Physiology: Integrating Theory and Application.  Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. Chapter 12.  Ahead of print, March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be involved in prescription of [[stretching]] routines or other approaches.  [[Nutrition]] and medical consultation are not within their scope of practice and training qualifications.

== Qualification standards ==

=== United States ===
In the US, The National Strength and Conditioning Association offers a Certified Strength and Conditioning Coach qualification that is required for positions in the field.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} In addition to the C.S.C.S. certification, it is encouraged to attain a bachelor's degree in majors that are related to exercise science due to the competitiveness of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsca.com/education/articles/career-series/becoming-a-strength-and-conditioning-coach/|title=Becoming a Strength and Conditioning Coach|access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Collegiate Strength &amp; Conditioning Coaches association also offers certification exclusive to the collegiate and professional-level strength and conditioning coach. This certification is known as Strength &amp; Conditioning Coach Certified (SCCC) and requires a bachelor's degree and a 640-hour internship in addition to passing the certification exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cscca.org/about|title=About Us|author=|date=|website=CSCCA.org|access-date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
Strength and conditioning in the UK is generally overseen by the UK Strength and Conditioning Association (UKSCA) and the Register of Exercise Professionals (REPS). Both organisations provide regulations and standards for employers and professionals. A UKSCA membership and Bachelor's degree in sport and exercise science are generally accepted by many professional sports clubs as prerequisites for strength and conditioning positions.

== Criticism ==
Criticism has followed the increased use of strength and conditioning coaches in a variety of sports due to the shift in importance to the size and speed of the players. In [[rugby union]], a game with heavy physical contact and minimal{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2017}} protection, players are being described as being "too big", creating collisions that are increasing the risk of short and long term injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34290980|title=How big will rugby players get?|last=Rhodes|first=David|date=19 September 2015|work=BBC News|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, it has been proposed that the increased weight and speed of players and subsequent rise of collision [[force]] leads to more frequent and severe [[Concussion|concussion injuries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/premiership/11407436/Rugby-concussions-soar-by-59-per-cent-says-report.html|title=Rugby concussions soar by 59 per cent, says report|first=Daniel|last=Schofield|date=11 February 2015|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/27655550|title=Rugby's concussion issue under the spotlight|first=Tom|last=English|date=1 June 2014|work=BBC Sport|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is as yet no research to suggest an increased use of strength and conditioning leading to an increased risk of injury.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The '''teaching philosophy''' of a candidate for an academic position is a written statement of the candidate's general personal views on [[teaching]].  [[College]]s and [[university|universities]] that advertise a position whose duties require teaching often require the applicant to submit a teaching philosophy with the application.  The philosophy statement often attempts to express what methods of teaching the candidate practices.

'''Thinking Maps''' are a set of techniques used in [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]] ("K-12"). There are eight diagram types that are intended to correspond with eight different fundamental thinking processes. They are supposed to provide a common visual language to information structure, often employed when students take notes.

Thinking Maps are visual tools for learning, and include eight visual patterns each linked to a specific cognitive process. Teachers may apply Thinking Maps in all content areas and all grade levels. The eight map types are:
; [[Radial tree|Circle Map]]: used for defining in context
; [[Concept map|Bubble Map]]: used for describing with adjectives
; [[Flowchart|Flow Map]]: used for sequencing and ordering events
; [[Brace map|Brace Map]]: used for identifying part/whole relationships
; [[Tree structure|Tree Map]]: used for classifying or grouping
; [[Double bubble map|Double Bubble Map]]: used for comparing and contrasting
; [[Multi-flow map]]: used for analyzing causes and effects
; [[Bridge map]]: used for illustrating  analogies

By linking each thinking skill to a unique and dynamic visual representation, the language of Thinking Maps becomes a tool set for supporting effective instructional practice and improving student performance. Teachers and students, therefore, independently apply thinking skills for their own learning while also having a common visual language for cooperative learning. By having a rich language of visual maps based on thinking processes, learners are no longer confused by poorly organized brainstorming webs or an endless array of static graphic organizers. They are enabled to move from concrete to abstract concepts, think with depth, and directly apply their thinking to complex tasks.

== General information ==
Thinking Maps are a specific set of graphic Thinking organizers used in K-12 classroom settings, or "visual teaching tools that foster and encourage life-long learning," as well as tol that provide students with the skills to be "successful thinkers, problem solvers, [and] decision makers" (Thinking Maps Inc., Pamphlet).  Maps were founded as,"a good skill for the mind" quoted by Dr. Mark Davidson, scholarly teacher of accelerated classes. What he says is that the "one common instructional thread that binds together all teachers, from prekindergarten through postgraduate, is that they all teach the same thought processes" (Thinking Maps Inc., Pamphlet). For example, the thought process of classification might be taught in kindergarten by sorting or grouping, whereas classification in the upper grades might be taught as categorizing a main idea and details. Although we refer to classifying items, concepts, or ideas in different ways with different aged students, the thought process in its entirety is considered classification.

With this belief that all teachers, no matter the grade level, teach the same thought processes, these common set of visual organizers was created by Dr. David Hyerle as a type of language to be used across grade levels, content areas, and disciplines so that "students could learn more effectively and more efficiently." Thinking Maps were also created so that these graphic organizers would "become a familiar part of students' education that it would remain an effective learning tool throughout their academic careers – and beyond" (Thinking Maps Inc., Pamphlet).

== History of Thinking Maps ==
In 1970, Innovative Sciences, Inc. (ISI) was founded by Charles Adams in order to "improve the thinking and problem-solving abilities of the work force" (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). Over the next eighteen years, ISI created a variety of developmentally appropriate materials, or "content-based thinking skills," for schools based on research from student reading performance and different educational teaching models (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). In 1988, David Hyerle wrote Expand Your Thinking, which was the first resource where his Thinking Maps were published, and at that point, he began training educators to use his Thinking Maps (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). In 1994, test results indicated that "Thinking Maps significantly affect[ed] standardized and qualitative measures of student performance" (Thinking Maps Inc., 2011). After more success and schools nationwide piloting Thinking Maps, ISI changed its name to Thinking Maps, Inc. in 2004 to "better promote its mission" (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). Today, thousands of teachers across America have been trained in using and implementing Thinking Maps in their classrooms. Thinking Maps are also being promoted in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011).

== Educational theory and Thinking Maps ==
In his text ''Curriculum as Conversation'', Applebee (1996) states that a "curriculum provides domains for conversation, and the conversations that take place within those domains are the primary means for teaching and learning. Through such conversations, students will be helped to enter into culturally significant traditions of knowledge-in-action" (p.&amp;nbsp;37). When looking at Applebee's (1996) ideas of "knowledge-in-action" and social learning, a connection with Hyerle's Thinking Maps is apparent. When students produce Thinking Maps, conversations among the students and their Maps occur, which is where the real learning takes place. Students are able to "illustrate" and explain their thought processes through Maps, while other students listen, ask questions, agree and/or disagree. Social learning starts when the teacher realizes that his or her classroom needs to be based on a learning community of able and willing learners, where each student has a vital role in the everyday learning by participating and adding to the conversation, which is where Thinking Maps can aid, scaffold, and support.

Moffitt's theory of integrated language arts is widely seen through the use of Thinking Maps. Thinking Maps are products of reading, writing, listening, and speaking, and the aspects of listening and speaking are parts of the thinking processes that students use to explain themselves. Although the same eight Thinking Maps are used across grade levels, the Maps are developmentally appropriate for each age and coincide with Moffitt's developmental principle. In second grade, a teacher may use the Flow Map to sequence the stages and life cycle of a butterfly, while a high school chemistry teacher may use the same map to sequence the changing of an element from the periodic table. One teacher uses the map to illustrate a concrete idea, while another teacher uses the map to illustrate an abstract idea.

When looking at the overarching theories of education, Thinking Maps fall into the Postmodern Constructivism theory. In the Postmodern Constructivism theory of education, learners often use their prior experiences, and when using one of the eight fundamental thought processes and Thinking Maps, learners often do use their background knowledge to continue constructing new meaning and knowledge (Sherman, 2000). Students are also encouraged to create and form their own opinions after self-reflection and creating Thinking Maps, as well as to engage and discuss their individual maps with their peers, even if their ideas differ. Another aspect of the Postmodern Constructivism theory of education that is seen by the use of Thinking Maps is that they promote critical thinking and problem solving (Sherman, 2011).

== Research and rationales for using Thinking Maps ==
In his book ''Student Successes With Thinking Maps'', Dr. David Hyerle (2011) provides a plethora of reasons and research as to why Thinking Maps are beneficial tools for the classroom. Hyerle states that using the eight Thinking Maps promote metacognition and continuous cognitive development for students across their academic careers, as well as adds an artistic and kinesthetic component for students who learn effectively with that specific multiple intelligence (Hyerle, 2011). Lesson objectives can be covered in less time and with greater retention when using Thinking Maps, teachers can determine their students' background knowledge before teaching a unit or area of study, and student performance can be tracked over time in an accurate manner, too (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). Through his research, Dr. Hyerle (2011) also found that Thinking Maps help close the achievement gap, as they "can help students [below grade level] self-regulate their own learning and be more successful in the game of school because Thinking Maps serve as a device for mediating thinking, listening, speaking, reading, writing, problem solving, and acquiring new knowledge." The thought processes that educators hope to instill in students are represented similarly throughout the curricula, and integrated thinking and learning across disciplines is promoted (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). As fidelity and accountability are also huge aspects in the education field, the idea that Thinking Maps as a school-wide initiative for use of a common instructional and learning tool and as a shared language among teachers and students is one of Hyerle's (2011) main ideas for the use of this support curriculum.

In Villalon and Calvo's (2011) ''Concept Maps as Cognitive Visualizations of Writing Assignments'', concept maps are discussed as a means of scaffolding university-aged students' ideas in writing, as well as their metacognitive skills. In their study, Villalon and Calvo evaluated a new Concept Map Mining tool, which was used in an "e-learning environment" that automatically generated maps using students' written work (p.&amp;nbsp;16). The Concept Map Mining tool was used to look at a collection of annotated essays written by undergraduate college students (p.&amp;nbsp;16). Villalon and Calvo (2011) found that "Cognitive Visualizations [such as Concept Map Mining] provide quality feedback because they make the author's thinking visible, making explicit the mental model learners are using…Within the writing process, providing automatic feedback in the form of [Cognitive Visualizations] allows learners to reflect on their own work and their own mental models that guided its construction, facilitating the development of metacognitive skills" (p.&amp;nbsp;23). Villalon and Calvo's (2011) study illustrates that the use of concept maps are beneficial to even the oldest of learners in a college setting, and although precise Thinking Maps were not used in this study, the idea of a graphic organizer to "map out" thought processes is universal.

In ''Thinking with Maps'', Elisabeth Camp (2007) investigates how individuals think and how thinking is related to language. Camp (2007) states that "…thinking in maps is substantively different from thinking in sentences" (p.&amp;nbsp;155). This concept supports Hyerle's (2011) idea that Thinking Maps possess an artistic and kinesthetic component, where students can feel free to express their ideas in a "drawing," or map, instead of using complete written sentences. Thinking Maps support learners who thrive with the artistic and kinesthetic multiple intelligences of learning.

David Hyerle (1996) reports numerous success stories with the use of Thinking Maps in his article ''Thinking Maps: Seeing is Understanding''. After teachers participated in a year-long professional development in the use and purpose of Thinking Maps, as well as integrated the maps into their curriculum during this training year, the "teachers agreed that the maps had successfully helped students develop their thinking processes and their ability to organize ideas, improved the quality and quantity of their writing, and also motivated them to learn. Further, the maps benefited the teachers by helping them organize content and assess student learning" (p.&amp;nbsp;88). Hyerle (1996) also reported that the educators who gave Thinking Maps the highest ratings at the end of the year were those who taught English Learners (Spanish-speaking students), as Thinking Maps "enabled their students to transfer patterns of thinking from Spanish into English, to focus on learning, and to build vocabulary" (p.&amp;nbsp;88).

In ''Designs of Concept Maps and Their Impacts on Readers' Performance in Memory and Reasoning While Reading'', Jeng-Yi Tzeng (2010) investigates the effect of Thinking Maps on students' performance of "cognitive operations." In the study, Tzeng had students read two opposing history articles that "argued from different perspectives about a historical incident" that occurred in Taiwan (p.&amp;nbsp;133). The results of the study indicated that the focus and design of the concept maps may "influence the formation of mental representations, and that this may be facilitative or constraining in regard to the readers' memory formation and reasoning about the reading materials." With regards to the maps' designs, Tzeng uncovered that this can impact a student's memory and/or understanding of a text, which poses as a negative aspect of the maps themselves.

In conclusion, by linking each thinking skill to a unique and dynamic visual representation, the language of Thinking Maps becomes a tool set for supporting effective instructional practice and improving student performance. Teachers and students, therefore, independently apply thinking skills for their own learning while also having a common visual language for cooperative learning. By having a rich language of visual maps based on thinking processes, learners are no longer confused by poorly organized brainstorming webs or an endless array of static graphic organizers. They are enabled to move from concrete to abstract concepts, think with depth, and directly apply their thinking to complex tasks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14604">Traditional education, also known as '''back-to-basics''', '''conventional education''' or '''customary education''', refers to long-established customs that society traditionally used in schools.  Some forms of [[education reform]] promote the adoption of progressive education practices, a more holistic approach which focuses on individual students' needs and self-control. In the eyes of reformers, traditional teacher-centered methods focused on rote learning and memorization must be abandoned in favor of student-centered and task-based approaches to learning.  However, many parents and conservative citizens are concerned with the maintenance of objective educational standards based on testing, which favors a more traditional approach.

Depending on the context, the opposite of ''traditional education'' may be [[progressive education]], modern education (the education approaches based on [[developmental psychology]]), or [[alternative education]].&lt;ref name=3r /&gt;

==Definition==
The definition of ''traditional education'' varies greatly with geography and by historical period.

The chief business of traditional education is to transmit to a next generation those skills, facts, and standards of moral and social conduct that adults consider to be necessary for the next generation's material and social success.&lt;ref name=Dewey&gt;{{cite book
|isbn=978-0-912099-35-4
|title=Experience and education
|author=Dewey, John
|authorlink=John Dewey
|publisher=[[Kappa Delta Pi]]
|year=1938
|pages=1–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As beneficiaries of this scheme, which educational progressivist [[John Dewey]] described as being "imposed from above and from outside", the students are expected to docilely and obediently receive and believe these fixed answers.  Teachers are the instruments by which this knowledge is communicated and these standards of behavior are enforced.&lt;ref name=Dewey /&gt;

Historically, the primary educational technique of traditional education was simple oral [[recitation]]:&lt;ref name=3r&gt;{{cite book |title= The Three R's Plus: What Today's Schools are Trying to Do and Why |author=Beck, Robert H. |isbn=978-0-8166-6017-9 |publisher=U of Minnesota Press |year=2009 |pages =3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a typical approach, students sat quietly at their places and listened to one student after another recite his or her lesson, until each had been called upon.  The teacher's primary activity was assigning and listening to these recitations; students studied and memorized the assignments at home.  A test or [[oral examination]] might be given at the end of a unit, and the process, which was called "assignment-study-recitation-test", was repeated.  In addition to its overemphasis on verbal answers, reliance on [[rote memorization]] (memorization with no effort at understanding the meaning), and disconnected, unrelated assignments, it was also an extremely inefficient use of students' and teachers' time.  This traditional approach also insisted that all students be taught the same materials at the same point; students that did not learn quickly enough failed, rather than being allowed to succeed at their natural speeds.  This approach, which had been imported from Europe, dominated American education until the end of the 19th century, when [[Education reform#Progressive reforms in Europe and the United States|the education reform movement]] imported progressive education techniques from Europe.&lt;ref name=3r /&gt;

Traditional education is associated with much stronger elements of coercion than seems acceptable now in most cultures.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008 |reason= This is a rather vague and broad generalization}}  It has sometimes included: the use of [[corporal punishment]] to maintain classroom discipline or punish errors; inculcating the dominant religion and language; separating students according to gender, race, and [[social class]] {{citation needed|date=August 2014 |reason= This is an unsupported and quite provocative claim}} , as well as teaching different subjects to girls and boys. In terms of curriculum there was and still is a high level of attention paid to time-honoured academic knowledge.

In the present it varies enormously from culture to culture, but still tends to be characterised by a much higher level of coercion than [[alternative education]]. Traditional schooling in Britain and its possessions and former colonies tends to follow the English Public School style of strictly enforced uniforms and a militaristic style of discipline. This can be contrasted with South African, US and Australian schools, which can have a much higher tolerance for spontaneous student-to-teacher communication.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008 |reason= Again, overly broad generalizations}}

A passing grade may or may not signify mastery:  a failing student may know the material but not complete homework assignments, and a passing student may turn in all homework but still not understand the material.
|| Many possible forms of communicating achievements:
* Teachers may be required to write personalized narrative evaluations about student achievement and abilities.
* Under [[Outcome-based education|standards-based education]], a government agency may require all students to pass a test; students who fail to perform adequately on the test may not be promoted.
|-
| Expectations || Students will graduate with different grades. Some students will fail due to poor performance based on a lack of understanding or incomplete assignments. || All students need to achieve a basic level of education, even if this means spending extra years in school.
|-
| Grade inflation/deflation || Achievement based on performance compared to a reasonably stable, probably informal standard which is highly similar to what previous students experienced. || The value of any given mark is often hard to standardize in alternative grading schemes.  Comparison of students in different classes may be difficult or impossible.

==Subject areas==

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Topic !! Traditional approach !! Alternate approaches
|-
| Mathematics || [[Traditional mathematics]]:
* Emphasis is on memorization of basic facts such as the [[multiplication table]] and mastering step-by-step arithmetic [[algorithms]] by studying examples and much practice.
* One correct answer is sought, using one "standard" method.
* Mathematics after elementary grades is tracked with different students covering different levels of material.
* Mathematics is taught as its own discipline without emphasis on social, political or global issues. There may be some emphasis on practical applications in science and technology.
||
* Curriculum de-emphasizes procedural knowledge drills in favor of technology (calculators, computers) and an emphasis on conceptual understanding.
* Lessons may include more exploratory material supportive of conceptual understanding, rather than direct presentation of facts and methods.
* Emphasis may be on practical applications and greater issues such as the environment, gender and racial diversity, and social justice.
* Mathematics lessons may include writing, drawing, games, and instruction with manipulatives rather than filling out worksheets.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., see [[Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space|Investigations]] series&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lessons may include exploration of concepts allowing students to invent their own procedures before teaching standard algorithms.
* Grading may be based on demonstration of conceptual understanding rather than entirely on whether the final answer is correct.
* In some countries (e.g. the United States), there may be expectations of high achievement and mastering algebra for all students rather than tracking some students into business math and others into mathematics for math and science careers.
|-
| Science || Fact-based science:  Science class is an opportunity to transmit concrete knowledge and specific vocabulary from the teacher (or textbook) to the students.  Students focus on memorizing what they are told.  "Experiments" follow cookbook-style procedures to produce the expected results. || With [[Inquiry-based Science]] a student might be asked to devise an experiment to demonstrate that the earth orbits the sun.  The emphasis changes from memorizing information that was learned through a scientific method to actually using the scientific method of discovery.
|-
| Language learning || [[Phonics]]:  The focus is on explicit training in sound to letter correspondence rules and the mechanics of decoding individual words.  Students initially focus on phonics subskills and reading simplified [[decodable text]]s. When they have mastered a sufficient number of rules, they are allowed to read freely and extensively. (In many languages, such as French, Spanish and Greek, phonics is taught in the context of reading simple open syllables.) || With [[whole language]] the child is exposed to rich, relevant language that can heighten motivation to read. Learning to read is assumed to be as natural as learning to speak, so students are not formally taught sound to letter correspondences, but assumed to infer them on their own. (Note that this issue is limited to languages such as English and French with complex phonetics and spelling rules. Instruction in countries with languages such as Spanish and Greek, which have relatively simple phonetic spelling, still depends mainly on phonics.)

Virtual Portal for Impaired Groups Interaction (ViPi) is a project partially funded  by the [[Europe]]an Union (EU) under the [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]], subprogramme KA3 [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]. The project commenced on 1 January 2011 and has 36 months duration (until 31 December 2013). The main vision of the project is to provide alternative and creative solutions for the employment of People with Disabilities (PwD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=AEGIS-ACCESSIBLE Projects |date=10 May 2011 |title=Accessibility: An ongoing struggle in every domain of daily life |url=http://www.slideshare.net/aegisproject/accessibility-an-ongoing-struggle-in-every-domain-of-daily-life |format=Flash with text transcript |publisher=slideshare |accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by delivering a "one-stop-shop"&lt;ref&gt;Access For All: ViPi project announcement,  http://www.accessforall.eu/2011/01/vipi-%E2%80%93-virtual-portal-for-impaired-groups-interaction/&lt;/ref&gt; interactive portal and learning environment comprising: 1) a multilingual platform, 2) an embedded social community, 3) accessible content ([[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines|WCAG 2.0]]) for PwD and trainers, etc. The project will bring together key stakeholders and gatekeepers (VET, target groups, umbrella organizations) in order to address the lack of specific training support or material for PwD and their trainers by providing a set of applications and services that will be available via a complete educational framework, taking into account interaction possibilities offered by web 2.0 and localised, tested and assessed with different end-user communities (GR, BE, LT, UK and CY&lt;ref&gt;Cyprus Government Web Portal: People with Disabilities links &amp; projects,  http://www.cyprus.gov.cy/portal/portal.nsf/0/D5BDBCF58E61104BC2256FDB002899C5?OpenDocument&amp;a=1&amp;z={{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Video-based reflection''' is a [[reflective practice]] technique in which [[video recording]]s, rather than one's own [[memory]], is used as a basis for reflection and professional growth. Video-based reflection is used with moderations in various [[profession]]al fields, e.g. in the field of [[education]] and [[pedagogy]]. Several [[charrette|workshop]] formats can be described as based on video-based reflection, e.g. "Videobased Reflection on Team Interaction" ([http://circd.ku.dk/documents/Videobased_Reflection_on_Team_Interaction.pdf The ViRTI Method; Due &amp; Lange 2015]) within the conversation analytic school of [[research]], or the concept of [[Marte Meo]], a method of [[Educational counseling|educational counseling]].

==In the education field ==
Individual [[teacher]]s can practice video-based reflection, but it is more commonly done when teachers are a part of video clubs. Research about the effect that [[video]] club participation can have on teacher practice has been done by Katherine A. Linsenmeier, Miriam Gamoran Sherin, and Elizabeth van Es.

===Individual video-based reflection===
Research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosaen|first=Cheryl L.|author2=Lundeberg, Mary |author3=Cooper, Marjorie |author4=Fritzen, Anny |author5= Terpstra, Majorie |title=Noticing Noticing: How Does Investigation of Video Records Change How Teachers Reflect on Their Experiences|journal=Journal of Teacher Education|year=2008|volume=59|issue=4|pages=347–360|doi=10.1177/0022487108322128}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that teachers can benefit from video-based reflection, even when done apart from a group.  Individuals using this mode of reflection tend to write longer and have more specific reflections than when writing a reflection using memory alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosaen|first=Cheryl L.|author2=Lundeberg, Mary |author3=Cooper, Marjorie |author4=Fritzen, Anny |author5= Terpstra, Majorie |title=Noticing Noticing: How Does Investigation of Video Records Change How Teachers Reflect on Their Experiences|journal=Journal of Teacher Education|year=2008|volume=59|issue=4|pages=347–360|doi=10.1177/0022487108322128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This practice has also been shown to help pre-service and [[novice]] teachers focus their attention on their students' learning rather than on their own experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calandra|first=Brendan|author2=Brantley-Dias, Laurie |author3=Lee, John K. |author4= Fox, Dana L. |title=Using video editing to cultivate novice teachers' practice|journal=Journal of Research on Technology in Education|year=2009|volume=42|issue=1|pages=73–94|doi=10.1080/15391523.2009.10782542}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=David M.|author2=Hammer, David |author3=Coffey, Janet E. |title=Novice Teachers' Attention to Student Thinking|journal=Journal of Teacher Education|date=March–April 2009|volume=60|issue=2|pages=142–154|doi=10.1177/0022487108330245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Video clubs ===
Video clubs are formed by groups of teachers who want to investigate a specific aspect of their teaching practice.  These [[Club (organization)|clubs]] often meet on a monthly basis to view and discuss a video clip of a member's teaching.  Teachers participating in video clubs focused on student learning report feeling better able to notice and respond to [[student]] learning during instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linsenmeier|first=Katherine A.|author2=Sherin |title=Miriam Gamoran|journal=Teaching Children Mathematics|year=2009|volume=15|issue=7|pages=418–422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherin|first=Miriam Gamoran|title=Viewing teaching on videotape|journal=Educational Leadership|year=2000|volume=57|issue=8|pages=36–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Es|first=Elizabeth|title=Viewer Discussion Is Advised: Video Clubs Focus Teacher Discussion on Student Learning|journal=Journal of Staff Development|year=2010|volume=31|issue=1|pages=54–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reality check ESA384313.jpg|thumb|250px|Researchers with the [[European Space Agency]] in [[Darmstadt]], Germany, exploring virtual reality for controlling [[Rover (space exploration)|planetary rovers]] and [[satellites]] in orbit]]

'''Virtual reality''' ('''VR''') is an interactive [[Computer generated reality|computer-generated]] experience taking place within a simulated environment. It incorporates mainly auditory and visual feedback, but may also allow other types of [[Perception#Types|sensory feedback]] like [[Haptic perception|haptic]]. This immersive environment can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical. [[Augmented reality]] systems may also be considered a form of VR that layers virtual information over a live camera feed into a headset or through a [[smartphone]] or tablet device giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.

Current VR technology most commonly uses [[virtual reality headset]]s or multi-projected environments, sometimes in combination with physical environments or props, to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual or imaginary environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to "look around" the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a [[head-mounted display]] with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens.

VR systems that include transmission of vibrations and other sensations to the user through a [[game controller]] or other devices are known as [[haptic technology|haptic]] systems. This tactile information is generally known as [[force feedback]] in medical, [[video gaming]], and military training applications.

==Etymology and terminology==
[[File:Linux kernel and gaming input-output latency.svg|thumb|Paramount for the sensation of [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]] into virtual reality are a high [[frame rate]] (at least 95 fps), as well as a low [[latency (engineering)|latency]].]]

"[[Virtual (philosophy)|Virtual]]" has had the meaning of "being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact" since the mid-1400s.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=virtual|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "virtual" has been used in the computer sense of "not physically existing but made to appear by software" since 1959.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"/&gt; 
In 1938, the French avant-garde playwright  [[Antonin Artaud]] described the illusory nature of characters and objects in the [[theatre]] as [[:fr:Réalité virtuelle|"la réalité virtuelle"]] in a collection of essays, ''[[:fr:Le Théâtre et son double|Le Théâtre et son double]]''. The English translation of this book, published in 1958 as ''[[The Theater and its Double]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonin Artaud]], ''The Theatre and its Double'' Trans. Mary Caroline Richards. (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; is the earliest published use of the term "virtual reality". The term "[[artificial reality]]", coined by [[Myron W. Krueger|Myron Krueger]], has been in use since the 1970s. The term "virtual reality" was first used in a science fiction context in ''The Judas Mandala'', a 1982 novel by [[Damien Broderick]].

A "[[cyberspace]]" is a networked virtual reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cyberspace|title=the definition of cyberspace|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual reality shares some elements with "[[augmented reality]]" (or AR).&lt;ref&gt;Myron Krueger. Artificial Reality 2, Addison-Wesley Professional, 1991. {{ISBN|0-201-52260-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; AR is a type of virtual reality technology that blends what the user sees in their ''real'' surroundings with digital content generated by computer software. The additional software-generated images with the virtual scene typically enhance how the real surroundings look in some way. Some AR systems use a camera to capture the user's surroundings or some type of display screen which the user looks at (e.g., Microsoft's [[HoloLens]], [[Magic Leap]]).

==Technology==
The [[VRML|Virtual Reality Modelling Language]] (VRML), first introduced in 1994, was intended for the development of "virtual worlds" without dependency on headsets.&lt;ref name="W3 VRML archive"&gt;{{cite web|title=VRML Virtual Reality Modeling Language|url=https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/VRML/|website=www.w3.org|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Web3D]] consortium was subsequently founded in 1997 for the development of industry standards for web-based 3D graphics. The consortium subsequently developed [[X3D]] from the VRML framework as an archival, [[open source software|open-source]] standard for web-based distribution of VR content.&lt;ref name="W3D Brutzman 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brutzman|first1=Don|title=X3D Graphics and VR|url=http://www.web3d.org/sites/default/files/presentations/X3D%20Graphics%20and%20VR/X3dGraphicsVirtualRealityW3cWorkshop2016October18.pdf|website=web3D.org|publisher=Web3D Consortium|accessdate=20 March 2017|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All modern VR displays are based on technology developed for [[smartphone]]s including: [[gyroscope]]s and motion sensors for tracking head, hand, and body positions; small HD screens for [[stereoscopic]] displays; and small, lightweight and fast [[processors]]. These components led to relative affordability for independent VR developers, and lead to the 2012 Oculus Rift Kickstarter offering the first independently developed VR headset.&lt;ref name="Wired Magic Leap Apr2016" /&gt;

Independent production of VR images and video has increased by the development of [[omnidirectional camera]]s, also known as 360-degree cameras or [[VR photography|VR cameras]], that have the ability to record in all directions, although at low-resolutions or in highly compressed formats for online streaming of [[360 video]].&lt;ref name="CNET May 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orellana|first1=Vanessa Hand|title=10 things I wish I knew before shooting 360 video|url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/360-cameras-comparison-video-things-to-know-before-you-buy/|website=CNET|accessdate=20 March 2017|language=en|date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[photogrammetry]] is increasingly used to combine several high-resolution photographs for the creation of detailed 3D objects and environments in VR applications.&lt;ref name="RE7 80.lv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resident Evil 7: The Use of Photogrammetry for VR|url=https://80.lv/articles/resident-evil-7-the-use-of-photogrammetry-for-vr/|website=80.lv|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="otherboard March 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Leif|title=Forget 360 Videos, Photogrammetric Virtual Reality Is Where It's At - Motherboard|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/forget-360-videos-photogrammetric-virtual-reality-is-where-its-at|website=Motherboard|accessdate=20 March 2017|language=en-us|date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:View-Master with Reel.jpg|thumb|[[View-Master]], a stereoscopic visual simulator, was introduced in 1939]]

The exact origins of virtual reality are disputed, partly because of how difficult it has been to formulate a definition for the concept of an alternative existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theverge.com/a/virtual-reality/intro | title=Seeing is Believing: The State of Virtual Reality | author=Matthew Schnipper | publisher= The Verge | access-date= 7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of perspective in Renaissance Europe created convincing depictions of spaces that did not exist, in what has been referred to as the "multiplying of artificial worlds".&lt;ref name="Baltrušaitis 1977"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baltrušaitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York |isbn=9780810906624 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other elements of virtual reality appeared as early as the 1860s. Antonin Artaud took the view that illusion was not distinct from reality, advocating that spectators at a play should suspend disbelief and regard the drama on stage as reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.vrs.org.uk/virtual-reality/beginning.html | title=How did virtual reality begin? | publisher=Virtual Reality Society | access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first references to the more modern concept of virtual reality came from [[science fiction]].

=== 1950–1970 ===
[[File:Sensorama-morton-heilig-virtual-reality-headset.jpg|upright|thumb|left|The [[Sensorama]] was designed in the 1960s]]

[[Morton Heilig]] wrote in the 1950s of an "Experience Theatre" that could encompass all the senses in an effective manner, thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity. He built a prototype of his vision dubbed the [[Sensorama]] in 1962, along with five short films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses (sight, sound, smell, and touch). Predating digital computing, the Sensorama was a [[Machine|mechanical device]]. Heilig also developed what he referred to as the "Telesphere Mask" (patented in 1960). The patent application described the device as "a telescopic television apparatus for individual use...The spectator is given a complete sensation of reality, i.e. moving three dimensional images which may be in colour, with 100% peripheral vision, binaural sound, scents and air breezes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/forgotten-genius-the-man-who-made-a-working-vr-machine-in-1957-1318253/2 | title=Forgotten genius: the man who made a working VR machine in 1957 | author=Holly Brockwell | date=3 April 2016 | publisher=Tech Radar | access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, [[Douglas Engelbart]] used computer screens both as input and output devices. In 1968, [[Ivan Sutherland]], with the help of his student [[Bob Sproull]], created what was widely considered to be the first [[head-mounted display]] (HMD) system for use in immersive simulation applications. It was primitive both in terms of [[user interface]] and [[realism (arts)|realism]], and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling. The graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple [[wire-frame model]] rooms. The formidable appearance of the device inspired its name, [[The Sword of Damocles (virtual reality)|The Sword of Damocles]].

=== 1970–1990 ===
The VR industry mainly provided VR devices for medical, flight simulation, automobile industry design, and military training purposes from 1970 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|title=National Center for Supercomputing Applications: History|publisher=The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821054144/http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|archivedate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Em became the first artist to produce navigable virtual worlds at [[NASA]]'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), where he was Artist in Residence from 1977 to 1984.&lt;ref name="Creative Computing March 1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Ted|title=Report on Siggraph '81|journal=Creative Computing|date=March 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aspen Movie Map]] was created at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1978. The program was a crude virtual simulation of [[Aspen, Colorado]] in which users could wander the streets in one of the three modes: summer, winter, and polygons. 

In 1979 [[Eric Howlett]] developed the Large Expanse, Extra Perspective (LEEP) optical system. The combined system created a stereoscopic image with a field of view wide enough to create a convincing sense of space. The users of the system have been impressed by the sensation of depth [field of view] in the scene and the corresponding realism. The original LEEP system was redesigned for the NASA Ames Research Center in 1985 for their first virtual reality installation, the VIEW (Virtual Interactive Environment Workstation) by [[Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher]]. The LEEP system provides the basis for most of the current virtual reality helmets available today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Wayne|title="Virtual Reality and Artificial Environments", A Critical History of Computer Graphics and Animation|date=December 2005|location=Section 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Musée Mécanique 205.JPG|thumb|upright|A 1980 Atari arcade video game ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' used 3D vector graphics to immerse the player in a VR world]]

[[Atari]] founded a research lab for virtual reality in 1982, but the lab was closed after two years due to the Atari Shock ([[North American video game crash of 1983]]). However, its hired employees, such as Tom Zimmerman, [[Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher]], [[Jaron Lanier]], [[Michael Naimark]], and [[Brenda Laurel]], kept their research and development on VR-related technologies. 

[[File:VPL DataSuit 1.jpg|upright|thumb|left|A VPL Research DataSuit, a full-body outfit with sensors for measuring the movement of arms, legs, and trunk. Developed circa 1989. Displayed at the Nissho Iwai showroom in Tokyo]]

By the 1980s the term "virtual reality" was popularized by Jaron Lanier, one of the modern pioneers of the field. Lanier had founded the company [[VPL Research]] in 1985. VPL Research has developed several VR devices like the Data Glove, the EyePhone, and the Audio Sphere. VPL licensed the Data Glove technology to [[Mattel]], which used it to make an accessory known as the Power Glove. While the Power Glove was hard to use and not popular, at US$75, it was an early affordable VR device.

=== 1990–2000 ===
In 1991, [[Carolina Cruz-Neira]], [[Daniel J. Sandin]] and [[Thomas A. DeFanti]] from the [[Electronic Visualization Laboratory]] created the [[Cave automatic virtual environment|first cubic immersive room]], The Cave. Developed as Cruz-Neira's PhD thesis, it involved a multi-projected environment, similar to the [[holodeck]], allowing people to see their own bodies in relation to others in the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goad|first1=Angela|title=Carolina Cruz-Neira {{!}} Introductions Necessary|url=http://introductionsnecessary.com/2016/01/18/carolina-cruz-neira/|website=Introductions Necessary|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arkansas Online Niera"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=David|title=Engineer envisions sci-fi as reality|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2014/nov/24/engineer-envisions-sci-fi-as-reality-20/?print|accessdate=28 March 2017|work=Arkansas Online|date=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1989-1992, [[Nicole Stenger]] created ''Angels'', the first real-time interactive immersive movie. The interaction was facilitated with a [[dataglove]] and high-resolution goggles.

In 1992, [[Louis Rosenberg (entrepreneur)|Louis Rosenberg]] created the [[Virtual fixture|Virtual Fixtures]] system at the [[Armstrong Laboratory|U.S. Air Force’s Armstrong Labs]] using a [[:File:Virtual-Fixtures-USAF-AR.jpg|full upper-body exoskeleton]], enabling a physically realistic virtual reality in 3D.  The system enabled the overlay of physically real 3D virtual objects registered with a user's direct view of the real world, producing the first true [[augmented reality]] experience enabling sight, sound, and touch.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg 1992"&gt;Rosenberg, Louis (1992).

[[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] console was released in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/products/virtual-boy/1672 |title=Nintendo Virtual Boy on theverge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1995, a group in Seattle created public demonstrations of a [[Cave automatic virtual environment|"CAVE-like"]] 270 degree immersive projection room called the Virtual Environment Theater, produced by entrepreneurs Chet Dagit and Bob Jacobson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-02-22/business/fi-34851_1_virtual-reality |title= Virtual Reality Applications Expand : Imaging: Technology is finding important places in medicine, engineering and many other realms – LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forte released the [[VFX1 Headgear|VFX1]], a PC-powered virtual reality headset in 1995.

In 1999, entrepreneur [[Philip Rosedale]] formed [[Linden Lab]] with an initial focus on the development of VR hardware. In its earliest form, the company struggled to produce a commercial version of "The Rig", which was realized in prototype form as a clunky steel contraption with several computer monitors that users could wear on their shoulders. The concept was later adapted into the personal computer-based, 3D virtual world [[Second Life]].&lt;ref&gt;Au, Wagner James. ''The Making of Second Life'', pg. 19.

In 2001, SAS Cube (SAS3) became the first PC based cubic room, developed by Z-A Production ([[Maurice Benayoun]], David Nahon), Barco, and Clarté. It was installed in [[Laval, Mayenne|Laval]], France. The SAS library gave birth to Virtools VRPack. 

By 2007, [[Google]] introduced [[Google Street View|Street View]], a service that shows panoramic views of an increasing number of worldwide positions such as roads, indoor buildings and rural areas. It also features a stereoscopic 3D mode, introduced in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://readwrite.com/2010/04/06/google_street_view_in_3d_here_to_stay |title=Google Street View in 3D: More Than Just an April Fool's Joke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Palmer Luckey]] designed the first prototype of the [[Oculus Rift]]. This prototype, built on a shell of another virtual reality headset, was only capable of rotational tracking. However, it boasted a 90-degree field of vision that was previously unseen in the consumer market at the time. This initial design would later serve as a basis from which the later designs came.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Peter. (2014). Oculus Rift.

By 2016 there were at least 230 companies developing VR-related products. Facebook had 400 employees focused on VR development; Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony and Samsung all had dedicated AR and VR groups. Dynamic [[3D audio effect|binaural audio]] was common to most headsets released that year. However, haptic interfaces were not well developed, and most hardware packages incorporated button-operated handsets for touch-based interactivity.

{{Main article|Applications of virtual reality}}

VR is most commonly used in entertainment applications such as [[Video game|gaming]] and [[3D cinema]]. Consumer virtual reality headsets were first released by video game companies in the early-mid 1990s. Beginning in the 2010s, next-generation commercial tethered headsets were released by Oculus (Rift), HTC (Vive) and Sony (PlayStation VR), setting off a new wave of application development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data-reality.com/comparison-of-best-vr-headsets-morpheus-vs-rift-vs-vive/|title=Comparison of VR headsets: Project Morpheus vs. Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive|website=Data Reality|accessdate=15 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820001906/http://data-reality.com/comparison-of-best-vr-headsets-morpheus-vs-rift-vs-vive/|archivedate=20 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3D cinema has been used for sporting events, pornography, fine art, music videos and short films. Since 2015, roller coasters and [[theme parks]] have incorporated virtual reality to match visual effects with haptic feedback .&lt;ref name="Wired Magic Leap Apr2016" /&gt;

In [[robotics]], virtual reality has been used to control robots in [[telepresence]] and [[telerobotic]] systems.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenberg 1993"&gt;Rosenberg, L., "Virtual fixtures as tools to enhance operator performance in telepresence environments," SPIE Manipulator Technology, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The technology is useful in robotics development such as in experiments that investigate how robots—through virtual articulations—can be applied as an intuitive [[User interface|human interface]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Robotics and Virtual Reality|last=Gulrez|first=Tauseef|last2=Hassanien|first2=Aboul Ella|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2012|isbn=9783642233623|location=Berlin|pages=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, researchers can simulate how robots are remotely controlled in different environments such as in space. Here, virtual reality not only offers insights into the manipulation and [[Locomotion in space|locomotion]] of robotic technology but also shows opportunities for inspection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Virtual reality has been used in rehabilitation since the 2000s. Despite numerous studies conducted, good quality evidence of its efficacy compared to other rehabilitation methods without sophisticated and expensive equipment is lacking for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dockx|first=Kim|date=2016|title==Virtual reality for rehabilitation in Parkinson's disease |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=12 |pages=CD010760|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010760.pub2|pmid=28000926|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/420336}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 review on the effectiveness of mirror therapy by virtual reality and robotics for any type of pathology concluded in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Darbois|first=Nelly|last2=Guillaud|first2=Albin|last3=Pinsault|first3=Nicolas |date=2018|title= Does Robotics and Virtual Reality Add Real Progress to Mirror Therapy Rehabilitation?

Applications for VR are facilitated by technologies that go beyond the use of graphics and [[Virtual reality headset|headsets]]. There are a multitude of techniques, technologies, and hardware solutions to enhance the immersive experience and derive data from the users’ responses to that experience. The use of haptic clothing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://teslasuit.io/|title=Teslasuit - full body haptic suit|website=Teslasuit - full body haptic VR suit|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;, eye tracking technologies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tobiipro.com/|title=Eye tracking technology for research - Tobii Pro|date=2015-04-27|website=www.tobiipro.com|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and “Fourth Dimension” sensory stimulation are becoming especially popular and useful&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mxtreality.co.uk/help/|title=Help - MXT|website=mxtreality.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

When commercially available technology became more widespread, VR festivals began to emerge in the mid-2010s. The first uses of VR in museum settings began in the 1990s, seeing a significant increase in the mid-2010s. Additionally, museums have begun making some of their content virtual reality accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mw2016.museumsandtheweb.com/paper/virtual-reality-at-the-british-museum-what-is-the-value-of-virtual-reality-environments-for-learning-by-children-and-young-people-schools-and-families/|title=Virtual reality at the British Museum: What is the value of virtual reality environments for learning by children and young people, schools, and families? – MW2016: Museums and the Web 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/blogs/checklist/extending-the-museum-experience-with-virtual-reality|title=Extending the Museum Experience with Virtual Reality|date=18 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction and popular culture ==
{{Main|Virtual reality in fiction}}

There have been many works of fiction that reference and describe forms of virtual reality. 

In the 1980s and 1990s, [[cyberpunk]]s viewed the technology as a potential means for social change. The [[recreational drug]] subculture praised virtual reality not only as a new art form, but as an entirely new frontier.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultronix.eserver.org/chesher/|title=Colonizing Virtual Reality: Construction of the Discourse of Virtual Reality|last=Chesher|first=Chris|date=1994|website=|publisher=Cultronix|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304125850/http://cultronix.eserver.org/chesher/|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concerns and challenges ==
===Health and safety===
There are many health and safety considerations of virtual reality. Most virtual reality systems come with consumer warnings, including: seizures; developmental issues in children; trip-and-fall and collision warnings; discomfort; repetitive stress injury; and interference with medical devices.&lt;ref name="Oculus Rift Warnings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oculus Rift Health and Safety Notice|url=https://static.oculus.com/documents/310-30023-01_Rift_HealthSafety_English.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users may experience twitches, seizures or blackouts while using VR headsets, even if they do not have a history of epilepsy and have never had blackouts or seizures before. As many as one in 4000 people may experience these symptoms. Since these symptoms are more common among people under the age of 20, children are advised against using VR headsets. Other problems may occur in physical interactions with one's environment. While wearing VR headsets, people quickly lose awareness of their real-world surroundings and may injure themselves by tripping over, or colliding with real-world objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fagan |first1=Kaylee |title=Here's what happens to your body when you've been in virtual reality for too long |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/virtual-reality-vr-side-effects-2018-3 |accessdate=5 September 2018 |publisher=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of unwanted symptoms have been caused by prolonged use of virtual reality,&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, B. D. (2014). Motion sickness symptomatology and origins. Handbook of Virtual Environments: Design, Implementation, and Applications, 531-599.&lt;/ref&gt; and these may have slowed proliferation of the technology. For example, in 1995, Nintendo released a gaming console known as the [[Virtual Boy]]. Worn as a headpiece and connected to a typical controller, the Virtual Boy received much criticism for its negative physical effects, including "dizziness, nausea, and headaches".&lt;ref&gt;Frischling, Bill. "Sideline Play." The Washington Post (1974-Current file): 11. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Washington Post (1877-1995). October 25, 1995. Web. May 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; VR headsets may regularly cause eye fatigue, as does all screened technology, because people tend to blink less when watching screens, causing their eyes to become more dried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mukamal |first1=Reena |title=Are Virtual Reality Headsets Safe for Eyes? |url=https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/are-virtual-reality-headsets-safe-eyes |website=American Academy of Ophthalmology |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some concerns about VR headsets contributing to myopia, but although VR headsets sit close to the eyes, they may not necessarily contribute to nearsightedness if the focal length of the image being displayed is sufficiently far away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Langley |first1=Hugh |title=We need to look more carefully into the long-term effects of VR |url=https://www.wareable.com/vr/vr-long-term-brain-eyes-effects-6674 |website=Wareable.com |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virtual reality sickness]] (also known as cybersickness) occurs when a person's exposure to a virtual environment causes symptoms that are similar to [[motion sickness]] symptoms.&lt;ref name="Kiryu2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kiryu |first1=T |last2=So |first2=RH |title=Sensation of presence and cybersickness in applications of virtual reality for advanced rehabilitation |journal=Journal of Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation |date=25 September 2007 |volume=4 |pages=34 |doi=10.1186/1743-0003-4-34 |pmid=17894857 |pmc=2117018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common symptoms are general discomfort, headache, stomach awareness, nausea, vomiting, pallor, sweating, fatigue, drowsiness, disorientation, and apathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hicks |first1=Jamison S. |last2=Durbin |first2=David B. |title=ARL-TR-5573: A Summary of Simulator Sickness Ratings for U.S. Army Aviation Engineering Simulators |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a551763.pdf |publisher=US Army Research Laboratory |date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These motion sickness symptoms are caused by a disconnect between what is being seen and what the rest of the body perceives. When the vestibular system, the body's internal balancing system, does not experience the motion that it expects from visual input through the eyes, the user may experience VR sickness. This can also happen if the VR system does not have a high enough frame rate, or if there is a lag between the body's movement and the onscreen visual reaction to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Caddy |first1=Becca |title=Vomit Reality: Why VR makes some of us feel sick and how to make it stop |url=https://www.wareable.com/vr/vr-headset-motion-sickness-solution-777 |website=Wareable.com |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because approximately 25–40% of people experience some kind of VR sickness when using VR machines, companies are actively looking for ways to reduce VR sickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Samit |first1=Jay |title=A Possible Cure for Virtual Reality Motion Sickness |url=http://fortune.com/2018/02/06/virtual-reality-motion-sickness/ |website=Fortune.com |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy===
The persistent tracking required by all VR systems makes the technology particularly useful for, and vulnerable to, mass [[surveillance]]. The expansion of VR will increase the potential and reduce the costs for information gathering of personal actions, movements and responses.&lt;ref name="Wired Magic Leap Apr2016" /&gt;

===Conceptual and philosophical concerns===
In addition, there are conceptual and philosophical considerations and implications associated with the use of virtual reality. What the phrase "virtual reality" means or refers to can be ambiguous. [[Mychilo S. Cline]] argued in 2005 that through virtual reality techniques will be developed to influence human behavior, [[interpersonal communication]], and [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7OxbJWzIaVEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=power+madness+and+immortality&amp;q=|title=Power, Madness, &amp; Immortality: the Future of Virtual Reality |publisher=Virtualreality.universityvillagepress.com |accessdate=2009-10-28|author1=Cline, Mychilo Stephenson|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virtualreality.universityvillagepress.com/index.php?itemid=25&amp;catid=4 |title=The Future of Virtual Reality with Mychilo Cline " Introduction to the Future of Virtual Reality |publisher=Virtualreality.universityvillagepress.com |accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power, Madness and Immortality {{!}} KurzweilAI|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/power-madness-and-immortality|website=www.kurzweilai.net|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
