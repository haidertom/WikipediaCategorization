Acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment.&lt;ref name=Hutchinson2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Efficacy --&gt;
The conclusions of many trials and numerous [[systematic review]]s of acupuncture are largely inconsistent, which suggests that it is not effective.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ernst2009/&gt; An overview of [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane reviews]] found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions.&lt;ref name=Ernst2009/&gt; A systematic review found little evidence of acupuncture's effectiveness in treating pain.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt; The evidence suggests that short-term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long-term benefits.&lt;ref name=Wang-2008/&gt; Some research results suggest acupuncture can alleviate pain, though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture's effects are mainly due to the [[Placebo|placebo effect]].&lt;ref name=Ernst2006/&gt; A systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias.&lt;ref name=Madsen2009/&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was [[cost-effective]] as an adjunct to standard care,&lt;ref name="Taylor2013"/&gt; while a systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain.&lt;ref name="Standaert2011"/&gt;

Acupuncture is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner using clean needle technique and single-use needles.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nciacupuncture"/&gt; When properly delivered, it has a low rate of mostly minor [[adverse effects]].&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect of the practitioner.&lt;ref name="nciacupuncture"/&gt; A review stated that the reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the previous decade.&lt;ref name="Gnatta2013"/&gt; The most frequently reported adverse events were [[pneumothorax]] and infections.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt; Since serious adverse events continue to be reported, it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Mechanism, Epidemiology and History --&gt;
Scientific investigation has not found any [[histology|histological]] or [[physiology|physiological]] evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as ''[[qi]]'', [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]], and acupuncture points,{{refn |group= n |name="SinghErnst2008" |Singh &amp; Ernst (2008) stated, "Scientists are still unable to find a shred of evidence to support the existence of meridians or Ch'i",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh &amp; Ernst|2008|page= 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The traditional principles of acupuncture are deeply flawed, as there is no evidence at all to demonstrate the existence of Ch'i or meridians"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh &amp; Ernst|2008|page= 107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "As yin and yang, acupuncture points and meridians are not a reality, but merely the product of an ancient Chinese philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh &amp; Ernst|2008|page= 387}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Ahn2008"/&gt; and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy (''qi'') flowing through meridians, which was a major part of early belief systems.&lt;ref name="Peñas2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mann2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams2013/&gt; Acupuncture is believed to have originated around 100&amp;nbsp;BC in China, around the time ''The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine'' ([[Huangdi Neijing]]) was published,&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; though some experts suggest it could have been practiced earlier.&lt;ref name="Ernst2006"/&gt; Over time, conflicting claims and belief systems emerged about the effect of lunar, celestial and earthly cycles, [[yin and yang]] energies, and a body's "rhythm" on the effectiveness of treatment.&lt;ref name="Prioreschi2004"/&gt; Acupuncture grew and diminished in popularity in China repeatedly, depending on the country's political leadership and the favor of rationalism or Western medicine.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; Acupuncture spread first to Korea in the 6th century AD, then to Japan through medical missionaries,&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; and then to Europe, starting with France.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; In the 20th century, as it spread to the United States and Western countries, the spiritual elements of acupuncture that conflict with Western beliefs were sometimes abandoned in favor of simply tapping needles into acupuncture points.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;&lt;ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson 2011 p. 610"/&gt;

Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=Berman2010/&gt; It is used most commonly for pain relief,&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCCAM2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Acupuncture for Pain|url=http://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/acupuncture-for-pain.htm|work=NCCIH|access-date=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is also used to treat a wide range of conditions. The majority of people who seek out acupuncture do so for musculoskeletal problems, including [[low back pain]], shoulder stiffness, and knee pain.&lt;ref name=Ishizaki2010/&gt; Acupuncture is generally only used in combination with other forms of treatment.&lt;ref name=Hutchinson2012/&gt; For example, [[American Society of Anesthesiologists]] states it may be considered in the treatment for nonspecific, noninflammatory low back pain only in conjunction with conventional therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benzon HT, Connis RT, De Leon-Casasola OA, Glass DD, Korevaar WC, Cynwyd B, Mekhail NA, Merrill DG, Nickinovich DG, Rathmell JP, Sang CN, Simon DL | title = Practice guidelines for chronic pain management: an updated report by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Chronic Pain Management and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 112 | issue = 4 | pages = 810–33 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20124882 | doi = 10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181c43103 | url = http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/article.aspx?articleid=1932775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acupuncture is the insertion of thin needles into the skin.&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt; According to the [[Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research]] (Mayo Clinic), a typical session entails lying still while approximately five to twenty needles are inserted; for the majority of cases, the needles will be left in place for ten to twenty minutes.&lt;ref name=mayo2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/acupuncture/basics/what-you-can-expect/prc-20020778|work=Mayo Clinic Staff|publisher=[[Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research]]|title=What you can expect|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be associated with the application of heat, pressure, or [[laser light]].&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt; Classically, acupuncture is individualized and based on philosophy and intuition, and not on scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schwartz | first=L | url=http://medicalacupuncture.org/aama_marf/journal/vol12_1/evidence.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011121060240/http://medicalacupuncture.org/aama_marf/journal/vol12_1/evidence.html|archive-date=2001-11-21 |journal=Medical Acupuncture | pages=38–41 | year=2000 |volume=12 | issue=1 | title=Evidence-Based Medicine And Traditional Chinese Medicine: Not Mutually Exclusive}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a [[invasiveness of surgical procedures#Non-invasive procedure|non-invasive]] therapy developed in early 20th century Japan using an elaborate set of "needles" for the treatment of children (''shōnishin'' or ''shōnihari'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Stephen | last = Birch | name-list-format = vanc |chapter= |pages= |title=Japanese Pediatric Acupuncture|publisher=Thieme |year=2011 |isbn=978-3131500618}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Thomas | last = Wernicke | name-list-format = vanc |chapter= |pages= |title=The Art of Non-Invasive Paediatric Acupuncture|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers |year=2014 |isbn=978-1848191600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional acupuncture, the acupuncturist decides which points to treat by observing and questioning the patient to make a diagnosis according to the tradition used. In TCM, the four diagnostic methods are: inspection, auscultation and olfaction, inquiring, and palpation. Inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue, including analysis of the tongue size, shape, tension, color and coating, and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge.&lt;ref name=Cheng1987/&gt; Auscultation and olfaction involve listening for particular sounds such as wheezing, and observing body odor.&lt;ref name=Cheng1987/&gt; Inquiring involves focusing on the "seven inquiries": chills and fever; perspiration; appetite, thirst and taste; defecation and urination; pain; sleep; and [[menses]] and [[leukorrhea]].&lt;ref name=Cheng1987/&gt; Palpation is focusing on feeling the body for tender ''"A-shi"'' points and feeling the pulse.&lt;ref name=Cheng1987&gt;[[#Cheng1987|Cheng]], 1987, chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Needles ===
[[File:Acupuncture Needles.jpg|thumb|right|Acupuncture needles]]
[[File:Japanese kudabari.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional and modern Japanese guiding tube needles]]
The most common mechanism of stimulation of acupuncture points employs penetration of the skin by thin metal needles, which are manipulated manually or the needle may be further stimulated by electrical stimulation (electroacupuncture).&lt;ref name=Berman2010/&gt; Acupuncture needles are typically made of stainless steel, making them flexible and preventing them from rusting or breaking.&lt;ref name=Hicks2005/&gt; Needles are usually disposed of after each use to prevent contamination.&lt;ref name=Hicks2005/&gt; Reusable needles when used should be sterilized between applications.&lt;ref name=Hicks2005&gt;{{cite book | first = Angela | last = Hicks | name-list-format = vanc |edition=1 |page=41 |title=The Acupuncture Handbook: How Acupuncture Works and How It Can Help You |publisher=[[Piatkus Books]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0749924720}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Collinge | first = William J. | name-list-format = vanc |title=The American Holistic Health Association Complete guide to alternative medicine |publisher=Warner Books |location=New York |year=1996 |isbn=0-446-67258-0 |oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needles vary in length between {{convert|13|to|130|mm|in}}, with shorter needles used near the face and eyes, and longer needles in areas with thicker tissues; needle diameters vary from 0{{convert|.16|mm|3|abbr=on}} to 0{{convert|.46|mm|3|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=Aung116&gt;[[#Aung2007|Aung &amp; Chen]], 2007, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 116].&lt;/ref&gt; with thicker needles used on more robust patients. Thinner needles may be flexible and require tubes for insertion. The tip of the needle should not be made too sharp to prevent breakage, although blunt needles cause more pain.&lt;ref name=FCA&gt;{{cite book| pages =[https://books.google.com/books?id=bKoMiuhSb3YC&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 2–3] | title=Fundamentals of Chinese Acupuncture | vauthors = Ellis A, Wiseman N, Boss K | isbn=091211133X | publisher=Paradigm Publications | year=1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the usual filiform needle, other needle types include three-edged needles and the Nine Ancient Needles.&lt;ref name=Aung116/&gt; Japanese acupuncturists use extremely thin needles that are used superficially, sometimes without penetrating the skin, and surrounded by a guide tube (a 17th-century invention adopted in China and the West). Korean acupuncture uses copper needles and has a greater focus on the hand.&lt;ref name=Dummies&gt;{{cite book | pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=b6_1FOwC_GYC&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 126–128] | title=Complementary Medicine For Dummies | last=Young | first=J | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | year=2007 | isbn=0470519681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Needling technique ===

==== Insertion ====

The skin is sterilized and needles are inserted, frequently with a plastic guide tube. Needles may be manipulated in various ways, including spinning, flicking, or moving up and down relative to the skin. Since most pain is felt in the superficial layers of the skin, a quick insertion of the needle is recommended.&lt;ref name=Aung2007&gt;[[#Aung2007|Aung &amp; Chen]], 2007, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 113–114].&lt;/ref&gt; Often the needles are stimulated by hand in order to cause a dull, localized, aching sensation that is called ''de qi'', as well as "needle grasp," a tugging feeling felt by the acupuncturist and generated by a mechanical interaction between the needle and skin.&lt;ref name=Berman2010/&gt; Acupuncture can be painful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loyeung BY, Cobbin DM | title = Investigating the effects of three needling parameters (manipulation, retention time, and insertion site) on needling sensation and pain profiles: a study of eight deep needling interventions | journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 2013 | pages = 136763 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24159337 | pmc = 3789497 | doi = 10.1155/2013/136763 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The skill level of the acupuncturist may influence how painful the needle insertion is, and a sufficiently skilled practitioner may be able to insert the needles without causing any pain.&lt;ref name=Aung2007/&gt;

==== ''De-qi'' sensation ====

''De-qi'' ({{zh|s=得气|p=dé qì}}; "arrival of qi") refers to a sensation of [[paresthesia|numbness]], distension, or electrical tingling at the needling site which might radiate along the corresponding [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridian]]. If ''de-qi'' can not be generated, then inaccurate location of the [[acupoint]], improper depth of needle insertion, inadequate manual manipulation, or a very weak constitution of the patient can be considered, all of which are thought to decrease the likelihood of successful treatment. If the ''de-qi'' sensation does not immediately occur upon needle insertion, various manual manipulation techniques can be applied to promote it (such as "plucking", "shaking" or "trembling").&lt;ref name="AungChen2007"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Steven | last1 = Aung | first2 = William | last2 = Chen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Clinical Introduction to Medical Acupuncture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC|access-date=20 September 2012|date=10 January 2007|publisher=Thieme|isbn=9781588902214|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Acupuncture is often accompanied by moxibustion, the burning of cone-shaped preparations of moxa (made from dried [[mugwort]]) on or near the skin, often but not always near or on an acupuncture point. Traditionally, acupuncture was used to treat [[acute (medicine)|acute conditions]] while moxibustion was used for [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic diseases]]. Moxibustion could be direct (the cone was placed directly on the skin and allowed to burn the skin, producing a blister and eventually a scar), or indirect (either a cone of moxa was placed on a slice of garlic, ginger or other vegetable, or a cylinder of moxa was held above the skin, close enough to either warm or burn it).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Needham2002|Needham &amp; Lu]], 2002, pp [https://books.google.com/books?id=0–0tdqBr58cC&amp;pg=PA170#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 170–173].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Traditional acupuncture involves moxibustion and cupping. --&gt;
A 2010 overview of systematic reviews found that moxibustion was effective for several conditions but the primary studies were of poor quality, so there persists ample uncertainty, which limits the conclusiveness of their findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee MS, Kang JW, Ernst E | title = Does moxibustion work?

== Safety ==

=== Adverse events ===
Acupuncture is generally safe when administered by an experienced, appropriately trained practitioner using clean-needle technique and sterile single-use needles.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nciacupuncture"&gt;{{cite web|title= Acupuncture–for health professionals (PDQ)|url= http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/acupuncture-pdq#section/_71|publisher= [[National Cancer Institute]]|access-date= 16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When improperly delivered it can cause adverse effects.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect on the part of the practitioner.&lt;ref name="nciacupuncture"/&gt; To reduce the risk of serious adverse events after acupuncture, acupuncturists should be trained sufficiently.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt; People with serious spinal disease, such as cancer or infection, are not good candidates for acupuncture.&lt;ref name=Berman2010/&gt; [[Contraindication]]s to acupuncture (conditions that should not be treated with acupuncture) include coagulopathy disorders (e.g. hemophilia and advanced liver disease), warfarin use, severe psychiatric disorders (e.g. psychosis), and skin infections or skin trauma (e.g. burns).&lt;ref name=Berman2010/&gt; Further, electroacupuncture should be avoided at the spot of implanted electrical devices (such as pacemakers).&lt;ref name=Berman2010/&gt;

A 2011 systematic review of systematic reviews (internationally and without language restrictions) found that serious complications following acupuncture continue to be reported.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt; Between 2000 and 2009, ninety-five cases of [[serious adverse event]]s, including five [[deaths]], were reported.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt; Many such events are not inherent to acupuncture but are due to [[Medical malpractice|malpractice]] of acupuncturists.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt; This might be why such complications have not been reported in surveys of adequately-trained acupuncturists.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt; Most such reports originate from Asia, which may reflect the large number of treatments performed there or a relatively higher number of poorly trained Asian acupuncturists.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt; Many serious adverse events were reported from developed countries.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt; These included Australia, Austria, Canada, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt; The number of adverse effects reported from the UK appears particularly unusual, which may indicate less under-reporting in the UK than other countries.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt; Reports included 38 cases of infections and 42 cases of organ trauma.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt; The most frequent adverse events included [[pneumothorax]], and [[bacterial infection|bacterial]] and [[viral infection]]s.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt;

==== English-language ====

A 2013 systematic review of the English-language case reports found that serious adverse events associated with acupuncture are rare, but that acupuncture is not without risk.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; Between 2000 and 2011 the English-language literature from 25 countries and regions reported 294 adverse events.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; The majority of the reported adverse events were relatively minor, and the incidences were low.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; For example, a prospective survey of 34,000 acupuncture treatments found no serious adverse events and 43 minor ones, a rate of 1.3 per 1000 interventions.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; Another survey found there were 7.1% minor adverse events, of which 5 were serious, amid 97,733 acupuncture patients.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; The most common adverse effect observed was infection (e.g. mycobacterium), and the majority of infections were bacterial in nature, caused by skin contact at the needling site.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; Infection has also resulted from skin contact with unsterilized equipment or with dirty towels in an unhygienic clinical setting.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; Other adverse complications included five reported cases of [[spinal cord injuries]] (e.g. migrating broken needles or needling too deeply), four brain injuries, four peripheral nerve injuries, five [[heart]] injuries, seven other organ and tissue injuries, bilateral hand [[edema]], [[granuloma|epithelioid granuloma]], [[pseudolymphoma]], [[argyria]], pustules, [[pancytopenia]], and scarring due to hot-needle technique.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; Adverse reactions from acupuncture, which are unusual and uncommon in typical acupuncture practice, included syncope, galactorrhoea, bilateral nystagmus, pyoderma gangrenosum, hepatotoxicity, eruptive lichen planus, and spontaneous needle migration.&lt;ref name="Xu S"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu S, Wang L, Cooper E, Zhang M, Manheimer E, Berman B, Shen X, Lao L | title = Adverse events of acupuncture: a systematic review of case reports | journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 2013 | pages = 581203 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23573135 | pmc = 3616356 | doi = 10.1155/2013/581203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 systematic review found 31 cases of vascular injuries caused by acupuncture, three resulting in death.&lt;ref name=Bergqvist/&gt; Two died from pericardial tamponade and one was from an aortoduodenal fistula.&lt;ref name=Bergqvist&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bergqvist D | title = Vascular injuries caused by acupuncture.

A 2012 review found a number of adverse events were reported after acupuncture in the UK's [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS) but most (95%) were not severe,&lt;ref name=Wheway2012/&gt; though miscategorization and under-reporting may alter the total figures.&lt;ref name=Wheway2012/&gt; From January 2009 to December 2011, 468 safety incidents were recognized within the NHS organizations.&lt;ref name=Wheway2012/&gt; The adverse events recorded included retained needles (31%), dizziness (30%), loss of consciousness/unresponsive (19%), falls (4%), bruising or soreness at needle site (2%), pneumothorax (1%) and other adverse side effects (12%).&lt;ref name=Wheway2012/&gt; Acupuncture practitioners should know, and be prepared to be responsible for, any substantial harm from treatments.&lt;ref name=Wheway2012/&gt; Some acupuncture proponents argue that the long history of acupuncture suggests it is safe.&lt;ref name=Wheway2012/&gt; However, there is an increasing literature on adverse events (e.g. spinal-cord injury).&lt;ref name=Wheway2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wheway J, Agbabiaka TB, Ernst E | title = Patient safety incidents from acupuncture treatments: a review of reports to the National Patient Safety Agency | journal = The International Journal of Risk &amp; Safety in Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 163–9 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22936058 | doi = 10.3233/JRS-2012-0569 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acupuncture seems to be safe in people getting [[anticoagulant]]s, assuming needles are used at the correct location and depth.&lt;ref name=Mcculloch2014/&gt; Studies are required to verify these findings.&lt;ref name="Mcculloch2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mcculloch M, Nachat A, Schwartz J, Casella-Gordon V, Cook J | title = Acupuncture safety in patients receiving anticoagulants: a systematic review | journal = The Permanente Journal | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 68–73 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25432001 | pmc = 4315381 | doi = 10.7812/TPP/14-057 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence suggests that acupuncture might be a safe option for people with allergic rhinitis.&lt;ref name=Feng2015/&gt;

==== Chinese, South Korean, and Japanese-language ====

A 2010 systematic review of the Chinese-language literature found numerous acupuncture-related adverse events, including pneumothorax, fainting, [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]], and infection as the most frequent, and cardiovascular injuries, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pneumothorax, and recurrent cerebral hemorrhage as the most serious, most of which were due to improper technique.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; Between 1980 and 2009, the Chinese-language literature reported 479 adverse events.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; [[Prospective survey]]s show that mild, transient acupuncture-associated adverse events ranged from 6.71% to 15%.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; In a study with 190,924 patients, the prevalence of serious adverse events was roughly 0.024%.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; Another study showed a rate of adverse events requiring specific treatment of 2.2%, 4,963 [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidences]] among 229,230 patients.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; Infections, mainly [[hepatitis]], after acupuncture are reported often in English-language research, though are rarely reported in Chinese-language research, making it plausible that acupuncture-associated infections have been underreported in China.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; Infections were mostly caused by poor sterilization of acupuncture needles.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; Other adverse events included spinal epidural hematoma (in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine), chylothorax, injuries of abdominal organs and tissues, injuries in the neck region, injuries to the eyes, including orbital hemorrhage, traumatic cataract, injury of the oculomotor nerve and retinal puncture, hemorrhage to the cheeks and the hypoglottis, peripheral motor-nerve injuries and subsequent motor dysfunction, local allergic reactions to metal needles, stroke, and cerebral hemorrhage after acupuncture.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt;

A causal link between acupuncture and the adverse events cardiac arrest, pyknolepsy, shock, fever, cough, thirst, aphonia, leg numbness, and sexual dysfunction remains uncertain.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang J, Shang H, Gao X, Ernst E | title = Acupuncture-related adverse events: a systematic review of the Chinese literature | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 88 | issue = 12 | pages = 915–921C | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21124716 | pmc = 2995190 | doi = 10.2471/BLT.10.076737 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same review concluded that acupuncture can be considered inherently safe when practiced by properly trained practitioners, but the review also stated there is a need to find effective strategies to minimize the health risks.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; Between 1999 and 2010, the Republic of Korean-literature contained reports of 1104 adverse events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shin HK, Jeong SJ, Lee MS, Ernst E | title = Adverse events attributed to traditional Korean medical practices: 1999-2010 | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 91 | issue = 8 | pages = 569–75 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23940404 | pmc = 3738306 | doi = 10.2471/BLT.12.111609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1980s and 2002, the Japanese-language literature contained reports of 150 adverse events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamashita H, Tsukayama H | title = Safety of acupuncture practice in Japan: patient reactions, therapist negligence and error reduction strategies | journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 391–8 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18955234 | pmc = 2586322 | doi = 10.1093/ecam/nem086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Children and pregnancy ====

Although acupuncture has been practiced for thousands of years in China, its use in [[pediatrics]] in the United States did not become common until the early 2000s. In 2007, the [[National Health Interview Survey]] (NHIS) conducted by the [[National Center for Health Statistics|National Center For Health Statistics]] (NCHS) estimated that approximately 150,000 children had received acupuncture treatment for a variety of conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://nccih.nih.gov/sites/nccam.nih.gov/files/news/nhsr12.pdf |title = Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Adults and Children: United States, 2007 |date = 2008-12-10 |access-date = 2016-02-05 |website = National Center for Complimentary and Integrative Health |publisher = NCHS |last = Barnes |first = Patricia M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 a study determined that the use of acupuncture-needle treatment on children was "questionable" due to the possibility of adverse side-effects and the pain manifestation differences in children versus adults. The study also includes warnings against practicing acupuncture on infants, as well as on children who are over-fatigued, very weak, or have over-eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jindal V, Ge A, Mansky PJ | title = Safety and efficacy of acupuncture in children: a review of the evidence | journal = Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 431–42 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18525459 | pmc = 2518962 | doi = 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318165b2cc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used on children, acupuncture is considered safe when administered by well-trained, licensed practitioners using sterile needles; however, a 2011 review found there was limited research to draw definite conclusions about the overall safety of pediatric acupuncture.&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt; The same review found 279 adverse events, 25 of them serious.&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt; The adverse events were mostly mild in nature (e.g. bruising or bleeding).&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt; The prevalence of mild adverse events ranged from 10.1% to 13.5%, an estimated 168 incidences among 1,422 patients.&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt; On rare occasions adverse events were serious (e.g. [[cardiac rupture]] or [[hemoptysis]]); many might have been a result of substandard practice.&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adams D, Cheng F, Jou H, Aung S, Yasui Y, Vohra S | title = The safety of pediatric acupuncture: a systematic review | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 128 | issue = 6 | pages = e1575-87 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22106073 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2011-1091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence of serious adverse events was 5 per one million, which included children and adults.&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt;

When used during pregnancy, the majority of adverse events caused by acupuncture were mild and transient, with few serious adverse events.&lt;ref name="Park-2014"/&gt; The most frequent mild adverse event was needling or unspecified pain, followed by bleeding.&lt;ref name="Park-2014"/&gt; Although two deaths (one stillbirth and one neonatal death) were reported, there was a lack of acupuncture-associated maternal mortality.&lt;ref name="Park-2014"/&gt; Limiting the evidence as certain, probable or possible in the causality evaluation, the estimated incidence of adverse events following acupuncture in pregnant women was 131 per 10,000.&lt;ref name="Park-2014"&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Park J, Sohn Y, White AR, Lee H | title = The safety of acupuncture during pregnancy: a systematic review | journal = Acupuncture in Medicine | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 257–66 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24554789 | pmc = 4112450 | doi = 10.1136/acupmed-2013-010480 | type = Systematic review }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Although acupuncture is not contraindicated in pregnant women, some specific acupuncture points are particularly sensitive to needle insertion; these spots, as well as the [[abdomen|abdominal region]], should be avoided during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Berman2010"/&gt;

==== Moxibustion and cupping ====
&lt;!-- Traditional acupuncture involves moxibustion and cupping. --&gt;
Four adverse events associated with moxibustion were bruising, burns and cellulitis, spinal epidural abscess, and large superficial basal cell carcinoma.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; Ten adverse events were associated with cupping.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; The minor ones were [[keloid]] scarring, burns, and [[bulla (dermatology)|bullae]];&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; the serious ones were acquired hemophilia A, stroke following cupping on the back and neck, factitious [[panniculitis]], reversible cardiac hypertrophy, and [[iron deficiency anemia]].&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt;

=== Cost-effectiveness ===

A 2013 meta-analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was [[cost-effective]] as a complement to standard care, but not as a substitute for standard care except in cases where comorbid depression presented.&lt;ref name=Taylor2013/&gt; The same meta-analysis found there was no difference between sham and non-sham acupuncture.&lt;ref name=Taylor2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor P, Pezzullo L, Grant SJ, Bensoussan A | title = Cost-effectiveness of Acupuncture for Chronic Nonspecific Low Back Pain | journal = Pain Practice | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 599–606 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24138020 | doi = 10.1111/papr.12116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain.&lt;ref name=Standaert2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Standaert CJ, Friedly J, Erwin MW, Lee MJ, Rechtine G, Henrikson NB, Norvell DC | title = Comparative effectiveness of exercise, acupuncture, and spinal manipulation for low back pain | journal = Spine | volume = 36 | issue = 21 Suppl | pages = S120-30 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21952184 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1097/BRS.0b013e31822ef878 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 systematic review found that the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture could not be concluded.&lt;ref name=Hopton2010/&gt; A 2012 review found that acupuncture seems to be cost-effective for some pain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ambrósio EM, Bloor K, MacPherson H | title = Costs and consequences of acupuncture as a treatment for chronic pain: a systematic review of economic evaluations conducted alongside randomised controlled trials | journal = Complementary Therapies in Medicine | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 364–74 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22863652 | doi = 10.1016/j.ctim.2012.05.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In TCM, disease is generally perceived as a disharmony or imbalance in energies such as [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Yin and yang|yin, yang]], [[Traditional Chinese medicine#TCM model of the body|''qi'', xuĕ, zàng-fǔ, meridians]], and of the interaction between the body and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiseman &amp; Ellis|1996|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapy is based on which "pattern of disharmony" can be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Ergil MC, Ergil KV | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=kdZ1rFKW–LEC&amp;pg=PA19 19], [https://books.google.com/books?id=kdZ1rFKW–LEC&amp;pg=PA148 148] | title = Pocket Atlas of Chinese Medicine | year = 2009 | publisher = Thieme | location = Stuttgart | isbn = 9783131416117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Flaws B, Finney D | year = 2007 | title = A handbook of TCM patterns &amp; their treatments | edition = 6th | publisher = Blue Poppy Press | isbn = 9780936185705 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=iJT3mz20yHoC&amp;pg=PA1 1] }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some diseases are believed to be caused by meridians being invaded with an excess of wind, cold, and damp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Flaws B, Finney D | title = A handbook of TCM patterns &amp; their treatments | publisher = Blue Poppy Press | year = 1996 | edition = 6 (2007) |isbn = 9780936185705 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=iJT3mz20yHoC&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 169–173] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to determine which [[Traditional chinese medicine#Patterns|pattern]] is at hand, practitioners examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing, or the sound of the voice.&lt;ref name=Tongue&gt;{{cite book | title = Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine | last = Maciocia | first = G | publisher = Eastland Press | year = 1995 | isbn = 093961619X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maciocia&gt;{{Cite book | first = G | last = Maciocia | title = The Foundations of Chinese Medicine | publisher = Churchill Livingstone | year = 2005 | isbn = 0443074895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TCM and its concept of disease does not strongly differentiate between the cause and effect of symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=t23zKB1FSVYC&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 26]| last=Ross |first=J|title=Zang Fu, the organ systems of traditional Chinese medicine| publisher=Elsevier |year=1984 | isbn=9780443034824 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article in ''Rheumatology'', the first documentation of an "organized system of diagnosis and treatment" for acupuncture was in ''The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine'' ([[Huangdi Neijing]]) from about 100&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; Gold and silver needles found in the tomb of [[Liu Sheng, Prince of Zhongshan|Liu Sheng]] from around 100&amp;nbsp;BC are believed to be the earliest archeological evidence of acupuncture, though it is unclear if that was their purpose.&lt;ref name=Ramey&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramey D, Buell D | year = 2004 | title = A true history of acupuncture | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1211/fact.2004.00244/full | doi = 10.1211/fact.2004.00244 | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | journal = Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies | pages = 269–273|trans-title=2017-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Plinio Prioreschi, the earliest known historical record of acupuncture is the [[Shih-Chi]] ("Record of History"), written by a historian around 100&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="Prioreschi2004"/&gt; It is believed that this text was documenting what was established practice at that time.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;

====Alternate theories====
The 5,000-year-old mummified body of [[Ötzi the Iceman]] was found with 15 groups of tattoos,&lt;ref name=Dorfer-1999/&gt; many of which were located at points on the body where acupuncture needles are used for abdominal or lower back problems. Evidence from the body suggests Otzi suffered from these conditions.&lt;ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/&gt; This has been cited as evidence that practices similar to acupuncture may have been practiced elsewhere in [[Eurasia]] during the early [[Bronze Age]];&lt;ref name=Dorfer-1999&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dorfer L, Moser M, Bahr F, Spindler K, Egarter-Vigl E, Giullén S, Dohr G, Kenner T | title = A medical report from the stone age? | journal = Lancet | volume = 354 | issue = 9183 | pages = 1023–5 | date = September 1999 | pmid = 10501382 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(98)12242-0 | url = http://www.utexas.edu/courses/classicalarch/readings/Iceman_Tattoos.pdf | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/5siE6P6TM?url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/classicalarch/readings/Iceman_Tattoos.pdf | archive-date = 2010-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, ''The Oxford Handbook of the History of Medicine'' calls this theory "speculative".&lt;ref name="Jackson 2011 p. 610"&gt;{{cite book | last=Jackson | first=M. | title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Medicine | publisher=OUP Oxford | series=Oxford Handbooks in History | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-19-954649-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpjgoazGIC4C&amp;pg=PT610 | access-date=14 July 2015 | page=610}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered unlikely that acupuncture was practiced before 2000&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Ramey/&gt; The Ötzi the Iceman's tattoo marks suggest to some experts that an acupuncture-like treatment was previously used in Europe 5 millennia ago.&lt;ref name="Ernst2006"/&gt;

Acupuncture may have been practiced during the [[Neolithic]] era, near the end of the [[stone age]], using sharpened stones called [[Bian Stones|Bian shi]].&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|70}} Many Chinese texts from later eras refer to sharp stones called "plen", which means "stone probe", that may have been used for acupuncture purposes.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|70}} The ancient Chinese medical text, Huangdi Neijing, indicates that sharp stones were believed at-the-time to cure illnesses at or near the body's surface, perhaps because of the short depth a stone could penetrate.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|71}} However, it is more likely that stones were used for other medical purposes, such as puncturing a growth to drain its [[pus]].&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;&lt;ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/&gt; The ''[[Mawangdui]]'' texts, which are believed to be from the 2nd century BC, mention the use of pointed stones to open [[abscess]]es, and moxibustion, but not for acupuncture.&lt;ref name="Prioreschi2004"/&gt; It is also speculated that these stones may have been used for bloodletting, due to the ancient Chinese belief that illnesses were caused by demons within the body that could be killed or released.&lt;ref name="Singh Ernst 2008 p. 42"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Singh S, Ernst E | title=Trick Or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine | publisher=W.

According to historians [[Lu Gwei-djen]] and [[Joseph Needham]], there is substantial evidence that acupuncture may have begun around 600&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; Some hieroglyphs and [[Pictogram|pictographs]] from that era suggests acupuncture and moxibustion were practiced.&lt;ref name="Robson"&gt;{{cite book | last = Robson | first = T | title = An Introduction to Complementary Medicine | isbn = 1741140544 | year = 2004 | publisher = [[Allen &amp; Unwin]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E6oa37ZyTxEC&amp;pg=PA90 | page = 90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians Gwei-djen and Needham said it was unlikely a needle could be made out of the materials available in China during this time period.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|71-72}} It is possible that [[Bronze|bronze]] was used for early acupuncture needles. Tin, copper, gold and silver are also possibilities, though they are considered less likely, or to have been used in fewer cases.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|69}} If acupuncture was practiced during the [[Shang dynasty]] (1766 to 1122&amp;nbsp;BC), organic materials like thorns, sharpened bones, or bamboo may have been used.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|70}} Once methods for producing steel were discovered, it would replace all other materials, since it could be used to create a very fine, but sturdy needles.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|74}} Gwei-djen and Needham noted that all the ancient materials that could have been used for acupuncture and which often produce archeological evidence, such as sharpened bones, bamboo or stones, were also used for other purposes.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; An article in ''Rheumatology'' said that the absence of any mention of acupuncture in documents found in the tomb of Ma-Wang-Dui from 198&amp;nbsp;BC suggest that acupuncture was not practiced by that time.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;

====Belief systems====
Several different and sometimes conflicting belief systems emerged regarding acupuncture. This may have been the result of competing schools of thought.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; Some ancient texts referred to using acupuncture to cause bleeding, while others mixed the ideas of blood-letting and spiritual ch'i energy. Over time, the focus shifted from blood to the concept of puncturing specific points on the body, and eventually to balancing Yin and Yang energies as well.&lt;ref name="Prioreschi2004"/&gt; According to David Ramey, no single "method or theory" was ever predominantly adopted as the standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramey DW | title = Inaccurate acupuncture history | journal = Rheumatology | volume = 43 | issue = 12 | pages = 1593; author reply 1593–4 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15564643 | doi = 10.1093/rheumatology/keh363 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, scientific knowledge of medicine was not yet developed, especially because in China dissection of the deceased was forbidden, preventing the development of basic anatomical knowledge.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;

It is not certain when specific acupuncture points were introduced, but the autobiography of Pien Chhio from around 400–500&amp;nbsp;BC references inserting needles at designated areas.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; [[Bian Que]] believed there was a single acupuncture point at the top of one's skull that he called the point "of the hundred meetings."&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|83}} Texts dated to be from 156–186&amp;nbsp;BC document early beliefs in channels of life force energy called meridians that would later be an element in early acupuncture beliefs.&lt;ref name=Ramey/&gt;

Ramey and Buell said the "practice and theoretical underpinnings" of modern acupuncture were introduced in ''The Yellow Emperor's Classic'' (Huangdi Neijing) around 100&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Prioreschi2004&gt;{{cite book | last = Prioreschi | first = P | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=MJUMhEYGOKsC&amp;pg=PA147 147–148] | year = 2004 | isbn = 1888456019 | publisher = Horatius Press | title = A history of Medicine, Volume 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ramey/&gt; It introduced the concept of using acupuncture to manipulate the flow of life energy (''qi'') in a network of meridian (channels) in the body.&lt;ref name=Ramey/&gt;&lt;ref name="Epler"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Epler DC | title = Bloodletting in early Chinese medicine and its relation to the origin of acupuncture | journal = Bulletin of the History of Medicine | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 337–67 | year = 1980 | pmid = 6998524 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The network concept was made up of acu-tracts, such as a line down the arms, where it said acupoints were located. Some of the sites acupuncturists use needles at today still have the same names as those given to them by the ''Yellow Emperor's Classic''.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|93}} Numerous additional documents were published over the centuries introducing new acupoints.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|101}} By the 4th century AD, most of the acupuncture sites in use today had been named and identified.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|101}}

===Early development in China===

====Establishment and growth====
In the first half of the 1st century AD, acupuncturists began promoting the belief that acupuncture's effectiveness was influenced by the time of day or night, the lunar cycle, and the season.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|140-141}} The Science of the Yin-Yang Cycles (''Yün Chhi Hsüeh'') was a set of beliefs that curing diseases relied on the alignment of both heavenly (thien) and earthly (ti) forces that were attuned to cycles like that of the sun and moon.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|140-141}} There were several different belief systems that relied on a number of celestial and earthly bodies or elements that rotated and only became aligned at certain times.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|140-141}} According to Needham and Gwei-djen, these "arbitrary predictions" were depicted by acupuncturists in complex charts and through a set of special terminology.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

Acupuncture needles during this period were much thicker than most modern ones and often resulted in infection. Infection is caused by a lack of sterilization, but at that time it was believed to be caused by use of the wrong needle, or needling in the wrong place, or at the wrong time.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|102-103}} Later, many needles were heated in boiling water, or in a flame. Sometimes needles were used while they were still hot, creating a [[cauterizing]] effect at the injection site.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|104}} Nine needles were recommended in the ''Chen Chiu Ta Chheng'' from 1601, which may have been because of an ancient Chinese belief that nine was a magic number.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|102-103}}

Other belief systems were based on the idea that the human body operated on a rhythm and acupuncture had to be applied at the right point in the rhythm to be effective.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|140-141}} In some cases a lack of balance between Yin and Yang were believed to be the cause of disease.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|140-141}}

In the 1st century AD, many of the first books about acupuncture were published and recognized acupuncturist experts began to emerge. The ''Zhen Jiu Jia Yi Jing'', which was published in the mid-3rd century, became the oldest acupuncture book that is still in existence in the modern era.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; Other books like the ''Yu Kuei Chen Ching'', written by the Director of Medical Services for China, were also influential during this period, but were not preserved.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; In the mid 7th century, [[Sun Simiao]] published acupuncture-related diagrams and charts that established standardized methods for finding acupuncture sites on people of different sizes and categorized acupuncture sites in a set of modules.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

Acupuncture became more established in China as improvements in paper led to the publication of more acupuncture books. The Imperial Medical Service and the Imperial Medical College, which both supported acupuncture, became more established and created medical colleges in every province.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{rp|129}} The public was also exposed to stories about royal figures being cured of their diseases by prominent acupuncturists.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{rp|129–135}} By time ''The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion'' was published during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644&amp;nbsp;AD), most of the acupuncture practices used in the modern era had been established.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;

====Decline====
By the end of the Song dynasty (1279&amp;nbsp;AD), acupuncture had lost much of its status in China.&lt;ref name=Barnes2005&gt;[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA25 25].&lt;/ref&gt; It became rarer in the following centuries, and was associated with less prestigious professions like [[alchemy]], [[shamanism]], [[midwifery]] and moxibustion.&lt;ref name="Barnes 2005 p. 25"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes LL | title=Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848 | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-674-01872-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA25 | access-date=21 July 2015 | page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, by the 18th century, scientific rationality was becoming more popular than traditional superstitious beliefs.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; By 1757 a book documenting the history of Chinese medicine called acupuncture a "lost art".&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|160}} Its decline was attributed in part to the popularity of prescriptions and medications, as well as its association with the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA188 188].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1822, the Chinese Emperor signed a decree excluding the practice of acupuncture from the Imperial Medical Institute.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; He said it was unfit for practice by gentlemen-scholars.&lt;ref name="Barnes 2005 p. 308"/&gt; In China acupuncture was increasingly associated with lower-class, illiterate practitioners.&lt;ref name="Barnes 2005 p. 58"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes LL | title=Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848 | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-674-01872-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA58 | access-date=14 July 2015 | page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was restored for a time, but banned again in 1929 in favor of science-based Western medicine. Although acupuncture declined in China during this time period, it was also growing in popularity in other countries.&lt;ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/&gt;

===International expansion===

Korea is believed to be the first country in Asia that acupuncture spread to outside of China.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; Within Korea there is a legend that acupuncture was developed by emperor [[Dangun]], though it is more likely to have been brought into Korea from a Chinese colonial prefecture in 514&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|262-263}} Acupuncture use was commonplace in Korea by the 6th century. It spread to Vietnam in the 8th and 9th centuries.&lt;ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/&gt; As Vietnam began trading with Japan and China around the 9th century, it was influenced by their acupuncture practices as well.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; China and Korea sent "medical missionaries" that spread traditional Chinese medicine to Japan, starting around 219&amp;nbsp;AD. In 553, several Korean and Chinese citizens were appointed to re-organize medical education in Japan and they incorporated acupuncture as part of that system.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|264}} Japan later sent students back to China and established acupuncture as one of five divisions of the Chinese State Medical Administration System.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|264-265}}

Acupuncture began to spread to Europe in the second half of the 17th century. Around this time the surgeon-general of the [[Dutch East India Company]] met Japanese and Chinese acupuncture practitioners and later encouraged Europeans to further investigate it.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|264-265}} He published the first in-depth description of acupuncture for the European audience and created the term "acupuncture" in his 1683 work ''De Acupunctura''.&lt;ref name="Singh Ernst 2008 p. 42"/&gt; France was an early adopter among the West due to the influence of Jesuit missionaries, who brought the practice to French clinics in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; The French doctor Louis Berlioz (the father of the composer [[Hector Berlioz]]) is usually credited with being the first to experiment with the procedure in Europe in 1810, before publishing his findings in 1816.&lt;ref name="Barnes 2005 p. 308"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes LL | title=Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848 | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-674-01872-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA308 | access-date=21 July 2015 | page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, acupuncture had become commonplace in many areas of the world.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{RP|295}} Americans and Britons began showing interest in acupuncture in the early 19th century but interest waned by mid century.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; Western practitioners abandoned acupuncture's traditional beliefs in spiritual energy, [[pulse diagnosis]], and the cycles of the moon, sun or the body's rhythm. Diagrams of the flow of spiritual energy, for example, conflicted with the West's own anatomical diagrams. It adopted a new set of ideas for acupuncture based on tapping needles into nerves.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;&lt;ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson 2011 p. 610"/&gt; In Europe it was speculated that acupuncture may allow or prevent the flow of electricity in the body, as electrical pulses were found to make a frog's leg twitch after death.&lt;ref name="Singh Ernst 2008 p. 42"/&gt;

The West eventually created a belief system based on Travell trigger points that were believed to inhibit pain. They were in the same locations as China's spiritually identified acupuncture points, but under a different nomenclature.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; The first elaborate Western treatise on acupuncture was published in 1683 by [[Willem ten Rhijne]].&lt;ref name="Barnes 2005 p. 75"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes LL | title=Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848 | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-674-01872-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA75 | access-date=14 July 2015 | page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Modern era ====

In China, the popularity of acupuncture rebounded in 1949 when [[Mao Zedong]] took power and sought to unite China behind traditional cultural values. It was also during this time that many Eastern medical practices were consolidated under the name traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).&lt;ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/&gt;

New practices were adopted in the 20th century, such as using a cluster of needles,&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{RP|164}} electrified needles, or leaving needles inserted for up to a week.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{RP|164}} A lot of emphasis developed on using acupuncture on the ear.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{RP|164}} Acupuncture research organizations were founded in the 1950s and acupuncture services became available in modern hospitals.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; China, where acupuncture was believed to have originated, was increasingly influenced by Western medicine.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; Meanwhile, acupuncture grew in popularity in the US. The US Congress created the Office of Alternative Medicine in 1992 and the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) declared support for acupuncture for some conditions in November 1997. In 1999, the [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health|National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] was created within the NIH. Acupuncture became the most popular alternative medicine in the US.&lt;ref name=Wang2008/&gt;

Politicians from the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] said acupuncture was superstitious and conflicted with the party's commitment to science.&lt;ref name=Crozier1968/&gt; Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong later reversed this position,&lt;ref name=Crozier1968&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Crozier RC |title= Traditional medicine in modern China: science, nationalism, and the tensions of cultural change |edition=1 |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |location= Cambridge |year=1968 |isbn=978-0674901056 |oclc= }}{{Page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that the practice was based on scientific principles.&lt;ref name=Taylor2011&gt;{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=K | title=Chinese Medicine in Early Communist China, 1945–63: a Medicine of Revolution | year=2005 | isbn=041534512X | publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, a ''New York Times'' reporter published an article on his acupuncture experiences in China, which led to more investigation of and support for acupuncture.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; The US President [[1972 Nixon visit to China|Richard Nixon visited China in 1972]].&lt;ref name="CSICOP"/&gt; During one part of the visit, the delegation was shown a patient undergoing major surgery while fully awake, ostensibly receiving acupuncture rather than [[anesthesia]].&lt;ref name="CSICOP"/&gt; Later it was found that the patients selected for the surgery had both a high [[pain tolerance]] and received heavy indoctrination before the operation; these demonstration cases were also frequently receiving [[morphine]] surreptitiously through an [[intravenous therapy|intravenous drip]] that observers were told contained only fluids and nutrients.&lt;ref name="CSICOP"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/china_conference_1/ |title=Traditional Medicine and Pseudoscience in China: A Report of the Second CSICOP Delegation (Part 1) | vauthors = Beyerstein BL, Sampson W |volume=20 |issue=4 |year=1996 |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004020227/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/china_conference_1/ |archive-date=4 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One patient receiving [[open heart surgery]] while awake was ultimately found to have received a combination of three powerful sedatives as well as large injections of a [[local anesthetic]] into the wound.&lt;ref name=Colquhoun2013/&gt; After the [[National Institute of Health]] expressed support for acupuncture for a limited number of conditions, adoption in the US grew further.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; In 1972 the first legal acupuncture center in the US was established in Washington DC&lt;ref name="JCIM_Lee"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jcimjournal.com/en/index.aspx/ |title=The first acupuncture center in the United States: an interview with Yao Wu Lee, Washington Acupuncture Center |first=AY |last=Fan |volume=20 |issue=5 |year=2012 |journal=[[Journal of Integrative Medicine]] |publisher=Committee for Journal of Chinese Integrative Medicine |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727004846/http://www.jcimjournal.com/en/index.aspx |archive-date=27 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973 the American [[Internal Revenue Service]] allowed acupuncture to be deducted as a medical expense.&lt;ref name="'70s 133"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York City|isbn= 0465041957|page= 133|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
{{Main|Regulation of acupuncture}}
There are various government and trade association regulatory bodies for acupuncture in the United Kingdom, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Japan, Canada, and in European countries and elsewhere. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends that before being licensed or certified, an acupuncturist receive 200 hours of specialized training if they are a physician and 2,500 hours for non-physicians; many governments have adopted similar standards.&lt;ref name="PybusCairns2004"/&gt;

The '''Andalusia Technology Park''' ({{lang-es|'''Parque Tecnológico de Andalucía''', '''PTA'''}}) in [[Málaga]] is a [[science park]].

The Parque Tecnológico de Andalucía was conceived as a technological nucleus to stimulate industry in [[Andalusia]]. This complex is one of the most important economic centres in the south of [[Spain]], with over 600 companies and 16,774 employees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pta.es/en/the_pta_in_numbers.cfm|title=The PTA in numbers - IDEA! Parque Tecnológico de Andalucía (PTA), Málaga|website=www.pta.es|language=en|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015.

The sectors with the greatest presence at the PTA are: Information Technology (Electronics, Information, Computing and Telecommunications) together with Engineering, Consultancy and Advisory services.  Most of the companies are focused on [[information technology]], [[telecommunications]], and [[research and development]]. They include some multinationals such as [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.surinenglish.com/20140207/news/costasol-malaga/workforce-very-positive-experience-201402071538.html|title="Our workforce has a very positive experience of being in Malaga".

{{Anthroposophy}}
'''Anthroposophic medicine''' (or '''anthroposophical medicine''') is a form of [[alternative medicine]].&lt;ref name=teils/&gt; Devised in the 1920s by [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861–1925) in conjunction with [[Ita Wegman]] (1876–1943), anthroposophical medicine is based on [[occult]] notions and draws on Steiner's [[spiritual philosophy]], which he called [[anthroposophy]]. Practitioners employ a variety of treatment techniques based upon anthroposophic precepts, including [[massage]], exercise, [[Counseling psychology|counselling]], and [[Anthroposophic pharmacy|substances]].&lt;ref name=ernstmist/&gt;

Many drug preparations used in anthroposophic medicine are ultra-diluted substances, similar to those used in [[homeopathy]]. Homeopathic remedies are not medically effective and are generally considered harmless, except when used as a substitute for a scientifically proven and effective cure.&lt;ref name=krit/&gt; In certain European countries, people with [[cancer]] are sometimes prescribed remedies made from specially harvested [[mistletoe]], but research has found no convincing [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence]] of clinical benefit.&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt;&lt;ref name="coch-2010"/&gt; Some anthroposophic doctors oppose childhood [[vaccination]], and this has led to preventable outbreaks of disease.&lt;ref name=measles/&gt;

Anthroposophic medicine departs from fundamental biological principles in several respects. For example, Steiner said that the [[heart]] does not [[pump]] [[blood]] but that blood propels itself along.&lt;ref name=Marinelli/&gt; Anthroposophic medicine also proposes that patients' [[past lives]] may influence their illness&lt;ref name=qw/&gt; and that the course of an illness is subject to [[karmic]] destiny.&lt;ref name=deadly/&gt; Professor of complementary medicine [[Edzard Ernst]] and other physicians and scientists including [[Simon Singh]] and [[David Gorski]] have characterized anthroposophic medicine as [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[quackery]]&lt;ref name=seop/&gt;&lt;ref name="thes-aberdeen"/&gt; with no basis in reason or logic.&lt;ref name=mckie/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gorski&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gorski |first1=David |title=A University of Michigan Medical School alumnus confronts anthroposophic medicine at his alma mater |url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-university-of-michigan-medical-school-alumnus-confronts-anthroposophic-medicine-at-his-alma-mater/ |website=Science-Based Medicine |accessdate=29 November 2018 |date=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ShermerEncyclopedia&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shermer |first1=Michael |title=The Skeptic encyclopedia of pseudoscience |date=2002 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=1576076539 |page=903 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&amp;pg=PA869&amp;lpg=PA869&amp;dq=dan+dugan+anthroposophy |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SinghBook"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Simon |title=Trick or treatment : the undeniable facts about alternative medicine |date=2009 |publisher=W.W.

===History===
[[File:Ita Wegman vor1900.jpg|thumb|200px|Ita Wegman, co-founder of the medical approach, before 1900 in Berlin.]]
The first steps towards an anthroposophic approach to [[medicine]] were made before 1920, when homeopathic physicians and pharmacists began working with Rudolf Steiner, who recommended new [[Anthroposophic Pharmacy|medicinal substances]] as well as specific methods for preparation along with an anthroposophic concept of man. In 1921, Ita Wegman opened the first anthroposophic medical [[clinic]], now known as the Klinik Arlesheim,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klinik-arlesheim.ch Ita Wegman Klinik] (German). Accessed 2007-12-26.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Arlesheim]], [[Switzerland]]. Wegman was soon joined by a number of other doctors. They then began to train the first anthroposophic [[nurse]]s for the clinic.

At Wegman's request, Steiner regularly visited the clinic and suggested treatment regimes for particular patients. Between 1920 and 1925, he also gave several series of lectures on medicine. In 1925, Wegman and Steiner wrote the first book on the anthroposophic approach to medicine, ''Fundamentals of Therapy''.

Wegman later opened a separate clinic and curative home in [[Ascona]]. Wegman lectured widely, visiting the [[Netherlands]] and [[England]] particularly frequently, and an increasing number of doctors began to include the anthroposophic approach in their practices. A cancer clinic, the Lukas Clinic, opened in Arlesheim in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lukasklinik.ch/cms.asp?IDN=133&amp;H='106'&amp;T=0&amp;Sprache=en Lukas Clinic]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630090414/http://www.lukasklinik.ch/cms.asp?IDN=133&amp;H=%27106%27&amp;T=0&amp;Sprache=en |date=June 30, 2006 }}. Accessed 2007-12-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 anthroposophic medicine in [[Germany]] got regulated by [[law]] as a specific therapeutic system ("Besondere Therapierichtung") by the Medicines Act-Arzneimittelgesetz (AMG) and by the Code of Social Law (Sozialgesetzbuch V)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nafkam-lovgivning.uit.no/anthroposophic-medicine-in-germany/ | title=Anthroposophic medicine in Germany | accessdate=2015-09-21 | date=2012-12-31 | work= NAFKAM's website on the regulation of Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) in 39 European/EU countries | publisher=NAFKAM }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s the [[Witten/Herdecke University]] in Germany established a [[Chair (academia)|chair]] in anthroposophical medicine. The [[News media|press]] described the appointment as a "death sentence" and the perception that pseudoscience was being taught damaged the [[university]]'s reputation, bringing it close to financial collapse. It was ultimately saved by a cash injection from [[Software AG]], a technology corporation with a history of funding anthroposophic projects.&lt;ref name=mckie&gt;{{cite news

|title=Holistic unit will 'tarnish' Aberdeen University reputation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, anthroposophical medicine was practised in 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kienle|first=Gunver|date=November 2013 |title=Anthroposophic Medicine: An Integrative Medical System Originating in Europe|pmc=3865373|journal=Global Advances in Health and Medicine|volume=2|pages=20–31|pmid=24416705|doi=10.7453/gahmj.2012.087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AM&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gunver Sophia Kienle|author2=Helmut Kiene|author3=Hans Ulrich Albonico|title=Anthroposophic Medicine: Effectiveness, Utility, Costs, Safety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4B99iUJPuYC&amp;pg=PP1|year=2006|publisher=Schattauer Verlag|isbn=978-3-7945-2495-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2013}}

In 2012 the [[University of Aberdeen]] considered establishing a chair in [[holistic health]] jointly funded by Software AG, and by the Anthroposophic Health, Education, and Social Care Movement, each of which would provide £1.5 million of endowment.&lt;ref name=mckie/&gt; [[Edzard Ernst]] commented "that any decent university should even consider an anthroposophical medicine unit seems incomprehensible. The fact that it would be backed by people who have a financial interest in this bogus approach makes it even worse."&lt;ref name=mckie/&gt; The University's governance and nominations committee eventually decided not to proceed with the appointment.&lt;ref name="thes-aberdeen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jump|first=Paul|date=11 May 2012|title=Aberdeen decides against alternative medicine chair|journal=Times Higher Education Supplement|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/419909.article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Categorization and conceptual basis===
The categorization of anthroposophical medicine is complex since in part it complements conventional medicine, and in part it substitutes for it.&lt;ref name=teils&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1159/000093481|title=Anthroposophische Medizin: Health Technology Assessment Bericht – Kurzfassung|year=2006|last1=Kienle|first1=Gunver S.|last2=Kiene|first2=Helmut|last3=Albonico|first3=Hans Ulrich|journal=Forschende Komplementärmedizin|volume=13|issue=2|pages=7–18|quote=teils ergänzend und teils ersetzend zur konventionellen Medizin}} ''Cited in'' {{cite journal|pmid=18540325|year=2008|last1=Ernst|first1=E|title=Anthroposophic medicine: A critical analysis|volume=150 Suppl 1|pages=1–6|journal=MMW Fortschritte der Medizin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Ernst wrote that it was being promoted as an "extension to conventional medicine".&lt;ref name=measles/&gt;

Ernst writes that Steiner used imagination and insight as a basis for his ideas, drawing mystical knowledge from the occult [[Akashic Records]], a work which is supposedly situated on the [[astral plane]], and which Steiner said was accessible to him via his intuitive powers.&lt;ref name=krit/&gt; On this basis, Steiner proposed "associations between four postulated dimensions of the human body (physical body, etheric body, astral body, and ego), plants, minerals, and the cosmos".&lt;ref name=ernstmist&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.39055.493958.80|title=Mistletoe as a treatment for cancer|year=2006|last1=Ernst|first1=E.|journal=BMJ|volume=333|issue=7582|pages=1282–3|pmid=17185706|pmc=1761165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner also proposed a connection betweens planets, metals and organs so that, for example, the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the element [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and the lung were all somehow associated. These propositions form the basis of anthroposophical medicine.&lt;ref name=krit/&gt;

Ernst has said that anthroposophical medicine "includes some of the least plausible theories one could possibly imagine",&lt;ref name=vatican&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.2042-7166.2007.tb04893.x|title=Anthroposophic Medicine|year=2010|last1=Ernst|first1=E|journal=Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies|volume=12|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; categorized it as "pure quackery",&lt;ref name="thes-aberdeen"/&gt; and said that it "has no basis in science".&lt;ref name=mckie/&gt; According to [[Quackwatch]], anthroposophical medicine practitioners regard illness as a "rite of passage" necessary to purge spiritual impurities carried over from past lives, according to the precepts of "karmic destiny".&lt;ref name=qw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/steiner.html|title=Rudolf Steiner's Quackery|last=Rawlings|first=Roger|publisher=[[QuackWatch]]|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

In [[anthroposophic pharmacy]] drugs are prepared according to ancient notions of [[alchemy]] and [[homeopathy]] which are not related to the science underlying modern [[pharmacology]].&lt;ref name=ernstmist/&gt; During the preparation process, patterns formed by crystallization are interpreted to see which "etheric force" they most closely resemble.&lt;ref name=seop&gt;{{cite book|first=Dan|last=Dugan|editor=Michael Shermer|title=Anthroposophy and Anthroposophical Medicine|work=The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&amp;pg=PA31|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-653-8|pages=31–32|date=2002-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most anthroposophic preparations are highly diluted, like homeopathic remedies. This means that, while they are completely harmless in themselves, using them in place of conventional medicine to treat serious illness carries a risk of severe adverse consequences.&lt;ref name=krit&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18540325|year=2008|last1=Ernst|first1=E|title=Anthroposophic medicine: A critical analysis|volume=150 Suppl 1|pages=1–6|journal=MMW Fortschritte der Medizin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as drug remedies, anthroposophical medicine also includes:&lt;ref name=ernstmist/&gt;

===Plant-derived treatments===
To select an anthroposophic substance for a particular illness, practitioners consider the source of the substances used. The character of a mineral, plant or animal is hypothesised to have been formed by the substances that are most active within it, in the belief that this character may also influence what the substance will accomplish when given to treat another organism. This is related to [[Samuel Hahnemann]]'s [[Doctrine of signatures]]. Willow, for example, is considered to have an unusual character:
{{Quote|... plants that grow near water are usually heavy, with big, dark green leaves that wilt and break easily. An exception is ... the white willow, a tree that always grows near water and loves light. However, unlike other "watery" plants, the willow has fine, almost dry leaves and looks very light ...  Its branches are unbelievably tough. They are elastic and cannot be broken. They bend easily and form "joints" rather than break. These few signatures can give us the clue to what salix can be used for therapeutically: arthritis, deformation of joints, swollen joints ...&lt;ref name=rob&gt;{{cite web

There is no scientific evidence that the shape of plants has ever caused a new medical property to be discovered.&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bennett |first=Bradley C. |year=2007 |title= Doctrine of Signatures: An Explanation of Medicinal Plant Discovery or Dissemination of Knowledge? |journal=Economic Botany |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=246–255 |url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1663%2F0013-0001(2007)61%5B246%3ADOSAEO%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |accessdate=2008-08-31 |quote= |doi=10.1663/0013-0001(2007)61[246:DOSAEO]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heart===
Steiner described the heart not as a [[pump]], but as a regulator of flow, such that the heartbeat itself can be distinguished from the circulation of blood.&lt;ref name=Marinelli/&gt;&lt;ref name="jarvis"&gt;William T. Jarvis [http://www.ncahf.org/articles/a-b/anthro.html Anthroposophical Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; Anthroposophic medicine claims the flow in the [[blood]] of the [[circulatory system]] is, as Marinelli put it, ''"propelled with its own biological momentum, as can be seen in the embryo, and boosts itself with ''induced'' momenta from the [[heart]]"''.&lt;ref name=Marinelli&gt;Marinelli, R., Fuerst, B., et al. [http://www.rsarchive.org/RelArtic/Marinelli/ "The Heart is not a Pump: A refutation of the pressure propulsion premise of heart function"], ''Frontier Perspectives'' 5(1), Fall-Winter 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Branko|title=The Heart and Circulation|date=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4471-5277-4|url=|ref=furst2014|oclc=868250054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of the heart is not based on any scientific theory and has been characterized as "crank science".&lt;ref name="jarvis"/&gt;

===Mistletoe treatment for cancer===

{{See also|List of unproven and disproven cancer treatments}}
Rudolf Steiner hypothesised that mistletoe could cure cancer, on the basis of the observation that the plant was a parasite which eventually killed its host, a process which he claimed paralleled the progression of cancer.&lt;ref name=ernstmist/&gt; Steiner believed the plant's medical potential was influenced by the position of the sun, moon and planets and that it therefore was important to harvest the plant at the right time.&lt;ref name=Olson2005&gt;{{cite book|author=James S. Olson|title=Bathsheba's Breast: Women, Cancer, and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gp9aMBieClMC&amp;pg=PA452|accessdate=1 September 2013|date=5 January 2005|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8064-3|page=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some mistletoe preparations are ultra-diluted; others are made from fermented mistletoe.&lt;ref name=ernstmist/&gt;  The most commonly used trade names for mistletoe drugs are Iscador and Helixor.&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt;

Although [[in vitro|laboratory]] experiments have suggested that mistletoe extract may affect the [[immune system]] and be able to kill some kinds of cancer cells, there is little [[evidence-based medicine|evidence]] of its benefit to people with cancer.&lt;ref name="coch-2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Horneber MA, Bueschel G, Huber R, Linde K, Rostock M |title=Mistletoe therapy in oncology |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD003297 |year=2008 |pmid=18425885 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003297.pub2 |type=Systematic review|quote=The review found that there was not enough evidence to reach clear conclusions about the effects on any of these outcomes and it is therefore not clear to what extent the application of mistletoe extracts translates into improved symptom control, enhanced tumour response or prolonged survival.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cancer.gov"/&gt; Most of the clinical research claiming that mistletoe therapy is effective is published in Germany, and it is generally considered unreliable because of major lapses in quality.&lt;ref name="cancer.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/mistletoe-pdq#section/_2 |title=Questions and Answers About Mistletoe |publisher=National Cancer Institute |accessdate=3 December 2015 |date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=xmas/&gt; Edzard Ernst wrote that research by anthroposophic doctors often reached positive conclusions on mistletoe therapy because it drew on unreliable material; independent researchers tended instead to find no evidence of benefit.&lt;ref name=ernstmist/&gt; The [[American Cancer Society]] says that "available evidence from well-designed clinical trials does not support claims that mistletoe can improve length or quality of life".&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |work=American Cancer Society Complete Guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=9780944235713 |editor=Ades TB |pages=424–428 |title=Mistletoe |quote=Available evidence from well-designed clinical trials does not support claims that mistletoe can improve length or quality of life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mistletoe-based cancer drugs are widely used in Europe, especially in German-speaking countries.&lt;ref name=xmas/&gt; In 2002 nearly half a million prescriptions were paid for by German health insurance and in 2006 there were reportedly around 30 types of mistletoe extract on the market.&lt;ref name=ernstmist/&gt;&lt;ref name=xmas/&gt;  Mistletoe extracts have been used as an unconventional treatment for cancer patients in the [[Netherlands]], and in Germany the treatment has been approved as [[palliative therapy]] to treat the symptoms of patients with malignant tumors.&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt; In Sweden, controversially, mistletoe therapy has been approved for use in the treatment of cancer symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://svenskfarmaci.se/lakemedel/unikt-klartecken-for-antroposofiskt-lakemedel/ "Unique green light for anthroposophical drug"], ''Svensk Farmaci''&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries mistletoe therapy is virtually unknown.&lt;ref name=xmas/&gt; The [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] has not approved mistletoe-based drugs for any purpose; mistletoe extracts may not be distributed in or imported into the US except for research purposes.&lt;ref name="cancer.gov"/&gt; {{asof|2015}}  no mistletoe-based drugs are licensed for use in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=ukmi&gt;{{citation |author=Johnson H |publisher=UK Medicines Information |title=What is the evidence for subcutaneous mistletoe extract in the treatment of cancer? |date=2 January 2015 |url=http://www.medicinesresources.nhs.uk/GetDocument.aspx?pageId=777217 |format=doc |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208125032/http://www.medicinesresources.nhs.uk/GetDocument.aspx?pageId=777217 |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 article on mistletoe in ''[[The Lancet#Specialty journals|Lancet Oncology]]'' invoked [[Ben Goldacre]]'s observation that a geographical preference for certain therapies was a hallmark of [[quackery]], and proposed that the continuing use of this "apparently ineffectual therapy" in a small cluster of countries was based on [[sociological]] rather than medical reasons, indicating a need for a more informed [[Informed consent|consent]] from patients.&lt;ref name=xmas&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Giorgio A, Stebbing J |title=Mistletoe: for cancer or just for Christmas? |journal=Lancet Oncol. |volume=14 |issue=13 |pages=1264–5 |year=2013 |pmid=24275128 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(13)70560-6 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immunization==
{{see also|Vaccine controversies}}

The risks arising from using anthroposophical medicine as a substitute for [[evidence-based medicine]] are exemplified by several cases of low vaccination levels in [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]],&lt;ref name=krit/&gt; since some anthroposophical doctors oppose [[immunization]].&lt;ref name=measles&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21102363|year=2011|last1=Ernst|first1=E|title=Anthroposophy: A risk factor for noncompliance with measles immunization|volume=30|issue=3|pages=187–9|doi=10.1097/INF.0b013e3182024274|journal=The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal |quote=Anthroposophic medicine was founded by Steiner and Ita Wegman in the early 20th century. Currently, it is being promoted as an extension of conventional medicine. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1999 study of children in Sweden showed that in [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]], only 18% had received [[MMR vaccine|MMR]] vaccination, compared to a level of 93% in other schools nationally.&lt;ref name=krit/&gt;

A 2003 report of a widespread measles outbreak around [[Coburg]], Germany, identified a [[Waldorf education|Waldorf school]] as the origin.&lt;ref name=krit/&gt; At the time the town's mayor had condemned homeopathic doctors who had discouraged vaccination, saying "Their stronghold is the Waldorf School, which actively encourages people not to have their children vaccinated. Now we have an epidemic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Offit]] writes that Steiner believed vaccination "interferes with karmic development and the cycles of reincarnation", and that adherence to this belief led to a 2008 [[pertussis]] outbreak in a Californian [[Waldorf education|Waldorf school]], causing its temporary closure.&lt;ref name=deadly&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul A.

&lt;!-- "Astrology" is an uncountable noun, and it is used as such throughout the lead. It is not meant to suggest a connection between unrelated astrological systems (eg. Chinese and Mayan), each of which could be referred to as "astrology". --&gt;
'''Astrology''' is the study of the movements and relative positions of [[celestial objects]] as a means of [[divination|divining]] information about human affairs and terrestrial events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Oxford University Press| title = astrology| encyclopedia = Oxford Dictionary of English| accessdate = 11 December 2015| url = https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/astrology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Merriam-Webster Inc.| title = astrology| encyclopedia = Merriam-Webster Dictionary| accessdate = 11 December 2015| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astrology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |first1=Nicholas |last1=Bunnin |first2=Jiyuan |last2=Yu |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2008 |p=57 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LdbxabeToQYC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=dictionary+philosophy+astrology#v=onepage&amp;q=dictionary%20philosophy%20astrology&amp;f=false|isbn=9780470997215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in [[Calendrical calculation|calendrical]] systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications.&lt;ref name="Koch-Westenholz 1995 Foreword, 11"&gt;{{cite book |last=Koch-Westenholz |first=Ulla |title=Mesopotamian astrology: an introduction to Babylonian and Assyrian celestial divination |year=1995 |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |location=Copenhagen |isbn=978-87-7289-287-0 |pages=Foreword, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some – such as the [[Hindu astrology|Indians]], [[Chinese astrology|Chinese]], and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] – developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. [[Western astrology]], one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th–17th century [[Common Era|BCE]] [[Mesopotamia]], from which it spread to [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], the [[Arab world]] and eventually [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Western Europe]]. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of [[horoscope]]s that purport to explain aspects of a person's [[personality]] and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;{{rp|83}}

From a 15th-century Welsh manuscript]]

Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and the [[Hindu astrology|Indians]], [[Chinese astrology|Chinese]], and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. In the West, astrology most often consists of a system of [[horoscope]]s purporting to explain aspects of a person's [[personality]] and predict future events in their life based on the positions of the sun, moon, and other celestial objects at the time of their birth. The majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;{{rp|83}}

Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium [[BCE]], with roots in [[Calendrical calculation|calendrical]] systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications.&lt;ref name="Koch-Westenholz 1995 Foreword, 11"/&gt; A form of astrology was practised in the first dynasty of [[Mesopotamia]] (1950–1651 BCE). Chinese astrology was elaborated in the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BCE). [[Hellenistic astrology]] after 332 BCE mixed [[Babylonian astrology]] with Egyptian [[Decans|Decanic astrology]] in [[Alexandria]], creating [[horoscopic astrology]]. [[Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's]] conquest of [[Asia]] allowed astrology to spread to [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. In Rome, astrology was associated with '[[Chaldea]]n wisdom'. After the conquest of Alexandria in the 7th century, astrology was taken up by Islamic scholars, and Hellenistic texts were translated into Arabic and Persian. In the 12th century, Arabic texts were imported to Europe and [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]]. Major astronomers including [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo]] practised as court astrologers. Astrological references appear in literature in the works of poets such as [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], and of playwrights such as [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[William Shakespeare]].

Throughout most of its history, astrology was considered a scholarly tradition. It was accepted in political and academic contexts, and was connected with other studies, such as [[astronomy]], [[alchemy]], [[meteorology]], and medicine.&lt;ref name="Kassell"/&gt; At the end of the 17th century, new scientific concepts in astronomy and physics (such as [[heliocentrism]] and [[classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]]) called astrology into question. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in astrology has largely declined.&lt;ref name="Brit"/&gt;

Scattered evidence suggests that the oldest known astrological references are copies of texts made in the ancient world. The [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]] is thought to be compiled in [[Babylon]] around 1700 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Hobson, ''THE EXACT TRANSMISSION OF TEXTS IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM B.C.E.'', Published PhD Thesis. Department of Hebrew, Biblical and Jewish Studies. University of Sydney. 2009 [http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/5404/1/r-hobson-2009-thesis.pdf PDF File]&lt;/ref&gt;  A scroll documenting an early use of [[electional astrology]] is doubtfully ascribed to the reign of the [[Sumer]]ian ruler [[Gudea of Lagash]] (c. 2144 – 2124 BCE). This describes how the gods revealed to him in a dream the constellations that would be most favourable for the planned construction of a temple.&lt;ref&gt;From scroll A of the ruler Gudea of Lagash, I 17 – VI 13. O. Kaiser, ''Texte aus der Umwelt des Alten Testaments'', Bd. 2, 1–3. Gütersloh, 1986–1991. Also quoted in A. Falkenstein, 'Wahrsagung in der sumerischen Überlieferung', ''La divination en Mésopotamie ancienne et dans les régions voisines''. Paris, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is controversy about whether these were genuinely recorded at the time or merely ascribed to ancient rulers by posterity. The oldest undisputed evidence of the use of astrology as an integrated system of knowledge is therefore attributed to the records of the first dynasty of [[Mesopotamia]] (1950–1651 BCE). This astrology had some parallels with [[Hellenistic]] Greek (western) astrology, including the zodiac, a norming point near 9 degrees in Aries, the trine aspect, planetary exaltations, and the dodekatemoria (the twelve divisions of 30 degrees each).&lt;ref name="Rochberg-Halton"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Elements of the Babylonian Contribution to Hellenistic Astrology | author=Rochberg-Halton, F. | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | year=1988 | volume=108 | issue=1 | pages=51–62 | jstor=603245 | doi=10.2307/603245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Babylonians viewed celestial events as possible signs rather than as causes of physical events.&lt;ref name="Rochberg-Halton"/&gt;

The system of [[Chinese astrology]] was elaborated during the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BCE) and flourished during the [[Han Dynasty]] (2nd century BCE to 2nd century CE), during which all the familiar elements of traditional Chinese culture – the Yin-Yang philosophy, theory of the five elements, Heaven and Earth, Confucian morality – were brought together to formalise the philosophical principles of Chinese medicine and divination, astrology and alchemy.&lt;ref name=Kistemaker /&gt;{{rp|3,4}}

==== Ancient objections ====

[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|upright|The Roman orator [[Cicero]] objected to astrology]]

[[Cicero]] stated the twins objection (that with close birth times, personal outcomes can be very different), later developed by [[Saint Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that since the other planets are much more distant from the earth than the moon, they could have only very tiny influence compared to the moon's.&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. pp.&amp;nbsp;173–174.&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that if astrology explains everything about a person's fate, then it wrongly ignores the visible effect of inherited ability and parenting, changes in health worked by medicine, or the effects of the weather on people.&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plotinus]] argued that since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on human affairs should depend on their position with respect to the zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] with a planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of its surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the moon is full to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Favorinus]] argued that it was absurd to imagine that stars and planets would affect human bodies in the same way as they affect the tides,&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates. [[Sextus Empiricus]] argued that it was absurd to link human attributes with myths about the signs of the zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carneades]] argued that belief in fate denies [[free will]] and [[morality]]; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Lament, Death, and Destiny | publisher=Peter Lang | author=Hughes, Richard | year=2004 | page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hellenistic Egypt ===
{{Main article|Hellenistic astrology}}

[[File:Quadritpartitum.jpg|thumb|upright|1484 copy of first page of [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy's]] ''Tetrabiblos'', translated into Latin by [[Plato of Tivoli]]|alt=Ptolemy's ''Tetrabiblos'', the Hellenistic text that founded Western astrology]]
In 525 BCE, [[Egypt]] was conquered by the Persians. The 1st century BCE Egyptian [[Dendera Zodiac]] shares two signs – the Balance and the Scorpion – with Mesopotamian astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 1994. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the occupation by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BCE, Egypt became [[Hellenistic]]. The city of [[Alexandria]] was founded by Alexander after the conquest, becoming the place where [[Babylonian astrology]] was mixed with Egyptian [[Decans|Decanic astrology]] to create [[Horoscopic astrology]]. This contained the Babylonian zodiac with its system of planetary [[exaltation (astrology)|exaltation]]s, the triplicities of the signs and the importance of eclipses. It used the Egyptian concept of dividing the zodiac into thirty-six decans of ten degrees each, with an emphasis on the rising decan, and the Greek system of planetary Gods, sign rulership and [[four elements]].&lt;ref&gt;Holden, 1996. pp.&amp;nbsp;11–13.&lt;/ref&gt; 2nd century BCE texts predict positions of planets in zodiac signs at the time of the rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 1994. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[astrologer]] and astronomer [[Ptolemy#Astrology|Ptolemy]] lived in Alexandria. Ptolemy's work the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'' formed the basis of Western astrology, and, "...enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more."&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, 1940. 'Introduction' p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece and Rome ===

The conquest of [[Asia]] by [[Alexander the Great]] exposed the Greeks to ideas from [[Syria]], Babylon, Persia and central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Campion, 2008. p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 280 BCE, [[Berossus]], a priest of [[Marduk|Bel]] from Babylon, moved to the Greek island of [[Kos]], teaching astrology and Babylonian culture.&lt;ref&gt;Campion, 2008. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1st century BCE, there were two varieties of astrology, one using [[horoscope]]s to describe the past, present and future; the other, [[theurgic]], emphasising the [[soul|soul's]] ascent to the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Campion, 2008. pp.&amp;nbsp;173–174.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek influence played a crucial role in the transmission of astrological theory to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref name=B32&gt;Barton, 1994. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first definite reference to astrology in Rome comes from the orator [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], who in 160 BCE warned farm overseers against consulting with Chaldeans,&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 1994. p.&amp;nbsp;32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; who were described as Babylonian 'star-gazers'.&lt;ref name=Campion227&gt;Campion, 2008. pp.&amp;nbsp;227–228.&lt;/ref&gt; Among both Greeks and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], Babylonia (also known as [[Chaldea]]) became so identified with astrology that 'Chaldean wisdom' became [[synonym]]ous with [[divination]] using planets and stars.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, 1983. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2nd-century Roman poet and satirist [[Juvenal]] complains about the pervasive influence of Chaldeans, saying, "Still more trusted are the Chaldaeans; every word uttered by the astrologer they will believe has come from [[Jupiter (mythology)|Hammon's]] fountain."&lt;ref&gt;[[Juvenal]], Satire 6: ''[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/juvenal_satires_06.htm The Ways of Women]'' (translated by G. G. Ramsay, 1918, retrieved 5 July 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first astrologers to bring [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] astrology to Rome was [[Thrasyllus of Mendes|Thrasyllus]], astrologer to the [[emperor]] [[Tiberius]],&lt;ref name="B32"/&gt; the first emperor to have had a court astrologer,&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 1994. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; though his predecessor [[Augustus]] had used astrology to help legitimise his [[Imperialism|Imperial]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 1994. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Hindu astrology}}

The main texts upon which classical Indian astrology is based are early medieval compilations, notably the ''[[Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra|{{IAST|Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra}}]]'', and ''[[Sārāvalī]]'' by {{IAST|Kalyāṇavarma}}.
The ''Horāshastra'' is a composite work of 71 chapters, of which the first part  (chapters 1–51) dates to the 7th to early 8th centuries and the second part (chapters 52–71) to the later 8th century. The ''Sārāvalī'' likewise dates to around 800 CE.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Pingree]], ''{{IAST|Jyotiḥśāstra}}'' (J. Gonda (Ed.)

In the seventh century, [[Isidore of Seville]] argued in his ''[[Etymologiae]]'' that astronomy described the movements of the heavens, while astrology had two parts: one was scientific, describing the movements of the sun, the moon and the stars, while the other, making predictions, was theologically erroneous.&lt;ref name=Wood5&gt;Wood, 1970. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Isidore&gt;{{cite book | title=Etymologiae | author=Isidore of Seville | year=c. 600 | pages=L, 82, col. 170}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[John Gower]] in the fourteenth century defined astrology as essentially limited to the making of predictions.&lt;ref name=Wood5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=3197718&amp;pageno=9 | title=Confessio Amantis | author=Gower, John | year=1390 | pages=VII, 670–84 | quote=Assembled with Astronomie / Is ek that ilke Astrologie / The which in juggementz acompteth / Theffect, what every sterre amonteth, / And hou thei causen many a wonder / To tho climatz that stonde hem under.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the stars was in turn divided into natural astrology, with for example effects on tides and the growth of plants, and judicial astrology, with supposedly predictable effects on people.&lt;ref name=Wood6&gt;Wood, 1970. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen148&gt;{{cite book | title=Star-crossed Renaissance | publisher=Duke University Press | author=Allen, Don Cameron | year=1941 | page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourteenth century sceptic [[Nicole Oresme]] however included astronomy as a part of astrology in his ''Livre de divinacions''.&lt;ref name=Wood8&gt;Wood, 1970. pp. 8–11&lt;/ref&gt; Oresme argued that current approaches to prediction of events such as plagues, wars, and weather were inappropriate, but that such prediction was a valid field of inquiry.

[[Renaissance]] scholars commonly practised astrology. [[Gerolamo Cardano]] cast the horoscope of king [[Edward VI of England]], while [[John Dee]] was the personal astrologer to queen [[Elizabeth I of England]].

France:Hadean Press&lt;/ref&gt; Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, as well as providing individual advice to everyone from monarchs downwards. Among other things, astrologers could advise on the best time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything—people, the world, the universe—was understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with [[religion]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;Cummins A (2012) The Starry Rubric: Seventeenth-Century English Astrology and Magic, p. 43–45.

== Principles and practice ==
Advocates have defined astrology as a symbolic language, an [[art]] form, a [[science]], and a method of divination.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica,' v.5, 1974, p. 916&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, Thomas: 'The Origin of Culture and Civilization,'' Phenix &amp; Phenix Literary Publicists, 2005, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; Though most cultural astrology systems share common roots in ancient philosophies that influenced each other, many use methods that differ from those in the West. These include Hindu astrology (also known as "Indian astrology" and in modern times referred to as "Vedic astrology") and Chinese astrology, both of which have influenced the world's cultural history.

=== Western ===
[[Western astrology]] is a form of [[divination]] based on the construction of a [[horoscope]] for an exact moment, such as a person's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Philip P. Wiener |title=Dictionary of the history of ideas |year=1974 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=978-0-684-13293-8 |url=http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=DicHist/uvaBook/tei/DicHist1.xml;brand=default;}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the tropical zodiac, which is aligned to the [[Equinox|equinoctial points]].&lt;ref&gt;James R. Lewis, 2003. ''The Astrology Book: the Encyclopedia of Heavenly Influences''. Visible Ink Press. Online at Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Western astrology is founded on the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies such as the Sun, Moon and planets, which are analysed by their movement through [[Astrological sign|signs]] of the [[zodiac]] (twelve spatial divisions of the [[ecliptic]]) and by their [[Astrological aspect|aspects]] (based on geometric angles) relative to one another. They are also considered by their placement in [[House (astrology)|houses]] (twelve spatial divisions of the sky).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hone |first=Margaret |title=The Modern Text-Book of Astrology |year=1978 |publisher=L. N. Fowler |location=Romford |isbn=978-0-85243-357-7 |pages=21–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astrology's modern representation in western popular media is usually reduced to [[sun sign astrology]], which considers only the zodiac sign of the Sun at an individual's date of birth, and represents only 1/12 of the total chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Riske |first=Kris |title=Llewellyn's Complete Book of Astrology |year=2007 |publisher=Llewellyn Publications |location=Minnesota, USA |isbn=978-0-7387-1071-6 |pages=5–6; 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The horoscope visually expresses the set of relationships for the time and place of the chosen event. These relationships are between the seven 'planets', signifying tendencies such as war and love; the twelve signs of the zodiac; and the twelve houses. Each planet is in a particular sign and a particular house at the chosen time, when observed from the chosen place, creating two kinds of relationship.&lt;ref name=Kremer&gt;{{cite journal | title=Horoscopes and History. by J. D. North; A History of Western Astrology. by S. J.

Along with [[tarot divination]], astrology is one of the core studies of [[Western esotericism]], and as such has influenced systems of [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] belief not only among Western esotericists and [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]], but also belief systems such as [[Wicca]] that have borrowed from or been influenced by the Western esoteric tradition. [[Tanya Luhrmann]] has said that "all magicians know something about astrology," and refers to a [[table of correspondences]] in [[Starhawk|Starhawk's]] ''[[The Spiral Dance]]'', organised by [[planets in astrology|planet]], as an example of the astrological lore studied by magicians.&lt;ref name="Luhrmann"&gt;{{cite book | title=Persuasions of the witch's craft: ritual magic in contemporary England | publisher=Harvard University Press | author=Luhrmann, Tanya | year=1991 | pages=147–151 | isbn=978-0-674-66324-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Details|Chinese zodiac}}
[[Chinese astrology]] has a close relation with [[Chinese philosophy]] (theory of the three harmonies: heaven, earth and man) and uses concepts such as [[yin and yang]], the [[Wu Xing|Five phases]], the 10 [[Celestial stem]]s, the 12 [[Earthly Branches]], and [[Chinese units of measurement|shichen]] (時辰 a form of timekeeping used for religious purposes).

The constellations of the Zodiac of western Asia and Europe were not used; instead the sky is divided into [[Chinese constellations|Three Enclosures]] (三垣 sān yuán), and [[Twenty-Eight Mansions]] (二十八宿 èrshíbā xiù) in twelve Ci ([[:zh:分野|十二次]]).&lt;ref&gt;F.

== Theological viewpoints ==
{{see also|Christian views on astrology|Jewish views on astrology|Muslim views on astrology}}

=== Ancient ===
[[St. Augustine]] (354{{ndash}}430) believed that the determinism of astrology conflicted with the Christian doctrines of man's free will and responsibility, and God not being the cause of evil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Magic and Divination at the Courts of Burgundy and France: Text and Context of Laurens Pignon's "Contre les Devineurs" (1411) | publisher=Brill | author=Veenstra, J.R. | year=1997 | isbn=978-90-04-10925-4|pages=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he also grounded his opposition philosophically, citing the failure of astrology to explain twins who behave differently although conceived at the same moment and born at approximately the same time.&lt;ref name=Hess&gt;{{cite book |last=Hess |first=Peter M.J. |title=Catholicism and science |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood |location=Westport |isbn=978-0-313-33190-9 |page=11 |edition=1st |author2=Allen, Paul L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval ===
[[File:Avicenna.jpg|thumb|upright|A drawing of Avicenna]]
Some of the practices of astrology were contested on theological grounds by medieval Muslim astronomers such as [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius), [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) and [[Avicenna]]. They said that the methods of astrologers conflicted with orthodox religious views of [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]], by suggesting that the Will of God can be known and predicted in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Saliba |first=George | authorlink=George Saliba | year=1994b | title=A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam | publisher=[[New York University Press]] | isbn=978-0-8147-8023-7 | pages=60, 67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Avicenna's 'Refutation against astrology', ''Risāla fī ibṭāl aḥkām al-nojūm'', argues against the practice of astrology while supporting the principle that planets may act as agents of divine causation. Avicenna considered that the movement of the planets influenced life on earth in a deterministic way, but argued against the possibility of determining the exact influence of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Catarina Belo, Catarina Carriço Marques de Moura Belo, ''Chance and determinism in Avicenna and Averroës'', p. 228. Brill, 2007. {{ISBN|90-04-15587-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, Avicenna did not deny the core dogma of astrology, but denied our ability to understand it to the extent that precise and fatalistic predictions could be made from it.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Saliba]], ''Avicenna'': 'viii. Mathematics and Physical Sciences'. Encyclopædia Iranica, Online Edition, 2011, available at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-viii&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]] (1292–1350), in his ''Miftah Dar al-SaCadah'', also used [[physics|physical]] arguments in astronomy to question the practice of judicial astrology.&lt;ref name=Livingston&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah: A Fourteenth Century Defense against Astrological Divination and Alchemical Transmutation | first=John W. | last=Livingston | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | volume=91 | issue=1 | year=1971 | pages=96–103 | doi=10.2307/600445| jstor=600445}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recognised that the [[star]]s are much larger than the [[planet]]s, and argued: &lt;blockquote&gt;And if you astrologers answer that it is precisely because of this distance and smallness that their influences are negligible, then why is it that you claim a great influence for the smallest heavenly body, Mercury? Why is it that you have given an influence to al-Ra's and [[al-Dhanab]], which are two imaginary points [ascending and descending nodes]?&lt;ref name=Livingston/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Confirmation bias]] is a form of [[cognitive bias]], a [[Psychology|psychological]] factor that contributes to belief in astrology.&lt;ref name="Allum"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allum |first=Nick |title=What Makes Some People Think Astrology Is Scientific? |journal=Science Communication |date=13 December 2010 |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=341–366 |doi=10.1177/1075547010389819 |quote=This underlies the ''Barnum effect''. Named after the 19th-century showman Phileas T. Barnum—whose circus provided "a little something for everyone"—it refers to the idea that people believe a statement about their personality that is vague or trivial if they think it derives from some systematic procedure tailored especially for them (Dickson &amp; Kelly, 1985; Furnham &amp; Schofield, 1987; Rogers &amp; Soule, 2009; Wyman &amp; Vyse, 2008). For example, the more birth detail is used in an astrological prediction or horoscope, the more credulous people tend to be (Furnham, 1991).

=== Demarcation ===

Under the criterion of [[falsifiability]], first proposed by the [[philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]], astrology is a pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=PopperStanford&gt;{{cite web |authors=Stephen Thornton, Edward N. Zalta (older edition)|title=Karl Popper|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper regarded astrology as "pseudo-empirical" in that "it appeals to observation and experiment," but "nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards."&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;{{cite book |last=Popper |first=Karl |title=Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-28594-0 |edition=Reprinted‌}}

In contrast to Popper, the philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Peter |title=Astrology and Science in Seventeenth-Century England |journal=Social Studies of Science |year=1975 |pages=399–422 | doi = 10.1177/030631277500500402 |pmid=11610221 |volume=5|issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|401}} Kuhn thought that, though astrologers had, historically, made predictions that categorically failed, this in itself does not make astrology unscientific, nor do attempts by astrologers to explain away failures by claiming that creating a horoscope is very difficult. Rather, in Kuhn's eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to [[medieval medicine]]; astrologers followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,&lt;ref name=Kuhn /&gt;{{rp|8}} and so "they had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise."&lt;ref name=Wright /&gt;{{rp|401;}}&lt;ref name=Kuhn&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|title=Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science [held at Bedford College, Regent's Park, London, from July 11th to 17th 1965] |year=1970 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-09623-2 |edition=Reprint |editor=[[Imre Lakatos]] |editor2=[[Alan Musgrave]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} While an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological [[hypothesis]] in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.&lt;ref name=Kuhn /&gt;{{rp|8}}

The philosopher [[Paul Thagard]] asserts that astrology cannot be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative.&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;{{rp|228}} To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience is that the state-of-the-art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be "selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations."&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;{{rp|227–228}} Progress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years.&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;{{rp|228}}&lt;ref name=Hurley /&gt;{{rp|549}} To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in [[normal science]] believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the "many unsolved problems," and in the face of better alternative theories (psychology). For these reasons Thagard views astrology as pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurley&gt;{{cite book |last=Hurley|first=Patrick|title=A concise introduction to logic |year=2005 |publisher=Wadsworth |location=Belmont, Calif.|isbn=978-0-534-58505-1|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|228}}

For the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.&lt;ref name=EdwardJ /&gt;{{rp|34}}

{{quote|What if throughout astrological writings we meet little appreciation of coherence, blatant insensitivity to evidence, no sense of a hierarchy of reasons, slight command over the contextual force of critieria, stubborn unwillingness to pursue an argument where it leads, stark naivete concerning the effiacacy of explanation and so on? In that case, I think, we are perfectly justified in rejecting astrology as irrational.&amp;nbsp;... Astrology simply fails to meet the multifarious demands of legitimate reasoning."|Edward W.

=== Effectiveness ===

Astrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in [[Experiment|controlled studies]] and has no scientific validity.&lt;ref name="Cosmic"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jeffrey Bennett |author2=Megan Donohue |author3=Nicholas Schneider |author4=Mark Voit |title=The cosmic perspective |year=2007 |publisher=Pearson/Addison-Wesley |location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-8053-9283-8 |pages=82–84 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|85;}}&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt; Where it has made [[falsifiable]] predictions under [[Scientific control|controlled conditions]], they have been falsified.&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt;{{rp|424}} One famous experiment included 28 astrologers who were asked to match over a hundred natal charts to psychological profiles generated by the [[California Psychological Inventory]] (CPI) questionnaire.&lt;ref name=Muller&gt;{{cite web|last=Muller |first=Richard |title=Web site of Richard A.

In 1955, the astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin stated that though he had failed to find evidence that supported indicators like [[Astrological signs|zodiacal signs]] and [[Astrological aspects|planetary aspects]] in astrology, he did find positive correlations between the [[Diurnal motion|diurnal positions]] of some [[Planets in astrology|planets]] and success in professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets.&lt;ref name=Pont&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pont |first=Graham |title=Philosophy and Science of Music in Ancient Greece |journal=Nexus Network Journal |year=2004 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=17–29 |doi=10.1007/s00004-004-0003-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gauquelin-1955"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gauquelin |first=Michel |title=L'influence des astres: étude critique et expérimentale |year=1955 |publisher=Éditions du Dauphin |location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the [[natal chart]]s of successful athletes and became known as the ''[[Mars effect]]''.&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll|first=Robert Todd|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions |year=2003 |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=978-0-471-27242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213}} A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence.&lt;ref name=Carroll /&gt;{{rp|213–214}} They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.&lt;ref name=Benski&gt;{{cite book |last=Benski |first=Claude|others=with a commentary by [[Jan Willem Nienhuys]] |title=The "Mars Effect: A French Test of over 1,000 Sports Champions |year=1995 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, NY |isbn=978-0-87975-988-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin. The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession.  The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower, indicating that parents choose dates and times to suit their beliefs. The sample group was taken from a time where belief in astrology was more common. Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations, where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information.&lt;ref name=CritThink/&gt;{{rp|116}}

Dean, a scientist and former astrologer, and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted a large scale scientific test that involved more than one hundred [[cognitive]], [[behavioural]], [[physiology|physical]], and other variables—but found no support for astrology.&lt;ref name=FailToPredict&gt;{{cite news |last=Matthews |first=Robert |title=Astrologers fail to predict proof they are wrong |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1439101/Astrologers-fail-to-predict-proof-they-are-wrong.html |accessdate=13 July 2012 |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=17 August 2003 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Geoffrey /&gt; Furthermore, a [[meta-analysis]] pooled 40 studies that involved 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests—which involved 300 participants—had the astrologers pick the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others that were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually three to five others). When date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results suggested there was any preferred chart.&lt;ref name=Geoffrey&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is Astrology Relevant to Consciousness and Psi? |author=Dean G. |author2=Kelly, I. W. |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |year=2003 |volume=10 |issue=6–7 |pages=175–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|190}}

=== Lack of mechanisms and consistency ===

Testing the validity of astrology can be difficult, because there is no consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict.&lt;ref name=Cosmic /&gt;{{rp|83}} Most professional astrologers are paid to predict the future or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.&lt;ref name="Cosmic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eysenck1982"/&gt;{{rp|83}}

Many astrologers claim that astrology is scientific,&lt;ref name=ChrisFrench&gt;{{cite news |last=Chris |first=French |title=Astrologers and other inhabitants of parallel universes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/07/astrologers-parallel-universes |publisher=The Guardian |work=7 February 2012 |accessdate=8 July 2012 |location=London |date=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some have proposed conventional [[Causality|causal agent]]s such as [[electromagnetism]] and [[gravity]].&lt;ref name=ChrisFrench/&gt; Scientists reject these mechanisms as implausible&lt;ref name=ChrisFrench /&gt; since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances.&lt;ref name=Shermer&gt;{{cite book |last=editor |first=Michael Shermer |title=The Skeptic encyclopedia of pseudoscience |year=2002 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, California |isbn=978-1-57607-653-8 |page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western astrology has taken the earth's [[Precession#Axial precession (precession of the equinoxes)|axial precession (also called precession of the equinoxes)]] into account since Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'', so the 'first point of Aries', the start of the astrological year, continually moves against the background of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Tester, 1999. Page 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated [[Astrological sign|sign]], astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations.&lt;ref name=Charpak /&gt; Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being "...empty boxes that have nothing to do with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars."&lt;ref name=Charpak/&gt; Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made, by the same astrologers, to the [[Age of Aquarius]], which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius.&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt;

Astrologers usually have only a small knowledge of astronomy, and often do not take into account basic principles—such as the precession of the equinoxes, which changes the position of the sun with time. They commented on the example of [[Élizabeth Teissier]], who claimed that, "The sun ends up in the same place in the sky on the same date each year," as the basis for claims that two people with the same birthday, but a number of years apart, should be under the same planetary influence. Charpak and Broch noted that, "There is a difference of about twenty-two thousand miles between Earth's location on any specific date in two successive years," and that thus they should not be under the same influence according to astrology. Over a 40 years period there would be a difference greater than 780,000 miles.&lt;ref name=Charpak&gt;{{cite book |last=Charpak |first=Georges |title=Debunked!: ESP, telekinesis, and other pseudoscience |journal=Physics Today |volume=58 |issue=5 |year=2004 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=978-0-8018-7867-1 |author2=Holland, Henri Broch |others=translated by Bart K. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpnWcMzeh8oC&amp;q=astrology#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=6, 7|bibcode=2005PhT....58e..67C |doi=10.1063/1.1995751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western politics and society ===

In the West, political leaders have sometimes consulted astrologers. For example, the British intelligence agency [[MI5]] employed [[Louis de Wohl]] as an astrologer after claims surfaced that [[Adolf Hitler]] used astrology to time his actions. The War Office was "...interested to know what Hitler's own astrologers would be telling him from week to week."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JrdVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5bADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6779,6948658&amp;dq=hitler-astrologer&amp;hl=en | title=The Strange Story Of Britain's "State Seer" | publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=30 August 1952 | accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, de Wohl's predictions were so inaccurate that he was soon labelled a "complete charlatan," and later evidence showed that Hitler considered astrology "complete nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/mar/04/nationalarchives.secondworldwar | title=Star turn: astrologer who became SOE's secret weapon against Hitler | publisher=The Guardian | date=4 March 2008 | accessdate=21 July 2012 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[John Hinckley|John Hinckley's]] [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|attempted assassination]] of US President [[Ronald Reagan]], first lady [[Nancy Reagan]] commissioned astrologer [[Joan Quigley]] to act as the secret White House astrologer.

There was a boom in interest in astrology in the late 1960s. The sociologist [[Marcello Truzzi]] described three levels of involvement of "Astrology-believers" to account for its revived popularity in the face of scientific discrediting. He found that most astrology-believers did not claim it was a scientific explanation with predictive power. Instead, those superficially involved, knowing "next to nothing" about astrology's 'mechanics', read newspaper astrology columns, and could benefit from "tension-management of anxieties" and "a cognitive belief-system that transcends science."&lt;ref name=Truzzi&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Occult Revival as Popular Culture: Some Random Observations on the Old and the Nouveau Witch | author=Truzzi, Marcello | journal=The Sociological Quarterly | year=1972 | volume=13 | issue=1 | pages=16–36 | jstor=4105818 | doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1972.tb02101.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those at the second level usually had their horoscopes cast and sought advice and predictions. They were much younger than those at the first level, and could benefit from knowledge of the language of astrology and the resulting ability to belong to a coherent and exclusive group. Those at the third level were highly involved and usually cast horoscopes for themselves. Astrology provided this small minority of astrology-believers with a "''meaningful'' view of their universe and [gave] them an ''understanding'' of their place in it."{{efn|Italics in original.}} This third group took astrology seriously, possibly as a ''sacred canopy'', whereas the other two groups took it playfully and irreverently.&lt;ref name=Truzzi/&gt;

In 1953, the sociologist [[Theodor W. Adorno]] conducted a study of the astrology column of a Los Angeles newspaper as part of a project examining mass culture in capitalist society.&lt;ref name=Nederman&gt;{{cite journal|title=Popular Occultism and Critical Social Theory: Exploring Some Themes in Adorno's Critique of Astrology and the Occult|journal=Sociological Analysis|date=Winter 1981|volume=42|author1=Cary J.

A 2005 [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll and a 2009 survey by the [[Pew Research Center]] reported that 25% of US adults believe in astrology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/16915/Three-Four-Americans-Believe-Paranormal.aspx |title=Three in Four Americans Believe in Paranormal |last=Moore |first=David W. |publisher=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] |date=16 June 2005 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2009/12/09/many-americans-mix-multiple-faiths/#eastern-or-new-age-beliefs-evil-eye |work=Many Americans Mix Multiple Faiths |title=Eastern or New Age Beliefs, 'Evil Eye' |date=9 December 2009 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center|Pew Research Center's]] Religion &amp; Public Life Project |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to data released in the [[National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation's]] 2014 ''Science and Engineering Indicators'' study, "Fewer Americans rejected astrology in 2012 than in recent years."&lt;ref name=NSF&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind14/index.cfm/chapter-7/c7h.htm |title=Science and Engineering Indicators: Chapter 7.Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding |publisher=National Science Foundation|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSF study noted that in 2012, "slightly more than half of Americans said that astrology was 'not at all scientific,' whereas nearly two-thirds gave this response in 2010. The comparable percentage has not been this low since 1983."&lt;ref name=NSF /&gt;

In India, there is a long-established and widespread belief in astrology. It is commonly used for daily life, particularly in matters concerning marriage and career, and makes extensive use of [[electional astrology|electional]], [[horary astrology|horary]] and [[karmic astrology]].&lt;ref name="wideind"&gt;{{Cite news|title=BV Raman Dies |publisher=New York Times, 23 December 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/23/world/bangalore-venkata-raman-indian-astrologer-dies-at-86.html |accessdate= 12 May 2009 |first=Michael T. |last=Kaufman |date=23 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fof"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fame and Fortune |author=Dipankar Das |url=https://www.lifepositive.com/fame-and-fortune/ |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian politics have also been influenced by astrology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/428081.stm | title=Soothsayers offer heavenly help | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=21 July 2012 | date=2 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still considered a branch of the [[Vedanga]].&lt;ref&gt;"In countries such as India, where only a small intellectual elite has been trained in Western physics, astrology manages to retain here and there its position among the sciences."

On February 2011, the [[Bombay High Court]] reaffirmed astrology's standing in India when it dismissed a case that challenged its status as a science.&lt;ref&gt;'Astrology is a science: Bombay HC', [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Astrology-is-a-science-Bombay-HC/articleshow/7418795.cms The Times of India], 3 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], strong belief in astrology has led to dramatic changes in the fertility rate and the number of abortions in the years of ''Fire Horse''. Adherents believe that women born in [[Bingwu|''hinoeuma'']] years are unmarriageable and bring bad luck to their father or husband. In 1966, the number of babies born in Japan dropped by over 25% as parents tried to avoid the stigma of having a daughter born in the hinoeuma year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=1bTGN21ev2MC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=hinoeuma | title=Japanese childrearing: two generations of scholarship | year=1996 | accessdate=22 July 2012| isbn=9781572300811 | last1=Shwalb | first1=David W. | last2=Shwalb | first2=Barbara J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=uAOrAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=hinoeuma | title=The Political Economy of Japan: Cultural and social dynamics | year=1992 | accessdate=22 July 2012| isbn=9780804719919 | last1=Kumon | first1=Shumpei | last2=Rosovsky | first2=Henry }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature and music ===

[[File:Woman in the Moon.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Title page of [[John Lyly|John Lyly's]] astrological play, ''The Woman in the Moon'', 1597]]

The fourteenth-century English poets [[John Gower]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] both referred to astrology in their works, including Gower's ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' and Chaucer's ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;ref name=Wedel/&gt; Chaucer commented explicitly on astrology in his ''Treatise on the Astrolabe'', demonstrating personal knowledge of one area, judicial astrology, with an account of how to find the ascendant or rising sign.&lt;ref name=WoodAstrolabe&gt;Wood, 1970. pp.12–21&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fifteenth century, references to astrology, such as with [[simile]]s, became "a matter of course" in English literature.&lt;ref name=Wedel&gt;{{cite book | title=Mediæval Attitude Toward Astrology, Particularly in England | publisher=Kessinger | author=Wedel, Theodore Otto | year=2003 | origyear=1920 | pages=131–156 | chapter=9: Astrology in Gower and Chaucer | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9lVQVyb9M4C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=%22Confessio+Amantis%22+Gower+astrology#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Confessio%20Amantis%22%20Gower%20astrology&amp;f=false | quote=The literary interest in astrology, which had been on the increase in England throughout the fourteenth century, culminated in the works of Gower and Chaucer. Although references to astrology were already frequent in the romances of the fourteenth century, these still retained the signs of being foreign importations. It was only in the fifteenth century that astrological similes and embellishments became a matter of course in the literature of England.&lt;br&gt;Such innovations, one must confess, were due far more to Chaucer than to Gower. Gower, too, saw artistic possibilities in the new astrological learning, and promptly used these in his retelling of the Alexander legend—but he confined himself, for the most part, to a bald rehearsal of facts and theories. It is, accordingly, as a part of the long encyclopaedia of natural science that he inserted into his ''Confessio Amantis'', and in certain didactic passages of the ''Vox Clamantis'' and the ''Mirour de l'Omme'', that Astrology figures most largely in his works&amp;nbsp;... Gower's sources on the subject of astrology&amp;nbsp;... were Albumasar's ''Introductorium in Astronomiam'', the Pseudo-Aristotelian ''Secretum Secretorum'', Brunetto Latini's ''Trésor'', and the ''Speculum Astronomiae'' ascribed to Albert the Great.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixteenth century, John Lyly's 1597 play, ''The Woman in the Moon'', is wholly motivated by astrology,&lt;ref name=DeLacy&gt;{{cite journal | title=Astrology in the Poetry of Edmund Spenser | author=De Lacy, Hugh | journal=The Journal of English and Germanic Philology |date=October 1934 | volume=33 | issue=4 | pages=520–543 | jstor=27703949}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Christopher Marlowe]] makes astrological references in his plays ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' and ''[[Tamburlaine]]'' (both c. 1590),&lt;ref name=DeLacy/&gt; and [[Sir Philip Sidney]] refers to astrology at least four times in his [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] ''[[The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia]]'' (c. 1580).&lt;ref name=DeLacy/&gt; [[Edmund Spenser]] uses astrology both decoratively and causally in his poetry, revealing "...unmistakably an abiding interest in the art, an interest shared by a large number of his contemporaries."&lt;ref name=DeLacy/&gt; [[George Chapman|George Chapman's]] play, ''[[The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron|Byron's Conspiracy]]'' (1608), similarly uses astrology as a causal mechanism in the drama.&lt;ref name=Camden&gt;{{cite journal | title=Astrology in Shakespeare's Day | author=Camden Carroll, Jr. | journal=Isis |date=April 1933 | volume=19 | issue=1 | pages=26–73 | jstor=225186 | doi=10.1086/346721}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] attitude towards astrology is unclear, with contradictory references in plays including ''[[King Lear]]'', ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', and ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]''.&lt;ref name=Camden/&gt; Shakespeare was familiar with astrology and made use of his knowledge of astrology in nearly every play he wrote,&lt;ref name=Camden/&gt; assuming a basic familiarity with the subject in his commercial audience.&lt;ref name=Camden/&gt; Outside theatre, the physician and mystic [[Robert Fludd]] practised astrology, as did the quack doctor Simon Forman.&lt;ref name=Camden/&gt; In Elizabethan England, "The usual feeling about astrology&amp;nbsp;...

In seventeenth century Spain, [[Lope de Vega]], with a detailed knowledge of astronomy, wrote plays that ridicule astrology. In his pastoral romance ''La Arcadia'' (1598), it leads to absurdity; in his novela ''Guzman el Bravo'' (1624), he concludes that the stars were made for man, not man for the stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Attitude of Lope de Vega toward Astrology and Astronomy | author=Halstead, Frank G. | journal=Hispanic Review | volume=7 |issue=3 |date=July 1939 |pages=205–219 |jstor=470235 | doi=10.2307/470235}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]] wrote the 1641 comedy ''Astrologo Fingido'' (The Pretended Astrologer); the plot was borrowed by the French playwright [[Thomas Corneille]] for his 1651 comedy ''Feint Astrologue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Calderon's Astrologo Fingido in France |author=Steiner, Arpad | journal=Modern Philology | volume=24 |issue=1 |date=August 1926 |pages=27–30 |jstor=433789 | doi=10.1086/387623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous piece of music influenced by astrology is the orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]''. Written by the British composer [[Gustav Holst]] (1874–1934), and first performed in 1918, the framework of ''The Planets'' is based upon the astrological symbolism of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;Campion, Nicholas.:''A History of Western Astrology: Volume II: The Medieval and Modern Worlds''. (Continuum Books, 2009) pp.&amp;nbsp;244–245 {{ISBN|978-1-84725-224-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the seven movements of the suite is based upon a different planet, though the movements are not in the order of the planets from the Sun. The composer [[Colin Matthews]] wrote an eighth movement entitled ''Pluto, the Renewer'', first performed in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=6045052 | title='Pluto the Renewer' is no swan song | publisher=National Public Radio (NPR) | date=10 September 2006 | accessdate=13 June 2013 | author=Adams, Noah}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, another British composer, [[Constant Lambert]], wrote a ballet on astrological themes, called ''[[Horoscope (ballet)|Horoscope]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashtonarchive.com/ballets/1938.htm |title=Frederick Ashton and His Ballets 1938 |publisher=Ashton Archive |year=2004 |accessdate=2 August 2016 |author=Vaughan, David |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050514074649/http://www.ashtonarchive.com/ballets/1938.htm |archivedate=14 May 2005 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the New Zealand composer [[Edwin Carr (composer)|Edwin Carr]] wrote ''The Twelve Signs: An Astrological Entertainment'' for orchestra without strings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sounz.org.nz/works/show/10611 | title=The Twelve Signs: An Astrological Entertainment | publisher=Centre for New Zealand Music | accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camille Paglia]] acknowledges astrology as an influence on her work of literary criticism ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille. ''Sex, Art, and American Culture: Essays''. Penguin Books, 1992, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrology features strongly in [[Eleanor Catton|Eleanor Catton's]] ''[[The Luminaries]]'', recipient of the [[2013 Man Booker Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Catton |first1=Eleanor |authorlink=Eleanor Catton |title=Eleanor Catton on how she wrote The Luminaries |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/11/eleanor-catton-luminaries-how-she-wrote-booker-prize |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=10 December 2015|date=2014-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences''', abbreviated '''BITSS''', is an academic initiative dedicated to advancing [[transparency]] and openness in [[social science]] research. It was established in 2012 by the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s [[Center for Effective Global Action]]. It is led by an interdisciplinary group of academics from ten different universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bitss.org/about/ |title=About |date=2015-10-08 |website=Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences |language=en-US |access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has worked with the [[Center for Open Science]] to define and promote a set of best practices for social scientists to maximize transparency in their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Miguel |first=E. |last2=Camerer |first2=C. |last3=Casey |first3=K. |last4=Cohen |first4=J. |last5=Esterling |first5=K.

'''Borderless selling''' is the process of [[selling]] services to clients outside the country of origin of services through modern methods which eliminate the actions specifically designed to hinder [[international trade]]. International trade through "borderless selling" is a new phenomenon born in the current "[[globalization]]" era.

==Definitions==
'''Borderless selling''' is defined as the process of performing [[sales]] transaction between two or more parties from different countries (an [[exporter]] and an [[importer]]) which is free from actions specifically designed to hinder [[international trade]], such as [[tariff barrier]]s, [[currency restriction]]s, and [[import quota]]s.

==Background==
[[International trade]] which is the exchange of goods and services across international borders has been present throughout much of history of [[economics]], [[society]] and [[politics]]. 

It is assumed that [[offshore outsourcing]] gave birth to "borderless selling". The selling of services by [[offshore outsourcing]] service providers to foreign clients is free from actions specifically designed to hinder international trade, such as tariff barriers, currency restrictions, and import quotas. This is largely because most of the services are sold or delivered electronically from the offshore service provider to the foreign client. This phenomenon gave birth to borderless selling.

There is a high correlation between outsourcing and exporting activity. However, borderless selling is different from free international trade or selling. Under the belief in [[Mercantilism]], most nations had high tariffs and many restrictions on international trade for centuries. In the 19th century, a belief in free trade became paramount in west, especially in Britain and this outlook has since then dominated the thinking of [[western nations]]. Traditionally international trade was possible between only those countries which regulated international trade through [[bilateral treaty|bilateral treaties]]. Borderless selling is possible between any two countries of the world because services can be exported using modern telecommunication networks without the need to regulate trade.

The "borderless selling" term was originated as part of the research carried out by team led by Paramjeev Singh Sethi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11727">The '''Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Project''' ('''BPP''') was a [[research project]] funded by [[NASA]] from 1996-2002 to study various proposals for [[Revolutionary technology|revolutionary]] methods of [[spacecraft propulsion]] that would require breakthroughs in physics before they could be realized.&lt;ref name="millis2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Millis|first1=Mark G.|title=Assessing Potential Propulsion Breakthroughs|journal=New Trends in Astrodynamics and Applications 2: an International Conference; 3-5 Jun. 2005; Princeton, NJ; United States|volume=1065|pages=441|date=Dec 1, 2005|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20060000022.pdf|accessdate=8 February 2018|bibcode=2005NYASA1065..441M|doi=10.1196/annals.1370.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=edited by Marc G.

During its six years of operational funding, this program received a total investment of $1.2 million.  

The Breakthrough Propulsion Physics project addressed a selection of “incremental and affordable” research questions towards the overall goal of propellantless propulsion, hyperfast travel, and breakthrough propulsion methods.&lt;ref name="millis20042" /&gt; It selected and funded five external projects, two in-house tasks and one
minor grant.&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3"/&gt;
At the end of the project, conclusions into fourteen topics, including these funded projects, were summarized by program manager Marc G. Millis.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt; Of these, six research avenues were found to be nonviable, four were identified as opportunities for continued research, and four remain unresolved.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="millis20042"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Millis|first1=Mark G.|date=2004|title=Prospects for Breakthrough Propulsion From Physics|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040070788.pdf|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-viable approaches==
One in-house experiment tested the Schlicher thruster antenna, claimed by Schlicher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schlicher|first1=R|last2=Biggs|first2=A|last3=Tedeschi|first3=W|title=Mechanical propulsion from unsymmetrical magnetic induction fields|journal=31st Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit|page=2643|doi=10.2514/6.1995-2643|url=https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1995-2643|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; to generate thrust.  No thrust was observed.&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fralick|first1=Gustave|last2=Niedra|first2=Janis|title=Experimental results of Schlicher's thrusting antenna|journal=37th Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit|date=Nov 1, 2001|doi=10.2514/6.2001-3657|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20020009088.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another experiment examined a gravity shielding mechanism claimed by Podkletnov and Nieminen.&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podkletnov|first1=E.|last2=Nieminen|first2=R.|title=A possibility of gravitational force shielding by bulk YBa2Cu3O7−x superconductor|journal=Physica C: Superconductivity|date=December 1992|volume=203|issue=3–4|pages=441–444|doi=10.1016/0921-4534(92)90055-H|bibcode=1992PhyC..203..441P}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experimental investigation on the BPPP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertson|first1=Tony|last2=Lichford|first2=Ron|last3=Peters|first3=Randall|last4=Thompson|first4=Byran|last5=Rogers|first5=Stephen L.|title=Exploration of Anomalous Gravity Effects by rf-Pumped Magnetized High-T(c) Superconducting Oxides|journal=AIAA Joint Propulsion Conference; 8-11 Jul. 2001; Salt Lake City, UT; United States|date=Jan 1, 2001|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20020016600.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hathaway|first1=G|last2=Cleveland|first2=B|last3=Bao|first3=Y|title=Gravity modification experiment using a rotating superconducting disk and radio frequency fields|journal=Physica C: Superconductivity|date=April 2003|volume=385|issue=4|pages=488–500|doi=10.1016/S0921-4534(02)02284-0|bibcode=2003PhyC..385..488H}}&lt;/ref&gt; found no evidence of the effect.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;

Research on quantum tunneling was sponsored by the BPPP.  It was concluded that this is not a mechanism for faster-than-light travel.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3" /&gt;

Other approaches categorized as non-viable are oscillation thrusters and gyroscopic antigravity, Hooper antigravity coils, and coronal blowers.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;

==Unresolved approaches==
A theoretical examination of additional atomic [[energy levels]] (deep Dirac levels) was carried out.  Some states were ruled out, but the problem remains unsolved.&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3" /&gt;

Experiments tested [[James F. Woodward|Woodward]]’s [[Woodward effect|theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woodward|first1=James F.|title=A new experimental approach to Mach's principle and relativistic graviation|journal=Foundations of Physics Letters|date=October 1990|volume=3|issue=5|pages=497–506|doi=10.1007/BF00665932|bibcode=1990FoPhL...3..497W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woodward|first1=James F.|title=Measurements of a Machian transient mass fluctuation|journal=Foundations of Physics Letters|date=October 1991|volume=4|issue=5|pages=407–423|doi=10.1007/BF00691187|bibcode=1991FoPhL...4..407W}}&lt;/ref&gt; of inducing transient inertia by electromagnetic fields.  The small effect could not be confirmed.  Woodward continued refining the experiments and theory.  Independent experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cramer|first1=John|last2=Cassisi|first2=Damon|last3=Fey|first3=Curran|title=Tests of Mach's Principle with a mechanical oscillator|journal=37th Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit|date=Oct 1, 2004|doi=10.2514/6.2001-3908|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050080680.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; also remained inconclusive.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3" /&gt;

A possible torsion-like effect in the coupling between electromagnetism and spacetime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ringermacher|first1=Harry I.|title=An electrodynamic connection|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=1994|volume=11|issue=9|pages=2383|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/11/9/018|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/11/9/018/meta|language=en|issn=0264-9381|bibcode=1994CQGra..11.2383R}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may ultimately be useful for propulsion, was sought in experiments. The experiments were insufficient to resolve the question.&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3" /&gt;

Other theories listed in Millis' final assessment as unresolved are [[Abraham-Minkowski controversy|Abraham–Minkowski]] electromagnetic momentum, interpreting inertia and gravity quantum vacuum effects, and the Podkletnov force beam.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;

== Space drives ==
One of the eight tasks funded by the BPP program was to define a strategy towards space drives.&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3" /&gt;  

As a motivation, seven examples of hypothetical space drives were described at the onset of the project.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;  These included the gravity-based pitch drive, bias drive, disjunction drive and diametric drive; the [[Alcubierre drive]]; and the vacuum energy based differential sail.&lt;ref name="millis1997" /&gt;

The project then considered the mechanisms behind these drives.  At the end of the project, three mechanisms were identified as areas for future research.  One considers the possibility of a reaction mass in seemingly empty space, for example in [[dark matter]], [[dark energy]], or [[zero-point energy]].  Another approach is to reconsider [[Mach's principle]] and [[Euclidean space]].  A third research avenue that might ultimately prove useful for spacecraft propulsion is the [[Coupling (physics)|coupling of fundamental forces]] on sub-atomic scales.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;

== Quantum vacuum energy experiments == 

One topic of investigations was the use of the [[zero-point energy]] field. As the [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] [[uncertainty principle]] implies that there is no such thing as an exact amount of energy in an exact location, [[quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuation]]s are known to lead to discernible effects such as the [[Casimir effect]]. The differential sail is a speculative drive, based on the possibility of inducing differences in the pressure of vacuum fluctuations on either side of a sail-like structure — with the pressure being somehow reduced on the forward surface of the sail, but pushing as normal on the raft surface — and thus propel a vehicle forward.&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="millis1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Millis|first1=Marc G.|title=Challenge to Create the Space Drive|journal=Journal of Propulsion and Power|date=September 1997|volume=13|issue=5|pages=577–582|doi=10.2514/2.5215|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19990023236.pdf|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Popular Science"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kP6ESrt1xLUC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=disjunction+drive#v=onepage&amp;q=disjunction%20drive&amp;f=false|title=Popular Science May 2001|author1=Corporation|first1=Bonnier|date=2001-05-01|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Casimir effect was investigated experimentally and analytically under the Breakthrough Propulsion Physics project.  This included the construction of MicroElectroMechanical
(MEM) rectangular Casimir cavities.&lt;ref name="millis20042" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maclay|first1=G. Jordan|title=Analysis of zero-point electromagnetic energy and Casimir forces in conducting rectangular cavities|journal=Physical Review A|date=17 April 2000|volume=61|issue=5|pages=052110|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.61.052110|bibcode=2000PhRvA..61e2110M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical work showed that the effect could be used to create net forces, although the forces would be extremely small.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="millis20042" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maclay|first1=G. Jordan|last2=Forward|first2=Robert L.|title=A Gedanken Spacecraft that Operates Using the Quantum Vacuum (Dynamic Casimir Effect)|journal=Foundations of Physics|date=March 2004|volume=34|issue=3|pages=477–500|doi=10.1023/B:FOOP.0000019624.51662.50|bibcode=2004FoPh...34..477M|arxiv=physics/0303108}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the project, the Casimir effect was categorized as an avenue for future research.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;

==Tau Zero Foundation==

After funding ended, program manager Marc G. Millis was supported by NASA to complete documentation of results. The book ''Frontiers of Propulsion Science'' was published by the [[AIAA]] in February 2009,&lt;ref&gt; M. Millis and E. Davis, ''Frontiers of Propulsion Science'', AIAA, Progress in Astronautics &amp; Aeronautics Vol 227, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1563479564}}
{{ISBN|1563479567}} &lt;/ref&gt; providing a deeper explanation of several propulsion methods.

Following program cancellation in 2002, Millis and others founded the Tau Zero Foundation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7401">The '''California drought manipulation conspiracy theory''' is promoted by a number of independent researchers, self-proclaimed scientists, and [[alternative media|alternative news outlets]]. The theory proposes that the [[2011–17 California drought|2011–2017 drought]] was a deliberate, man-made phenomenon, created by [[weather modification]]. The theory has been dismissed by the [[scientific community]] and [[mainstream media]] as [[fringe science]] or [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gumbel |first=Andrew |date=September 26, 2015 |title=Drought blamers: California conspiracists see government's hand in arid climate |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/26/california-drought-conspiracy-theories-geoengineering-climate |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location= |access-date=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbslocal.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/09/22/growing-number-believe-californias-drought-is-a-government-conspiracy/ |title=Growing Number Believe California's Drought Is A Government Conspiracy |publisher=CBS Sacramento |accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key claims and components==
The [[2011–17 California drought|2011–2017 drought]] has inspired alarm among many, leading to the emergence of alternative theories, or "[[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]", purporting to explain its cause.

Many of the proponents claim that [[chemtrail conspiracy theory|chemtrails]] are used to affect storm clouds, in a manner of suppressing the development of precipitation. This would occur because of the presence of too many [[cloud condensation nuclei]], or "cloud seeds", in a single area. Others say that technologies similar to [[High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program|HAARP]] (a federal [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] research program, which was decommissioned in 2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = HAARP closure postponed until 2015 | url = http://www.adn.com/article/20140702/haarp-closure-postponed-until-2015 | first = Dermot | last = Cole | date = 2 July 2014 | work = Alaska Dispatch News | accessdate = 2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; are being used to create a large and stubborn [[high-pressure area]] over the [[West Coast of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_24904396/california-drought-whats-causing-it|title=California drought: What’s causing it?|date=13 January 2014|publisher=|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They claim that this, also, discourages storms and rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/26/california-drought-conspiracy-theories-geoengineering-climate |title=Drought blamers: California conspiracists see government's hand in arid climate |first=Andrew |last=Gumbel |date=26 September 2015 |publisher= |accessdate=1 September 2016 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most well-known adherent of the theory is Dane Wigington, former [[solar power|solar engineer]], and lead researcher for www.GeoEngineeringwatch.org  a [[climate engineering]] watchdog group. He says government agencies and other entities have [[economic geography|economic]] and [[geostrategy|geopolitical]] motivations to manipulate the weather on the West Coast and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="cbslocal.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mtshasta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtshastanews.com/article/20140723/News/140729883 |title=Shasta County agrees to find out more about jet trails |first=Richard |last=DuPertuis |publisher= |accessdate=1 September 2016 |work=Mount Shasta Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents have claimed credibility for the theory, in part, as a result of a Los Angeles County [[cloud seeding]] program, begun in early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2016/03/24/conspiracy_theories_rain_down_california_cloud_seeding_project_brings_out_the_truthers/ |title=Conspiracy theories rain down: California cloud-seeding project brings out the truthers |first=Reynard |last=Loki |publisher=Salon |accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/government-buries-weather-modification-news/ |title=HAARPing On; The government didn't quietly admit to modifying weather in California; cloud seeding is a well-documented effort to counteract the effects of drought (and isn't related to chemtrails). |author=Kim LaCapria |date=March 17, 2016 |website=[[Snopes.com]] |publisher=Snopes.com |access-date=September 2, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reinforces their view that government continues to engage in weather modification and/or climate engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/02/the-climate-conspiracy-theory-coming-to-your-congressmans-twitter-feed/452628/|title=The Climate Conspiracy Theory Coming to Your Congressman's Twitter Feed|first=Jason|last=Plautz|publisher=|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=As Water Supply Reaches Record Low, California Combats Drought With Black-Ops Weather Control Technology From Vietnam War|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2014/02/04/as-water-supply-reaches-record-low-california-combats-drought-with-black-ops-weather-control-technology-from-vietnam-war/|publisher=Forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shasta County action==
In July 2014, the [[Shasta County, California|Shasta County]] Board of Supervisors voted unanimously in favor of a formal inquiry into chemtrail conspiracy claims.

'''Cantera stone''' is a quarried, [[volcanic rock]] that is mined in various regions of Mexico and Central America. Its name derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for [[quarry]]. Its properties allow for detailed carving and cutting. It is used in hotels, shopping malls, office buildings, and custom homes throughout the world, and has stood for centuries in many cathedrals, haciendas and other buildings throughout Latin America. The stone can absorbs air and humidity without expansion, so it can be used in wet areas. It is often used to create tables, fireplaces, wall tiles, pool areas, and columns.

The stone's color may vary depending on the impurities present in the stone of a particular region.  The cantera notably used in many of the buildings, walls, and roads of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]], Mexico is a distinct green color. This rock is formed by volcanic ash and dust. The ash is washed into a silt bed and combined with the lava, dirt and stone on the ground already. This combination makes Cantera a porous and lightweight stone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2873">The '''Clohessy-Wiltshire equations''' describe a simplified model of orbital relative motion, in which the target is in a circular orbit, and the chaser spacecraft is in an elliptical or circular orbit. This model gives a first-order approximation of the chaser's motion in a target-centered coordinate system. It is very useful in planning rendezvous of the chaser with the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clohessy-Wiltshire equations|url=http://www.ae.utexas.edu/courses/ase366k/cw_equations.pdf|publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin]]|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x} = 3n^2x+2n\dot{y}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ddot{y} = -2n\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ddot{z} = -n^2z&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;n = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a^3}}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the orbital rate of the target body. &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the target body's circular orbit, and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard gravitational parameter]].

For illustration, in low earth orbit, &lt;math&gt; \mu = 3.986E14 \frac{m^3}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;a = 6378137m + 415000m = 6793137m&lt;/math&gt;,  so  &lt;math&gt;n=0.00113 s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to an orbital period of about 93 minutes.

== Solution ==
We can obtain closed form solutions of these coupled differential equations in matrix form, allowing us to find the position and velocity of the chaser at any time given the initial position and velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students (3rd Edition)|last=Curtis|first=Howard D.|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|year=2014|isbn=9780080977478|location=Oxford, UK|pages=383–387|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\delta\vec{r}(t) = [\Phi_{rr}(t)]\delta\vec{r_0} + [\Phi_{rv}(t)]\delta\vec{v_0}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\delta\vec{v}(t) = [\Phi_{vr}(t)]\delta\vec{r_0} + [\Phi_{vv}(t)]\delta\vec{v_0}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{rr}(t) = 
		\begin{bmatrix}
			4-3\cos{nt} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
			6(\sin{nt}-nt) &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
			0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cos{nt}
		\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{rv}(t) = 
		\begin{bmatrix}
			\frac{1}{n}\sin{nt} &amp; \frac{2}{n}(1-\cos{nt}) &amp; 0 \\
			\frac{2}{n}(\cos{nt}-1) &amp; \frac{1}{n}(4\sin{nt}-3nt) &amp; 0 \\
			0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{n}\sin{nt}
		\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{vr}(t) = 
		\begin{bmatrix}
			3n\sin{nt} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
			6n(\cos{nt}-1) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
			0 &amp; 0 &amp; -n\sin{nt}
		\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{vv}(t) = 
		\begin{bmatrix}
			\cos{nt} &amp; 2\sin{nt} &amp; 0 \\
			-2\sin{nt} &amp; 4\cos{nt}-3 &amp; 0 \\
			0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cos{nt}
		\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{vr}(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\Phi_{rr}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{vv}(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\Phi_{rv}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Since these matrices are easily [[Invertible matrix|invertible]], we can also solve for the initial conditions given only the final conditions and the properties of the target vehicle's orbit.

In [[physics]], a '''conservation law''' states that a particular measurable property of an isolated [[physical system]] does not change as the system evolves over time. Exact conservation laws include [[conservation of energy]], [[conservation of linear momentum]], [[conservation of angular momentum]], and [[conservation of electric charge]]. There are also many approximate conservation laws, which apply to such quantities as [[conservation of mass|mass]], [[Parity (physics)|parity]], [[lepton number]], [[baryon number]], [[strangeness]], [[hypercharge]], etc.  These quantities are conserved in certain classes of physics processes, but not in all.

A local conservation law is usually expressed mathematically as a [[continuity equation]], a [[partial differential equation]] which gives a relation between the amount of the quantity and the "transport" of that quantity.    It states that the amount of the conserved quantity at a point or within a volume can only change by the amount of the quantity which flows in or out of the volume.

From [[Noether's theorem]], each conservation law is associated with a [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] in the underlying physics.

==Conservation laws as fundamental laws of nature==

Conservation laws are fundamental to our understanding of the physical world, in that they describe which processes can or cannot occur in nature.  For example, the conservation law of energy states that the total quantity of energy in an isolated system does not change, though it may change form.  In general, the total quantity of the property governed by that law remains unchanged during physical processes.  With respect to classical physics, conservation laws include conservation of energy, mass (or matter), linear momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge.  With respect to particle physics, particles cannot be created or destroyed except in pairs, where one is ordinary and the other is an antiparticle.  With respect to symmetries and invariance principles, three special conservation laws have been described, associated with inversion or reversal of space, time, and charge.

Conservation laws are considered to be fundamental laws of nature, with broad application in physics, as well as in other fields such as chemistry, biology, geology, and engineering.

Most conservation laws are exact, or absolute, in the sense that they apply to all possible processes.  Some conservation laws are partial, in that they hold for some processes but not for others.

One particularly important result concerning conservation laws is [[Noether's theorem]], which states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between each one of them and a differentiable [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] of nature.  For example, the conservation of energy follows from the time-invariance of physical systems, and the conservation of angular momentum arises from the fact that physical systems behave the same regardless of how they are oriented in space.

==Approximate laws==

There are also '''approximate''' conservation laws.  These are approximately true in particular situations, such as low speeds, short time scales, or certain interactions.

* [[Conservation of mass|Conservation of rest mass]]
* Conservation of [[baryon number]] (See [[chiral anomaly]] and [[sphaleron]])
* Conservation of [[lepton number]] (In the [[Standard Model]])
* Conservation of [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]] (violated by the [[weak interaction]])
* Conservation of [[parity (physics)|parity]]
* Invariance under [[charge conjugation]]
* Invariance under [[T-symmetry|time reversal]]
* [[CP symmetry]], the combination of charge and parity conjugation (equivalent to time reversal if CPT holds)

==Global and local conservation laws==
The total amount of some conserved quantity in the universe could remain unchanged if an equal amount were to appear at one point ''A'' and simultaneously disappear from another separate point ''B''.  For example, an amount of energy could appear on Earth without changing the total amount in the Universe if the same amount of energy were to disappear from a remote region of the Universe.  This weak form of "global" conservation is really not a conservation law because it is not [[Lorentz invariant]], so phenomena like the above do not occur in nature.&lt;ref name="Aitchison"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to [[Special Relativity]], if the appearance of the energy at ''A'' and disappearance of the energy at ''B'' are simultaneous in one [[inertial reference frame]], they will not be simultaneous in other inertial reference frames moving with respect to the first.  In a moving frame one will occur before the other; either the energy at ''A'' will appear ''before'' or ''after'' the energy at ''B'' disappears.  In both cases, during the interval energy will not be conserved.  

A stronger form of conservation law requires that, for the amount of a conserved quantity at a point to change, there must be a flow, or ''flux'' of the quantity into or out of the point.  For example, the amount of [[electric charge]] in a volume is never found to change without an [[electric current]] into or out of the volume that carries the difference in charge.  Since it only involves continuous ''[[principle of locality|local]]'' changes, this stronger type of conservation law is [[Lorentz invariant]]; a quantity conserved in one reference frame is conserved in all moving reference frames.&lt;ref name="Aitchison" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt;  This is called a ''local conservation'' law.&lt;ref name="Aitchison" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt;  Local conservation also implies global conservation; that the total amount of the conserved quantity in the Universe remains constant.  All of the conservation laws listed above are local conservation laws. A local conservation law is expressed mathematically by a ''[[continuity equation]]'', which states that the change in the quantity in a volume is equal to the total net  "flux" of the quantity through the surface of the volume.  The following sections discuss continuity equations in general.

==Differential forms==
{{see also|conservation form|continuity equation}}
In continuum mechanics, the most general form of an exact conservation law is given by a [[continuity equation]]. For example, conservation of electric charge ''q'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{j} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ∇⋅ is the [[divergence]] operator, ''ρ'' is the density of ''q'' (amount per unit volume), '''j''' is the flux of ''q'' (amount crossing a unit area in unit time), and ''t'' is time.

If we assume that the motion '''u''' of the charge is a continuous function of position and time, then
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{j} = \rho \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In one space dimension this can be put into the form of a homogeneous first-order [[nonlinear partial differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic equation]]:&lt;ref name="To24"&gt;see Toro, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + A(y) y_x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the dependent variable ''y'' is called the ''density'' of a ''conserved quantity'', and ''A(y)'' is called the ''[[current jacobian]]'', and the [[Notation for differentiation#Partial derivatives|subscript notation for partial derivatives]] has been employed. The more general inhomogeneous case:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + A(y) y_x = s &lt;/math&gt;

is not a conservation equation but the general kind of [[balance equation]] describing a [[dissipative system]]. The dependent variable ''y'' is called a ''nonconserved quantity'', and the inhomogeneous term ''s(y,x,t)'' is the-''[[Divergence|source]]'', or [[dissipation]]. For example, balance equations of this kind are the momentum and energy [[Navier-Stokes equations]], or the [[entropy#Entropy balance equation for open systems|entropy balance]] for a general [[isolated system]].

In the '''one-dimensional space''' a conservation equation is a first-order [[nonlinear partial differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic equation]] that can be put into the ''advection'' form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + a(y) y_x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the dependent variable ''y(x,t)'' is called the density of the ''conserved'' (scalar) quantity (c.q.(d.) = conserved quantity (density)), and ''a(y)'' is called the '''current coefficient''', usually corresponding to the [[partial derivative]] in the conserved quantity of a [[current density]] (c.d.) of the conserved quantity ''j(y)'':&lt;ref name="To24" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; a(y) = j_y (y)&lt;/math&gt;

In this case since the [[chain rule]] applies:

:&lt;math&gt; j_x= j_y (y) y_x = a(y) y_x &lt;/math&gt;

the conservation equation can be put into the current density form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + j_x (y)= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In a '''space with more than one dimension''' the former definition can be extended to an equation that can be put into the form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + \mathbf a(y) \cdot \nabla y = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''conserved quantity'' is ''y('''r''',t)'', ''&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;'' denotes the [[scalar product]], ''&amp;nabla;'' is the [[nabla symbol|nabla]] operator, here indicating a [[gradient]], and ''a(y)'' is a vector of current coefficients, analogously corresponding to the [[divergence]] of a vector c.d. associated to the c.q. '''j'''(y):

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + \nabla \cdot \mathbf  j(y) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

This is the case for the [[continuity equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_t + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf u) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Here the conserved quantity is the [[mass]], with [[density]] ''&amp;rho;''('''r''',t) and current density  ''&amp;rho;'''''u''', identical to the [[momentum conservation|momentum density]], while '''u'''('''r''',t) is the [[flow velocity]].

In the '''general case''' a conservation equation can be also a system of this kind of equations (a [[vector equation]]) in the form:&lt;ref name="To24" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_t + \mathbf A(\mathbf y) \cdot \nabla \mathbf y = \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where '''y''' is called the ''conserved'' ('''vector''') quantity, &amp;nabla; y is its [[gradient]], '''0''' is the [[zero vector]], and '''A(y)''' is called the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of the current density. In fact as in the former scalar case, also in the vector case '''A(y)''' usually corresponding to the Jacobian of a [[current density matrix]] '''J(y)''':

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf A( \mathbf y) = \mathbf J_{\mathbf y} (\mathbf y)&lt;/math&gt;

and the conservation equation can be put into the form:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_t + \nabla \cdot \mathbf J (\mathbf y)= \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;

For example, this the case for Euler equations (fluid dynamics). In the simple incompressible case they are:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla\cdot \mathbf u=0\\[1.2ex]
{\partial \mathbf u \over\partial t}+ \mathbf u \cdot
\nabla \mathbf u + \nabla s =\mathbf{0},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*'''''u''''' is the [[flow velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], with components in a N-dimensional space ''u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''u&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' ... ''u&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'',
*''s'' is the specific [[pressure]] (pressure per unit [[density]]) giving the [[Linear differential equation|source term]],

{{see also|Euler equations (fluid dynamics)}}

It can be shown that the conserved (vector) quantity and the c.d. matrix for these equations are respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}1 \\  \mathbf u \end{pmatrix}; \qquad
{\mathbf J}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf u\\ \mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u + s \mathbf I\end{pmatrix};\qquad
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'' denotes the [[outer product]].

==Integral and weak forms==
Conservation equations can be also expressed in integral form: the advantage of the latter is substantially that it requires less smoothness of the solution, which paves the way to [[weak formulation|weak form]], extending the class of admissible solutions to include discontinuous solutions.&lt;ref name="ToroInt"&gt;see Toro, p.62-63&lt;/ref&gt; By integrating in any space-time domain the current density form in 1-D space:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + j_x (y)= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and by using [[Green's theorem]], the integral form is:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{- \infty}^\infty y \, dx + \int_0^\infty j (y) \, dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In a similar fashion, for the scalar multidimensional space, the integral form is:

:&lt;math&gt; \oint [y \, d^N r + j (y) \, dt] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the line integration is performed along the boundary of the domain, in an anticlock-wise manner.&lt;ref name="ToroInt" /&gt;

Moreover, by defining a [[test function]] ''&amp;phi;''('''r''',''t'') continuously differentiable both in time and space with compact support, the [[weak formulation|weak form]] can be obtained pivoting on the [[initial condition]]. In 1-D space it is:

: &lt;math&gt; \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi_t y + \phi_x j(y) \,dx \,dt = - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi(x,0) y(x,0) \, dx &lt;/math&gt;

Note that in the weak form all the partial derivatives of the density and current density have been passed on to the test function, which with the former hypothesis is sufficiently smooth to admit these derivatives.&lt;ref name="ToroInt" /&gt;

'''Cryptozoology''' is a [[pseudoscience]] and [[subculture]] that aims to prove the existence of entities from the [[folklore]] record, such as [[Bigfoot]], the [[chupacabra]], or [[Mokele-mbembe]]. Cryptozoologists refer to these entities as ''cryptids'', a term coined by the subculture. Because it does not follow the [[scientific method]], cryptozoology is considered a pseudoscience by the academic world: it is neither a branch of [[zoology]] nor [[folkloristics]].

Originally founded in the 1950s by zoologists [[Bernard Heuvelmans]] and [[Ivan T. Sanderson]], scholars have noted that the pseudoscience rejected mainstream approaches from an early date, and that adherents often express hostility to mainstream science. Scholars have studied cryptozoologists and their influence (including the pseudoscience's association with [[young Earth creationism]]), and have noted parallels in cryptozoology and other pseudosciences such as [[ghost hunting]] and [[ufology]].

==Terminology, history, and approach==
As a field, cryptozoology originates from  the works of colleagues Bernard Heuvelmans, a [[Belgian]] zoologist, and Ivan T. Sanderson, a Scottish zoologist. Notably, Heuvelmans published ''[[On the Track of Unknown Animals]]'' (French ''Sur la Piste des Bêtes Ignorées'') in 1955, a landmark work among cryptozoologists that was followed by numerous other like works. Similarly, Sanderson published a series of books that assisted in developing hallmarks of cryptozoology, including ''Abominable Snowmen: Legend Come to Life'' (1961).&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"&gt;Regal, Brian (2011) "Cryptozoology", pp. 326-329 as published in McCormick, Charlie T. and Kim Kennedy (2011). ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art''. 2nd edition. [[ABC-CLIO]]. {{ISBN|978-1-59884-241-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cryptozoology'' dates from cryptozoologist circles from 1959 or before&amp;nbsp;– Heuvelmans attributes the coinage of the term ''cryptozoology'' ('the study of hidden animals') to Sanderson.&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OED-CRYPTOZOOLOGY"&gt;Additionally, see discussion at "cryptozoology, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 25 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Patterned after ''cryptozoology'', the term ''cryptid'' was coined in 1983 by cryptozoologist J. E. Wall in the Summer issue of the [[International Society of Cryptozoology]] newsletter.&lt;ref name="Regal2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Regal|first=B.|title=Searching for Sasquatch: Crackpots, Eggheads, and Cryptozoology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5a7GAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA197|date=11 April 2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-11829-4|pages=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wall "[It has been] suggested that new terms be coined to replace sensational and often misleading terms like 'monster'. My suggestion is 'cryptid', meaning a living thing having the quality of being hidden or unknown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Wall |first=J.E. |title=The ISC Newsletter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSfXAAAAMAAJ |date=Summer 1982 |publisher=International Society of Cryptozoology |volume=2 |issue=2 |page=10 |quote=The Spring, 1983, issue featured an interview with Paul LeBlond and Forrest Wood, in which it was suggested that new terms be coined to replace sensational and often misleading terms like "monster." My suggestion is "cryptid," meaning a living thing having the quality of being hidden or unknown. As far as I know, this would be an entirely new word , describing those creatures which are (or may be) subjects of cryptozoological investigation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the noun ''cryptid'' as "an animal whose existence or survival to the present day is disputed or unsubstantiated; any animal of interest to a cryptozoologist".&lt;ref name="OED-CRYPTID"&gt;"cryptid, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 25 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; While used by most cryptozoologists, the term ''cryptid'' is not used by academic zoologists.&lt;ref name="PAXTON-2011"&gt;Paxton, C.G.M.  (2011). "Putting the “ology” into cryptozoology." . ''Biofortean Notes''. Vol. 7, pp. 7-20, 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

While biologists regularly identify new species, cryptozoologists often focus on creatures from the [[folklore]] record. Most famously, these include the [[Loch Ness Monster]], [[Bigfoot]], the [[chupacabra]], as well as other "imposing beasts that could be labeled as monsters". In their hunt for these entities, cryptozoologists may employ devices such as motion-sensitive cameras, night-vision equipment, and audio-recording equipment. While there have been attempts to codify cryptozoological approaches, unlike biologists, zoologists, botanists, and other academic disciplines, however, "there are no accepted, uniform, or successful methods for pursuing cryptids".&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"/&gt; Some scholars have identified precursors to modern cryptozoology in certain medieval approaches to the folklore record, and the psychology behind the cryptozoology approach has been the subject of academic study.&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"/&gt;

Few cryptozoologists have a formal science education, and fewer still have a science background directly relevant to cryptozoology. Adherents often misrepresent the academic backgrounds of cryptozoologists. According to writer [[Daniel Loxton]] and paleontologist [[Donald Prothero]], "Cryptozoologists have often promoted 'Professor [[Roy Mackal]], PhD.' as one of their leading figures and one of the few with a legitimate doctorate in biology. What is rarely mentioned, however, is that he had no training that would qualify him to undertake competent research on exotic animals. This raises the specter of 'credential mongering', by which an individual or organization feints a person's graduate degree as proof of expertise, even though his or her training is not specifically relevant to the field under consideration." Besides Heuvalmans, Sanderson, and Mackal, notable cryptozoologists with academic backgrounds include [[Grover Krantz]], [[Karl Shuker]], and [[Richard Greenwell]].&lt;ref name="LOXTON-PROTHERO-2013-304-305"&gt;Loxton, Daniel and Donald Prothero. 2013. ''Abominable Science: Origins of the Yeti, Nessie, and other Famous Cryptids'', p. 304-305. [[Columbia University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-231-52681-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Young Earth creationism===
A subset of cryptozoology promotes the pseudoscience of [[Young Earth creationism]], rejecting conventional science in favor of a Biblical interpretation and promoting concepts such as "[[Young Earth creationism#Flood geology, the fossil record, and dinosaurs|living dinosaur]]s". [[Science journalism|Science writer]] [[Sharon A. Hill]] observes that the Young Earth creationist segment of cryptozoology is "well-funded and able to conduct expeditions with a goal of finding a living dinosaur that they think would invalidate evolution."&lt;ref name="SCIENTIFICAL-AMERICANS-66"&gt;Hill, Sharon A. 2017. ''Scientifical Americans: The Culture of Amateur Paranormal Researchers'', pp. 66. [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]. {{ISBN|9781476630823}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] Jeb J. Card says that "Creationists have embraced cryptozoology and some cryptozoological expeditions are funded by and conducted by creationists hoping to disprove evolution."&lt;ref name="CARD-32"&gt;Card, Jeb J. 2016. "Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S. ''Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices'', p. 32. [[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|9780817319113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview, [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Donald Prothero]] notes an uptick in creationist cryptozoologists. He observes that "[p]eople who actively search for Loch Ness monsters or Mokele Mbembe do it entirely as creationist ministers. They think that if they found a dinosaur in the Congo it would overturn all of evolution. It wouldn't. It would just be a late-occurring dinosaur, but that's their mistaken notion of evolution."&lt;ref name="NAT-GEO-PROTHERO"&gt;Shea, Rachel Hartigan. 2013. "The Science Behind Bigfoot and Other Monsters".''[[National Geographic]]'', September 9, 2013. [https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/09/130907-cryptid-crytozoology-bigfoot-loch-yeti-monster-abominable-science/ Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and pseudoscience==
The 2003 discovery of the [[fossil]] remains of ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' was cited by paleontologist [[Henry Gee]], a senior editor at the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', as possible evidence that "in geological terms, makes it more likely that stories of other mythical, human-like creatures such as yetis are founded on grains of truth." "Cryptozoology," Gee says, "can come in from the cold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Henry Gee |year=2004 |journal=Nature News |url=http://www.bioedonline.org/news/news.cfm?art=1329 |title=Flores, God and Cryptozoology: The discovery poses thorny questions about the uniqueness of Homo sapiens | doi = 10.1038/news041025-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, cryptozoology is widely criticised for an array of reasons and is rejected by the academic world. There is a broad consensus from academics that cryptozoology is a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Jeffrey A. (2000). ''The Scientific Endeavor: A Primer on Scientific Principles and Practice''. [[Benjamin Cummings]]. p. 119. {{ISBN|978-0805345964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roesch, Ben S; Moore, John L. (2002). ''Cryptozoology''. In [[Michael Shermer]]. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: Volume One''. ABC-CLIO. pp. 71-78. {{ISBN|1-57607-653-9}} "Pointing to this rampant speculation and ignorance of established scientific theories in cryptozoology, as well as the field's poor record of success and its reliance on unsystematic, anecdotal evidence, many scientists and skeptics classify cryptozoology as a pseudoscience."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Church, Jill M. (2009). ''Cryptozoology''. In [[H. James Birx]]. ''Encyclopedia of Time: Science, Philosophy, Theology &amp; Culture, Volume 1''. [[SAGE Publications]]. pp. 251-252. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-4164-8}} "Cryptozoology has acquired a bad reputation as a pseudoscience... Until detailed, methodical research becomes standard practice among cryptozoologists, the field will remain disrespected by more traditional biologists and zoologists."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lack, Caleb W; Rousseau, Jacques. (2016). ''Unknown Animals and Cryptozoology''. In ''Critical Thinking, Science and Pseudoscience: Why We Can't Trust Our Brains.'' [[Springer Publishing]]. pp. 153-174. {{ISBN|978-0-8261-9419-0}} "Cryptids are the focus of study in cryptozoology, a field most scientists label as pseudoscientific."&lt;/ref&gt; The field is regularly criticized for reliance on anecdotal information&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shermer|first=Michael| authorlink=Michael Shermer | year=2003|title=Show Me the Body|work=[[Scientific American]]|issue=288 (5)|page=27|url=http://www.michaelshermer.com/2003/05/show-me-the-body}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because in the course of investigating animals that most scientists believe are unlikely to have existed, cryptozoologists do not follow the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="luumsh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dash|first=Mike|title=Borderlands: The Ultimate Exploration of the Unknown|publisher=[[Overlook Press]]|year=2000 |isbn=0-440-23656-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill notes that "there is no academic course of study in cryptozoology or no university degree program that will bestow the title 'cryptozoologist'."&lt;ref name="SCIENTIFICAL-AMERICANS-66"/&gt;

Anthropologist Jeb J. Card summarizes cryptozoology in a survey of pseudoscience and [[pseudoarchaeology]]:

:Cryptozoology purports to be the study of previously unidentified animal species. At first glance, this would seem to differ little from zoology. New species are discovered by field and museum zoologists every year. Cryptozoologists cite these discoveries as justification of their search but often minimize or omit the fact that the discoverers do not identify as cryptozoologists and are academically trained zoologists working in an ecological paradigm rather than organizing expeditions to seek out supposed examples of unusual and large creatures.&lt;ref name="CARD-23-32"&gt;Card, Jeb J. 2016. "Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S. ''Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices'', p. 23-32. [[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|9780817319113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Card notes that "cryptozoologists often show their disdain and even hatred for professional scientists, including those who enthusiastically participated in cryptozoology", which he traces back to Heuvelmans's early "rage against critics of cryptozoology". He finds parallels with cryptozoology and other pseudosciences, such as [[ghost hunting]] and [[ufology]], and compares the approach of cryptozoologists to colonial big-game hunters, and to aspects of European imperialism. According to Card, "Most cryptids are framed as the subject of indigenous legends typically collected in the hayday of [[comparative folklore]], though such legends may be heavily modified or worse. Cryptozoology's complicated mix of sympathy, interest, and appropriation of indigenous culture (or non-indigenous construction of it) is also found in [[New Age]] circles and dubious "[[Indian burial grounds]]" and other [[legend]]s ... invoked in [[haunting]]s such as the [[The Amityville Horror|"Amityville" hoax]] ...".&lt;ref name="CARD-24-25"&gt;Card, Jeb J. 2016. "Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S. ''Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices'', p. 24-25. [[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|9780817319113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 foreword for ''The American Biology Teacher'', then [[National Association of Biology Teachers]] president [[Dan Ward (educator)|Dan Ward]] uses cryptozoology as an example of "technological pseudoscience" that may confuse students about the scientific method. Ward says that "Cryptozoology … is not valid science or even science at all. It is monster hunting."&lt;ref name="WARD-2011"&gt;Ward, Daniel. 2011. “From the President”. The American Biology Teacher 73.8 (2011): 440–440.&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of science|Historian of science]] [[Brian Regal]] includes an entry for cryptozoology in his ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia'' (2009). Regal says that "as an intellectual endeavor, cryptozoology has been studied as much as cryptozoologists have sought hidden animals".&lt;ref name="NAGEL-50"&gt;Nagel, Brian. 2009. ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia'', p. 50. [[ABC-CLIO]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1992 issue of ''[[The Folklore Society|Folklore]]'', [[folkloristics|folklorist]] Véronique Campion-Vincent says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Unexplained appearances of mystery animals are reported all over the world today. Beliefs in the existence of fabulous and supernatural animals are ubiquitous and timeless. In the continents discovered by Europe indigenous beliefs and tales have strongly influenced the perceptions of the conquered confronted by a new natural environment. In parallel with the growing importance of the scientific approach, these traditional mythical tales have been endowed with sometimes highly artificial precision and have given birth to contemporary legends solidly entrenched in their territories. The belief self-perpetuates today through multiple observations enhanced by the media and encouraged (largely with the aim of gain for touristic promotion) by the local population, often genuinely convinced of the reality of this profitable phenomenon."&lt;ref name="CAMPION-VINCENT-173"&gt;Campion-Vincent, Véronique. 1992. “Appearances of Beasts and Mystery-cats in France”. ''Folklore'' 103.2 (1992): 160–183.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Campion-Vincent says that "four currents can be distinguished in the study of mysterious animal appearances": "Forteans" ("compiler[s] of anomalies" such as via publications like the ''[[Fortean Times]]''), "occultists" (which she describes as related to "Forteans"), "folklorists", and "cryptozoologists". Regarding cryptozoologists, Campion-Vincent says that "this movement seems to deserve the appellation of parascience, like [[parapsychology]]: the same corpus is reviewed; many scientists participate, but for those who have an official status of university professor or researcher, the participation is a private hobby".&lt;ref name="CAMPION-VINCENT-173"/&gt;

In her ''Encyclopedia of American Folklore'', academic [[Linda Watts]] says that "folklore concerning unreal animals or beings, sometimes called monsters, is a popular field of inquiry" and describes cryptozoology as an example of "American narrative traditions" that "feature many monsters".&lt;ref name="WATTS-271"&gt;Watts, Linda S. 2007. ''Encyclopedia of American Folklore'', p. 271. [[Facts on File]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of cryptozoology, folklorist [[Peter Dendle]] says that "cryptozoology devotees consciously position themselves in defiance of mainstream science" and that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:The psychological significance of cryptozoology in the modern world .. serves to channel guilt over the decimation of species and destruction of the natural habitat; to recapture a sense of mysticism and danger in a world now perceived as fully charted and over-explored; and to articulate resentment of and defiance against a scientific community perceived as monopolising the pool of culturally acceptable beliefs.&lt;ref name="DENDLE-2006-190-206"&gt;Dendle, Peter. 2006. "Cryptozoology in the Medieval and Modern Worlds". ''Folklore'', Vol. 117, No. 2 (Aug., 2006), pp. 190-206. [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a paper published in 2013, Dendle refers to cryptozoologists as "contemporary monster hunters" that "keep alive a sense of wonder in a world that has been very thoroughly charted, mapped, and tracked, and that is largely available for close scrutiny on Google Earth and satellite imaging" and that "on the whole the devotion of substantial resources for this pursuit betrays a lack of awareness of the basis for scholarly consensus (largely ignoring, for instance, evidence of evolutionary biology and the fossil record)."&lt;ref name="DENDLE-2013-439"&gt;Dendle, Peter. 2013. "Monsters and the Twenty-First Century" as published in ''The Ashgate Research Companion to Monsters and the Monstrous''. [[Ashgate Publishing]]. {{ISBN|9781472418012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Mike Dash]], few scientists doubt there are thousands of unknown animals, particularly invertebrates, awaiting discovery; however, cryptozoologists are largely uninterested in researching and cataloging newly discovered species of [[ant]]s or [[beetle]]s, instead focusing their efforts towards "more elusive" creatures that have often defied decades of work aimed at confirming their existence.&lt;ref name="luumsh"/&gt;

Paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] (1984) lists cryptozoology among examples of human gullibility, along with [[creationism]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Humans are the most inventive, deceptive, and gullible of all animals. Only those characteristics can explain the belief of some humans in creationism, in the arrival of UFO's with extraterrestrial beings, or in some aspects of cryptozoology. … In several respects the discussion and practice of cryptozoology sometimes, although not invariably, has demonstrated both deception and gullibility. An example seems to merit the old Latin saying 'I believe because it is incredible,' although Tertullian, its author, applied it in a way more applicable to the present day creationists.&lt;ref name="SIMPSON-1984-1-16"&gt;Simpson, George Gaylord (1984). "Mammals and Cryptozoology". ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society''. Vol. 128, No. 1 (Mar. 30, 1984), pp. 1-19. [[American Philosophical Society]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paleontologist Donald Prothero (2007) cites cryptozoology as an example of pseudoscience, and categorizes it along with [[Holocaust denial]] and [[Ufology#As a pseudoscience|UFO abductions claims]] as aspects of American culture that are "clearly baloney".&lt;ref name="PROTHERO-2007"&gt;[[Donald R. Prothero|Prothero, Donald R.]]. 2007. ''Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters'', pp. 13-15. [[Columbia University Press]]. {{ISBN|9780231511421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Scientifical Americans: The Culture of Amateur Paranormal Researchers'' (2017), Hill surveys the field and discusses aspects of the subculture, noting internal attempts at creating more scientific approaches and the involvement of [[Young Earth creationists]] and a prevalence of hoaxes. She concludes that many cryptozoologists are "passionate and sincere in their belief that mystery animals exist. As such, they give deference to every report of a sighting, often without criticial questioning. As with the [[ghost hunting|ghost seekers]], cryptozoologists are convinced that they will be the ones to solve the mystery and make history. With the lure of mystery and money undermining diligent and ethical research, the field of cryptozoology has serious credibility problems."&lt;ref name="SCIENTIFICAL-AMERICANS-56-68"&gt;Hill, Sharon A. 2017. ''Scientifical Americans: The Culture of Amateur Paranormal Researchers'', pp. 56-68. [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]. {{ISBN|9781476630823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==
There have been several organizations, of varying types, dedicated or related to cryptozoology. These include:

'''Dunstan Baby Language''' is a theory about infantile vocal reflexes as signals, in humans.   The theory is that across cultures and linguistic groups there are five sounds, each with a meaning, that are used by [[infants]] before the [[language acquisition]] period. The hypothesis was developed by Australian former [[mezzo-soprano]], Priscilla Dunstan, and has been featured on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPXsoZ_F0SA Dunstan on The Oprah Winfrey Show]&lt;/ref&gt; Dunstan's theory has not been scientifically validated.

==Dunstan's theory==
Between 0–3 months, infants make what Dunstan calls ''sound reflexes''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dunstanbaby.co.uk/cms/index.php?page=us-faqs Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dunstan, we all have reflexes, like sneezes, hiccups, and burps, that all have a recognizable pattern when sound is added to the reflex. There are other reflexes that all babies experience, and when sound is added to these, a distinct, preemptive "cry" will occur before the infant breaks into what Dunstan calls the hysterical [[cry]]. Dunstan states that these preemptive cries can indicate what the infant requires (e.g., ''food'', ''comfort'', ''sleep'', etc.), and they escalate to the hysterical cry if they are not answered. As the infant matures past 3 months in [[Communication|vocalization]], the sound reflexes become replaced with more elaborate [[babbling]].

===Words (sound reflexes)===
According to Dunstan, the five universal words (or ''sound reflexes'') used by infants are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oprah.com/tows/slide/200611/20061113/slide_20061113_350_102.jhtml Five Universal Words of Dunstan Baby Language as Posted on Oprah.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Neh (I'm hungry)''' - An infant uses the sound reflex "''Neh''" to communicate its hunger. The sound is produced when the sucking reflex is triggered, and the tongue is pushed up on the roof of the mouth.
* '''Owh (I'm sleepy)''' - An infant uses the sound reflex "''Owh''" to communicate that they are tired.  The sound is produced much like an audible [[yawn]].
* '''Heh (I'm experiencing discomfort)''' - An infant uses the sound reflex "''Heh''" to communicate [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], discomfort, or perhaps that it needs a fresh diaper. The sound is produced by a response to a skin reflex, such as feeling sweat or itchiness in the bum.
* '''Eairh (I have lower gas)''' - An infant uses the sound reflex "''Eairh''" to communicate they have [[flatulence]] or an upset stomach. The sound is produced when trapped air from a belch is unable to release and travels to the stomach where the muscles of the intestines tighten to force the air bubble out.  Often, this sound will indicate that a bowel movement is in progress, and the infant will bend its knees, bringing the legs toward the torso. This leg movement assists in the ongoing process.
* '''Eh (I need to be burped)''' - An infant uses the sound reflex "''Eh''" to communicate that it needs to be burped. The sound is produced when a large bubble of trapped air is caught in the chest, and the reflex is trying to release this out of the mouth.

Dunstan states that she has a [[photographic memory]] for sounds and that this, combined with her years in the [[opera]] and her experience as a mother, allowed her to recognize certain sounds in the human voice. A [[DVD]] set called ''The Dunstan Baby Language'' was released by Dunstan in November 2006. The two-disc set covered the five universal words of the language, methods of learning how to recognize the vocalizations and sounds, numerous examples of baby cries from around the world to "tune your ear," and live demonstrations of newborn mother groups experimenting with the language.

==Criticism==
Linguistics experts point out that Dunstan's hypothesis has not been subjected to rigorous testing or academic scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/01162007/entertainment/health/hey_baby__look_whos_talking_health_skip_card.htm Hey Baby, Look Who's Talking]&lt;/ref&gt; The Dunstan company had, at one time, developed a [[clinical trial]] plan with [[Brown University]] researchers to test its claims, but abandoned it for [[Opinion poll|consumer surveys]] and small-group observations in order "to hasten the development of a system that could be used by parents," skipping rigorous testing to go straight to market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/182567 "Dare I Trust My Intuition?"], Mary Carmichael, ''[[Newsweek]]'', 31 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FOSS''' ('''Full-Option Science System''') is a research-based science curriculum for grades K—8 developed at the [[Lawrence Hall of Science]], [[University of California, Berkeley]]. FOSS is also an ongoing research project dedicated to improving the learning and teaching of science.

==History==
The FOSS K–8 program was developed at the [[Lawrence Hall of Science]], [[University of California at Berkeley]], under three separate [[National Science Foundation]] grants (1988&lt;ref&gt;FOSS Grades 3–6, NSF Grant MDR-8751727, July 1988 to March 1992&lt;/ref&gt; 1991,&lt;ref&gt;FOSS Grades K–2, NSF Grant MDR-9150097, July 1991 to Dec. 1994&lt;/ref&gt; 1996.&lt;ref&gt;FOSS for Middle School, NSF Grant ESI-9553600, Sept. 1996 to Aug. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;)  The program was originally developed and trial tested in urban and suburban [[San Francisco Bay Area]] school districts and field-tested and implemented nationally in ten sites.  Twenty-six modules were developed for K–6, and nine courses for middle school. The FOSS K–6 program went through a major revision in 2000 and was then adopted in Texas. The program went through a minor revision in 2005. A new, California specific, edition was developed for the California science adoption (K–5) in 2007. FOSS is currently published by Delta Education, a division of School Specialty Inc.

==Pedagogy==
The FOSS program uses several instructional pedagogies: [[inquiry-based learning]] (each investigation is guided by questions), hands-on learning and active investigation (students work with materials and conduct investigations to attempt to answer questions), student-to-student interaction, writing (students keep careful notes in science notebooks), and research/reading (readings are included to enhance or underscore active investigation—students work with materials prior to doing any reading).

==Components==
Each K–6 module consists of a kit of student materials, a teacher guide, and a student reading book. Each middle school course includes a kit of student materials, a teacher guide, a Science Resources book, a lab notebook, and a course-specific multimedia component. The FOSS website, FOSSweb, contains additional online activities for students and resources for parents and teachers. FOSSweb has two sister sites, FOSSweb CA, for the California 2007 edition, and FOSSweb NYC, for New York City teachers using FOSS.

==Program Use and Adoption==
FOSS is in use in every state in the country with over 100,000 teachers and 2 million students and is in approximately 16% of the nation's school districts.  FOSS was the first non-t
ex
tbook curriculum to make the California adoption list (1992) and was adopted in California for the 2007 science adoption (FOSS California K–5).  The program is on many state adoption lists and is used in 50 of the 100 largest U.S. school districts.  FOSS is cited as an exemplary program in publications by nationally recognized organizations in the science reform movement, including National Science Resources Center,&lt;ref&gt;Resources for Teaching Elementary Science, 1996; Science for All Children, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Science Teachers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Pathways to the National Standards, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

FOSS has been approved as a recommended science program in each of the adoption states in which it has been submitted.

The '''G20 Research Group''' was founded by [[John Kirton]] in February 2008 as a global network of scholars, students and professionals in the academic, research, business, non-governmental and other communities who follow the work of the [[G-20 major economies|G20]]. In 2009, Kirton was joined by co-directors Alan Alexandroff, Research Director of the Program on Conflict Management and Negotiation at the [[Munk School of Global Affairs]] at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]] in the [[University of Toronto]], and Donald Brean, Professor of Finance and Business Economics at the [[Rotman School of Management]] at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name=G20RG-pdf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/G20RG.pdf |author=G20 Research Group |publisher=University of Toronto  |title=G20 Research Group |accessdate=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the work done by the [[G8 Research Group]], which has been following the G20 finance ministers and central banker governors since they began meeting in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=G8 Research Group |publisher=University of Toronto  |url=http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/about/g8rg_about.htm |title=About the G8 Research Group |accessdate=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the G20 Research Group aims to serve as the world's leading independent source of information and analysis on the G20.&lt;ref name=G20RG-pdf /&gt;

The G20 Research Group publishes the [http://www.g20.utoronto.ca G20 Information Centre] website, which provides a permanent collection of G20-related documents and information. It also conducts programs of research, teaching, and information and public education.

Whenever possible the G20 Research Group, like the G8 Research Group, sends a field team to the summits and finance meetings of the G20 to assist the world's media on site and to collect documentation uniquely available there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Allan |last=Woods |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/article/818745--g8-g20-summit-junkies-gear-up |title=G8/G20 summit junkies gear up |journal=[[Toronto Star]] |date=June 3, 2010 |accessdate=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Graham F. |last=Scott |url=http://this.org/blog/2010/06/15/5-independent-news-sources-g20/ |title=5 independent news sources to follow the G20 with| journal=[[This Magazine]] |date=June 15, 2010 |accessdate=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geoprofessions''' is a term coined by the Geoprofessional Business Association to connote various technical disciplines that involve engineering, earth and environmental services applied to below-ground (“subsurface”), ground-surface, and ground-surface-connected conditions, structures, or formations. The principal disciplines include, as major categories:
* [[geomatics engineering]]
* [[#Geotechnical-engineering specialties|geotechnical engineering]];
* [[#Engineering geology and other geology specialties|geology and engineering geology]];
* [[#Geological engineering|geological engineering]];
* [[#Geophysics|geophysics]];

Each discipline involves specialties, many of which are recognized through professional designations that governments and societies or associations confer based upon a person’s education, training, experience, and educational accomplishments. In the United States, engineers must be licensed in the state or territory where they practice engineering. Most states license geologists and several license environmental “site professionals.” Several states license engineering geologists and recognize geotechnical engineering through a geotechnical-engineering titling act.

==Geotechnical-engineering specialties==
{{main|Geotechnical engineering}}
Although geotechnical engineering is applied for a variety of purposes, it is essential to foundation design. As such, geotechnical engineering is applicable to every existing or new structure on the planet; every building and every highway, bridge, tunnel, harbor, airport, water line, reservoir, or other public work. Commonly, the geotechnical-engineering service comprises a study of subsurface conditions using various sampling, in-situ testing, and/or other site-characterization techniques. The instrument of professional service in those cases typically is a report through which geotechnical engineers relate the information they have been retained to provide, typically: their findings; their opinions about subsurface materials and conditions; their judgment about how the subsurface materials and conditions assumed to exist probably will behave when subjected to loads or used as building material; and their preliminary recommendations for materials usage or appropriate foundation systems, the latter based on their knowledge of a structure’s size, shape, weight, etc., and the subsurface/structure interactions likely to occur. [[Civil engineers]], [[structural engineers]], and [[architects]], feasibly among other members of the project team, apply the geotechnical findings and preliminary recommendations to take the structure’s design forward. They realize these preliminary recommendations are subject to change, however, because – as a matter of practical necessity related to the [[Observational method (geotechnics)|observational method]] inherent to geotechnical engineering – geotechnical engineers base their recommendations on the composition of samples taken from a tiny portion of a site whose actual subsurface conditions are unknowable before excavation, because they are hidden by earth and/or rock and/or water. For this reason, as a key component of a complete geotechnical engineering service, geotechnical engineers employ construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET) to observe subsurface materials as they are exposed through excavation. To help achieve economies on their clients’ behalf, geotechnical engineers assign their field representatives – specially educated and trained paraprofessionals – to observe the excavated materials and the excavations themselves in light of conditions the geotechnical engineers opined to exist. When differences are discovered, the geotechnical engineers evaluate the new findings and, when necessary, modify their design and construction recommendations. Because such changes could require other members of the design and construction team to modify their designs, specifications, and proposed methods, many owners have their geotechnical engineers serve as active members of the project team from project inception to conclusion, working with others to help ensure appropriate application of geotechnical information and judgments.

In other cases, geotechnical engineering goes beyond a study and construction recommendations to include design of soil and rock structures. The most common of these are the [[Road surface|pavements]] that make up our streets and highways, airport runways, and bridge and tunnel decks, among other paved improvements. Geotechnical engineers design the pavements in terms of the subgrade, subbase, and base layers of materials to be used, and the thickness and composition of each. Geotechnical engineers also design the earth-retention walls associated with structures such as levees, earthen dams, reservoirs, and landfills. In other cases, the design is applied to contain earth, via structures such as excavation-support systems and retaining walls. Sometimes referred to as geostructural engineering or geostructural design, these services are also intrinsic to [[hydraulic engineering]], [[Hydrogeological|hydrogeologic engineering]], [[coastal engineering]], geologic engineering and [[Civil engineering#Water resources engineering|water-resources engineering]]. Geotechnical-engineering design is also applied for structures such as tunnels, bridges, dams, and other structures beneath, on, or connected to the surface of the earth. Geotechnical engineering, like geology, engineering geology, and geologic engineering, also involves the specialties of [[rock mechanics]] and [[soil mechanics]], and often requires knowledge of [[geotextiles]] and [[geosynthetics]], as well as an array of instrumentation and monitoring equipment, to help ensure specified conditions are achieved and maintained.

[[Earthquake engineering]] and landslide detection, remediation, and prevention are geoprofessional services associated with specialized types of geotechnical engineering (as well as [[#Geophysics|geophysics]]; see below), as is forensic geotechnical engineering, a geoprofessional service applied to determine why a certain applicable type of event – usually a failure of some sort – occurred. (Virtually all geoprofessional services can be performed for forensic purposes, commonly as litigation-support/[[expert witness]] services.) [[Railway systems engineering|Railway-systems engineering]] is another type of specialized geotechnical engineering, as are the design of [[piers]] and [[Bulkhead (barrier)|bulkheads]], [[drydocks]], on-shore and off-shore [[Wind turbine|wind-turbine]] systems, and systems that stabilize [[oil platforms]] and other marine structures to the sea floor.

Geotechnical engineers have long been involved in [[sustainability]] initiatives, including  (among many others) the use of excavated materials; the safe application of contaminated subsurface materials; the recycling of asphalt, concrete, and building rubble and debris; and the design of [[permeable paving|permeable pavements]].

All [[Civil engineering|civil-engineering]] specialties and projects – roads and highways, bridges, rail systems, ports and other waterfront structures, airport terminals, etc. – require the involvement of geotechnical engineers and engineering, meaning that many civil-engineering pursuits are geoprofessional pursuits to a greater or lesser degree. However, geotechnical engineering has for centuries also been associated with [[military engineering]]; [[sappers]] (in general) and [[miners]] (whose tunneling design services (known as [[Mining (military)|landmining]] and [[Mining (military)|undermining]]) were used in military-siege operations).

==Engineering geology and other geology specialties==
{{main|Geology|Engineering geology}}
Engineering geologist.
(a) Elements of the engineering geologist specialty. 
The practice of engineering geology involves the interpretation, evaluation, analysis, and application of geological information and data to civil works. Geotechnical soil and rock units are designated, characterized, and classified, using standard engineering soil and rock classification systems. Relationships are interpreted between landform development, current and past geologic processes, ground and surface water, and the strength characteristics of soil and rock. Processes evaluated include both surficial processes (for example, slope, fluvial, and coastal processes), and deep-seated processes (for example, volcanic activity and seismicity). Geotechnical zones or domains are designated based on soil and rocked geological strength characteristics, common landforms, related geologic processes, or other pertinent factors. Proposed developmental modifications are evaluated and, where appropriate, analyzed to predict potential or likely changes in types and rates of surficial geologic processes. Proposed modifications may include such things as vegetation removal, using various types of earth materials in construction, applying loads to shallow or deep foundations, constructing cut or fill slopes and other grading, and modifying ground and surface water flow. The effects of surficial and deep-seated geologic processes are evaluated and analyzed to predict their potential effect on public health, public safety, land use, or proposed development.
(b) Typical engineering geologic applications and types of projects. Engineering geology is applied during all project phases, from conception through planning, design, construction, maintenance, and, in some cases, reclamation and closure. Planning-level engineering geologic work is commonly conducted in response to forest practice regulations, critical areas ordinances, and the State Environmental Policy Act. Typical planning-level engineering geologic applications include timber harvest planning, proposed location of residential and commercial developments and other buildings and facilities, and alternative route selection for roads, rail lines, trails, and utilities. Site-specific engineering geologic applications include cuts, fills, and tunnels for roads, trails, railroads, and utility lines; foundations for bridges and other drainage structures, retaining walls and shoring, dams, buildings, water towers, slope, channel and shoreline stabilization facilities, fish ladders and hatcheries, ski lifts and other structures; landings for logging and other work platforms; airport landing strips; rock bolt systems; blasting; and other major earthwork projects such as for aggregate sources and landfills.

While engineering geology is applicable principally to planning, design and construction activities, other specialties of geology are applied in a variety of geoprofessional specialty fields, such as [[mining geology]], [[petroleum geology]], and [[environmental geology]]. Note that mining geology and [[mining engineering]] are different geoprofessional fields.

==Geological engineering==
{{distinguish|Climate engineering}}
'''Geological engineering''' is a hybrid discipline that comprises elements of [[civil engineering]], [[mining engineering]], [[petroleum engineering]], and [[earth sciences]]. Geological engineers often become licensed as both engineers and geologists. There are thirteen geological-engineering (or '''geoengineering''') programs in the United States that are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET: (1) Colorado School of Mines, (2) Michigan Technological University, (3) Missouri University of Science and Technology, (4) Montana Tech of the University of Montana, (5) South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, (6) University of Alaska-Fairbanks, (7) [[University of Minnesota]] Twin Cities, (8) [[University of Mississippi]], (9) [[University of Nevada, Reno]] (10) University of North Dakota, (11) University of Texas at Austin, (12) University of Utah, and (13) University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Other schools offer programs or classes in geological engineering, including the [[University of Arizona]].

'''Geoengineering''' or '''geological engineering''', [[engineering geology]], and [[geotechnical engineering]] deal with the discovery, development, and production and use of subsurface earth resources, as well as the design and construction of [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]. Geoengineering is the application of [[geosciences]], where mechanics, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and geology are used to understand and shape our interaction with the earth.

Geoengineers work in areas of
# [[mining]], including surface and subsurface [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]]s, and [[rock burst]] mitigation
# energy, including [[hydraulic fracturing]] and [[Boring (earth)|drilling]] for exploration and production of water, oil, or gas
# infrastructure, including [[Rapid transit|underground transportation]] systems and isolation of [[nuclear waste|nuclear]] and [[hazardous waste]]s; and
# environment, including [[groundwater flow]], contaminant transport and remediation, and hydraulic structures.

Professional [[List of geoscience organizations|geoscience organizations]] such as the [[American Rock Mechanics Association]] or the [[Geo-Institute]] and academic degrees such as the bachelor of geoengineering accredited by [[ABET]] acknowledge the broad scope of work practiced by geoengineers and stress fundamentals of science and engineering methods for the solution of complex problems. Geoengineers study the mechanics of rock, [[soil mechanics|soil]], and fluids to improve the sustainable use of earth’s finite resources, where problems appear with competing interests, for example, groundwater and waste isolation, [[Offshore drilling|offshore]] [[oil drilling]] and risk of spills, natural gas production and [[induced seismicity]].

==Geophysics==
{{main|Geophysics|Exploration geophysics}}
Geophysics is the study of the physical properties of the earth using quantitative physical methods to determine what lies beneath the earth's surface.  The physical properties of concern include the propagation of elastic waves (seismic), magnetism, gravity, electrical resistivity/conductivity, and electromagnetism.  Geophysics has historically been most commonly used in oil exploration and mining, but its popularity in non-destructive investigative work has flourished since the early 1990s.  It is also used in groundwater exploration and protection, geo-hazard studies (e.g., faults and landslides), alignment studies (e.g., proposed roadway, underground utilities, and pipelines), foundation studies, contamination characterization and remediation, landfill investigations, unexploded-ordnance investigations, vibration monitoring, dam-safety evaluation, location of underground storage tanks, identification of subsurface voids, and assisting in archeological investigations. (definition from Association of Environmental &amp; Engineering Geologists)

==Geophysical engineering==
'''Geophysical engineering''' is the application of geophysics to the engineering design of facilities including roads, tunnels, and mines.

==Environmental-science and environmental-engineering specialties==
{{main|Environmental science|Environmental engineering}}
Environmental science and environmental engineering are the geoprofessions commonly associated with the identification, remediation, and prevention of environmental contamination. These services range from phase-one and phase-two [[Environmental Site Assessment|environmental site-assessments]] – research designed to assess the likelihood that a property is contaminated and subsurface exploration conducted to identify the nature and extent of contamination, respectively – up through the design of processes and systems to remediate contaminated sites for the protection of human health and the environment.

[[Environmental geology]] is one of the principal geoprofessions engaged in assessing and remediating contaminated sites. Environmental geologists help identify the subsurface [[stratigraphy]] in which contaminants are located and through which they migrate. [[Environmental chemistry]] is the geoprofession that encompasses the study of chemical compounds in the soil.  These compounds are categorized as pollutants or contaminants when introduced into the environment by human factors (e.g., waste, mining processes, radioactive release) and are not of natural origin. Environmental chemistry assesses interactions or these compounds with soil, rock, and water to determine their fate and transport, the techniques to measure the levels of contaminants in the environment, and technologies to destroy or reduce the toxicity of contaminants in wastes or compounds that have been released to the environment. [[Environmental engineering]] is often applied to assess contaminated sites, but more often is used in the design of systems to remediate contaminated soil and groundwater.

[[Hydrogeology]] is the geoprofession involved when environmental studies involve subsurface water. Hydrogeology applications range from securing safe, plentiful underground drinking-water sources to identifying the nature of groundwater contamination in order to facilitate remediation. [[Environmental toxicology]] is a geoprofession when used to identify the source, fate, transformation, effects, and risks of pollutants on the environment, including soil, water, and air. [[Society of Wetland Scientists|Wetlands science]] is a geoprofessional pursuit that incorporates several scientific disciplines, such as [[botany]], [[biology]], and [[limnology]]. It involves, among other activities, the delineation, conservation, restoration, and preservation of wetlands. These services are sometimes conducted by geoprofessional specialists called [[Society of Wetland Scientists|wetlands scientists]]. [[Ecology]] is a closely related environmental geoprofession involving studies into the distribution of organisms and biodiversity within an environmental context.
 
Numerous geoprofessional disciplines contribute to the redevelopment of [[brownfields]], sites (typically urban) that are underused or abandoned because they are or are assumed to be contaminated by hazardous materials. Geoprofessionals are engaged to evaluate the degree to which such sites are contaminated and the steps that can be taken to achieve the sites’ safe reuse. Environmental engineers and scientists work with developers to identify and design remediation strategies and exposure-barrier designs that protect future site users from unacceptable exposure to environmental contamination resulting from previous uses of the site. Because these previous uses often resulted in degraded soil conditions and the presence of abandoned, underground structures, geotechnical engineers often are needed to design special foundations for the new structures.

==Construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET)==
Construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET) comprises an array of licensed-engineer-directed professional services applied principally for purposes of construction quality assurance and quality control. CoMET services commonly are provided as a separate discipline by firms that also practice geotechnical engineering, possibly among other geoprofessional disciplines. The geoprofessional-service industry has evolved in this manner because geotechnical engineering employs the observational method. [[Karl von Terzaghi]] and [[Ralph B. Peck]] – the creators of modern geotechnical engineering – used the [[Observational method (geotechnics)|observational method]] and multiple working hypotheses to expedite and economize the subsurface-exploration process, by using sampling and testing to form a judgment about subsurface conditions, and then observing excavated conditions and materials to confirm or modify those judgments and related recommendations, and then finalize them. To economize still further, geoprofessionals educated and trained paraprofessionals to represent them on site (hence the term “field representative”), especially to apply their judgment (much as a geotechnical engineer would) in comparing observed conditions with those the geotechnical engineer believed would exist. Over time, geotechnical engineers expanded their CoMET services by providing the additional education and training their field representatives needed to evaluate constructors’ attainment of conditions commonly specified by geoprofessionals; e.g., subsurface preparation for foundations of buildings, roadways, and other structures; materials used for subgrade, subbase, and base purposes; site grading; construction of earthen structures (earth dams, levees, reservoirs, landfills, et al.) and earth-retaining structures (e.g., retaining walls); and so on. Because many of the materials involved, such as concrete, are used in other elements of construction projects and structures, geoprofessional firms expanded their field representatives’ skill sets still more, to encompass observation and testing of numerous additional materials (e.g., reinforced concrete, structural steel, masonry, wood, and fireproofing), processes (e.g., cutting and filling and rebar placement), and outcomes (e.g., the effectiveness of welds). Laboratory services are a common element of many CoMET operations. Also operating under the direction of a licensed engineer, they are applied in geotechnical engineering to evaluate subsurface-material samples. In overall CoMET operations, laboratories operate with the equipment and personnel required to evaluate a variety of construction materials.

CoMET services applied to evaluate the actual composition of a site’s subsurface are part of a complete geotechnical engineering service. For purposes of short-term economy, however, some owners select a firm not associated with the geotechnical engineer of record to provide these and all other CoMET services. This approach precludes the geotechnical engineer of record from providing a complete service. It also aggravates risk, because the individuals engaged to evaluate actual subsurface conditions are not “briefed” by the geotechnical engineer of record before they go to the project site and seldom communicate with the geotechnical engineer of record when they discern differences, in large part because the firm associated with the geotechnical engineer of record is regarded as a competitor of the firm employing the field representatives. In some cases, the field representatives in question lack the specific project background information and/or the education and training required to discern those differences.

CoMET services applied to evaluate constructor’s attainment of specified conditions take the form of quality-assurance (QA) or quality-control (QC) services. QA services are performed directly or indirectly for the owner. The owner specifies the nature and extent of QA services that the owner believes is appropriate. Some owners specify none at all or only those that may be required by law. Those required by law are imposed via a jurisdiction’s [[building code]]. Almost all U.S. jurisdictions base their building codes on “model codes” developed by associations of building officials. The [[International Code Council|International Code Council (ICC)]] is the most prominent of these groups and its [[International Building Code (IBC)]] is the most commonly used model. As a result, many jurisdictions now require IBC “Special Inspection,” a term defined by the IBC as “the required examination of the materials, installation, fabrication, erection, or placement of components and connections requiring special expertise to ensure compliance with approved construction documents and referenced standards.” Special Inspection requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction based on the provisions adopted by the local building official. While some of the services involved may be similar to or the same as conventional CoMET services, Special Inspection is handled differently. Most commonly, the owner or the owner’s agent is required to retain a building-official-approved Special Inspection-services provider. Special Inspection is often required to obtain a certificate of occupancy.

QC services are those applied by or on behalf of a constructor to ensure the constructor has attained conditions the constructor has contractually agreed to attain. Most CoMET consultants are engaged far more to provide QA services than QC services.

Many CoMET procedures are specified in standards developed by [[Standards organization#Standard-developing organizations .28SDOs.29|standards-developing organizations (SDOs)]] such as the [[American Society of Civil Engineers|American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)]], [[ASTM International]], and [[American Concrete Institute|American Concrete Institute (ACI)]], using standards-development protocols approved by the [[American National Standards Institute|American National Standards Institute (ANSI)]] and/or the [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]]. All such standards identify what is minimally required to conform. Likewise, several organizations have developed programs to accredit CoMET field and laboratory services to perform certain types of testing and inspection. Some of these programs are more comprehensive than others; e.g., requiring regular calibration of equipment, participation in proficiency testing programs, and implementation and documentation of a (quality) management system to demonstrate technical competence. As with all such programs, of course, accreditation identifies what is least acceptable. Many CoMET laboratories go far beyond minimum requirements in an effort to attain higher levels of quality.

A variety of organizations – including local building departments – have developed personnel-certification protocols and requirements. In many jurisdictions, only appropriately certified individuals are permitted to perform certain evaluations. Individuals typically are required to meet certain prerequisites for certification and must pass examinations, in some cases involving performance observation in the field. The prerequisite for higher degrees of certification often include a requirement that the individual has met requirements for a lower degree of certification (e.g., Soils Technician I is in some cases a prerequisite for Soils Technician II). It should be noted that field representatives are sometimes referred to as “soil testers,” “technicians,” “technicians/technologists,” or “engineering technicians.” The Geoprofessional Business Association developed the term “field representative” to encompass all the many types of paraprofessionals involved (e.g., those involved with specific types of materials, such as reinforced concrete, soil, or steel; those who observe or inspect processes or conditions, such as welding inspectors, caisson inspectors, and foundation inspectors), and especially to underscore their significant, mutual responsibility, that purpose titles such as “technician” fail to signify. In fact, the engineers who direct CoMET operations are personally and professionally responsible and liable for their field representatives’ acts and statements while representing the engineer on site.

Especially because CoMET consultants have more hands-on experience with construction activities than many other design-team members, many owners involve them (among other geoprofessionals) from the outset of a project, during the design phase, to help the owner and/or design team members develop technical specifications and establish testing and inspection requirements, instrumentation requirements and procedures, and observation programs. Geotechnical engineers employ CoMET services during the earliest stages of a project, to oversee subsurface sampling procedures, such as drilling.

Many of the CoMET services performed for construction projects are performed for environmental projects as well, but requirements tend to be less rigid because they involve fewer licensing and related requirements. For example, individuals may perform federally mandated all-appropriate inquiries – typically a phase-one environmental site assessment – without a license of any kind.

==Other geoprofessional services==
To the extent that [[archeology]] and [[paleontology]] require systematic subsurface excavation to recover artifacts, they, too, are considered geoprofessions. Many geoprofessional-services firms offer these services to those of their clients that need to satisfy federal and/or state regulations that require paleontological and/or archeological inquiry before site development or redevelopment activities can proceed.

The book opens with an account of the 1984 [[salmonella]] poisonings in [[The Dalles, Oregon]], caused by followers of [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]] who sprayed salmonella onto salad bars. Other research shows how [[Moscow]] scientists created an untraceable germ that would induce the body to self-destruct, and reveals that the U.S. military planned for germ warfare on [[Cuba]] during the 1960s.&lt;ref name="simonandschuster" /&gt; Three classified U.S. biodefense projects are detailed: [[Project Bacchus]], [[Project Clear Vision]], and [[Project Jefferson]].&lt;ref name="Enemark"&gt;{{cite book|last=Enemark|first=Christian |title=Disease and Security|publisher=Routledge|date=April 24, 2007|edition=GoogleBook|page=173|isbn=0-415-42234-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bT9j6lhPHHUC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=%22Project+Clear+Vision%22&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA173,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Germs'' concludes with an assessment of the United States' ability to deter future bio-attack.&lt;ref name="businessweek" /&gt;

==Reviews==
''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' was favorable, though it criticized the book's tone as "somewhat [[alarmism|alarmist]]".&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' was also generally favorable, except for pointing out some conflicting views on bioterrorism.&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_42/b3753045.htm |title=Bio-Terrorism under the Microscope |last=Arnst |first=Catherine |date=October 15, 2001 |publisher=businessweek.com |accessdate=2009-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215123330/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_42/b3753045.htm |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'''s [[book review]] by British [[psychiatrist]] [[Simon Wessely]], cautioned against [[panic]], stating that biological weapons can cause destruction through fear, effectively giving the biodefense industry "the equivalent of a [[blank cheque]]".&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/oct/20/highereducation.news1|title=Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War |last=Wessely|first=Simon |date=October 10, 2001|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a wide range of potential applications for research at high altitude, including medical, [[physiological]], and cosmic physics research.

==High-altitude medical research==
The most obvious and direct application of high-altitude research is to understand altitude illnesses such as [[acute mountain sickness]], and the rare but rapidly fatal conditions, [[high-altitude pulmonary edema]] ([[HAPE]]) and [[high-altitude cerebral edema]] ([[HACE]]).&lt;ref name=MedicalProblems&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cymerman, A |author2=Rock, PB |title=Medical Problems in High Mountain Environments. A Handbook for Medical Officers |publisher=US Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |volume=USARIEM-TN94-2 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7976 |accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altitude-sickness.org/ |title=altitude-sickness.org |accessdate=2007-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818061521/http://www.altitude-sickness.org/ |archivedate=2007-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research at high altitude is also an important way to learn about sea level conditions that are caused or complicated by [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] such as chronic lung disease and [[sepsis]]. Patients with these conditions are very complex and usually suffer from several other diseases at the same time, so it is virtually impossible to work out which of their problems is caused by lack of oxygen. Altitude research gets round this by studying the effects of oxygen deprivation on otherwise healthy people.

Travelling to high altitude is often used as a way of studying the way the body responds to a shortage of oxygen. It is difficult and prohibitively expensive to conduct some of this research at sea level

Although the shortage of air contributes to the effects on the human body, research has found that most altitude sicknesses can be linked to the lack of atmospheric pressure. At low elevation, the pressure is higher because the molecules of air are compressed from the weight of the air above them. However, at higher elevations, the pressure is lower and the molecules are more dispersed. The percentage of oxygen in the air at sea level is the same at high altitudes. But because the air molecules are more spread out at higher altitudes, each breath takes in less oxygen to the body. With this in mind, the lungs take in as much air as possible, but because the atmospheric pressure is lower the molecules are more dispersed, resulting in a lower amount of oxygen per breath.

At 26,000 feet the body reaches a maximum and can no longer adjust to the altitude, often referred to as the "Death Zone".

It lies about {{convert|28|km}} northeast of the capital city [[Kathmandu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moste.gov.np/%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%81/department_of_environment|title=Department of Environment {{!}} Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Information Technology Park was completed in April 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cankavre.org.np/aboutus.php|publisher=CANKavre.org.np|title=CAN Kavre, Nepal|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a total investment of [[Nepalese Rupees|NRs]]. 270 million (~ {{To USD|270|Nepal|round=yes}} million USD). The initiation of the Park was formally done by an American company IBM but it left after nine months.&lt;ref name="nepalnews" /&gt; Javra Software Company from the [[Netherlands]] had also started work but it too left, stating technical reasons and shifted to [[Kathmandu]]. By July 2014, it has not come into operation, as a result of which the [[Government of Nepal]] is missing millions of rupees in [[revenue]]. The government has formed a department named the Department of Information Technology for the socio-economic transformation to form a developed country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infodev.com.np/doit/index.php/frontend/detail/1|title=Department of Information Technology (सुचना प्रविधि बिभाग)|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doit.gov.np/newsite/index.php/frontend/detail/2|title=Department of Information Technology|publisher=Doit.gov.np|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and objectives==

The IT Park was established under the [[Ministry of Industry (Nepal)|Ministry of Industry]], for the development and promotion of information technology and services in the country. It has been said to be providing employment opportunities to about 15,000 technicians after the full range of operations of the IT Park.&lt;ref name="myrepublica" /&gt; It has aimed to provide government services&lt;ref name="doit" /&gt; by maximizing the use of information and technology.

==Land and distribution==

The Park has been distributed within the area of 235 Ropanis ({{convert|12|hectare|m2}}) consisting of a commercial building, an administrative building, four residential buildings and a security building built by investing [[Nepalese Rupees|NRs]]. 500 million (~ {{To USD|500|Nepal|round=yes}} million USD).&lt;ref name="nepalnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nepalnews.com/archive/2013/feb/feb07/news07.php|title=Kavre's IT park fails to come into operation even after 17 yrs|date=7 February 2013|publisher=Nepalnews.com|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4824">'''Interdisciplinary Peer Review''' (IPR) is a [[peer review]] process with an additional focus outside of the area of the author's subject of expertise. Disciplines such as [[Telecommunications]], [[Political Science]], [[Engineering]], and [[Medicine]] require specific subject matter expertise, however, they still cross multiple disciplines and may require review from many alternate functional areas to achieve maximum perspective to prevent duplication or improper publication. Reviews of this nature may also cross cultures, race, and other demographics to gain perspective.

==Reduplication and Interdisciplinarity==

''In Peer Commentary on Peer Review: A case study in scientific quality control,'' Stevan R. Harnard (p.&amp;nbsp;15) begins to touch on the concept by asking how well does the review process work and what prevents re-duplication. Julie Klein defined interdisciplinarity as new divisions of intellectual labor, collaborative research, team teaching, hybrid fields, comparative studies, increased borrowing across disciplines, and a variety of unified, holistic perspectives that have created pressures upon traditional divisions of knowledge. She goes on to describe how interdisplinarity is used to accomplish: -Answers to complex questions-Address broad issues-Explore disciplinary and professional relations-To solve problems beyond the scope of any one discipline-To achieve unity of knowledge, whether on a limited or grand scale.

==Differences==
The difference between an Interdisciplinary Peer Review and Interdisciplinarity is that the [[peer group]] in Interdisciplinary Peer Review crosses social, economic, and educational groups. Access to the review process allows greater input from a wider array or potential researchers.

==Open Interdisciplinary Peer Review Via Social Networking==
Open Interdisciplinary Peer Review via Social Networking –The nature and ease of social networking sites makes Interdisciplinary Peer Review a reality. The issue becomes the informality of the review. This informality makes the review more of an "Open Peer Review" rather than a formalized review. Surprisingly in Encouraging Formative Peer Review Via Social Networking Sites, Bassford (E.67) finds that a high percentage of student's feel social networking is useful for enhancing learning, but only a small portion want to use it for such activities.

==Dilemma==
Validation of information in an Open Interdisciplinary Peer Review is an ongoing or second Interdisciplinary Peer Review. Interdisciplinary Peer Review is a continual process of review.  When publication is instant and prior to a review, the accuracy falls under scrutiny in the Open review nature of social media.  The level of accuracy potentially becomes more variable as the non peer group dissemination increases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10221">'''International scientific vocabulary''' ('''ISV''') comprises scientific and specialized words whose language of origin may or may not be certain, but which are in current use in several modern languages (that is, [[translingualism|translingually]]). The name "International Scientific Vocabulary" was first used by Philip Gove in ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Webster’s Third New International Dictionary]]'' (1961).&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, Tom (editor), ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language.'' Oxford University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Crystal,&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language.'' Cambridge University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; science is an especially productive field for new coinages.

==Instances==
According to ''Webster's Third'', "some ISV words (like [[haploid]]) have been created by taking a word with a rather general and simple meaning from one of the languages of antiquity, usually [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], and conferring upon it a very specific and complicated meaning for the purposes of modern [[scientific]] discourse." An ISV word is typically a [[classical compound]] or a derivative which "gets only its raw materials, so to speak, from antiquity." Its morphology may vary across languages.

The online version of Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (Merriam-Webster, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;The online version is available by subscription.&lt;/ref&gt; adds that the ISV "consists of words or other linguistic forms current in two or more languages" that "differ from [[New Latin]] in being adapted to the structure of the individual languages in which they appear."&lt;ref&gt;"International scientific vocabulary." [http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged. Merriam-Webster, 2002.]  Accessed July 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, ISV terms are often made with Greek, Latin, or other [[combining form]]s, but each language pronounces the resulting neo-lexemes [[Hobson-Jobson#Law of Hobson-Jobson|within its own phonemic "comfort zone"]], and makes morphological connections using its normal morphological system. In this respect ISV can be viewed as heavily borrowing [[loanword]]s from [[New Latin]]. 

McArthur&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, Tom, [http://kdictionaries.com/lia-intro.html "Asian Lexicography: Past, Present, and Prospective", ''Lexicography in Asia'' (Introduction). Password Publishers Limited, 1998.] Accessed January 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; characterizes ISV words and morphemes as "[[International word|translinguistic]]", explaining that they operate "in many languages that serve as mediums for education, culture, science, and technology." Besides European languages, such as Russian, Swedish, English, and Spanish, ISV lexical items also function in Japanese, Malay, Philippine languages, and other Asian languages. According to McArthur, no other set of words and morphemes is so international.

The ISV is one of the concepts behind the development and standardization of the [[constructed language]] called [[Interlingua]]. Scientific and medical terms in Interlingua are largely of Greco-Latin origin, but, like most Interlingua words, they appear in a wide range of languages. Interlingua's vocabulary is established using a group of ''control languages'' selected because they radiate words into, and absorb words from, a large number of other languages. A ''prototyping'' technique then selects the most recent common ancestor of each eligible Interlingua word or affix. The word or affix takes a contemporary form based on the control languages. This procedure is meant to give Interlingua the most generally international vocabulary possible.&lt;ref&gt;Gode, Alexander, ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language]]''. New York: Storm Publishers, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other differences==
Another difference between scientific terms and classical Latin and Greek is that many compounded scientific terms do not [[elision|elide]] the [[inflection]] vowel at the end of a [[root (linguistics)|root]] before another root or prefix that starts with a vowel, e.g. [[gastroenteritis|gastr'''o'''enteritis]]; but elision happens in [[gastrectomy]] (not gastroectomy).

The Greek word τέρας (τέρατο-) = "[[monster]]" is usually used to mean "monster (abnormal)" (e.g. [[teratology]], [[teratogen]]), but some biological names use it to mean "monster (enormous)" (e.g. the extinct animals ''[[Teratornis]]'' (a [[condor]] with a 12-foot wingspan) and ''[[Terataspis]]'' (a [[trilobite]] 2 feet long)).

It occurred 41,400 (±2,000) years ago during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] and was first recognised in the late 1960s as a geomagnetic reversal recorded in the  Laschamp lava flows in the [[Clermont-Ferrand]] district of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bonhommet |first=N. |author2=Zähringer, J. |year=1969 |title=Paleomagnetism and potassium argon age determinations of the Laschamp geomagnetic polarity event |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=6 |pages=43–46 |doi=10.1016/0012-821x(69)90159-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetic excursion has since been demonstrated in geological archives from many parts of the world. The period of reversed magnetic field was approximately 440 years, with the transition from the normal field lasting approximately 250 years. The reversed field was 75% weaker, whereas the strength dropped to only 5% of the current strength during the transition. This reduction in geomagnetic field strength resulted in more [[cosmic rays]] reaching the [[Earth]], causing greater production of the [[Cosmogenic nuclide|cosmogenic isotopes]] [[beryllium 10]] and [[carbon 14]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phys.org/news/2012-10-extremely-reversal-geomagnetic-field-climate.html |title=An extremely brief reversal of the geomagnetic field, climate variability and a super volcano|last=Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Laschamp event was the first known geomagnetic excursion and remains the most thoroughly studied among the known geomagnetic excursions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://booksite.elsevier.com/brochures/geophysics/PDFs/00095.pdf |website=elsevier.com |title=5.10 Geomagnetic Excursions |accessdate=31 January 2018 |date=2007 |first1=C. |last1=Laj |first2=J.

[[File:Disciplines mind map.jpg|thumb|Mind map of top level disciplines and professions]]
The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of an topical guide to academic disciplines:

An '''academic discipline''' or '''field of study''' is known as a branch of [[knowledge]]. It is [[education|taught]] as an accredited part of [[higher education]]. A scholar's discipline is commonly defined and recognized by a [[faculty (division)|university faculties.]] That person will be accredited by [[learned society|learned societies]] to which he or she belongs along with the [[academic journal]]s in which he or she publishes. However, no formal criteria exist for defining an academic discipline.

Disciplines varies between universities and programs. These discipline will have well-defined rosters of journals and conferences supported by a few universities and publications. A discipline may have branches, that are called sub-disciplines.

There is no consensus on how some academic disciplines should be classified (e.g., whether [[anthropology]] and [[linguistics]] are disciplines of [[social science]]s or fields within the [[humanities]]). More generally, the proper criteria for organizing knowledge into disciplines are also open to debate.

[[Natural history]] specimen dealers had an important role in the development of science in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. They supplied the rapidly growing, both in size and number, museums and educational establishments and private collectors whose collections, either in entirety or parts finally entered [[List of natural history museums|museums]].
Most sold not just [[Zoological specimen|zoological]], [[Botany|botanical]] and [[Geology|geological]] specimens but also 
equipment and books. Many also sold [[Archaeology|archaeological]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] items.They purchased 
specimens from professional and amateur collectors, sometimes collected themselves as well as acting as agents for the sale of 
collections. Many were based in [[Mercantilism|mercantile]] centres notably [[Amsterdam]], [[Hamburg]], and [[London]] or 
in major cities. Some were specialists and some were [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] authorities who wrote scientific works and manuals, some functioned as trading museums or institutes.

'''Los Angeles Science Teachers Network''' is a professional development network for [[science education]] by science teachers for science teachers committed to creating the most engaging hands-on curriculum possible through [[inquiry-based learning]] and [[scientific literacy]].

==History==
The first meeting was held in [[Lisa Ellen Niver]]'s home in September 2009. In October 2013, the professional development network had its fifteenth session. Over seventy teachers and forty schools have been involved to date. In ''[[Westside Today]]'', information about teaching, science and LASTN was presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Advisory Council==
Several teachers formed the core group and served as advisors to Niver over the first three years: Susan Bagdasarian, Sasha Moore, Joseph Rose and Judy Weiskopf. Niver was frequently asked about teaching science, she has been quoted in Parenting.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.parenting.com/gallery/everyday-ways-sneak-learning |title      =Everyday Ways to Sneak in Learning |work     =Parenting.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PBS]].org,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  https://www.pbs.org/parents/education/science/tips/weather-science-lessons/ |title      =Weather Science Lessons |work      = PBS.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Green Living Arizona'' (in print),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.greenlivingaz.com/2012/05/08/5528/ |title      =Science vs. Nutrition the GMO debate |work      =Green Living Magazine Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Huffington Post''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url        =  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/14/back-to-school-divorce-teachers_n_1761147.html?ir=Divorce#slide=1376638 |title      =Back to School 2012: Teachers Reveal Divorced Parents Biggest Mistakes |work     =  Huffington Post | date=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on National television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqZqdq7Al24 |title      =Career Day |work     =National Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        = http://www.sciencebuddies.org/blog/2012/08/success-story-science-fair-projects-with-real-world-impact.php |title      =  Success Story: Science Fair Projects with Real-World Impact |work      =Science Buddies}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Niver is on sabbatical with [[We Said Go Travel]], Susan Bagdasarian has been the director of the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lisa-niver-rajna/0/871/6a3f |title      =LASTN |work     =LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.linkedin.com/company/3148346?trk=tyah |title      =LASTN company |work     =LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kiefer 14-04-2014 Vollmond fullmoon (13856458823).jpg|200px|thumb|Despite all of the beliefs, no valid scientific study has ever found a significant extraordinary effect of the [[full Moon]] on life on Earth.]]

The term '''lunar effect''' refers to real or imaginary correlations between specific stages of the roughly 29.5-day [[lunar cycle]] and behavior and physiological changes in living beings on Earth, including humans. In some cases the purported effect may depend on external cues, such as the amount of [[moonlight]]. In other cases, such as the approximately monthly cycle of [[menstruation]] in humans (but not other mammals), the coincidence in timing reflects no known lunar influence.

A considerable number of studies have examined the effect on humans. By the late 1980s, there were at least 40 published studies on the purported lunar-lunacy connection,&lt;ref name="RottonKelly1985" /&gt; and at least 20 published studies on the purported lunar-birthrate connection.&lt;ref name="MartensKelly1988" /&gt;  This has allowed several extensive literature reviews and meta-analyses to be produced, which have found no correlation between the lunar cycle and human biology or behavior.&lt;ref name="RottonKelly1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MartensKelly1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kelly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FosterRoenneberg2008" /&gt;

==Origins of the belief==
Examples of the belief have been found in ancient [[Assyria]]n/[[Babylonia]]n writing.&lt;ref name="skepdic"&gt;{{cite web

  | authorlink = Robert Todd Carroll

  | date = 12 August 2011
  | url = http://www.skepdic.com/fullmoon.html
  | accessdate = 22 October 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contexts==
Claims of a lunar connection have appeared in the following contexts:

===Fertility===
{{see also|Menstrual cycle#The Moon}}
It is widely believed that the Moon has a relationship with [[fertility]] due to the corresponding human [[menstrual cycle]], which averages 28 days.&lt;ref name="skepdic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="straightdope-menstruation"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Adams | first = Cecil | authorlink = Cecil Adams

  | url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1348/whats-the-link-between-the-moon-and-menstruation
  | accessdate = 14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no connection between lunar rhythms and menstrual onset has been conclusively shown to exist, and the similarity in length between the two cycles is most likely coincidental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=William A. Gutsch|title=1001 things everyone should know about the universe|date=1997|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=9780385482233|page=57|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barash|first1=David P.|last2=Lipton|first2=Judith Eve|title=How women got their curves and other just-so stories evolutionary enigmas|date=2009|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780231518390|edition=[Online-Ausg.].|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fZM2AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT64|chapter=Synchrony and Its Discontents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birth rate ===
Three studies carried out between 1959 and 1973 reported a 1 percent increase in births in New York following a full Moon.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}  However, multiple studies have found no connection between [[birth rate]] and lunar phases.  A 1957 analysis of 9,551 births in [[Danville, PA]], found no correlation between birth rate and the phase of the Moon.&lt;ref name="Abell1979" /&gt; Records of 11,961 live births and 8,142 natural births (not induced by drugs or cesarean section) over a 4-year period (1974-1978) at the [[UCLA]] hospital did not correlate in any way with the cycle of lunar phases.&lt;ref name="AbellGreenspan1979" /&gt;  Analysis of 3,706 spontaneous births (excluding births resulting from induced labor) in 1994 showed no correlation with lunar phase.&lt;ref name="JoshiBharadwaj1998" /&gt;  The distribution of 167,956 spontaneous vaginal deliveries, at 37 to 40 weeks gestation, in [[Phoenix, AZ]], between 1995 and 2000, showed no relationship with lunar phase.&lt;ref name="Morton-PradhanBay2005" /&gt;  Analysis of 564,039 births (1997 to 2001) in [[North Carolina]] showed no predictable influence of the lunar cycle on deliveries or complications.&lt;ref name="ArlissKaplan2005" /&gt;  Analysis of 6,725 deliveries (2000 to 2006) in [[Hannover, Germany|Hannover]] revealed no significant correlation of birth rate to lunar phases.&lt;ref name="StaboulidouSoergel2008" /&gt;  A 2001 analysis of 70,000,000 birth records from the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] revealed no correlation between birth rate and lunar phase.&lt;ref name="Caton2001" /&gt;  An extensive review of 21 studies from 7 different countries showed that the majority of studies reported no relationship to lunar phase, and that the positive studies were inconsistent with each other.&lt;ref name="MartensKelly1988" /&gt;  A review of 6 additional studies from 5 different countries similarly showed no evidence of relationship between birth rate and lunar phase.&lt;ref name="KellyMartens1994" /&gt;

=== Blood loss===
It is sometimes claimed that surgeons used to refuse to operate during the full Moon because of the increased risk of death of the patient through blood loss.&lt;ref name="RomanSoriano2004"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2013}}{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  One team, in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], reported a weak correlation between lunar phase and hospital admissions due to [[gastrointestinal bleeding]], but only when comparing full Moon days to all non-full Moon days lumped together.&lt;ref name="RomanSoriano2004" /&gt;  This methodology has been criticized, and the statistical significance of the results disappears if one compares day 29 of the lunar cycle (full Moon) to days 9, 12, 13, or 27 of the lunar cycle, which all have an almost equal number of hospital admissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margot|first1=JL|title=No evidence of purported lunar effect on hospital admission rates or birth rates.|journal=Nursing Research|date=2015|volume=64|issue=3|pages=168–73|pmid=25756232|doi=10.1097/nnr.0000000000000086|pmc=4418782}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spanish team acknowledged that the wide variation in the number of admissions throughout the lunar cycle limited the interpretation of the results.&lt;ref name="RomanSoriano2004" /&gt;

In October 2009, British politician [[David Tredinnick (politician)|David Tredinnick]] asserted that during a full Moon "[s]urgeons will not operate because blood clotting is not effective and the police have to put more people on the street.".&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091014/debtext/91014-0022.htm#09101453000053 Hansard, 14 Oct 2009 : Column 414]&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] said they would "laugh their heads off" at the suggestion they could not operate on the full Moon.&lt;ref name=RCS&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/iandouglas/100005822/mps-believe-the-funniest-things/|title=MPs believe the funniest things|date=11 October 2010|author=Ian Douglas|publisher =Daily Telegraph|accessdate=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human behavior===

====Mental Illness====
Two studies found evidence that those with mental disorders i.e. Schizophrenia generally exhibit 1.8% of increased violent or aggressive episodes during the full Moon,&lt;ref name="Drum1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieber1978" /&gt; but a more recent study found no such correlation to that of nonschizophrenic human beings.&lt;ref name="Owen1998" /&gt;  An analysis of mental-health data found a significant effect of Moon phases, but only on [[schizophrenic]] patients.&lt;ref name="Barr2000" /&gt;  Such effects are not necessarily related directly to the appearance of the Moon. &lt;!-- The epilepsy section used to come immediately after this, as an implied explanation for the effect. --&gt;

====Epilepsy====
A study into epilepsy found a significant negative correlation between the mean number of seizures per day and the fraction of the Moon that is illuminated, but this correlation disappeared when the local clarity of the night sky was controlled for, suggesting that it is the brightness of the night sky, and not the lunar phase per se, that influences the occurrence of epileptic seizures with advanced photosensitive epilepsy.&lt;ref name="BaxendaleFisher2008" /&gt;

====Law and order====
Senior police officers in [[Brighton]], UK announced in June 2007 that they were planning to deploy more officers over the summer to counter trouble they believe is linked to the lunar cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,2095945,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Police link full moon to aggression | first=Fred | last=Attewill | date=5 June 2007 | accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed research by the [[Sussex Police]] force that concluded there was a rise in violent crime when the Moon was full. A spokeswoman for the police force said "research carried out by us has shown a correlation between violent incidents and full moons". A police officer responsible for the research told the BBC that "From my experience of 19 years of being a police officer, undoubtedly on full moons we do seem to get people with sort of strange behavior - more fractious, argumentative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/southern_counties/6723911.stm |title=Crackdown on lunar-fuelled crime |publisher=BBC News |date=5 June 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police in [[Ohio]] and [[Kentucky]] have blamed temporary rises in crime on the full Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?Date=20020825&amp;Category=NEWS03&amp;ArtNo=108250070&amp;Ref=AR toledoblade.com - Analysis shines light on full Moon, crime&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skepdic.com/refuge/bunk19.html Skeptic's Dictionary and Refuge: Mass Media Bunk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kypost.com/2002/jan/29/chase012902.html|title=Police busy for full moon|work=[[The Cincinnati Post|The Kentucky Post]]|publisher=[[E.

A reported correlation between Moon phase and the number of homicides in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] was found, through later analysis, not to be supported by the data and to have been the result of inappropriate and misleading statistical procedures.&lt;ref name="kelly"&gt;{{Citation

====Motorcycle fatalities====
A study of 13,029 motorcyclists killed in nighttime crashes found that there were 5.3% more fatalities on nights with a full moon compared to other nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redelmeier|first1=D|last2=Shafir|first2=E|title=The full moon and motorcycle related mortality: population based double control study|journal=BMJ|date=11 December 2017|volume=359|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/359/bmj.j5367}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors speculate that the increase might be due to visual distractions created by the moon, especially when it is near the horizon and appears abruptly between trees, around turns, etc.

====Politics====
It was suggested, by [[Guy Cramer]], president of the aerospace science company [[United Dynamics Corp]], that the full Moon might have influenced voter behavior in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|US 2000 Presidential Election]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050207110753/http://www.yfiles.com/Presidential-vote.htm #Y127; 24% of the U.S. Presidential Vote swayed by the Full Moon effect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stock market====
Several studies have argued that the stock market’s average returns are much higher during the half of the month closest to the new moon than the half closest to the full moon. The reasons for this have not been studied, but the authors suggest this may be due to lunar influences on mood.&lt;ref name="YuanZheng2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yuan|first1=Kathy Zhichao|last2=Zheng|first2=Lu|last3=Zhu|first3=Qiaoqiao|title=Are Investors Moonstruck? - Lunar Phases and Stock Returns|year=2001|issn=1556-5068|doi=10.2139/ssrn.283156|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/70z5b0ng}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YuanZheng2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yuan|first1=Kathy|last2=Zheng|first2=Lu|last3=Zhu|first3=Qiaoqiao|title=Are investors moonstruck?

&lt;!--If there is a correlation, one might compare this to findings that the stock market performs better with increased sunshine.&lt;ref name="HirshleiferShumway2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirshleifer|first1=David|last2=Shumway|first2=Tyler|title=Good Day Sunshine: Stock Returns and the Weather|journal=The Journal of Finance|volume=58|issue=3|year=2003|pages=1009–1032|issn=00221082|doi=10.1111/1540-6261.00556}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

====Meta-analyses====
A meta-analysis of thirty-seven studies that examined relationships between the Moon's four phases and human behavior revealed no significant correlation. The authors found that, of twenty-three studies that had claimed to show correlation, nearly half contained at least one [[statistics|statistical]] error.&lt;ref name="RottonKelly1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kelly"/&gt; Similarly, in a review of twenty studies examining correlations between Moon phase and suicides, most of the twenty studies found no correlation, and the ones that did report positive results were inconsistent with each other.&lt;ref name="kelly" /&gt; A 1978 review of the literature also found that lunar phases and human behavior are not related.&lt;ref name="CampbellBeets1978" /&gt;

A July 2013 study  carried out at the [[University of Basel]] in [[Switzerland]] suggests a correlation between the full Moon and human sleep quality.&lt;ref name="CajochenAltanay-Ekici2013" /&gt; Professor Cajochen and colleagues presented evidence that a lunar rhythm can modulate sleep structure in humans when measured under the highly controlled conditions of a circadian laboratory study protocol without time cues. Studying 33 volunteer subjects, the researchers found that subjective and objective measures of sleep varied according to lunar phase and thus may reflect human circalunar rhythmicity. Stringently controlled laboratory conditions, in a cross-sectional setting, were employed to exclude confounding effects such as increased light at night or the potential bias in perception. Measures of lunar influence on sleep structure, [[electroencephalograph]]ic activity during [[non-rapid eye movement sleep]] (NREM), and secretion of the hormones [[melatonin]] and [[cortisol]], were retrospectively analyzed. At no point, during and after the study, were volunteers or investigators aware of the posteriori analysis relative to lunar phase. Around full Moon it was found that electroencephalogram (EEG) delta activity during NREM sleep, an indicator of deep sleep, decreased by 30%, time to fall asleep increased by five minutes, and EEG-assessed total sleep duration was reduced by 20 minutes. These changes were associated with a decrease in subjective sleep quality and diminished endogenous melatonin levels.&lt;ref name="CajochenAltanay-Ekici2013" /&gt;  Cajochen said: "The lunar cycle seems to influence human sleep, even when one does not 'see' the Moon and is not aware of the actual Moon phase." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roberts |first=Michelle |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23405941 |title=BBC News - Full Moon 'disturbs a good night's sleep' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= 2013-07-25|accessdate=2013-07-26|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are suggestions that the 2013 Cajochen study is faulty because of a relatively small (n=33) sample size and inappropriate controls for age and sex.&lt;ref name="Cordi2014" /&gt;  A 2014 study with larger sample sizes (n1=366, n2=29, n3=870) and better experimental controls found no effect of the lunar phase on sleep quality metrics.&lt;ref name="Cordi2014" /&gt;  A 2015 study of 795 children found a 3-minute ''increase'' in sleep duration near the full moon,&lt;ref name="Sjodin2015"/&gt; but a 2016 study of 5,812 children found a 5-minute ''decrease'' in sleep duration near the full moon.&lt;ref name="Chaput2016"/&gt;  No other modification in activity behaviors were reported,&lt;ref name="Chaput2016"/&gt; and the lead scientist concluded: "Our study provides compelling evidence that the moon does not seem to influence people's behavior."&lt;ref name="FrontPed"&gt;{{cite news|title=Does the moon affect our mood or actions?|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160506105645.htm|accessdate=2016-05-11|work=www.sciencedaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In animals===
[[Grunion|California Grunion]] fish have an unusual mating and spawning ritual during the spring and summer months.  The egg laying takes place on four consecutive nights, beginning on the nights of the full and new Moons, when tides are highest.&lt;ref name="grunion" /&gt;  However, this is a well understood reproductive strategy that is more related to tides than it is to lunar phase.  It happens to correlate with the lunar phase because tides are highest when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned, i.e., at new Moon or full Moon.

Correlation between hormonal changes in the [[testis]] and lunar periodicity was found in [[streamlined spinefoot]] (a type of fish), which spawns synchronously around the last Moon quarter.&lt;ref name="zimecki"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zimecki |first=M |date=2006 |title=The lunar cycle: effects on human and animal behavior and physiology |url=http://www.phmd.pl/fulltxt.php?ICID=442883|journal=Postepy Hig Med Dosw|pmid=16407788 |access-date=24 July 2015 |volume=60 |pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[orange-spotted spinefoot]], lunar phases affect the levels of [[melatonin]] in the blood.&lt;ref name="zimecki"/&gt;

Evidence for lunar effect in reptiles, birds and mammals is scant,&lt;ref name="zimecki"/&gt; but among reptiles [[marine iguana]]s (which live in the [[Galápagos Islands]]) time their trips to the sea in order to arrive at low tide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martin Wikelski|author2=Michaela Hau|title=Is There an Endogenous Tidal Foraging Rhythm in Marine Iguanas?|journal=[[Journal of Biological Rhythms]]|date=Dec 1995|doi=10.1177/074873049501000407|pmid=8639942|volume=10|issue=4|pages=335–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spawning of coral ''[[Platygyra lamellina]]'' occurs at night during the summer on a date determined by the [[phase of the Moon]]; in the [[Red Sea]], this is the three- to five-day period around the [[new Moon]] in July and the similar period in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Schlesinger, Y. |author2=Loya, Y. |year=1991 |title=Larval development and survivorship in the corals ''Favia favus'' and ''Platygyra lamellina'' |journal=Developments in Hydrobiology  |volume=66 |pages=101–108 |doi=10.1007/978-94-011-3240-4_14 |isbn=978-94-010-5428-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Acropora]]'' coral time their simultaneous release of sperm and eggs to just one or two days a year, after sundown with a full moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Alex Riley|title=Playing Cupid to get reluctant corals in the mood for love|journal=[[New Scientist]]|date=Feb 20, 2016|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2077033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Palolo worm]] that lives in the seas of Indonesia and Polynesia loose the terminal part of their bodies during a waning moon at a certain time of year. These parts float to the surface and release sperm and eggs. The terminal parts are gathered by people as a special food.

In 2000, a retrospective study in the [[United Kingdom]] reported an association between the full moon and significant increases in animal bites to humans. The study reported that patients presenting to the [[Emergency Department|A&amp;E]] with injuries stemming from bites from an animal rose significantly at the time of a full moon in the period 1997-1999. The study concluded that animals have an increased inclination to bite a human during a full moon period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yonezawa|first=Bhattacharjee|last2=Bradle|first2=Mona|last3=Smith|first3=Scally|last4=Wilson|date=2000-12-23|title=Do animals bite more during a full moon?

==Proposed explanations==
===Tidal===
Believers in the lunar theory suggest several different mechanisms by which the behaviour of the Moon could influence the behaviour of human beings. A common suggestion is that, since the Moon affects large bodies of water such as the ocean (a phenomenon known as "[[tidal force]]"), the Moon should be expected to have an analogous effect on human beings, whose bodies contain a great deal of water.&lt;ref name="skepdic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="straightdope"&gt;{{cite web
  | last=Adams | first=Cecil | authorlink = Cecil Adams
  | title = Do things get crazy when the moon is full?
  | work = [[The Straight Dope]]
  | date = 13 March 1987
  | url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/552/do-things-get-crazy-when-the-moon-is-full
  | accessdate = 14 December 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is a misconception that fails to take into account differences in scale. The tidal force is in fact very weak and should be expected to exercise no more gravitational pull on the human body than a mosquito.&lt;ref name="skepdic" /&gt; Besides this, the "suggestion" failed to account for the dependence of [[tide]]s from both the phase of the Moon and the ''time of day''.

Believers ([[David Tredinnick (politician)|David Tredinnick]] being a prominent example) often support their claims by noting that many police officers, teachers, and nurses have observed a lunar effect in the course of their work. To the extent that nurses and police officers do indeed claim to observe patterns, this is most likely to be explained in terms of [[confirmation bias]]: People notice if something dramatic happens during a full Moon, but do not notice when nothing dramatic happens;&lt;ref name="straightdope"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilovich1993" /&gt; furthermore, dramatic occurrences that do not occur during full Moons are typically not counted as evidence against the belief.&lt;ref name="skepdic"/&gt; Believers are further bolstered in their belief through [[communal reinforcement]]: The more people talk about the effect, the more people notice spurious relationships.&lt;ref name="skepdic"/&gt;

===Evolutionary===
{{quotation|Nocturnal carnivores are widely believed to have played an important role in human evolution, driving the need for nighttime shelter, the control of fire and our innate fear of darkness. We performed an extensive analysis of predatory behavior across the lunar cycle on the largest dataset of lion attacks ever assembled and found that African lions are as sensitive to moonlight when hunting humans as when hunting herbivores and that lions are most dangerous to humans when the Moon is faint or below the horizon. |{{Citation|author1=C.

For some 3–4 million years, bipedal hominins in the East African Rift valley were evolving in potential conflict and competition with fearsome carnivores including sabre-toothed cats equipped with excellent night-vision. Using the largest data set ever recorded – 1,000 lion attacks on humans across Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 – Craig Packer and his colleagues showed that there is a peak of attacks by lions upon humans during the evening dark hours following full Moon. According to Packer, this may help explain why so many myths and superstitions attribute fearsome dangers and nightmarish potencies to the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;C. Packer, A. Swanson, D. Ikanda, and H. Kushnir (2011). ''Fear of Darkness, the Full Moon and the Nocturnal Ecology of African Lions.'' PLoS ONE 6(7): e22285. {{DOI|10.1371/journal.pone.0022285}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not all archaeologists accept that lunar periodicity was ever relevant to human evolution, those favouring the idea include Curtis Marean, who heads excavations at the important Middle Stone Age site of [[Pinnacle Point]], South Africa. Marean argues that anatomically modern humans around 165,000 years ago – when inland regions of the continent were dry, arid and uninhabitable – became restricted to small populations clustered around coastal refugia, reliant on marine resources including shellfish whose safe harvesting at spring low tides presupposed careful tracking of lunar phase. Against this background, if Marean is right, humans who ignored or misread the Moon might frequently have been drowned.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis Marean (2010).

===Positive ions===

A further suggestion is that [[positive ions]] increase in abundance during a full Moon and that this should be expected to influence human behavior. However, this is a pseudo-scientific claim. Not only is the increase in frequency extremely slight (much smaller than that caused by [[air conditioning]] and [[air pollution]]),&lt;ref name="straightdope" /&gt; but ionic charge – positive or negative – has no effect on human behavior, and no physiological effect other than static electric shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Novella|first=Steven|authorlink=Steven Novella|title=Pseudoscience Sells|url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/pseudoscience-sells/|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that with regard to certain types of depression such as [[seasonal affective disorder]] (SAD), [[negative air ionization therapy]] has no statistically significant benefits beyond placebo. Moreover, such treatments require ionization many orders of magnitude greater than any differences produced by the lunar cycle, and there are superior effects found by using similar treatments with bright light instead of ion generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Flory R, Ametepe J, Bowers B | date = May 2010 | title = A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of bright light and high-density negative air ions for treatment of Seasonal Affective Disorder | url = | journal = Psychiatry Res. | volume = 177 | issue = 1–2| pages = 101–8 | pmid = 20381162 | doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2008.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyclic variations related to the moon's phases in the magnitude of the humoral immune response of mice to polivinylpyrrolidone and sheep erythrocytes were also described. It is suggested that melatonin and endogenous steroids may mediate the described cyclic alterations of physiological processes. The release of neurohormones may be triggered by the electromagnetic radiation and/or the gravitational pull of the moon}}

The ''Panton Principles'' are a set of principles which were written to promote [[open science]]. They were first drafted in July 2009 at the [[Panton Arms]] pub in [[Cambridge]].

[[File:Panton Principles.jpg|thumb|right|Drafters of the Panton Principles at the Panton Arms pub]]

==History==
The principles were written by [[Peter Murray-Rust]], [[Cameron Neylon]], [[Rufus Pollock]], and [[John Wilbanks]]. They were then refined by the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] and officially launched in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.okfn.org/2010/02/19/launch-of-the-panton-principles-for-open-data-in-science/ |title=Launch of the Panton Principles for Open Data in Science and 'Is It Open Data?' |first=Jonathan |last=Gray |work=blog.okfn.org |date=19 February 2010  |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Principles==
1. Where data or collections of data are published it is critical that they be published with a clear and explicit statement of the wishes and expectations of the publishers with respect to re-use and re-purposing of individual data elements, the whole data collection, and subsets of the collection. This statement should be precise, irrevocable, and based on an appropriate and recognized legal statement in the form of a waiver or license.

''When publishing data make an explicit and robust statement of your wishes.''

2. Many widely recognized licenses are not intended for, and are not appropriate for, data or collections of data. A variety of waivers and licenses that are designed for and appropriate for the treatment of data are described here. Creative Commons licenses (apart from CCZero), GFDL, GPL, BSD, etc. are NOT appropriate for data and their use is STRONGLY discouraged.

''Use a recognized waiver or license that is appropriate for data.''

3. The use of licenses which limit commercial re-use or limit the production of derivative works by excluding use for particular purposes or by specific persons or organizations is STRONGLY discouraged. These licenses make it impossible to effectively integrate and re-purpose datasets and prevent commercial activities that could be used to support data preservation.

''If you want your data to be effectively used and added to by others it should be open as defined by the Open Knowledge/Data Definition – in particular non-commercial and other restrictive clauses should not be used.''

4. Furthermore, in science it is STRONGLY recommended that data, especially where publicly funded, be explicitly placed in the public domain via the use of the Public Domain Dedication and Licence or Creative Commons Zero Waiver. This is in keeping with the public funding of much scientific research and the general ethos of sharing and re-use within the scientific community.

''Explicit dedication of data underlying published science into the public domain via PDDL or CCZero is strongly recommended and ensures compliance with both the Science Commons Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data and the Open Knowledge/Data Definition.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Murray-Rust, Peter |author2=Neylon, Cameron |author3=Pollock, Rufus |author4=Wilbanks, John |title=Principles|url=http://pantonprinciples.org/|work=Panton Principles: Principles for Open Data in Science|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
Between the launch of the project and December 2011 the principles gained 150 endorsements from researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Molloy | first1 = J. C. | title = The Open Knowledge Foundation: Open Data Means Better Science | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | pages = e1001195 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22162946 | pmc = 3232214 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One researcher said the principles allow researchers to better claim credit for their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Salo | first1 = D. | title = Who owns our work? | doi = 10.1629/23191 | journal = Serials: the Journal for the Serials Community | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 191–195 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project won an innovation prize from the [[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sparc.arl.org/innovator/panton.shtml |title=SPARC Innovator: Authors of the Panton Principles – A Call for Open Data in Science (June 2010) (SPARC2) |first=Caralee |last=Adams |work=sparc.arl.org |date=June 2010 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Philosophical Magazine - 1st Series - Volume 1 - 1798 - Titlepage.png|thumb|Titlepage of the first issue]]

The '''''Philosophical Magazine''''' is one of the oldest [[scientific journal]]s published in English. It was established by [[Alexander Tilloch]] in 1798;&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;John Burnett, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27448 "Tilloch, Alexander (1759–1825)"], [[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], [[Oxford University Press]], Sept 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed 17 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in 1822 [[Richard Taylor (editor)|Richard Taylor]] became joint editor&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; and it has been published continuously by [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] ever since.{{doubtful|date=December 2012}}

==Early history==
The name of the journal dates from a period when "natural philosophy" embraced all aspects of science. The very first paper published in the journal carried the title "Account of Mr Cartwright's Patent Steam Engine". Other articles in the first volume include "Methods of discovering whether Wine has been adulterated with any Metals prejudicial to Health" and "Description of the Apparatus used by Lavoisier to produce Water from its component Parts, Oxygen and Hydrogen".

==19th century==
Early in the nineteenth century, classic papers by [[Humphry Davy]], [[Michael Faraday]] and [[James Prescott Joule]] appeared in the journal and in the 1860s [[James Clerk Maxwell]] contributed several long articles, culminating in a paper containing the deduction that light is an [[electromagnetic wave]] or, as he put it himself, "We can scarcely avoid the inference that light consists in transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena". The famous experimental paper of [[Albert A. Michelson]] and [[Edward Morley]] was published in 1887 and this was followed ten years later by [[J. J. Thomson]] with article "Cathode Rays" – essentially the discovery of the [[electron]].

In 1814, the ''Philosophical Magazine'' merged with the ''[[Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts]]'', otherwise known as ''Nicholson's Journal'' (published by [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]]), to form ''The Philosophical Magazine and Journal''. Further mergers with the ''[[Annals of Philosophy]]'' and ''The Edinburgh Journal of Science'' led to the retitling of the journal in 1840, as ''The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science''. In 1949, the title reverted to ''The Philosophical Magazine''.

==20th century==
In the early part of the 20th century, Ernest Rutherford was a frequent contributor. He once told a friend to "watch out for the next issue of ''Philosophical Magazine''; it is highly radioactive!" Aside from his work on understanding [[radioactivity]], Rutherford proposed the experiments of [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]] that verified his nuclear model of the [[atom]] and led to [[Niels Bohr]]'s famous paper on planetary electrons, which was published in the journal in 1913. Another classic contribution from Rutherford was entitled "Collision of α Particles with Light Atoms. IV. An Anomalous Effect in Nitrogen" – an article describing no less than the first artificial [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of an [[chemical element|element]].

In 1978 the journal was divided into two independent parts, ''Philosophical Magazine A'' and ''Philosophical Magazine B''. Part A published papers on [[structure]], defects and mechanical properties while Part B focussed on [[statistical mechanics]], [[electronics|electronic]], [[optical]] and [[magnetic]] properties.

==Recent developments==
Since the middle of the 20th century, the journal has focused on [[condensed matter physics]] and published significant papers on [[dislocations]], [[mechanics|mechanical]] properties of [[solids]], [[amorphous]] [[semiconductors]] and [[glasses]]. As subject area evolved and it became more difficult to classify research into distinct areas, it was no longer considered necessary to publish the journal in two parts, so in 2003 parts A and B were re-merged. In its current form, 36 issues of the ''Philosophical Magazine'' are published each year, supplemented by 12 issues of '''''Philosophical Magazine Letters'''''.

==Editors==
Previous editors of the ''Philosophical Magazine'' have been [[John Tyndall]], [[J.J. Thomson]], [[Sir Nevill Mott]], and [[William Lawrence Bragg]]. The journal is currently edited by Edward A. Davis.

== ''Philosophical Magazine Letters'' {{anchor|Letters}} ==
In 1987, the sister journal '''''Philosophical Magazine Letters''''' was established with the aim of rapidly publishing short communications on all aspects of [[condensed matter physics]]. It is edited by Edward A. Davis and Peter Riseborough. This monthly journal had a 2014 impact factor of 1.087.

==Series==
Over its 200-year history, ''Philosophical Magazine'' has occasionally restarted its volume numbers at 1, designating a new 'series" each time.[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~content=t713695589~link=cover] The journal's series are as follows:
* ''Philosophical Magazine, Series 1'' (1798–1826), volumes 1 through 68
* ''Philosophical Magazine, Series 2'' (1827–1832), volumes 1 through 11
* ''Philosophical Magazine, Series 3'' (1832–1850), volumes 1 through 37
* ''Philosophical Magazine, Series 4'' (1851–1875), volumes 1 through 50
* ''Philosophical Magazine, Series 5'' (1876–1900), volumes 1 through 50
* ''Philosophical Magazine, Series 6'' (1901–1925), volumes 1 through 50
* ''Philosophical Magazine, Series 7'' (1926–1955), volumes 1 through 46
* ''Philosophical Magazine, Series 8'' (1955–present), volumes 1 through 95 (through December 2015)
If the renumbering had not occurred, the 2015 volume (series 8, volume 95) would have been volume 407.

Specifying the '''research question''' is the [[methodological]] point of departure of scholarly research in both the [[natural sciences|natural]] and [[social sciences]]. The research will answer the question posed. At an [[undergraduate]] level, the answer to the research question is the [[thesis statement]]. The answer to a research question will help address a "research problem" which is a problem "readers think is worth solving". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Booth|first=Wayne|title=[[The Craft of Research]]|year=1995|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=0226065650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Specifying the research question is one of the first [[Methodology|methodological]] steps the investigator has to take when undertaking [[research]]. The research question must be accurately and clearly defined.

Choosing a research question is the central element of both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research]] and in some cases it may precede construction of the conceptual framework of study. In all cases, it makes the theoretical assumptions in the framework more explicit, most of all it indicates what the researcher wants to know most and first.

The student or researcher then carries out the research necessary to answer the research question, whether this involves reading [[secondary sources]] over a few days for an [[undergraduate]] term paper or carrying out [[primary research]] over years for a major project.

When the research is complete and the researcher knows the (probable) answer to the research question, writing up can begin (as distinct from writing notes, which is a process that goes on through a research project). In term papers, the answer to the question is normally given in summary in the [[introduction (essay)|introduction]] in the form of a [[thesis statement]].

== Types and purpose ==
The research question serves two purposes:
# It determines where and what kind of research the writer will be looking for. 
# It identifies the specific objectives the study or paper will address. 
Therefore, the writer must first identify the type of study (qualitative, quantitative, or mixed) before the research question is developed.

=== Qualitative study ===
A [[qualitative research|qualitative study]] seeks to learn why or how, so the writer’s research must be directed at determining the what, why and how of the research topic. Therefore, when crafting a research question for a qualitative study, the writer will need to ask a why or how question about the topic. For example: How did the company successfully market its new product? The sources needed for qualitative research typically include print and internet texts (written words), audio and visual media.

Here is Creswell's (2009) example of a script for a qualitative research central question: 
* _________ (How or what) is the _________ ("story for" for narrative research; "meaning of" the phenomenon for phenomenology; "theory that explains the process of" for grounded theory; "culture-sharing pattern" for ethnography; "issue" in the "case" for case study) of _________ (central phenomenon) for _________ (participants) at _________ (research site).

=== Quantitative study ===
A [[quantitative research|quantitative study]] seeks to learn where, or when, so the writer’s research must be directed at determining the where, or when of the research topic. Therefore, when crafting a research question for a quantitative study, the writer will need to ask a where, or when question about the topic. For example: Where should the company market its new product? Unlike a qualitative study, a quantitative study is mathematical analysis of the research topic, so the writer’s research will consist of numbers and statistics.

Here is Creswell's (2009) example of a script for a quantitative  research question: 
* Does _________ (name the theory) explain the relationship between _________ (independent variable) and _________ (dependent variable), controlling for the effects of _________ (control variable)?

Alternatively, a script for a quantitative null hypothesis might be as follows: 
* There is no significant difference between _________ (the control and experimental groups on the independent variable) on _________ (dependent variable).

Quantitative studies also fall into two categories: 
# Correlational studies: A correlational study is non-experimental, requiring the writer to research relationships without manipulating or randomly selecting the subjects of the research. The research question for a correlational study may look like this: What is the relationship between long distance commuters and eating disorders?
# Experimental studies: An experimental study is experimental in that it requires the writer to manipulate and randomly select the subjects of the research. The research question for an experimental study may look like this: Does the consumption of fast food lead to eating disorders?

=== Mixed study ===
A mixed study integrates both [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and quantitative studies, so the writer’s research must be directed at determining the why or how and the what, where, or when of the research topic. Therefore, the writer will need to craft a research question for each study required for the assignment. A typical study may be expected to have between 1 and 6 research questions.

Once the writer has determined the type of study to be used and the specific objectives the paper will address, the writer must also consider whether the research question passes the ‘so what’ test. The ‘so what’ test means that the writer must construct evidence to convince the audience why the research is expected to add new or useful knowledge to the literature.

==Related terms==

===Problematique===

"Problematique" is a term that functions analogously to the research problem or question used typically when addressing global systemic problems. The term achieved prominence in 1970 when 
[[Hasan Özbekhan]], [[Erich Jantsch]] and [[Alexander Christakis]] conceptualized the original prospectus of the [[Club of Rome]] titled "The Predicament of Mankind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/loversofdemocracy/Predicament.PTI.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=3 February 2014|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203125912/http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/loversofdemocracy/Predicament.PTI.pdf|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this prospectus the authors designated 49 Continuous Critical Problems facing humankind, saying "We find it virtually impossible to view them as problems that exist in isolation - or as problems capable of being solved in their own terms... It is this generalized meta system of problems, which we call the 'problematique' that inheres in our situation."

Situations similar to the global problematique in their complexity are also called problematiques. These situations receive different designations from other authors. [[C. West Churchman]], [[Rittell]] and Weber, and [[Argyris]] &lt;ref&gt;Argyris, C. (1968) "Some Unintended Consequences of Rigorous Research". ''Psychological Bulletin'', pp.&amp;nbsp;185–197.&lt;/ref&gt; call these situations wicked problems. Russell Ackoff simply called them "messes.'"

'''Science policy''' is concerned with the allocation of resources for the conduct of science towards the goal of best serving the public interest.  Topics include the [[funding of science]], the careers of scientists, and the translation of scientific discoveries into [[technological innovation]] to promote [[commercial product development]], [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]], [[economic growth]] and [[economic development]].  Science policy focuses on knowledge production and role of knowledge networks, collaborations and the complex distributions of expertise, equipment and know-how. Understanding the processes and organizational context of generating novel and innovative science and engineering ideas is a core concern of science policy. Science policy topics include [[weapons development]], [[health care]] and [[environmental monitoring]].

Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve science.  A large and complex web of factors influences the development of science and
engineering that includes government science policy makers, private firms (including both national and multi-national firms), social
movements, media, non-governmental organizations, universities, and other research institutions. In addition, science policy is increasingly international as defined by the global operations of firms and research institutions as well as by the collaborative networks of non-governmental
organizations and of the nature of scientific inquiry itself. 

==History==
{{main|History of science policy}}

[[State (polity)|State]] [[policy]] has influenced the funding of [[public works]] and science for thousands of years, dating at least from the time of the [[Mohists]], who inspired the study of logic during the period of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]], and the study of defensive fortifications during the [[Warring States period]] in China. General levies of labor and grain were collected to fund great public works in China, including the accumulation of grain for distribution in times of famine,&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Bray (1984), ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'' '''VI.2''' '''''Agriculture'''''&lt;/ref&gt; for the building of levees to control flooding by the great rivers of China, for the building of canals and locks to connect rivers of China, some of which flowed in opposite directions to each other,&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Needham]], ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and for  the building of bridges across these rivers. These projects required a [[civil service]], the [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholars]], some of whom demonstrated great mastery of [[hydraulics]].

In Italy, Galileo noted that individual taxation of minute amounts could fund large sums to the State, which could then fund his research on the trajectory of cannonballs, noting that "each individual soldier was being paid from coin collected by a general tax of pennies and farthings, while even a million of gold would not suffice to pay the entire army."&lt;ref&gt;[[Galileo]] (1638) [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=753&amp;chapter=109891&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 Two New Sciences], Salviati, first day of the dialogs&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain]], [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]] had a formative effect on science policy with his identification of "experiments of .. light, more penetrating into nature [than what others know]",&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Francis Bacon]] (1624). ''[[New Atlantis]]''&lt;/ref&gt; which today we call the [[crucial experiment]].  Governmental approval of [[the Royal Society]] recognized a [[scientific community]] which exists to this day. British prizes for research spurred the development of an accurate, portable [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]], which directly enabled reliable navigation and sailing on the high seas, and also funded [[Charles Babbage|Babbage]]'s computer.

The professionalization of science, begun in the nineteenth century, was partly enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]], and State funding of universities of their respective nations. In the United States, a member of the National Academy of Sciences can sponsor a Direct Submission for publication in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/site/misc/iforc.shtml#submission PNAS Submission Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; ''PNAS'' serves as a channel to recognize research of importance to at least one member of the National Academy of Sciences.

Public policy can directly affect the funding of [[capital equipment]], intellectual infrastructure for industrial research, by providing tax incentives to those organizations who fund research. [[Vannevar Bush]], director of the office of scientific research and development for the U.S. government in July 1945, wrote "Science is a proper concern of government"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm Vannevar Bush (July 1945), "Science, the Endless Frontier"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Vannevar Bush directed the forerunner of the [[National Science Foundation]], and his writings directly inspired researchers to invent the [[hyperlink]] and the [[computer mouse]].  The [[DARPA]] initiative to support computing was the impetus for the [[Internet Protocol]] stack. In the same way that scientific consortiums like [[CERN]] for [[high-energy physics]] have a commitment to public knowledge, access to this public knowledge in physics led directly to CERN's sponsorship of development of the [[World Wide Web]] and standard Internet access for all.

==Philosophies of science policy==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}

===Basic versus applied research===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}

The programs that are funded are often divided into four basic categories: [[basic research]], [[applied research]], [[Research and development|development]], and facilities and equipment.&lt;ref name="AAASpresentation"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clemins|first=Patrick|title=R&amp;D in the President's FY 2011 Budget|url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/presentations/|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed (lead)|date=December 2014}}  [[Translational research]] is a newer concept that seeks to bridge the gap between basic science and practical applications.

Basic science attempts to stimulate breakthroughs. Breakthroughs often lead to an explosion of new technologies and approaches.  Once the basic result is developed, it is widely published; however conversion into a practical product is left for the free market.  However, many governments have developed risk-taking research and development organizations to take basic theoretical research over the edge into practical [[engineering]].  In the [[United States|U.S.]], this function is performed by [[DARPA]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

On the other hand, technology development is a policy in which engineering, the application of science, is supported rather than basic science.  The emphasis is usually given to projects that increase important strategic or commercial engineering knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}  The most extreme{{dubious|date=December 2014}} success story is doubtless the [[Manhattan Project]] that developed [[nuclear weapon]]s.  Another remarkable success story was the "X-vehicle" studies that gave the US a lasting lead in aerospace technologies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

These exemplify two disparate approaches: The Manhattan Project was huge, and spent unblinkingly on the most risky alternative approaches.  The project members believed that failure would result in their enslavement or destruction by [[Nazi Germany]].  Each X-project built an aircraft whose only purpose was to develop a particular technology.  The plan was to build a few cheap aircraft of each type, fly a test series, often to the destruction of an aircraft, and never design an aircraft for a practical mission.  The only mission was technology development.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A number of high-profile technology developments have failed.  The US Space Shuttle failed to meet its cost or flight schedule goals.  Most observers explain the project as over constrained: the cost goals too aggressive, the technology and mission too underpowered and undefined.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The Japanese [[fifth generation computer systems project]] met every technological goal, but failed to produce commercially important [[artificial intelligence]].  Many observers{{Who|date=December 2014}} believe that the Japanese tried to force engineering beyond available science by brute investment.  Half the amount spent on basic research rather might have produced ten times the result.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

=== Utilitarian versus monumental science policy ===
[[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] policies prioritize scientific projects that significantly reduce [[suffering]] for larger numbers of people.  This approach would mainly consider the numbers of people that can be helped by a research policy.  Research is more likely to be supported when it costs less and has greater benefits.  Utilitarian research often pursues incremental improvements rather than dramatic advancements in knowledge, or break-through solutions, which are more commercially viable/feasible.

In contrast, monumental science is a policy in which science is supported for the sake of a greater understanding of the universe, rather than for specific short-term practical goals.  This designation covers both large projects, often with large facilities, and smaller research that does not have obvious practical applications and are often overlooked.  While these projects may not always have obvious practical outcomes, they provide education of future scientists, and advancement of scientific knowledge of lasting worth about the basic building blocks of science.&lt;ref name=Vuong2018&gt;{{cite journal|title=The (ir)rational consideration of the cost of science in transition economies|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|volume=2|issue=1|pages=5|date=January 1, 2018|doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0281-4|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0281-4|accessdate=January 2, 2018|last1=Vuong|first1=Quan-Hoang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical outcomes do result from many of these "monumental" science programs.  Sometimes these practical outcomes are foreseeable and sometimes they are not.  A classic example of a monumental science program focused towards a practical outcome is the [[Manhattan project]].  An example of a monumental science program that produces unexpected practical outcome is the [[laser]].  Coherent light, the principle behind lasing, was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, but not created until 1954 by Charles H. Townes with the [[maser]].  The breakthrough with the maser led to the creation of the laser in 1960 by Theodore Maiman.  The delay between the theory of coherent light and the production of the laser was partially due to the assumption that it would be of no practical use.&lt;ref&gt;Suplee, Curt (1999) ''Physics In The 20th Century'' Harry N. Abrams Inc, 58-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholastic conservation===
This policy approach prioritizes efficiently teaching all available science to those who can use it, rather than investing in new science.  In particular, the goal is not to ''lose'' any existing knowledge, and to find new practical ways to apply the available knowledge.  The classic success stories of this method occurred in the 19th century U.S. land-grant universities, which established a strong tradition of research in practical agricultural and engineering methods.  More recently, the [[Green Revolution]] prevented mass famine over the last thirty years.  The focus, unsurprisingly, is usually on developing a robust curriculum and inexpensive practical methods to meet local needs.

== Science policy by country ==

Most developed countries usually have a specific national body overseeing national science (including technology and innovation) policy. In the case developing countries many follow the same fashion.  Many governments of [[developed country|developed countries]] provide considerable funds (primarily to universities) for scientific research (in fields such as [[physics]] and [[geology]]) as well as social science research (in fields such as [[economics]] and [[history]]). Much of this is not intended to provide concrete results that may be commercialisable, although research in scientific fields may lead to results that have such potential. Most university research is aimed at gaining publication in [[peer review]]ed [[academic journal]]s.

A funding body is an organisation that provides [[research funding]] in the form of [[research grant]]s or [[scholarship]]s.  Research councils are the funding bodies that are government-funded agencies engaged in the support of research in different disciplines and postgraduate funding.  Funding from research councils is typically competitive. As a general rule, more funding is available in science and engineering disciplines than in the arts and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Funding_my_further_study/Public_funding_bodies/p!ejclk | title = Public funding bodies | work = [[Graduate Prospects]] | accessdate = 2007-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the two main research councils are the [[Australian Research Council]] and the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]].

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the three main research councils ("Tri-Council") are the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]] (SSHRC) the [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council]] (NSERC) and the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] (CIHR). Additional research funding agencies include the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]], [[Genome Canada]], [[Sustainable Development Technology Canada]] and several Tri-Council supported [[Networks of Centres of Excellence]]. [http://www.nce.gc.ca/]

===Brazil===

In Brazil, two important research agencies are the [[National Council for Scientific and Technological Development]] (CNPq, Portuguese: Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico), an organization of the Brazilian federal government under the Ministry of Science and Technology, and [[São Paulo Research Foundation]] (FAPESP, Portuguese: Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo), a public foundation located in the state of São Paulo, Brazil [http://www.fapesp.br/en/].

===European Union===
The science policy of the [[European Union]] is carried out through the [[European Research Area]], which is a system that integrates the scientific resources of member nations and acts as a "common market" for research and innovation purpose.  The European Union's executive body, the [[European Commission]], has a [[Directorate-General for Research (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Research]]; which is responsible for the Union's science policy.  In addition, the [[Joint Research Centre]] provides independent scientific and technical advice to the European Commission and Member States of the [[European Union]] (EU) in support of EU policies.&lt;ref name="a1370"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/index.cfm?id=1370 | title=EU Science Hub - European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also the recently established [[European Research Council]], the first European Union [[Funding of science|funding body]] set up to support investigator-driven research.

There are also European science agencies that operate independently of the European Union, such as the [[European Science Foundation]], [[European Space Agency]], and the [[European Higher Education Area]]; which are created by the [[Bologna process]].

On science policy and on the European Research Area is grounded the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which addresses global challenges of pivotal importance for the well-being of the European citizens within the context of sustainable development and environmental protection. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
German research funding agencies include the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], which covers both [[science]] and [[humanities]].

=== India ===
Research funding by the Government of India comes from a number of sources.  For basic science and technology research, these include the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Department of Science and Technology (DST), and University Grants Commission (UGC).  For medical research, these include the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), CSIR, DST and Department of Biotechnology (DBT).  For applied research, these include the CSIR, DBT and Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC).

Other funding authorities are the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO), the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the Department of Ocean Development (DOD), the Indian Council for Social Science Research (ICSSR), and the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF) etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unom.ac.in/gcl-opac/Research%20funding.htm#Indian%20Research%20Funding%20Agencies&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===
Irish funding councils include the Irish Research Council (IRC) and the [[Science Foundation Ireland]]. The prior [[IRCSET|Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology]] (IRCSET) and the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences (IRCHSS) were merged to form the IRC in March 2012.&lt;ref name="IRC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.research.ie/aboutus/about-irc | title=About Us | publisher=Irish Research Council | accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Netherlands ===
Dutch research funding agencies include [[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek]] (NWO) [http://nwo.nl/] and [[Agentschap NL]] [http://www.agentschapnl.nl/].

=== Pakistan ===
The Government of Pakistan has mandated that a certain percentage of gross revenue generated by all telecom service providers be allocated to development and research of information and communication technologies. The [[National ICT R&amp;D Fund (Pakistan)|National ICT R&amp;D Fund]] was established in January 2007.

===Russia===
Under the Soviet Union, much research was routinely [[Suppressed research in the Soviet Union|suppressed]].
Now science in Russia is supported by state and private funds. From the state: the Russian Humanitarian Scientific Foundation (http://www.rfh.ru), the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (www.rfbr.ru), the Russian Science Foundation (http://rscf.ru)

=== Switzerland ===
Swiss research funding agencies include the [[Swiss National Science Foundation]] (SNSF), the innovation promotion agency CTI (CTI/KTI), Ressortforschung des Bundes [http://www.ressortforschung.admin.ch/], and Eidgenössische Stiftungsaufsicht [http://www.edi.admin.ch/esv/].

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Research Councils UK}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Haldane principle]], that decisions about what to spend research funds on should be made by researchers rather than politicians, is still influential in research policy. There are several university departments with a focus on science policy, such as the [[Science Policy Research Unit]]. There are seven grant-awarding [[Research Councils UK|Research Councils]]:
* [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (AHRC)
* [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] (BBSRC)
* [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC)
* [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC)
* [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC)
* [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC)
* [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC)

===United States===
{{main|Science policy of the United States}}

The [[United States]] has a long history of government support specially for science and technology.  Science policy in the United States is the responsibility of many organizations throughout the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].  Much of the large-scale policy is made through the legislative [[United States budget process|budget process]] of enacting the yearly [[United States federal budget|federal budget]].  Further decisions are made by the various federal agencies which spend the funds allocated by Congress, either on in-house research or by granting funds to outside organizations and researchers.

Research funding agencies in the United States are spread among many different departments, which include:
* Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]])
* [[United States Department of Energy]] Office of Science
* [[National Institutes of Health]]: biomedical research
* [[National Science Foundation]]: fundamental research and education in all the non-medical fields of science and engineering.
* [[Office of Naval Research]]

[[File:Scientific law versus Scientific theories.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Scientific theories explain why something happens, whereas Scientific Laws record what happens.]]
The '''laws of science''', also called '''[[scientific law]]s''' or '''scientific principles''', are statements that describe or [[prediction|predict]] a range of [[natural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|law of nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each scientific law is a statement based on [[reproducibility|repeated]] [[experiment]]al [[observation]]s that describes some aspect of the [[Universe]]. The term ''law'' has diverse usage in many cases (approximate, accurate, broad, or narrow [[scientific theory|theories]]) across all fields of [[natural science]] ([[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], etc.). Scientific laws summarize and explain a large collection of facts determined by [[experiment]], and are tested based on their ability to predict the results of future experiments. They are developed either from facts or through [[mathematics]], and are strongly supported by [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] [[evidence]]. It is generally understood that they reflect causal relationships fundamental to reality, and are discovered rather than invented.&lt;ref name="McComas2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F. McComas|title=The Language of Science Education: An Expanded Glossary of Key Terms and Concepts in Science Teaching and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXzGBAAAQBAJ|date=30 December 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-6209-497-0|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws reflect scientific knowledge that experiments have repeatedly verified (and never [[Falsifiability|falsified]]). Their accuracy does not change when new theories are worked out, but rather the scope of application, since the equation (if any) representing the law does not change. As with other scientific knowledge, they do not have absolute certainty (as mathematical [[theorems]] or [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]] do), and it is always possible for a law to be overturned by future observations. A law can usually be formulated as one or several statements or [[equation]]s, so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment, given the circumstances of the processes taking place.

Laws differ from [[hypotheses]] and [[postulates]], which are proposed during the [[Scientific method|scientific process]] before and during validation by experiment and observation. [[Hypotheses]] and [[postulates]] are not laws since they have not been verified to the same degree and may not be sufficiently general, although they may lead to the formulation of laws. A law is a more solidified and formal statement, distilled from repeated experiment. Laws are narrower in scope than [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], which may contain one or several laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/evolution/education/definitions-fact-theory-law-scientific-work Definitions from the NCSE]&lt;/ref&gt; Science distinguishes a law or theory from facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/role_of_theory_final.pdf | title=The Role of Theory in Advancing 21st Century Biology: Catalyzing Transformative Research |publisher = The National Academy of Sciences |year =2007 |journal=Report in Brief |}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling a law a [[scientific fact|fact]] is [[ambiguous]], an [[overstatement]], or an [[equivocation]].&lt;ref name=gouldfact&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html | first = Stephen Jay | last = Gould | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title  = Evolution as Fact and Theory | journal = Discover | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | date = 1981-05-01 | pages = 34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the nature of a scientific law is a question in [[philosophy]] and although scientific laws describe nature mathematically, scientific laws are practical conclusions reached by the [[scientific method]]; they are intended to be neither laden with [[ontology|ontological]] commitments nor statements of logical [[wikt:absolute#Noun|absolutes]].

According to the [[unity of science]] thesis, ''all'' scientific laws follow fundamentally from physics. Laws which occur in other sciences ultimately follow from [[physical law]]s. Often, from mathematically fundamental viewpoints, [[universal constant]]s emerge from a scientific law.

==Overview==
A scientific law always applies under the same conditions, and implies that there is a causal relationship involving its elements. [[Scientific fact|Factual]] and well-confirmed statements like "Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure" are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the [[philosophy of science]], going back to [[David Hume]], is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to [[constant conjunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Laws differ from [[scientific theory|scientific theories]] in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found false when extrapolated. [[Ohm's law]] only applies to linear networks, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] only applies in weak gravitational fields, the early laws of [[aerodynamics]] such as [[Bernoulli's principle]] do not apply in case of [[compressible flow]] such as occurs in [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] flight, [[Hooke's law]] only applies to [[strain (physics)|strain]] below the [[elastic limit]], etc. These laws remain useful, but only under the conditions where they apply.

Many laws take [[mathematics|mathematical]] forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the [[law of conservation of energy]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\Delta E = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where E is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U=\delta Q-\delta W\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The term "scientific law" is traditionally associated with the [[natural sciences]], though the [[social sciences]] also contain laws.&lt;ref name=Ehrenberg&gt;[[Andrew S. C. Ehrenberg]] (1993), "[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v365/n6445/pdf/365385a0.pdf Even the Social Sciences Have Laws]", [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], 365:6445 (30), page 385.{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a scientific law in social sciences is [[Zipf's law]].

Like theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions (specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the law), and can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]] if they are found in contradiction with new data.

== Conservation laws ==

===Conservation and symmetry===
{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}

Most significant laws in science are [[conservation laws]]. These fundamental laws follow from homogeneity of space, time and [[phase (waves)|phase]], in other words ''symmetry''.

*'''[[Noether's theorem]]:''' Any quantity which has a continuous differentiable symmetry in the action has an associated conservation law.
* [[Conservation of mass]] was the first law of this type to be understood, since most macroscopic physical processes involving masses, for example collisions of massive particles or fluid flow, provide the apparent belief that mass is conserved. Mass conservation was observed to be true for all chemical reactions. In general this is only approximative, because with the advent of relativity and experiments in nuclear and particle physics: mass can be transformed into energy and vice versa, so mass is not always conserved, but part of the more general conservation of mass-energy.
*'''[[Conservation of energy]]''', '''[[Conservation of momentum|momentum]]''' and '''[[Conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]]''' for isolated systems can be found to be [[Time translation symmetry|symmetries in time]], translation, and rotation.
*'''[[Conservation of charge]]''' was also realized since charge has never been observed to be created or destroyed, and only found to move from place to place.

===Continuity and transfer===

Conservation laws can be expressed using the general [[continuity equation]] (for a conserved quantity) can be written in differential form as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}=-\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} &lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is some quantity per unit volume, '''J''' is the [[flux]] of that quantity (change in quantity per unit time per unit area). Intuitively, the [[divergence]] (denoted ∇•) of a [[vector field]] is a measure of flux diverging radially outwards from a point, so the negative is the amount piling up at a point, hence the rate of change of density in a region of space must be the amount of flux leaving or collecting in some region (see main article for details). In the table below, the fluxes, flows for various physical quantities in transport, and their associated continuity equations, are collected for comparison.

More general equations are the [[convection–diffusion equation]] and [[Boltzmann transport equation]], which have their roots in the continuity equation.

==Laws of classical mechanics==

===Principle of least action===

{{Main|Principle of least action}}

All of classical mechanics, including [[Newton's laws]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]], [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]], etc., can be derived from this very simple principle:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathcal{S} = \delta\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[action (physics)|action]]; the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]

:&lt;math&gt; L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) = T(\mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)-V(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)&lt;/math&gt;

of the physical system between two times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The kinetic energy of the system is ''T'' (a function of the rate of change of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system), and [[potential energy]] is ''V'' (a function of the configuration and its rate of change). The configuration of a system which has ''N'' [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] is defined by [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''q&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'').

There are [[Canonical coordinates|generalized momenta]] conjugate to these coordinates, '''p''' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''), where:

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}&lt;/math&gt;

The action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term "path" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the [[generalized coordinates]] in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).

The action is a ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' rather than a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]'', since it depends on the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian depends on the path '''q'''(''t''), so the action depends on the ''entire'' "shape" of the path for all times (in the time interval from ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Between two instants of time, there are infinitely many paths, but one for which the action is stationary (to the first order) is the true path. The stationary value for the ''entire continuum'' of Lagrangian values corresponding to some path, ''not just one value'' of the Lagrangian, is required (in other words it is ''not'' as simple as "differentiating a function and setting it to zero, then solving the equations to find the points of [[maxima and minima]] etc", rather this idea is applied to the entire "shape" of the function, see [[calculus of variations]] for more details on this procedure).&lt;ref&gt;Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume 2, R.P. Feynman, R.B. Leighton, M. Sands, Addison-Wesley, 1964, {{isbn|0-201-02117-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notice ''L'' is ''not'' the total energy ''E'' of the system due to the difference, rather than the sum:

:&lt;math&gt;E=T+V&lt;/math&gt;

Trigg, VHC Publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1 (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Classical Mechanics, T.W.B. Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw-Hill (UK), 1973, {{isbn|0-07-084018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; general approaches to classical mechanics are summarized below in the order of establishment. They are equivalent formulations, Newton's is very commonly used due to simplicity, but Hamilton's and Lagrange's equations are more general, and their range can extend into other branches of physics with suitable modifications.

Using the definition of generalized momentum, there is the symmetry:

'''[[Newton's laws of motion]]'''

They are low-limit solutions to [[theory of relativity|relativity]]. Alternative formulations of Newtonian mechanics are [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] mechanics.

The laws can be summarized by two equations (since the 1st is a special case of the 2nd, zero resultant acceleration):

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}, \quad \mathbf{F}_{ij}=-\mathbf{F}_{ji} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''p''' = momentum of body, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = force ''on'' body ''i'' ''by'' body ''j'', '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt; = force ''on'' body ''j'' ''by'' body ''i''.

For a [[dynamical system]] the two equations (effectively) combine into one:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}_\mathrm{i}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{F}_{E} + \sum_{\mathrm{i} \neq \mathrm{j}} \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{ij} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = resultant external force (due to any agent not part of system). Body ''i'' does not exert a force on itself.

==Laws of gravitation and relativity==

===Modern laws===

;[[Special relativity]]

Postulates of special relativity are not "laws" in themselves, but assumptions of their nature in terms of ''relative motion''.

Often two are stated as "the laws of physics are the same in all [[inertial frames]]" and "the [[speed of light]] is constant". However the second is redundant, since the speed of light is predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]]. Essentially there is only one.

The said posulate leads to the [[Lorentz transformations]] – the transformation law between two [[frame of reference]]s moving relative to each other. For any [[4-vector]]

:&lt;math&gt;A' =\Lambda A &lt;/math&gt;

this replaces the [[Galilean transformation]] law from classical mechanics. The Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformations for low velocities much less than the speed of light ''c''.

The magnitudes of 4-vectors are invariants - ''not'' "conserved", but the same for all inertial frames (i.e. every observer in an inertial frame will agree on the same value), in particular if ''A'' is the [[four-momentum]], the magnitude can derive the famous invariant equation for mass-energy and momentum conservation (see [[invariant mass]]):

:&lt;math&gt; E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

in which the (more famous) [[mass-energy equivalence]] ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a special case.

;[[General relativity]]

General relativity is governed by the [[Einstein field equation]]s, which describe the curvature of space-time due to mass-energy equivalent to the gravitational field. Solving the equation for the geometry of space warped due to the mass distribution gives the [[metric tensor]]. Using the geodesic equation, the motion of masses falling along the geodesics can be calculated.

;[[Gravitomagnetism]]

In a relatively flat spacetime due to weak gravitational fields, gravitational analogues of Maxwell's equations can be found; the '''GEM equations''', to describe an analogous ''[[Gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic field]]''. They are well established by the theory, and experimental tests form ongoing research.&lt;ref name="Gravitation and Inertia"&gt;Gravitation and Inertia, I. Ciufolini and J.A.

These equations can be modified to include [[magnetic monopole]]s, and are consistent with our observations of monopoles either existing or not existing; if they do not exist, the generalized equations reduce to the ones above, if they do, the equations become fully symmetric in electric and magnetic charges and currents. Indeed, there is a duality transformation where electric and magnetic charges can be "rotated into one another", and still satisfy Maxwell's equations.

;Pre-Maxwell laws

These laws were found before the formulation of Maxwell's equations. They are not fundamental, since they can be derived from Maxwell's Equations. Coulomb's Law can be found from Gauss' Law (electrostatic form) and the Biot–Savart Law can be deduced from Ampere's Law (magnetostatic form). Lenz' Law and Faraday's Law can be incorporated into the Maxwell-Faraday equation. Nonetheless they are still very effective for simple calculations.

Classically, [[optics]] is based on a [[variational principle]]: light travels from one point in space to another in the shortest time.

*[[Fermat's principle]]

In [[geometric optics]] laws are based on approximations in Euclidean geometry (such as the [[paraxial approximation]]).

In [[physical optics]], laws are based on physical properties of materials.

*[[Brewster's law|Brewster's angle]]
*[[Malus's law]]

In actuality, optical properties of matter are significantly more complex and require quantum mechanics.

== Laws of quantum mechanics==

Quantum mechanics has its roots in [[postulates of quantum mechanics|postulates]]. This leads to results which are not usually called "laws", but hold the same status, in that all of quantum mechanics follows from them.

One postulate that a particle (or a system of many particles) is described by a [[wavefunction]], and this satisfies a quantum wave equation: namely the [[Schrödinger equation]] (which can be written as a non-relativistic wave equation, or a [[relativistic wave equation]]). Solving this wave equation predicts the time-evolution of the system's behaviour, analogous to solving Newton's laws in classical mechanics.

Other postulates change the idea of physical observables; using [[operators (physics)|quantum operators]]; some measurements can't be made at the same instant of time ([[Uncertainty principle]]s), particles are fundamentally indistinguishable. Another postulate; the [[wavefunction collapse]] postulate, counters the usual idea of a measurement in science.

== Laws of chemistry ==
{{Main|Chemical law}}

'''Chemical laws''' are those [[natural law|laws of nature]] relevant to [[chemistry]]. Historically, observations led to many empirical laws, though now it is known that chemistry has its foundations in [[quantum mechanics]].

;[[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|Quantitative analysis]]

The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the [[law of conservation of mass]], which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary [[chemical reaction]]. Modern physics shows that it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and that [[Mass–energy equivalence|energy and mass are related]]; a concept which becomes important in [[nuclear chemistry]]. [[Conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].

Additional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass.  [[Joseph Proust]]'s [[law of definite composition]] says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important.

[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s [[law of multiple proportions]] says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers (i.e. 1:2 for [[Oxygen]]:[[Hydrogen]] ratio in water); although in many systems (notably [[Biomolecule|biomacromolecules]] and [[minerals]]) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.

More modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and its transformations.

;[[Reaction kinetics]] and [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibria]]

* In equilibrium, molecules exist in mixture defined by the transformations possible on the timescale of the equilibrium, and are in a ratio defined by the intrinsic energy of the molecules—the lower the intrinsic energy, the more abundant the molecule. [[Le Chatelier's principle]] states that the system opposes changes in conditions from equilibrium states, i.e. there is an opposition to change the state of an equilibrium reaction.
* Transforming one structure to another requires the input of energy to cross an energy barrier; this can come from the intrinsic energy of the molecules themselves, or from an external source which will generally accelerate transformations.  The higher the energy barrier, the slower the transformation occurs.
* There is a hypothetical intermediate, or ''transition structure'', that corresponds to the structure at the top of the energy barrier.  The [[Hammond's postulate|Hammond–Leffler postulate]] states that this structure looks most similar to the product or starting material which has intrinsic energy closest to that of the energy barrier.  Stabilizing this hypothetical intermediate through chemical interaction is one way to achieve [[catalysis]].
* All chemical processes are reversible (law of [[microscopic reversibility]]) although some processes have such an energy bias, they are essentially irreversible.
* The reaction rate has the mathematical parameter known as the [[rate constant]]. The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the temperature and [[activation energy]] dependence of the rate constant, an empirical law.

'''Slow science''' is part of the broader [[Slow movement (culture)|slow movement]]. It is based on the belief that [[science]] should be a slow, steady, methodical process, and that scientists should not be expected to provide "quick fixes" to society's problems. Slow science supports [[curiosity]]-driven [[Scholarly method|scientific research]] and opposes [[Performance measurement|performance targets]].

W. | title = Studies on Mario Bunge's Treatise | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam Atlanta, Georgia | year = 1990 | page = 426 | isbn = 9789051831870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines it as a grouping of [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[management science]].&lt;ref name="Farmer1995"&gt;{{cite book | last = Farmer | first = David John | author-link = David John Farmer | title = The language of public administration: bureaucracy, modernity, and postmodernity | publisher = University of Alabama Press | location = Tuscaloosa, Alabama | year = 1995 | page = 95 | isbn = 9780817307844 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=TxDGwJq_FOoC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; He sees it thus as a form of technology, distinguished from other branches of it such as [[engineering]], [[biotechnology]], [[information technology]] and [[general technology]]. Its goal is to help engineer [[sociosystems]] and evaluate their performance, while making use of [[social science]] research.&lt;ref name="Farmer1995"/&gt; In short, sociotechnology can be seen as the creation, modification and maintenance of social systems.&lt;ref name="WeingartnerDorn1990"/&gt;

Writing on sociotechnical change, [[Wiebe Bijker|Bijker]] wrote: "Society is not [[Technological determinism|determined by technology]], nor is technology determined by society. Both emerge as two sides of the sociotechnical coin."&lt;ref name="Bijker1997"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bijker | first = Wiebe E. | author-link = Wiebe Bijker | title = Of bicycles, bakelites, and bulbs: toward a theory of sociotechnical change | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1997 | page = 274 | isbn = 9780262522274 |url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_5110/bijker.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology is the sum of ways in which social groups construct the material objects of their civilizations. The things made are socially constructed just as much as technically constructed. The merging of these two things, construction and insight, is sociotechnology. "For example, we typically build a bridge when there’s some expectation that people need to get from Point A to Point B, and there’s something they need to bypass along the way (e.g. a river, a canyon, another road). Failure to consider the social factors as well as the technical factors could lead to a "bridge to nowhere" – and we all know at least one person who’s had a problem with those"&lt;ref name=Radziwill2009&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Business==

Business use "richness and reach". The richness and reach strategy has evolved with technology. Richness is the ability to understand the information being passed for example calling someone is less rich than face to face contact. Reach is the number of people who exchange the information. In the past it was easier to complete richness and reach, but now with new technologies like video chatting, it is easier for business to do fulfill both richness and reach. Positive economics is the study of existing (or historical) means of exchange- a social science such as sociology, history, and political sciences. Normative economics is the social technology because it attempts to create different kinds of economic arrangements.

==Community and technology==

Accelerating growth of technology is a major problem and cause of destabilization of a communicational world. [[Paul Virilio]] believes that the "real" is being mistaken by virtual and the virtual world destroys physical presence. [[Marshall McLuhan]] wrote about the extension of human senses and the nervous system into the world through electronic media. Essentially he believes that the mind, the self, and consciousness are made from already created technology, media, and language as opposed to create naturally like those who made technology, media, and language. The image of one’s self becomes aware of itself in a world of technology. Consciousness and desire become less individualistic and turns into more already constituted social forms. The response to how someone feels something, what it means, and how it feels (for example feeling "attached" to someone after losing your virginity to them) is already set up through media communication (show, music, movies, articles). People will anticipate that they will be attached because of what they already know about it, so when it happens they do feel attached because that is how they were programmed to feel. People have turned to technology to create their "self" and determine how they feel and act. The conscious mind does not move into a world-as-other mindset but into an already constituted world.

Lewis Mumford believed the world of relying on technology began with early human experiments in industrialization including coal mines because coal and iron built and powered industrialization. It has come to the point where communication is relied on technology. Conversation turned into talking through a machine (texting, phone calls, social media).

The difference between the past and present technology is the extent of social binding. The more social forces it binds together the more powerful the technology is. For example, the attack on the World Trade Center as opposed to the attack of Pearl Harbor. It took a year to see the film of the attack on the American battleships. Because of this, people were more unaware and it was less of a big deal than what 9-11 was. During the terrorist attack in 2001, everything was broadcast in the moment. People were seeing the destruction with their own eyes in the moment, causing more ridicule and passion for the situation.

==Robots replacing people==
{{Further|Technological unemployment|Social robot}}
Furbie and Tamagotchi are electronic toys made for children that make noises and demand for care. These toys caused children to form a companionship with robots instead of human beings. Paro is a robotic baby seal that was created in Japan to perform therapeutic functions. Paro had positive psychological results for those in nursing homes. A woman constantly argued with her son and turned to the Paro for comfort and confided in the Paro instead of fixing things with her son. Society has turned to demanding more intimacy from sociable robots then from each other. People that use the robots for comfort feel like they are being comforted by someone even though they are actually alone. These robotic characters cause people to have a relationship with technology while avoiding the trouble of human interaction.

==Social technology==

Science and technology are big contributions to the economic development, but can also lead to negative side effects as it evolves. For example, people care more about materialistic things than the negative influences they have created in human morals and education. For example, it is more important for people to know words to songs than to remember things for their test. There are other problems due to the development of new technologies such as the conservation of the environment because there is a demand for more products which leads to more destruction of environment to build more to sell from. Many social problems have appeared in society and cannot seem to be solved by natural science and technology alone. It requires the need for social sciences as well. Social technology is the strategy used to help solve the wrong behaviors in the world that are caused by social problems like how to solve the issue of people being invested in materialistic goods more than morals, so that they economy can still continue to grow, and society can be a better place.

'''Statistical alchemy''' was a term originated by [[John Maynard Keynes]] to describe [[econometrics]] in 1939. The phrase has subsequently been used by [[Alvan Feinstein]] to describe [[meta-analysis]]. It is generally regarded as a deprecatory term which undermines attempts to present such activities as meeting the rigorous standards of science.

==Econometrics==
Keynes (1939) wrote a review of [[Jan Tinbergen]]'s ''Statistical Testing of Business-Cycle Theories''. Although he praised Tinbergen for his objectivity, he however depicted his methodology as "black magic" which he regarded as essentially untrustworthy. He was unpersuaded that "this brand of ''statistical alchemy'' is ripe to become a branch of science" (emphasis in the original).&lt;ref name="Hendry"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hendry|first1=David|title=Econometrics-Alchemy or Science?|journal=Economica|date=1980|volume=47|issue=188|pages=387–406|doi=10.2307/2553385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often this metaphor is seen as a way of suggesting that econometricians were following a foolhardy pursuit comparable to the [[alchemy|alchemical quest]] of turning base metal into gold. However G. M. P. Swann points out that Keynes was well aware that such eminent early scientists as [[Isaac Newton]]. He rather proposes a more nuanced interpretation of the metaphor as referring to the [[Alkahest]], a universal solvent, which, it was claimed could turn stone into water. He claimed that by restricting econometrics to theory, mathematics and statistics, econometricians had discarded other important applied techniques. Although [[Ragnar Frisch]] had made warnings about this, these had been subsequently ignored by other econometricians who had ended up claiming that econometrics constituted a universal solvent.&lt;ref name="Swann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swann|first1=G. M. P.|title=Putting Econometrics in Its Place: A New Direction in Applied Economics|date=2006|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|location=Cheltenham|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}

==Meta-analysis==
Feinstein (1995) published "Meta-analysis: statistical alchemy for the 21st century" where he claimed that in meta-analysis scientific requirements had been removed or destroyed, eliminating the scientific requirements of reproducibility and precision. This was equivalent to a ''free lunch'', comparable to the alchemical transmutation of base metals to gold. [[Detournement|Detourning]] the adage concerning the combination of [[apples and oranges]], Feinstein suggested that meta-analytic mixtures were so heterogeneous that they might be better described as "combining rotten fruits". He argues that meta-analysis violates the [[Bradford Hill criteria]] of consistency as inconsistencies are ignored or buried through the process of  agglomerating the data.

'''São Carlos''' (Saint Charles, in English, {{IPA-pt|sɐ̃w̃ ˈkaʁlus}}; named after [[Charles Borromeo|Saint Charles Borromeo]]) is a city of 246,088&lt;ref name="IBGE" /&gt; inhabitants ([[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]/2017) in the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. It is located at {{coord|22|01|04|S|47|53|27|W|}}, at about 230&amp;nbsp;km from the city of [[São Paulo]].

==History==
The region started to be settled in the end of the 18th century, with the opening of a road that led to the gold mines in [[Cuiabá]] and [[Goiás]]. Leaving from [[Piracicaba]], passing through [[Rio Claro, São Paulo|Rio Claro]], the hills, fields and by typical vegetations of the Brazilian countryside, settlers established in the region. São Carlos' history started in 1831, when the "Pinhal" (Pines) allotment was demarcated.

On the city's foundation date, November 4, 1857, the population resided in some houses around the chapel and the inhabitants were mostly Arruda Botelho's family heirs, who were the first owners of the "Pinhal" alloments. Between 1831 and 1857 the pioneer coffee farms were formed, starting the first economic activity in the city. The coffee crops came to the "Pinhal" farm in 1840 and spread throughout the fertile lands around, becoming the main export item. The city foundation is credited to [[Antônio Carlos de Arruda Botelho, Count of Pinhal]], an influent farmer and entrepreneur.

São Carlos was elevated to [[village]] in 1865, when a "Câmara", or ruling chamber, was created. In 1874, the village had 6,897 inhabitants, as a humble highlight of its fast growth and regional importance. It became a [[city]] in 1880 and in 1886, with a population of 16,104, its urban structure was settled.

The city arises on the coffee crops expansion context, which is relevant to the last two decades of the 19th century and to the first two of the 20th century. The arrival of the railway in 1884 provided an efficient system to transport the [[Coffee production in Brazil|coffee production]] to the [[Port of Santos|Santos harbor]] and boosted the economy of the region. The railway also contributed to the political and economic consolidation of the central area of the city.

When slavery ended, government created incentives to bring in immigrants. São Carlos had already received German nationals brought by the Count of Pinhal in 1876. Between 1880 and 1904, the city was one of the most important immigration centers in São Paulo state, the majority of them being [[Italian Brazilians|Italians]] - specifically, [[Northern Italy|Northern Italians]]. They worked in coffee plantations and in manufacturing factories, as well as trading activities.

In the beginning of the 20th century, countless cultural societies developed social activities aiming to promote literacy. Vittorio Emanuele Society in 1900 and [[Dante Alighieri]] in 1902 were but a few of them. The Italian presence was so significant that during the first half of the 20th century, the Italian government had a consulate branch in São Carlos.

With the [[Wall Street crash of 1929]], coffee production went through a crisis, which made many immigrants leave rural areas for factories, wood artifact production, pottery, and construction.

Farmers had already applied the profits obtained with coffee in the constitution of several types of companies in São Carlos: banks, electricity, cable cars, telephones, water pumps, sewers, theaters, hospitals and schools.  This established a foundation for industrialization in the city. With the arrival of immigrants from other urban centers from the 1930s - 1940s, their expertise was used to consolidate industrialization as the main economic activity in the city. Its peak years were the 1950s, when São Carlos became a manufacturing center, with relevant industrial expression in São Paulo state.

The industrial sector also developed through workshops that incorporated the coffee industry. The manufacture of processing machinery, shoes, fertilizers, hardware, furniture, pasta, cigars, as well as activities such as tailory, breweries, foundries, sawmills, weaving, pottery and pencil production expanded the economy of São Carlos in the 1930s. In the 1950s and 1960s, with the expansion of refrigeration, new factories of machinery and tractors arrived. Numerous small- and medium-sized companies which provided products and services were also established.

In the second half of the 20th century, the city received a boost of technological and higher educational development when in 1953 the Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos, or the Engineering School of the [[University of São Paulo]], was created. In the 1970s, the [[Federal University of São Carlos]] was launched.

==Geography==

São Carlos is located on the geographic center of the São Paulo state, approximately {{convert|231|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[São Paulo|city of São Paulo]]. The city is the center of a [[Microregion of São Carlos|microregion]] with 308,777 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Census of the IBGE - Synopsis - Table 761|url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/cd/cd2010sp.asp?o=3&amp;i=P|publisher=IBGE.gov.br|accessdate=22 July 2011|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its altitude is over 856 m, offering a mild altitude climate. Most of the year the city is windy, sunny and with mild temperatures at night. For this reason the city is nicknamed "''Cidade do Clima''" (Weather City) and celebrates once a year an event called "''Festa do Clima''", or "Weather Festival".

The city has a total area of 1.141&amp;nbsp;km², which includes two districts to the north (''Santa Eudóxia'' and ''Água Vermelha''), one district to the west (''Bela Vista São-carlense''), and one district to the east (''Vila Nery'').

===Climate===
According to the [[Köppen Climate Classification]], the city has an altitude tropical climate with dry winter, with minimum average temperatures of 15,3&amp;nbsp;°C and maximum of 27,0&amp;nbsp;°C.

==Economy==
The city has an active industrial profile with important national and international industries and certain agricultural importance, backed by technologies developed by [[Embrapa]], owner of two research complexes in the city. Due to its increasing number of high technology industries, the city has been proclaimed "The National Capital of Technology" by Brazilian President [[Dilma Rousseff]] in 2011.

The city hosts several locally-grown technology-based companies, such as Opto Eletrônicos, and factories of multinational corporations such as [[Faber Castell]], [[Electrolux]], [[Husqvarna AB|Husqvarna]], [[Tecumseh Products Company|Tecumseh]] and the Brazilian plant of [[Volkswagen]] [[engine]]s, and national corporations such as [[TAM Linhas Aéreas|TAM MRO - Technology Center]], [[Toalhas São Carlos]], [[Tapetes São Carlos]], [[Papel São Carlos]], [[Prominas Brasil]] and [[Latina (industry)|Latina]].

The economic basis of São Carlos is the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]]. Commerce and services corresponds to 65.9% of the city's GDP. Industry is also relevant. With 32.3% of the economy, the [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] has a bigger participation than the state of São Paulo's average. The [[Primary sector of the economy|primary sector]] corresponds to 1.7% of the GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipal Profile at SEADE|url=http://www.seade.gov.br/produtos/perfil/perfilMunEstado.php|publisher=SEADE.gov.br|accessdate=12 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823080724/http://www.seade.gov.br/produtos/perfil/perfilMunEstado.php|archivedate=23 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:San Carlos Borromeo Repartiendo Limosna al Pueblo by Jose Salome Pina - 1853.jpg|thumb|250px|''Saint Charles Borromeo Giving Alms to the Poor'', an 1853 painting by [[José Salomé Pina]] — the town of São Carlos is named after the Catholic saint [[Charles Borromeo|Carlos Borromeo]], the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] [[archbishop of Milan]] from 1564 to 1584.]]

São Carlos is home to two [[University of São Paulo|Universidade de São Paulo]] campuses and the  [[Federal University of São Carlos|Universidade Federal de São Carlos]] (UFSCar), two of the most important higher learning centers in Brazil. Moreover, another minor and private university, [[Centro Universitário Central Paulista]] (UNICEP), is also based in São Carlos, and community colleges like [[SENAI]], [[Industrial Social Services|SESI]], [[Serviço Social do Comércio|SESC]], [[Serviço Nacional de Aprendizagem Comercial|SENAC]] and the ''Escola Técnica Estadual Paulino Botelho''. This has turned São Carlos into a university-oriented town, with an abundance of student-focused commercial establishments. It is also known for its student parties.

São Carlos' cultural life is marked by a young audience that enjoys musical concerts of Brazilian contemporary alternative artists that usually include the city in their tours. Also, São Carlos has 3 theaters and 7 commercial movie-theaters rooms.

There are two important events celebrated every year in the city, the ''Climate Party'', which happens in April and has a traditional ''Orchid Exposition'' which features a craftwork fair and several food barracks. An [[Oktobertech]] fest is held yearly along with the [[São Carlos High Tech Fair]] (Fealtec).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2926">"'''The Limits of Individual Plasticity'''" is a short essay written by [[science fiction]] author [[H.G. Wells]] (21 September 1866 – 13 August 1946) in 1895. In it, H.G. Wells speculates his theories
on the plasticity of animals, explaining that the default biological form of an animal may be altered in a way that it would continue to survive even if it, in any way, no longer resembles its inherent form. This could, according to Wells, theoretically be achieved through surgical, or [[chemical modification]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothma, Sheila and David, [https://books.google.com/books?id=j-gB7ZawIDsC&amp;pg=PT35&amp;dq=%22The+Limits+of+Individual+Plasticity%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HB-HUfXSC8LhrAGsooDoCA&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBw The Pursuit of Perfection: The Promise and Perils of Medical Enhancement], Random House Digital, Inc., 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Wells was fully aware that surgical modification is only a physical change, and would not alter an animal's [[DNA|genetic blueprint]].&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Herbert George (1975). [https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ8eByH9QXsC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22The+Limits+of+Individual+Plasticity%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HB-HUfXSC8LhrAGsooDoCA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA H.G. Wells: Early Writings in Science and Science Fiction]. California: University of California Press. p. 249. {{ISBN|0520026799}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He made note that should an animal be surgically 
modified, their offspring would most likely retain their parent creature's original physical form.

== Incorporation in novels ==

H.G. Wells presented many of his ideas from "The Limits of Individual Plasticity" in his 1896 science fiction novel, ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bleiler, Everett, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KEZxhkG5eikC&amp;pg=PA796&amp;dq=%22The+Limits+of+Individual+Plasticity%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HB-HUfXSC8LhrAGsooDoCA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg Science Fiction: The Early Years]. p.796. Kent State University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
In the novel, a shipwrecked Englishman named Edward Prendick is rescued from the sea and brought to a secluded island by a man named
Montgomery, who reveals the island is owned and operated by an eminent British physiologist named Dr. Moreau. Moreau was shunned from the scientific community
when his horrific experiments of [[vivisection]] were brought to the public spotlight. Dr. Moreau continued his experiments on vivisection
on his private island, where animals are altered with great detail to resemble human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, Nancy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ObOBRDdBIEcC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=%22The+Limits+of+Individual+Plasticity%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HB-HUfXSC8LhrAGsooDoCA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw Promoting and Producing Evil], Rodopi, 2010, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; They are a defective experiment, as they will
revert to their bestial forms after a period of time.

== Reception ==
[[BBC Future Media|BBC]] science columnist Rose Eveleth wrote a joint review in ''The New York Times'' of the audiobook versions of ''Unstoppable'' and [[Leonard Mlodinow]]'s 2015 book ''[[The Upright Thinkers]]''. Eveleth found Nye's audiobook "easy to listen to", noting the familiarity of Nye's voice to those who have watched the children's television series ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]''. However, Eveleth wrote that both books "stumble" because they "recycle well-known material", describing how Nye "spends a good chunk of his book talking about the setup of his extremely energy-efficient home ... Some of these stories are relevant and interesting. Other times, they feel forced, as if both authors knew that without a personal touch, their books would read like any other general primer on climate change or great men in science."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Eveleth|first1=Rose|title='The Upright Thinkers' and 'Unstoppable'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/books/review/the-upright-thinkers-and-unstoppable.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=23 January 2017 |date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Warthall, in the introduction to an interview with Nye for ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''{{'}}s "Book Talk" column, commented that ''Unstoppable'' "mixes science and [Nye's] trademark humor".&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Worrall |first1=Simon |title=Bill Nye the Science Guy Knows How to Fix Climate Change|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151115-bill-nye-science-guy-climate-change-unstoppable-ngbooktalk/ |website=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |accessdate=23 January 2017 |date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Kay, in a review for the [[Associated Press]], commented on the clarity of Nye's language, writing how "Nye explains the basics of climate science without making 'Unstoppable' feel like a textbook."&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5601">'''Viktor Schauberger''' (30 June 1885 in Holzschlag, [[Upper Austria]]&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Coats|first=Callum|title=Who was Viktor Schauberger?|url=http://schauberger.co.uk/viktor-schauberger/|publisher=[[Nexus (magazine)|Nexus]]|issue=11|date=April–May 1996|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  – 25 September 1958 in [[Linz]], Austria&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;) was an Austrian forest caretaker, [[natural history|naturalist]], [[parascientist]]&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Engert: [http://www.kheichhorn.de/html/body_forellenturbine.html ''Die Forellenturbine als Prinzip der kostenlosen Energiegewinnung. Freie Energie durch Implosion''].&lt;/ref&gt;, [[philosopher]], [[inventor]] and [[biomimicry]] experimenter.

Schauberger developed his own ideas based on what he observed in nature. In ''Implosion'' magazine, a magazine released by Schauberger's family, he said that aeronautical and marine engineers had incorrectly designed the propeller. He stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As best demonstrated by Nature in the case of the aerofoil maple-seed, today’s propeller is a pressure-screw and therefore a braking screw, whose purpose is to allow the heavy maple-seed to fall parachute-like slowly towards the ground and to be carried away sideways by the wind in the process. No bird has such a whirling thing on its head, nor a fish on its tail. Only man made use of this natural brake-screw for forward propulsion. As the propeller rotates, so does the resistance rise by the square of the rotational velocity. This is also a sign that this supposed propulsive device is unnaturally constructed and therefore out of place.&lt;ref&gt;Viktor Schauberger, ''Implosion'' Magazine, No. 112, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5137">'''Vis medicatrix naturae''' (literally "the healing power of nature", and also known as ''natura medica'') is the [[Latin]] rendering of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Νόσων φύσεις ἰητροί'' ("Nature is the physician(s) of diseases"), a phrase attributed to [[Hippocrates]]. While the phrase is not actually attested in his corpus,&lt;ref&gt;Hiroshi, H.

Hippocrates believed that an organism is not passive to [[injuries]] or [[disease]], but rebalances itself to counteract them. The state of [[illness]], therefore, is not a malady but an effort of the body to overcome a disturbed equilibrium. It is this capacity of organisms to correct imbalances that distinguishes them from non-living matter.&lt;ref&gt;Grube, C. M. A (1954) “Greek medicine and the Greek genius” Phonix 8 123-135 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1086122 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; 

From this follows the medical approach that “nature is the best physician” or “nature is the healer of disease”. To do this Hippocrates considered a doctor’s chief aim was to help this natural tendency of the body by observing its action, removing obstacles to its action, and thus allow an organism to recover its own health.&lt;ref name="Neuburger"&gt;Neuburger, M. (1944) "An Historical Survey of the Concept of Nature from a Medical Viewpoint" Isis 35 (1): 16–28 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/330687 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; This underlies such Hippocratic practices as [[blood letting]] in which a perceived excess of a [[humor]] is removed, and thus was taken to help the rebalancing of the body's [[Humorism|humors]].&lt;ref&gt;Neuberger, M. (1932) 'The doctrine of the healing power of nature throughout the course of time'. Homeopathy College New York. {{OCLC|10366814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance and modern history==
After Hippocrates, the idea of ''vis medicatrix naturae'' continued to play a key role in medicine. In the [[early Renaissance]], the physician and early scientist [[Paracelsus]] had the idea of “inherent balsam”. [[Thomas Sydenham]], in the 18th century considered fever as a healing force of nature.&lt;ref name="Neuburger"/&gt;  
 
In the nineteenth-century, ''vis medicatrix naturae'' came to be interpreted as [[vitalism]], and in this form it came to underlie the philosophical framework of [[homeopathy]], [[chiropractic]], [[hydropathy]], [[osteopathy]] and [[naturopathy]].&lt;ref name="Bynum"/&gt; As Bynum notes, "Search the Internet for vis medicatrix naturae and you will find yourself in the land of what we now politely call 'alternative' or 'complementary' medicine".&lt;ref name="Bynum"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bynum | first1 = W. F. | title = Nature's helping hand | journal = Nature | volume = 414 | issue = 6859 | pages = 21 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1038/35102123 | pmid = 11689921 | pmc = | bibcode = 2001Natur.414...21B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to homeostasis==
[[Walter Cannon]]'s notion of [[homeostasis]] also has its origins in ''vis medicatrix naturae''. "All that I have done thus far in reviewing the various protective and stabilizing devices of the body is to present a modern interpretation of the natural vis medicatrix.".&lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;Cross, S. T. Albury, W. R. (1987) "Walter B. Cannon, L. J. Henderson, and the Organic Analogy"  Osiris  3:165-192 page 175 [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/368665]&lt;/ref&gt; In this, Cannon stands in contrast to [[Claude Bernard]] (the father of modern [[physiology]]), and his earlier idea of [[milieu interieur]] that he proposed to replace vitalistic ideas about the body.&lt;ref name="Cross"/&gt; However, both the notions of homeostasis and milieu interieur are ones concerned with how the body's physiology regulates itself through multiple [[mechanical equilibrium]] adjustment feedbacks rather than nonmechanistic [[Vitalism|life forces]].

==Relation to evolutionary medicine==
More recently, [[evolutionary medicine]] has identified many medical symptoms such as [[fever]], [[inflammation]], [[sickness behavior]], and [[morning sickness]] as evolved adaptations that function as ''darwinian medicatrix naturae'' due to their selection as means to protect, heal, or restore the injured, infected or physiologically disrupted body.&lt;ref&gt;Nesse, R. M. Williams, G. C. (1994) 'Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine' Vintage Books New York {{ISBN|0-679-74674-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars and policymakers have noted that the fields of [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM) have remained predominantly male with historically low participation among [[Woman|women]] since their origins during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

Scholars are exploring the various reasons for the continued existence of this [[gender]] disparity in STEM fields. Those who view this disparity as resulting from [[discrimination|discriminatory]] forces are also seeking ways to redress this disparity within STEM fields (these typically construed as well-compensated, high-status professions with universal career appeal).&lt;ref&gt;Gürer, Denise and Camp, Tracy (2001).

Studies suggest that many factors contribute to the attitudes towards the achievement of young women in [[mathematics]] and [[science]], including encouragement from parents, interactions with mathematics and science teachers, curriculum content, hands-on laboratory experiences, high school achievement in mathematics and science, and resources available at home.&lt;ref name="Lost Talent"&gt;S.L. Hanson, "Lost Talent, Women in the Sciences", Philadelphia, PA.: Temple University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], research findings are mixed concerning when boys' and girls' attitudes about mathematics and science diverge. Analyzing several nationally representative [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]], one researcher found few differences in girls' and boys' attitudes towards science in the early secondary school years.&lt;ref name="Lost Talent"/&gt; Students' aspirations to pursue careers in mathematics and science influence both the courses they choose to take in those areas and the level of effort they put forth in these courses.

A 1996 study suggested girls begin to lose self-confidence in middle school because they believe that men possess more intelligence in technological fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pajares | first1 = F | year = 1996 | title = Self-efficacy beliefs and mathematical problem-solving of gifted students | url = | journal = [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]] | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 325–44 | doi=10.1006/ceps.1996.0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that men outperform women in spatial analysis, a skillset many engineering professionals deem vital, generates this misconception.&lt;ref name="CeciWilliams2009" /&gt; Feminist scholars postulate that boys are more likely to gain spatial skills outside the classroom because they are culturally encouraged to build and work with their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Catherine, and Christianne Corbett.

A 1996 study of college freshmen by the [[Higher Education Research Institute]] shows that men and women differ greatly in their intended fields of study. Of first-time college freshmen in 1996, 20 percent of men and 4 percent of women planned to major in [[computer science]] and [[engineering]], while similar percentages of men and women planned to major in [[biology]] or [[Physical Sciences|physical sciences]]. The differences in the intended majors between male and female first-time freshmen directly relate to the differences in the fields in which men and women earn their degree. At the post-secondary level, women are less likely than men to earn a degree in mathematics, physical sciences, or computer sciences and engineering. The exception to this gender imbalance is in the field of [[Life-science|life science]].&lt;ref name="Freshman"&gt;Higher Education Research Institute, Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, The American Freshman: National Norms for Fall 1996, University of California, Los Angeles, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of underrepresentation of women in STEM careers ===
In [[Scotland]], a large number of women graduate in STEM subjects but fail to move onto a STEM career compared to men. The [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] estimates that doubling women's high-skill contributions to Scotland's economy would benefit it by £170&amp;nbsp;million per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Tapping All our Talents|date=April 2012|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/other/tapping-all-our-talents|location=United Kingdom|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=9780902198661|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Men's and women's earnings ===
{{See also|Gender pay gap}}
Female college graduates earned less on average than male college graduates, even though they shared the earnings growth of all college graduates in the 1980s. Some of the differences in salary are related to the differences in occupations entered by women and men. Among recent science and engineering bachelor's degree recipients, women were less likely than men to be employed in science and engineering occupations. There remains a wage gap between men and women in comparable scientific positions. Among more experienced scientists and engineers, the gender gap in salaries is greater than for recent graduates.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation, Women, Minorities and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 1996, Washington, D.C.: 1996, appendix table 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Salaries are highest in mathematics, computer science, and engineering, which are fields in which women are not highly represented. In [[Australia]], a study conducted by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] has shown that the current gender wage gap between men and women in STEM fields in Australia stands at 30.1 percent as of 2013, which is an increase of 3 percent since 2012.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.professionalsaustralia.org.au/professional-women/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2014/03/WOMEN_IN_STEM_v2.pdf|title=Women in STEM in Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Professionals Australia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to a study done by Moss, &lt;ref name="Moss-Racusin2012" /&gt;when faculty members of top research institutions in America were asked to recruit student applicants for a laboratory manager position, both men and women faculty members rated the male applicants as more hireable and competent for the position, as opposed to the female applicants who shared an identical resume with the male applicants. In the Moss study, faculty members were willing to give the male applicants a higher starting salary and career mentoring opportunities.&lt;ref name="Moss-Racusin2012" /&gt;

===Education and perception===
The percentage of PhDs in STEM fields in the U.S. earned by women is about 42%,&lt;ref name="NSF T7.3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/static/data/tab7-3.xlsx |title=TABLE 7-3.

These differences start as early as the third grade according to Thomas Dee, with boys advancing in math and science and girls advancing in reading.&lt;ref&gt;Dee, Thomas S. "Teachers and the Gender Gaps in Student Achievement." The Journal of Human Resources, vol. 42, no. 3, 2007, pp. 528–554. {{JSTOR|40057317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representation of women worldwide ==
[[UNESCO]], among other agencies including the [[European Commission]] and The Association of Academies and Societies of Sciences in Asia (AASSA), have been outspoken about the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields globally.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002315/231519e.pdf|title=A Complex Formula: Girls and Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics in Asia|date=2015|website=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO Bangkok Office|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=She figures 2012 – Research policy and organisation – EU Bookshop|url=http://bookshop.europa.eu/uri?target=EUB:NOTICE:KINA25617:EN:HTML|doi=10.2777/38520|date=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interacademies.net/File.aspx?id=28016|title=Women in Science and Technology in Asia|date=1 September 2015|website=The InterAcademy Partnership|publisher=AASSA, Gyeonggi-Do|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their efforts to compile and interpret comparative statistics, it is necessary to exercise caution. [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] has commented on the obstacles regarding the making of meaningful statistical comparisons between countries:&lt;ref name="fastlane"&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "Life in the fast lane: Arab women in science and technology," ''Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society'', vol. 36, no. 2 (2016), p. 107–117.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|
For a variety of reasons, it is difficult to obtain reliable data on international comparisons of women in STEM fields.  Aggregate figures do not tell us much, especially since terminology describing educational levels, content of majors, job categories, and other markers varies from country to country. 
}}
Even when different countries use the same definitions of terms, the social significance of the categories may differ considerably. Koblitz remarks:&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "Mathematics and gender: Some cross-cultural observations," in Gila Hanna, ed., ''Towards Gender Equity in Mathematics Education: An ICMI Study'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|
It is not possible to use the same indicators to determine the situation in every country.  The significant statistic might be the percentage of women teaching at the university level.  But it might also be the proportion of women at research institutes and academies of sciences (and at what level), or the percentage of women who publish (or who publish in foreign as opposed to domestic journals), or the proportion of women who go abroad for conferences, post-graduate study, and so on, or the percentage of women awarded grants by national and international funding agencies.  Indices can have different meanings in different countries, and the prestige of various positions and honors can vary considerably.

=== Asia ===
[[File:Proportion of female graduates A Complex Formula.svg|thumb|Proportion of female graduates in science programmes in tertiary education in Asia.]]
A fact sheet published by UNESCO in March 2015&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; presented worldwide statistics of women in the STEM fields, with a focus on [[Asia]] and the Pacific region. It reports that, worldwide, 30 percent of researchers are women. In these areas, East Asia, the Pacific, South Asia and West Asia had the most uneven balance, with 20 percent of researchers being women in each of those sub-regions. Meanwhile, [[Central Asia]] had the most equal balance in the region, with women comprising 46 percent of its researchers. The Central Asian countries [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] were the only countries in Asia with women as the majority of their researchers, though in both cases it was by a very small margin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002351/235155E.pdf|title=Women in Science|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cambodia ====
As of 2004, 13.9% of students enrolled in science programs in [[Cambodia]] were female and 21% of researchers in science, technology, and innovation&amp;nbsp;fields were female as of 2002. These statistics are significantly lower than those of other Asian countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[Mongolia]], and [[South Korea]]. According to a UNESCO report on women in STEM in Asian countries, Cambodia's education system has a long history of male dominance stemming from its male-only [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teaching practices. Starting in 1924, girls were allowed to enroll in school. Bias against women, not only in education but in other aspects of life as well, exists in the form of traditional views of men as more powerful and dignified than women, especially in the home and in the workplace, according to UNESCO's ''A Complex Formula''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Indonesia ====
UNESCO's ''A Complex Formula'' states that [[Indonesia]]'s government has been working towards gender equality, especially through the [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Ministry of Education and Culture]], but stereotypes about women's roles in the workplace persists. Due to traditional views and societal [[Norm (social)|norms]], women struggle to remain in their careers or to move up in the workplace. Substantially more women are enrolled in science-based fields such as [[pharmacy]] and biology than in mathematics and [[physics]]. Within engineering, statistics vary based on the specific engineering discipline; women make up 78% of [[chemical engineering]] students but only 5% of [[mechanical engineering]] students. As of 2005, out of 35,564 researchers in science, technology, and engineering, only 10,874 or 31% were female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Malaysia ====
According to UNESCO, 48.19% of students enrolled in science programs in Malaysia were female as of 2011. This number has grown significantly in the past three decades, during which the country's employment of women has increased by 95%. In Malaysia, over 50% of employees in the computer industry, which is generally a male-dominated field within STEM, are women. Of students enrolled in pharmacy, more than 70% are female, while in engineering only 36% of students are female. Women held 49% of research positions in science, technology, and innovation as of 2011.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Mongolia ====
According to UNESCO's data from 2012 and 2011 respectively, 40.2% of students enrolled in science programs and 49% of researchers in science, technology, and innovation in Mongolia are female.&amp;nbsp;Traditionally, [[nomad]]ic Mongol culture was fairly egalitarian, with both women and men raising children, tending livestock, and fighting in battle, which mirrors the relative equality of women and men in Mongolia's modern-day workforce. More females than males pursue higher education and 65% of college graduates in Mongolia are women. However, women earn about 19–30% less than their male counterparts and are perceived by society to be less suited to engineering than men. Thirty percent or less of employees in computer science, construction architecture, and engineering are female while three in four biology students are female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Nepal ====
As of 2011, 26.17% of [[Nepal]]'s science students were women and 19% of their engineering students were also women. In research, women held 7.8% of positions in 2010. These low percentages correspond with Nepal's patriarchal societal values. In Nepal, women that enter STEM fields most often enter forestry or medicine, specifically [[nursing]], which is perceived as a predominantly female occupation in most countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== South Korea ====
In 2012, 30.63% of students enrolled in science programs in South Korea were female, a number that has been increasing since the digital revolution. Numbers of male and female students enrolled at most levels of education are comparable as well, though the gender difference is larger in higher education. Confucian beliefs in the lower societal value of women as well as other cultural factors could influence South Korea's STEM gender gap. In South Korea, as in other countries, the percentage of women in medicine (61.6%) is much higher than the percentage of women in engineering (15.4%) and other more math-based stem fields. In research occupations in science, technology, and innovation, women made up 17% of the workforce as of 2011. In South Korea, most women working in STEM fields are classified as "non-regular" or temporary employees, indicating poor job stability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In a study conducted by the University of Glasgow which examined math anxiety and test performance of boys and girls from various countries, researchers found that South Korea had a high sex difference in mathematics scores, with female students scoring significantly lower than and experiencing more math anxiety on math tests than male students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoet|first=Gijsbert|last2=Bailey|first2=Drew H.|last3=Moore|first3=Alex M.|last4=Geary|first4=David C.|date=2016-04-21|title=Countries with Higher Levels of Gender Equality Show Larger National Sex Differences in Mathematics Anxiety and Relatively Lower Parental Mathematics Valuation for Girls|journal=PLOS One|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e0153857|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0153857|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4839696|pmid=27100631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gulf states ====
[[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] reported&lt;ref name="fastlane"/&gt; on a series of interviews conducted in 2015 in Abu Dhabi with women engineers and computer scientists who had come to the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf states to find opportunities that were not available to them in their home country.  The women spoke of a remarkably high level of job satisfaction and relatively little discrimination.  Koblitz comments that

{{Quote|
...most people in most countries outside of the Middle East have no idea that the region, in particular the UAE, is a magnet for young, dynamic Arab women making successful careers for themselves in a variety of high-tech and other scientific fields; "land of opportunity," "a tech-person's paradise," and yes, even "mecca" were among the terms used to describe the UAE by the women I met.

In the [[European Union]] only 16.7% on average of ICT (Information and communication technology) specialists are women. Only in [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] do women hold more that 25 percent of these roles. The gender distribution is more balanced, particularly in [[History of the European Union|new member states]] when taking into account ICT technicians (middle and low-ranking positions).&lt;ref name=EDJNet /&gt;

In 2012 the percentage of women PhD graduates was 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, and just the 28% of PhD graduates in engineering, manufacturing and construction. In the computing subfield only 21% of PhD graduates were women. In 2013 in the EU as an average men scientists and engineers made up 4.1% of total labour force, while women made up only 2.8%. In more than half of the countries women make up less than 45% of scientists and engineers. The situation has improved, as between 2008 and 2011 the number of women amongst employed scientists and engineers grew by an average of 11.1% per year, while the number of men grew only by 3.3% over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date= 2016|title= She Figures 2015|url= https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/she_figures_2015-final.pdf#view=fit&amp;pagemode=none|publisher= European Commission|page= |access-date= 28 August 2018 |ISBN=978-92-79-48375-2|doi=10.2777/744106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 in [[Slovenia]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], and [[Italy]] there were more boys than girls taking advanced courses in mathematics and physics in secondary education in Grade 12.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;

In 2018 [[European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society]] [[Mariya Gabriel]] announced plans to increase the participation of women in the digital sector by challenging stereotypes; promoting digital skills and education and advocating for more women entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More women in the Digital sector: a key to Europe's successful digital future |url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/more-women-digital-sector-key-europes-successful-digital-future-international-womens-day-2018 |work=Digital Single Market|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 August 2018 |date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men are much more likely than women to have a STEM career regardless of educational attainment. Women in STEM fields earn considerably less than men, even after controlling for a wide set of characteristics such as education and age. On average, men in STEM jobs earn $36.34 per hour while women in STEM jobs earn $31.11 per hour.&lt;ref name="Women in STEM"/&gt;

Women dominate the total number of persons with bachelor's degrees, as well as those in STEM fields defined by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]]. However, they are underrepresented in specific fields including Computer Sciences, Engineering, and Mathematics.

Asian women are over-represented in STEM fields in the U.S.(though not as much as males of the same ethnicity) compared to African American, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, and Native American women.&lt;ref name="NCES2014"/&gt; Within academia, these minority women represent less than 1% of tenure-track positions in the top 100 U.S. universities despite constituting approximately 13% of total US population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Towns|first=Marcy|date=Spring 2010|title=Where Are the Women of Color?

==== African American Women ====
Prejudice and assumed stereotypes keep women of color, especially black women from studying in STEM fields. Psychologically, stereotypes on black women's intellect, cognitive abilities, and work ethic contribute to their lack of confidence in STEM. Spelman College is looking to change how the world looks at African American women, and welcomes black women helping to support them in becoming involved and technically proficient in STEM. Spelman provides the environment which cultivates creativity, intellectual thinking, and curiosity to broaden their thinking for complex solutions. 2,100 students of Spelman come from forty-four states, one territory and eleven countries, with one of the highest ranks of all institutions with black graduating with bachelors of science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Kimberly M.|date=Spring 2014|title=Realigning the crooked room: Spelman claims a space for African American women in STEM|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A379445373/ITOF?u=auraria_main&amp;sid=ITOF&amp;xid=1a7ce7cd|journal=Realigning the Crooked Room: Spelman Claims a Space for African American Women in STEM|volume=16|pages=|via=Auraria Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada ====
According to the National Household Survey, women represented 39% of STEM graduates in Canada, as opposed to 66% in non-STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-006-x/2013001/article/11874-eng.htm|title=Gender differences in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and computer science (STEM) programs at university|last=Hango|first=Darcy|date=2015|website=statcan|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the [[University of British Columbia]] discovered that only 20–25% of computer science students from all Canadian college and universities are women. As well, only about 1 in 5 of that percentage will graduate from those programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A325699497/GPS?u=ko_k12hs_d73&amp;sid=GPS&amp;xid=ce00382c|title=Unlocking the brilliance: author provides insights on how to inspire young women to join the high tech industry|website=link.galegroup.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistically, women are less likely to choose a STEM program, regardless of mathematical ability. Young men with lower marks in mathematics are more likely to pursue STEM fields than their women-identified peers with higher marks in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Darcy Hango|title=Gender differences in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and computer science (STEM) programs at university|date=18 Dec 2013|url=https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-006-x/2013001/article/11874-eng.htm|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underrepresentation in STEM-related awards and competitions ==
In terms of the most prestigious awards in STEM fields, fewer have been awarded to women than to men. Between 1901 and 2017 the female:total ratio of [[Nobel Prize]]s were 2:207 for physics, 4:178 for chemistry, 12:214 for physiology/medicine, and 1:79 for economic sciences.
The ratios for other fields were 14:114 in literature and 16:104 for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/ |title=Nobel Prize Facts |publisher= NobelPrize.org |access-date=18 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maryam Mirzakhani]] was the first woman and first Iranian to receive the [[Fields Medal]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/IMU/Prizes/2014/news_release_mirzakhani.pdf|title=The Work of Maryam Mirzakhani.

Fewer female students participate in prestigious STEM-related competitions such as the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]. In 2017, only 10% of the IMO participants were female and there was one female on the South Korean winning team of six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imo-official.org/organizers.aspx?column=year&amp;amp;order=desc | title=International Mathematical Olympiad Timeline | website=International Mathematical Olympiad |publisher= |access-date=18 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koreadailyus.com/korea-takes-1st-place-at-international-math-olympiad/ | title=Korea Takes 1st Place at International Math Olympiad | date=25 Jul 2017 |website=Korea Daily |publisher= |access-date=18 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of UK patent applications, in 2016, found that the proportion of new inventions registered by women was rising, but that most female inventors were active in stereotypically female fields such as "designing bras and make-up". 94% of inventions in the field of computing, 96% in automotive applications and mining, and 99% in explosives and munitions, were by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=New generation of inventors wanted: women need to apply|last=Keate|first=Georgie|date=27 December 2016|work=[[The Times]]|pages=22–23|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 [[Russia]] had the highest percentage of patents filed by women, at about 16%.

== Explanations for low representation of women ==
There are a variety of proposed reasons for the relatively low numbers of women in STEM fields. These can be broadly classified into societal, psychological, and innate explanations. However, explanations are not necessarily restricted to just one of these categories.

=== Societal ===
====Discrimination====
Schiebinger claims discrimination, both overt and covert, faced by women in STEM fields leads to fewer women in STEM fields.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999" /&gt;{{rp|33}} In the 1980s, researchers demonstrated a general evaluative bias against women.&lt;ref name=Swim1989&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swim|first1=J.|last2=Borgida|first2=E.|last3=Maruyama|first3=G.|last4=Myers|first4=D.G.|title=Joan McKay versus John McKay: Do gender stereotypes bias evaluations?|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1989|volume=105|issue=3|pages=409–429|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.105.3.409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 study, email requests were sent to meet to professors in doctoral programs at the top 260 U.S. universities. It was impossible to determine whether any particular individual in this study was exhibiting discrimination, since each participant only viewed a request from one potential graduate student. However, researchers found evidence for discrimination against ethnic minorities and women relative to Caucasian men.&lt;ref name=Milkman2012&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Milkman| first1=K.L|last2=Akinola| first2=M.|last3=Chugh|first3=D.| title=Temporal Distance and Discrimination: An Audit Study in Academia|journal=Psychological Science|year=2012| volume=23|issue=7|pages=710–717|doi=10.1177/0956797611434539|pmid=22614463}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, science faculty were sent the materials of student who was applying for a lab manager position at their university.&lt;ref name=Moss-Racusin2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moss-Racusin|first1=C.A.|last2=Dovidio| first2=J.F.|last3=Brescoll| first3=V.L.|last4=Graham| first4=M.| last5=Handelsman|first5=J.| title=Science faculty's subtle gender biases favor male students|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2012 |volume=109|issue=41|pages=16474–16479| doi=10.1073/pnas.1211286109|pmid=22988126| pmc=3478626}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials were the same for each participant, but each application was randomly assigned either a male or a female name. The researchers found that faculty members rated the male candidates as both more competent and more hirable than the females candidate, despite applications being otherwise identical.&lt;ref name=Moss-Racusin2012/&gt; If individuals are given information about a prospective student's gender, they may infer that he or she possesses traits consistent with stereotypes for that gender.&lt;ref name=Deaux1984&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deaux|first1=K.|last2=Lewis|first2=L.L.|title=Structure of gender stereotypes: Interrelationships among components and gender label|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1984|volume=46|issue=5|pages=991–1004|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.46.5.991}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2014 found that men are favored in some domains, such as tenure rates in biology, but that the majority of domains were gender-fair. The authors interpreted this to suggest that the underrepresentation of women in the professorial ranks was not solely caused by sexist hiring, promotion, and remuneration.&lt;ref name="Ceci-2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ceci |first1=S.

==== Stereotypes ====
Stereotypes about what someone in a STEM field should look and act like may cause established members of these fields to overlook individuals who are highly competent.&lt;ref name=Wells1985&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=Gary L.|title=The Conjunction Error and the Representativeness Heuristic|journal=Social Cognition| year=1985|volume=3|issue=3| pages=266–279|doi=10.1521/soco.1985.3.3.266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotypical scientist or individual in another STEM profession is usually thought to be male.&lt;ref name=Good2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Good|first1=Jessica J.|last2=Woodzicka|first2=Julie A.|last3= Wingfield|first3= Lylan C.|title=The Effects of Gender Stereotypic and Counter-Stereotypic Textbook Images on Science Performance|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|year=2010|volume=150|issue=2|pages=132–147|doi=10.1080/00224540903366552|pmid=20397590}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in STEM fields may not fit individuals' conception of what a scientist, engineer, or mathematician "should" look like and may thus be overlooked or penalized. The Role Congruity Theory of Prejudice states that perceived incongruity between gender and a particular role or occupation can result in negative evaluations.&lt;ref name=Eagly2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eagly|first1=A.H.|last2=Karau|first2=S.J.|title=Role congruity theory of prejudice toward female leaders|journal=Psychological Review|year=2002| volume=109|issue=3| pages=573–598| doi=10.1037/0033-295x.109.3.573| pmid=12088246|citeseerx=10.1.1.460.315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garcia-Retamero2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia-Retamero|first1=R.|last2=Lopez-Zafra|first2=E.|title=Prejudice against Women in Male-congenial Environments: Perceptions of Gender Role Congruity in Leadership|journal=Sex Roles|year=2006|volume=55|issue=1–2|pages=51–61|doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9068-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ritter2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ritter|first1=B.A.|last2=Yoder|first2=J.D.|title=Gender Differences in Leader Emergence Persist Even for Dominant Women: An Updated Confirmation of Role Congruity Theory|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|year=2004|volume=28|issue=3|pages=187–193|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00135.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, negative stereotypes about women's quantitative abilities may lead people to devalue their work or discourage these women from continuing in STEM fields.&lt;ref name=Miyake2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miyake|first1=A.|last2=Kost-Smith|first2=L.E.|last3=Finkelstein|first3=N.D.|last4 = Pollock|first4=S.J.|last5=Cohen|first5=G.L.|last6=Ito|first6=T.A.|title=Reducing the Gender Achievement Gap in College Science: A Classroom Study of Values Affirmation|journal=Science| year=2010|volume=330|issue=6008| pages=1234–1237| doi=10.1126/science.1195996 | pmid=21109670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both men and women who work in "nontraditional" occupations may encounter discrimination, but the forms and consequences of this discrimination are different. Individuals of a particular gender are often perceived to be better suited to particular careers or areas of study than those of the other gender.&lt;ref name=Gaucher2011&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Gaucher|first1=D.| last2=Friesen|first2=J.|last3=Kay| first3=A.C.|title=Evidence that gendered wording in job advertisements exists and sustains gender inequality|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=101| issue=1|pages=109–128| doi=10.1037/a0022530|pmid=21381851}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lyness2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyness|first1=K.S.|last2=Heilman|first2=M.E.|title=When fit is fundamental: Performance evaluations and promotions of upper-level female and male managers|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology| year=2006|volume=91| issue=4| pages=777–785| doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.4.777|pmid=16834505|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.9525}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that job advertisements for male-dominated careers tended to use more agentic words (or words denoting agency, such as "leader" and "goal-oriented") associated with male stereotypes.&lt;ref name=Gaucher2011/&gt; Social Role Theory, proposed in 1991, states that men are expected to display agentic qualities and women to display communal qualities.&lt;ref name=Eagly1991&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eagly|first1=A.H.|last2=Wood|first2=W.|title=Explaining Sex Differences in Social Behavior: A Meta-Analytic Perspective|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1991|volume=17|issue=3|pages=306–315| doi=10.1177/0146167291173011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expectations can influence hiring decisions.&lt;ref name=Madera2009&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Madera|first1=J.M.|last2=Hebl|first2=M.R.|last3=Martin|first3=R.C.| title=Gender and letters of recommendation for academia: Agentic and communal differences|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|year=2009|volume=94|issue=6|pages=1591–1599|doi=10.1037/a0016539|pmid=19916666|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.9717}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study found that women tended to be described in more communal terms and men in more agentic terms in letters of recommendation. These researchers also found that communal characteristics were negatively related to hiring decisions in academia.&lt;ref name=Madera2009/&gt;

Although women entering traditionally male professions face negative stereotypes suggesting that they are not "real" women, these stereotypes do not seem to deter women to the same degree that similar stereotypes may deter men from pursuing nontraditional professions. There is historical evidence that women flock to male-identified occupations once opportunities are available.&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, Samuel. 1985. ''The Process of Occupational Sex-Typing''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, examples of occupations changing from predominantly female to predominantly male are very rare in human history. The few existing cases—such as medicine—suggest that redefinition of the occupations as appropriately masculine is necessary before men will consider joining them.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenreich, Barbara, and Deirdre English. 1978. For Her Own Good: 100 Years of Expert Advice to Women. Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although men in female-dominated occupations may contend with negative stereotypes about their masculinity, they may also experience certain benefits. In 1992 it was suggested that women in male-dominated occupations tended to hit a [[glass ceiling]]; while men in female-dominated occupations may hit a "glass escalator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Christine | year = 1992 | title = The Glass Escalator: Hidden Advantages for Men in the 'Female' Professions | journal = Social Problems | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 253–267 | jstor=3096961 | doi=10.1525/sp.1992.39.3.03x0034h}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the glass ceiling can make it difficult for women and minorities to reach the top of an occupation, the "glass escalator" allows men to excel in a profession that is female dominated.

The Black Sheep effect occurs when individuals are likely to evaluate members of their in-group more favorably than members of their out-group when those members are highly qualified.&lt;ref name=Eidelman2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eidelman|first1=S.|last2=Biernat|first2=M.|title=Derogating black sheep: Individual or group protection?|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology| year=2003|volume=39| issue=6|pages=602–609| doi=10.1016/s0022-1031(03)00042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerr1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=N.L.|last2=Hymes|first2=R.W.|last3=Anderson|first3=A.B.|last4=Weathers|first4=J.E.|title=Defendant-juror similarity and mock juror judgments|journal=Law and Human Behavior|year=1995|volume=19|issue=6|pages=545–567|doi=10.1007/bf01499374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marques2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=J.|last2=Abrams|first2=D.|last3=Serodio|first3=R.G.|title=Being better by being right: Subjective group dynamics and derogation of in-group deviants when generic norms are undermined|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2001|volume=81|issue=3|pages=436–447|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.3.436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=T.S.|last2=Hosch|first2=H.M.|title=An examination of jury verdicts for evidence of a similarity-leniency effect, an out-group punitiveness effect or a black sheep effect|journal=Law and Human Behavior|year=2004|volume=28|issue=5|pages=587–598|doi=10.1023/b:lahu.0000046436.36228.71}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when an individual's in-group members have average or below average qualities, he or she is likely to evaluate them much lower than out-group members with equivalent qualifications.&lt;ref name=Eidelman2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerr1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marques2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor2004/&gt; This suggests that established women in STEM fields will be more likely than established men to help early career women who display sufficient qualifications. However, established women will be less likely than men to help early career women who display insufficient qualifications.

====Queen Bee effect====
The Queen Bee effect is similar to the Black Sheep effect but applies only to women. It explains why higher-status women, particularly in male-dominated professions, may actually be far less likely to help other women than their male colleagues might be.&lt;ref name=Cooper1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=V.W.|title=Homophily or the Queen Bee Syndrome|journal=Small Group Research|year=1997|volume=28|issue=4|pages=483–499|doi=10.1177/1046496497284001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellemers|first1=N.|last2=Van den Heuvel|first2=H.|last3=de Gilder|first3=D.|last4=Maass|first4=A.|last5=Bonvini|first5=A.|title=The underrepresentation of women in science: Differential commitment or the queen bee syndrome?|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=43|issue=3|pages=315–338|doi=10.1348/0144666042037999|pmid=15479533|url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/files/1953519/Ellemers%20British%20Journal%20of%20Social%20Psychology%2043%202004%20u.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study found that while doctoral students in a number of different disciplines did not exhibit any gender differences in work commitment or work satisfaction, faculty members at the same university believed that female students were less committed to their work than male students.&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004/&gt; What was particularly surprising was that these beliefs by faculty members were most strongly endorsed by female faculty members, rather than male faculty members.&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004/&gt; One potential explanation for this finding is that individual mobility for a member of a negatively stereotyped group is often accompanied by a social and psychological distancing of oneself from the group. This implies that successful women in traditionally male-dominated careers do not see their success as evidence that negative stereotypes about women's quantitative and analytical abilities are wrong, but rather as proof that they personally are exceptions to the rule.&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004/&gt; Thus, such women may actually play a role in perpetuating, rather than abolishing, these negative stereotypes.

====Mentorship====
In STEM fields, the support and encouragement of a mentor can make a lot of difference in women's decisions of whether or not to continue pursuing a career in their discipline&lt;ref name=Sonnert2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sonnert|first1=G.|last2=Fox|first2=M.F.|last3=Adkins|first3=K.|title=Undergraduate Women in Science and Engineering: Effects of Faculty, Fields, and Institutions Over Time|journal=Social Science Quarterly|year=2007|volume=88|issue=5|pages=1333–1356|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2007.00505.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.452.4529}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stout2011&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Stout|first1=J.G.|last2=Dasgupta| first2=N.|last3=Hunsinger| first3=M.|last4=McManus| first4=M.A.|title=STEMing the tide: Using ingroup experts to inoculate women's self-concept in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=100|issue=2|pages=255–270|doi=10.1037/a0021385|pmid=21142376}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be particularly true for younger individuals who may face many obstacles early on in their careers.&lt;ref name="Griffith2010"/&gt; Since these younger individuals often look to those who are more established in their discipline for help and guidance, the responsiveness and helpfulness of potential mentors is incredibly important.

====Lack of support====
Women in STEM may leave due to not being invited to professional meetings, the use of sexually discriminating standards against women, inflexible working conditions, the perceived need to hide pregnancies, and the struggle to balance family and work. Women in STEM fields that have children either need child care or to take a long leave of absence. When a [[nuclear family]] can not afford child care, typically it is the mother that gives up her career to stay at home with the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/7-things-keeping-women-out-of-science-2013-10 |title=These Are The 7 Things Keeping Women Out of Science Careers |last=Welsh |first=Jennifier |date=16 Oct 2013 |website= |publisher=Business Insider |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due in part to women being paid statistically less in their careers. The man makes more money so the man goes to work and the woman gives up her career. Maternity leave is another issue women in STEM fields face. In the [[Maternity leave in the United States|U.S. maternity leave]] is required by The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/ |title=Family and Medical Leave Act |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=United States Department of Labor |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FMLA requires 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually for mothers of newborn or newly adopted children. This is one of the lowest levels of leave in the industrialized world. Unlike the United States, most countries have the right to paid time off.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} If a new mother does not have external financial support or savings, they may not be able to take their full maternity leave. Few companies allow men to take paternity leave and it may be shorter than women's maternity leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edd.ca.gov/Disability/PFL_Fathers.htm |title=Paid Family Leave – Fathers |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=State of California, Employment Development Department |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longer paternity leaves for men could allow women to go back to work while their partners stay home with the children.

==== Harassment ====
In 1993 ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' indicated that three-quarters of women students and residents were harassed at least once during their medical training.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999" /&gt;{{rp|51}}

==== Lack of role models ====
In engineering and science education, women made up almost 50 percent of non-tenure track lecturer and instructor jobs, but only 10 percent of tenured or tenure-track professors in 1996. In addition, the number of female department chairs in medical schools did not change from 1976 to 1996.&lt;ref name="Pell1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pell|first1=A N|title=Fixing the leaky pipeline: women scientists in academia|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=74|issue=11| year=1996|pages=2843–8|issn=0021-8812| doi=10.2527/1996.74112843x|pmid=8923199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, women who do make it to tenured or tenure-track positions may face the difficulties associated with holding a token status. They may lack support from colleagues and may face antagonism from peers and supervisors.&lt;ref name="Lips2008" /&gt; However, in 2014 a team of psychologists and economists conducted extensive analyses of national data and concluded that the state of women in STEM has changed greatly in the past two decades and any conclusions about their status based on data prior to 2000 are likely to be outdated. In general, they concluded that women had very sizable gains in academic science, including remuneration, promotion, and job satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Ceci2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ceci|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Ginther|first2=Donna K.|last3=Kahn|first3=Shulamit|last4=Williams|first4=Wendy M.|title=Women in Academic Science, A Changing Landscape |journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest |volume=15 |issue=3 |year=2014 |pages=75–141 |issn=1529-1006 |doi=10.1177/1529100614541236|pmid=26172066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it has been posited that more female role models would encourage more women to enter fields dominated by men, research has indicated this is not the case,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Cheryan|first1 = Sapna|last2 = Siy|first2 = John Oliver|last3 = Vichayapai|first3 = Marissa|last4 = Drury|first4 = Benjamin J.|last5 = Kim|first5 = Saenam|title = Do Female and Male Role Models Who Embody STEM Stereotypes Hinder Women's Anticipated Success in STEM?|journal = Social Psychological and Personality Science|volume = 2|issue = 6|pages = 656–664|doi = 10.1177/1948550611405218|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that women's lack of interest in STEM fields may instead in part stem from stereotypes about employees and workplaces in STEM fields, to which stereotypes women are disproportionately responsive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/15/geeky_decor_puts_off_ladies/ |title=Ladies put off tech careers by sci-fi posters, Coke cans |last=Page |first=Lewis |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/06/27/girls_into_tech_cracked_at_last_sorta/ |title=Trick-cyclist's claim: I have FOUND how to get GIRLS INTO TECH |last=Page |first=Lewis |date=27 June 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Clustering and leaky pipeline ====
In the early 1980s Rossiter put forth the concept of "territorial segregation" or [[occupational segregation]], which is the idea that women "cluster" in certain fields of study.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}} For example, "women are more likely to teach and do research in the humanities and social sciences than in the natural sciences and engineering",&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"/&gt;{{rp|34}} and the majority of college women tend to choose majors such as psychology, education, English, performing arts, and nursing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ruchika Tulshyan |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/03/02/top-10-college-majors-women-forbes-woman-leadership-education_slide_11.html |title=Top 10 College Majors For Women – 10: Liberal Arts and Sciences, General Studies, Humanities |publisher=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-07|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123090031/http://www.forbes.com/2010/03/02/top-10-college-majors-women-forbes-woman-leadership-education_slide_11.html|archivedate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossiter also used "hierarchical segregation" as an explanation for the low number of women in STEM fields.{{clarify|date=March 2018}} She describes "hierarchical segregation" as a decrease in the number of women as one "moves up the ladder of power and prestige."&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"/&gt;{{rp|33}} This is related to the [[STEM pipeline|leaky STEM pipeline]] concept. The metaphor of the leaky pipeline has been used to describe how women drop out of STEM fields at all stages of their careers. In the U.S., out of 2,000 high school aged persons, 1944 were enrolled in high school fall 2014.&lt;ref name="NCES d15_201.20"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/tables/dt15_201.20.asp |title=Table 201.20.

=== Psychological ===
==== Lack of interest ====
A meta-analysis concluded that men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people. When interests were classified by [[Holland Codes|RIASEC type]] (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional), men showed stronger Realistic and Investigative interests, and women showed stronger Artistic, Social, and Conventional interests. Sex differences favoring men were also found for more specific measures of engineering, science, and mathematics interests.&lt;ref name="Su2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Su|first1=Rong|last2=Rounds|first2=James|last3= Armstrong|first3= Patrick|title=Men and Things, Women and People: A Meta-Analysis of Sex Differences in Interests|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2009|volume=135|issue=6|pages=859–884|doi=10.1037/a0017364|pmid=19883140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 3-year interview study, Seymour and Hewitt (1997) found that perceptions that non-STEM academic majors offered better education options and better matched their interests was the most common (46%) reason provided by female students for switching majors from STEM areas to non-STEM areas. The second most frequently cited reason given for switching to non-STEM areas was a reported loss of interest in the women's chosen STEM majors. Additionally, 38% of female students who remained in STEM majors expressed concerns that there were other academic areas that might be a better fit for their interests.&lt;ref name="Seymour1997"&gt;{{cite book | last=Seymour | first=Elaine | title=Talking about leaving : why undergraduates leave the sciences | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder, CO, USA | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-8133-6642-5 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preston's (2004) survey of 1,688 individuals who had left sciences also showed that 30 percent of the women endorsed "other fields more interesting" as their reason for leaving.&lt;ref name="Preston2004"&gt;{{cite book | last=Preston | first=Anne | title=Leaving science : occupational exit from scientific careers | publisher=Russell Sage Foundation | location=New York | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-87154-694-4 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced math skills do not often result in a woman being interested in a STEM career. A [[Statistics Canada]] survey found that even young women of high mathematical ability are much less likely to enter a STEM field than young men of similar or even lesser ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Lack of confidence ====
Research has found that women steer away from STEM fields because they believe they are not qualified for them; the study suggested that this could be fixed by encouraging girls to participate in more mathematics classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/27/new_study_into_lack_of_women_in_tech_its_not_the_mens_fault/?mt=1437990843635 |title=New study into lack of women in Tech: It's NOT the men's fault |last=Page |first=Lewis |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the factors behind girls' lack of confidence might be unqualified or ineffective teachers.

Not only can the issue of confidence keep women from even entering STEM fields, but even women in upper-level courses with higher skill are more strongly affected by the stereotype that they (by nature) do not possess innate ability to succeed.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Julia|date=November–December 2012|title=Calculus GPA and Math Identification as Moderators of Stereotype Threat in Highly Persistent Women|url=|journal=Basic &amp; Applied Social Psychology|volume=34 |issue=6|pages=534–543|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can cause a negative effect on confidence for women despite making it through courses designed to filter students out of the field.

====Stereotype threat====
Stereotype threat arises from the fear that one's actions will confirm a negative stereotype about one's in-group. This fear creates additional stress, consuming valuable cognitive resources and lowering task performance in the threatened domain.&lt;ref name=Schmader2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmader|first1=T.|last2=Johns|first2=M.|title=Converging evidence that stereotype threat reduces working memory capacity|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=85|issue=3|pages=440–452|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.3.440|pmid=14498781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steele1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=C.M.|last2=Aronson|first2=J.|title=Stereotype Threat and the Intellectual Test Performance of African Americans|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1995|volume=69|issue=5|pages=797–811|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797|pmid=7473032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steele2002&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Steele|first1=C.M.|last2=Spencer|first2=S.J.|last3=Aronson|first3=J.|title=Contending with group image: The psychology of stereotype and social identity threat|year=2002|volume=34|pages=379–440|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(02)80009-0|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|isbn=9780120152346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are susceptible to stereotype threat whenever they are assessed in a domain for which there is a perceived negative stereotype about a group to which they belong. Stereotype threat undermines the academic performance of women and girls in math and science, which leads to an underestimation of abilities in these subjects by standard measures of academic achievement.&lt;ref name=Spencer1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer|first1=S.J.|last2=Steele|first2=C.M.|last3=Quinn|first3=D.M.|title=Stereotype threat and women's math performance|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=1999|volume=35|issue=1|pages=4–28|doi=10.1006/jesp.1998.1373|citeseerx=10.1.1.370.3979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miyake2010/&gt; Individuals who identify strongly with a certain area (e.g., math) are more likely to have their performance in that area hampered by stereotype threat than those who identify less strongly with the area.&lt;ref name=Steele2002/&gt; This means that even highly motivated students from negatively stereotyped groups are likely to be adversely affected by stereotype threat and thus may come to disengage from the stereotyped domain.&lt;ref name=Steele2002/&gt;
Negative stereotypes about girls’ capabilities in mathematics and science drastically lower their performance in mathematics and science courses as well as their interest in pursuing a STEM career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christine-bork/women-in-science_b_1327752.html |title=STEM Fields: Where Are the Women? |last=Bork |first=Christine |date= 2012-03-08|website= |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that gender differences in performance disappear if students are told that there are no gender differences on a particular mathematics test.&lt;ref name=Spencer1999/&gt; This indicates that the learning environment can greatly impact success in a course.

Stereotype threat has been criticized on a theoretical basis.&lt;ref name=jensen&gt;Arthur Robert Jensen "The g factor: the science of mental ability" 1998 {{ISBN|0-275-96103-6}}, Praeger Publishers, 88 Post Road West, Westport, CT 06881, pages 513–515: "the phenomenon of stereotype threat can be explained in terms of a more general construct, test anxiety, which has been studied since the early days of psychometrics. Test anxiety tends to lower performance levels on tests in proportion to the degree of complexity and the amount of mental effort they require of the subject. The relatively greater effect of test anxiety in the black
samples, who had somewhat lower SAT scores, than the white subjects in the Stanford experiments constitutes an example of the Yerkes-Dodson law ... by conducting the same type of experiment using exclusively white (or black)
subjects, divided into lower- and higher-ability groups, it might be shown that 
the phenomenon attributed to stereotype threat has nothing to do with race as
such, but results from the interaction of ability level with test anxiety as a
function of test complexity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoet2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = G. | last2 = Geary | first2 = D.

A study&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; was done to determine how stereotype threat and math identification can affect women who were majoring in a STEM related field. There were three different situations, designed to test the impact of stereotype on performance in math. One group of women were informed that men had previously out-performed women on the same calculus test they were about to take. The next group was told men and women had performed at the same level. The last group was told nothing about how men had performed and there was no mention of gender before taking their test. Out of these situations, women performed at their best scores when there was no mention of gender. The worst scores were from the situation where women were told that men had performed better than women. For women to pursue the male-dominated field of STEM, previous research shows that they must have more confidence in math/science ability.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt;

===Innate versus learned skill===

Some studies propose the explanation that STEM fields (and especially fields like physics, math and philosophy) are considered by both teachers and students to require more innate talent than skills that can be learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/beliefs-about-innate-talent-may-dissuade-students-from-stem-42967 |title=Beliefs about innate talent may dissuade students from STEM |last=Miller |first=David |date=9 Jun 2015 |website= |publisher=The Conversation |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with a tendency to view women as having less of the required innate abilities, researchers propose this can result in assessing women as less qualified for STEM positions. In a study done by Ellis, Fosdick and Rasmussen, it was concluded that without strong skills in calculus, women cannot perform as well as their male counterparts in any field of STEM, which leads to the fewer women pursuing a career in these fields.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=Jessica|last2=Fosdick|first2=Bailey K.|last3=Rasmussen|first3=Chris|title=Women 1.5 Times More Likely to Leave STEM Pipeline after Calculus Compared to Men: Lack of Mathematical Confidence a Potential Culprit|journal=PLOS One|volume=11|issue=7|year=2016|pages=1–14|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0157447|pmid=27410262|pmc=4943602}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high percentage of women that do pursue a career in STEM do not continue on this pathway after taking Calculus I, which was found to be a class that weeds out students from the STEM pathway.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt;

There have been several controversial statements about innate ability and success in STEM. A few notable examples include [[Lawrence Summers]], former president of [[Harvard University]] who suggested cognitive ability at high end positions could cause a population difference. Summers later stepped down as president.&lt;ref name="harvard2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html |title=Archive of: Remarks at NBER Conference on Diversifying the Science &amp; Engineering Workforce |accessdate=2008-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130023006/http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html |archivedate=January 30, 2008 |df= }}. January 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Google engineer, James Damore, wrote a memo entitled [[Google's Ideological Echo Chamber]] suggesting that differences in trait distributions between men and women was a reason for gender imbalance in STEM. The memo stated that [[affirmative action]] to reduce the gap could discriminate against highly qualified male candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/evzjww/here-are-the-citations-for-the-anti-diversity-manifesto-circulating-at-google |title=Here Are the Citations for the Anti-Diversity Manifesto Circulating at Google |last1=Matsakis |first1=Louise | last2=Koebler |first2=Jason | last3=Emerson |first3=Sarah  |date=7 Aug 2017 |website= |publisher=Vice |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damore was fired for sending out this memo.

== Strategies for increasing representation of women ==
[[File:15208-event-CMS Girls Engineering Camp-6655 (18682448435).jpg|thumb|The CMS Girls Engineering Camp at [[Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce]] in June 2015]]

There are a multitude of factors that may explain the low representation of women in STEM careers. [[Anne-Marie Slaughter]], the first woman to hold the position of Director of Policy Planning for the [[United States Department of State]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.princeton.edu/slaughter | title=Anne-Marie Slaughter  |website=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt; has recently suggested some strategies to the corporate and political environment to support women to fulfill to the best of their abilities the many roles and responsibilities that they undertake.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/letters/article/1225099--finding-a-work-life-balance Finding a work-life-balance], ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 11 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The academic and research environment for women may benefit by applying some of the suggestions she has made to help women excel, while maintaining a work-life balance.

===Social-psychological interventions===
A number of researchers have tested interventions to alleviate stereotype threat for women in situations where their math and science skills are being evaluated. The hope is that by combating stereotype threat, these interventions will boost women's performance, encouraging a greater number of them to persist in STEM careers.

One simple intervention is simply educating individuals about the existence of stereotype threat. Researchers found that women who were taught about stereotype threat and how it could negatively impact women's performance in math performed as well as men on a math test, even when stereotype threat was induced. These women also performed better than women who were not taught about stereotype threat before they took the math test.&lt;ref name=Johns2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johns|first1=Michael|last2=Schmader|first2=Toni|last3= Martens|first3= Andy|title=Knowing Is Half the Battle: Teaching Stereotype Threat as a Means of Improving Women's Math Performance|journal=Psychological Science|year=2005|volume=16|issue=3|pages=175–179|doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.00799.x|pmid=15733195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Role models====
One of the proposed methods for alleviating stereotype threat is through introducing role models. One study found that women who took a math test that was administered by a female experimenter did not suffer a drop in performance when compared to women whose test was administered by a male experimenter.&lt;ref name=Marx2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marx|first1=D.M.|last2=Roman|first2=J.S.|title=Female role models: Protecting women's math performance|journal=Personality and Social Bulletin|year=2002|volume=28|issue=9|pages=1183–1193|doi=10.1177/01461672022812004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these researchers found that it was not the physical presence of the female experimenter but rather learning about her apparent competence in math that buffered participants against stereotype threat.&lt;ref name=Marx2002 /&gt; 
The findings of another study suggest that role models do not necessarily have to be individuals with authority or high status, but can also be drawn from peer groups. This study found that girls in same-gender groups performed better on a task that measured math skills than girls in mixed-gender groups.&lt;ref name=Huguet2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huguet|first1=P.|last2=Regner|first2=I.|title=Stereotype threat among schoolgirls in quasi-ordinary classroom circumstances|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=2007|volume=99|issue=3|pages=545–560|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.99.3.545}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the fact that girls in the same-gender groups had greater access to positive role models, in the form of their female classmates who excelled in math, than girls in mixed-gender groups.&lt;ref name=Huguet2007 /&gt; 
Similarly, another experiment showed that making groups achievements salient helped buffer women against stereotype threat. Female participants who read about successful women, even though these successes were not directly related to performance in math, performed better on a subsequent math test than participants who read about successful corporations rather than successful women.&lt;ref name=McIntyre2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McIntyre|first1=R.B.|last2=Paulson|first2=R.M.|last3= Lord|first3= C.G.|title=Alleviating women's mathematics stereotype threat through salience of group achievements|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=39|issue=1|pages=83–90|doi=10.1016/s0022-1031(02)00513-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A study investigating the role of textbook images on science performance found that women demonstrated better comprehension of a passage from a chemistry lesson when the text was accompanied by a counter-stereotypic image (i.e., of a female scientist) than when the text was accompanied by a stereotypic image (i.e., of a male scientist).&lt;ref name=Good2010 /&gt;
Other scholars distinguish between the challenges of both recruitment and retention in increasing women's participation in STEM fields. These researchers suggest that although both female and male role models can be effective in recruiting women to STEM fields, female role models are more effective at promoting the retention of women in these fields.&lt;ref name=Drury2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drury|first1=Benjamin J.|last2=Siy|first2=John Oliver|last3= Cheryan|first3= Sapna|title=When Do Female Role Models Benefit Women? The Importance of Differentiating Recruitment From Retention in STEM|journal=Psychological Inquiry|year=2011|volume=22|issue=4|pages=265–269|doi=10.1080/1047840x.2011.620935}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female teachers can also act as role models for young girls. Reports have shown that the presence of female teachers positively influences girls' perceptions of STEM and increases their interest in STEM careers.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stearns|first=Elizabeth|last2=Bottía|first2=Martha Cecilia|last3=Davalos|first3=Eleonora|last4=Mickelson|first4=Roslyn Arlin|last5=Moller|first5=Stephanie|last6=Valentino|first6=Lauren|date=2016-02-01|title=Demographic Characteristics of High School Math and Science Teachers and Girls' Success in STEM|url=https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article/63/1/87/1845557|journal=Social Problems|language=en|volume=63|issue=1|pages=87–110|doi=10.1093/socpro/spv027|issn=0037-7791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-affirmation====
Researchers have investigated the usefulness of self-affirmation in alleviating stereotype threat. One study found that women who affirmed a personal value prior to experiencing stereotype threat performed as well on a math test as men and as women who did not experience stereotype threat.&lt;ref name=Martens2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martens|first1=A.|last2=Johns|first2=M.|last3= Greenberg|first3= J.|last4=Schimel|first4=J.|title=Combating stereotype threat: The effect of self-affirmation on women's intellectual performance|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=42|issue=2|pages=236–243|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.04.010|hdl=10092/507}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study found that a short writing exercise in which college students, who were enrolled in an introductory physics course, wrote about their most important values substantially decreased the gender performance gap and boosted women's grades.&lt;ref name=Miyake2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miyake|first1=A.|last2=Kost-Smith|first2=L.E.|last3= Finkelstein|first3= N.D.|last4=Pollock|first4=S.J.|last5=Cohen|first5=G.L.|last6=Ito|first6=T.A.|title=Reducing the Gender Achievement Gap in College Science: A Classroom Study of Values Affirmation|journal=Science|year=2010|volume=330|issue=6008|pages=1234–1237|doi=10.1126/science.1195996|pmid=21109670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars believe that the effectiveness of such values-affirmation exercises is their ability to help individuals view themselves as complex individuals, rather than through the lens of a harmful stereotype. Supporting this hypothesis, another study found that women who were encouraged to draw self-concept maps with many nodes did not experience a performance decrease on a math test.&lt;ref name=Gresky2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gresky|first1=D.M.|last2=Eyck|first2=L.L.T.|last3= Lord|first3= C.G.|last4=McIntyre|first4=R.B.|title=Effects of salient multiple identities on women's performance under mathematics stereotype threat|journal=Sex Roles|year=2005|volume=53|issue=9–10|pages=703–716|doi=10.1007/s11199-005-7735-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women who did not draw self-concept maps or only drew maps with a few nodes did perform significantly worse than men on the math test.&lt;ref name=Gresky2005 /&gt; The effect of these maps with many nodes was to remind women of their "multiple roles and identities," that were unrelated to, and would thus not be harmed by, their performance on the math test.&lt;ref name=Gresky2005 /&gt;

=== Organized efforts ===
Organizations such as [[Girls Who Code]], StemBox,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2218287/stembox-girls-in-stem/|title=Introducing StemBox, Birchbox's Super Smart Little Sister|access-date=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blossom, Engineer Girl, [http://womanity.org/programs/afghanistan/ Girls Can Code] in Afghanistan, [http://robotixedu.com/indian-girls-code/ @IndianGirlsCode], and Kode with Klossy (spearheaded by supermodel [[Karlie Kloss]]) aim to encourage women and girls to explore male-dominated STEM fields. Many of these organizations offer summer programs and scholarships to girls interested in STEM fields. The U.S. government has funded similar endeavors; the Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs created TechGirls and TechWomen, exchange programs which teach Middle Eastern and North African girls and women skills valuable in STEM fields and encourage them to pursue STEM careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/03/205866.htm|title=Advancing the Status of Women and Girls Around the World|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the [https://unesco.usmission.gov/teachher/ TeachHer Initiative], spearheaded by UNESCO, Costa Rican First Lady, [[Mercedes Peñas Domingo]], and [[Dr. Jill Biden]] which aims to close the gender gap in STEAM curricula and careers.
