'''''Amafufunyana''''' is an unspecified [[Culture-bound syndrome|"culture-bound" syndrome]] named by the traditional healers of the [[Xhosa people]] that relates to claims of [[demonic possession]] due to members of the Xhosa people exhibiting [[aberrant behavior]] and psychological concerns.&lt;ref name="PP"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Niehaus DJ, Oosthuizen P, Lochner C, Emsley RA, Jordaan E, Mbanga NI, Keyter N, Laurent C, Deleuze JF, Stein DJ |date=March–April 2004 |title=A culture-bound syndrome 'amafufunyana' and a culture-specific event 'ukuthwasa': differentiated by a family history of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders |journal=[[Psychopathology (journal)|Psychopathology]] |publisher=[[Karger Publishers]] |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=59–63 |doi=10.1159/000077579 |pmid=15057028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After study, it was discovered that this term is directed toward people suffering from varying types of [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="PP"/&gt; A similar term, [[ukuthwasa]], is used to refer to positive types of claimed possession, though this event also involves those suffering from schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="CRC"/&gt; It has also found cultural usage among some groups of [[Zulu people]]s.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Fresh Perspectives: Introduction to Psychology |chapter=Psychopathology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-btwxJAR_gC&amp;dq |publisher=[[Pearson South Africa]] |page=368 |date=2007 |isbn=9781868912896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct translation of the term ''amafufunyana'' is [[Anxiety|nerves]] and is a part of a much more complex cultural ideology connecting varying types of [[psychosis]] with religious, social, and recently psychiatric beliefs and activities. In a 1998 interview with Xhosa people suffering from schizophrenia by Lund et al., it was determined that through interaction with scientists and psychological services, the preferred treatment for the cultural condition had shifted from relation to traditional healers to active [[psychiatric assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lund C, Swartz L |date=June 1998 |title=Xhosa-Speaking Schizophrenic Patients' Experience of Their Condition: Psychosis and Amafufunyana |url=http://sap.sagepub.com/content/28/2/62.abstract |journal=[[South African Journal of Psychology]] |publisher=[[Psychological Society of South Africa]] |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=62–70 |doi=10.1177/008124639802800202 |accessdate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claimed symptoms and causes==
People who claim to be suffering from ''amafufunyana'' state that their symptoms include hearing "voices from their stomachs", speaking in another language or in a disturbing tone, and general agitation and possible violence. There is also the possibility of suicide being attempted.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;

One of the cultural beliefs for the cause is bewitchment from drinking a [[magic potion]] brewed from ants that have been feeding upon a buried dead body.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt; General possession by [[malignant]] spirits is also believed. Among the Zulu specifically, there is also the belief that a "horde of spirits" from multiple ethnic groups come together to take over a person's body.&lt;ref name="CRC"&gt;{{cite book |last=Helman |first=Cecil G. |date=January 26, 2007 |title=Culture, Health and Illness, Fifth edition |chapter=Cross-Cultural Psychiatry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uz59BgAAQBAJ&amp;dq |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |page=269 |isbn=9781444113631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common cultural treatment for the claimed ailment is for one of the traditional healers, often ''ukuthwasa'' themselves, to perform a ritual of [[exorcism]].&lt;ref name="CRC"/&gt;

==History==
Recorded incidents of ''amafufunyana'' appear to have begun in the early 20th century and researchers such as Ngubane ''et al'' have suggested that its cultural formation may have had something to do with [[colonialism]] and [[Human migration|migration]] of [[indigenous peoples]] away from their homes. There have also been widespread outbreaks of the condition, similar to events involving contagious spread of [[hysteria]], recorded in the 1980s at a rural girl's [[boarding school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinason |first=Valerie |date=2002 |title=Attachment, Trauma and Multiplicity: Working with Dissociative Identity Disorder |chapter=Dissociation and Spirit Possession |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NJ8XtDSajhAC&amp;dq |publisher=[[Psychology Press]] |pages=233–236 |isbn=9780415195560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common types of people that are identified as afflicted by the cultural group are those of the lowest economic and social level and more often during times of cultural hardship and change, such as during migrations. More women than men are also identified.&lt;ref name="CRC"/&gt;

'''Anarcho-primitivism''' is an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] critique of the origins and progress of [[civilization]]. According to anarcho-primitivism, the [[Neolithic Revolution|shift from hunter-gatherer to agricultural subsistence]] gave rise to [[social stratification]], [[coercion]], [[Social alienation|alienation]], and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. Anarcho-primitivists advocate a return of non-"civilized" ways of life through [[deindustrialization]], abolition of the [[division of labor]] or [[specialization (functional)|specialization]], and abandonment of large-scale organization [[technologies]]. Many traditional anarchists reject the critique of civilization while some, such as Wolfi Landstreicher, endorse the critique but do not consider themselves anarcho-primitivists. Anarcho-primitivists are often distinguished by their focus on the [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] of achieving a [[feral]] state of being through "[[Rewilding (anarchism)|rewilding]]".

== History ==
=== Origins ===
[[File:Walden Thoreau.jpg|thumb|180px|thumb|''[[Walden]]'' by [[Henry David Thoreau]], an influential early [[green-anarchist]] work]]
In the U.S., anarchism started to have an ecological view mainly in the writings of [[Henry David Thoreau]]. In his book ''[[Walden]]'', he advocates [[simple living]] and [[self-sufficiency]] among natural surroundings in resistance to the advancement of industrial civilization.&lt;ref name="Thoreau"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html |title=La Insumisión Voluntaria: El Anarquismo Individualista Español Durante La Dictadura Y La Segunda República (1923–1938) |trans-title= Draft Avoidance: Spanish Individualistic Anarchism During the Dictatorship and the Second Republic (1923–1938) |author= Diez, Xavier Diez |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060526224800/http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html|archivedate=26 May 2006|
quote=Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por John Zerzan. Para George Woodcock(8), esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.|language=es}}
:Translated: "His most representative work is ''Walden'', published in 1854, although redacted between 1845 and 1847 when Thoreau decided to move to an isolated cabin in the woods and live in intimate contact with nature in a solitary and sober life. His philosophy, from this experience, attempts to transmit the idea that a return to respecting nature is necessary, and that happiness is, above all, a fruit of inner richness and harmony between individuals and the natural environment. Many have seen Thoreau as a precursor to ecologism and anarcho-primitism, actualized by John Zerzan. For Woodcock (8), this attitude can also be motivated by the idea of resistance to progress and the rejection of the increasing materialism that characterized North American society in the mid-19th century."&lt;/ref&gt; "Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and anarcho-primitivism represented today by [[John Zerzan]]. For [[George Woodcock]], this attitude can also be motivated by the idea of resistance to progress and the rejection of the increasing materialism that characterized North American society in the mid-19th century."&lt;ref name="Thoreau"/&gt; Zerzan himself included the text "Excursions" (1863) by Thoreau in his edited compilation of anti-civilization writings called ''[[Against Civilization: Readings and Reflections]]'' from 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Zerzan, John|title=[[Against Civilization]]: Readings and Reflections|publisher=Feral House|year=2005|isbn=0-922915-98-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, [[anarchist naturism]] appeared as the union of [[anarchist]] and [[naturist]] philosophies.&lt;ref name="naturismolibertario"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soliobrera.org/pdefs/cuaderno4.pdf |title=El Naturismo Libertario (1890–1939) |trans-title=Libertarian Naturism (1890–1939) |author=Roselló, Josep Maria |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102181805/http://www.soliobrera.org/pdefs/cuaderno4.pdf |archivedate=2 January 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ortega"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interactivist.autonomedia.org/node/4694|title=Anarchism, Nudism, Naturism|author=Ortega, Carlos}}&lt;/ref&gt; It mainly was important within individualist anarchist circles&lt;ref name="Thoreau" /&gt; in Spain,&lt;ref name="Thoreau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="naturismolibertario"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ortega"/&gt; France&lt;ref name="Thoreau"/&gt; and Portugal.&lt;ref name="portugal"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Anarchisme et naturisme au Portugal, dans les années 1920|trans-chapter=Anarchism and naturism in Portugal in the 1920s|title=Les anarchistes du Portugal|trans-title=The Anarchists of Portugal|author=Freire, João |isbn=2-9516163-1-7|language=fr}}''''&lt;/ref&gt; Important influences in it were Henry David Thoreau,&lt;ref name="Thoreau"/&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]]&lt;ref name="naturismolibertario"/&gt; and [[Elisee Reclus]].&lt;ref name="Reclus1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natustar.com/uk/naturism-begin.html |title=The pioneers |work=Natustar |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025125935/http://www.natustar.com/uk/naturism-begin.html |archivedate=25 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-naturism advocated [[vegetarianism]], [[free love]], [[nudism]] and an ecological world view within anarchist groups and outside them.&lt;ref name="naturismolibertario"/&gt;

Anarcho-naturism promoted an ecological worldview, small [[ecovillage]]s, and most prominently nudism as a way to avoid the artificiality of the industrial mass society of modernity.&lt;ref name=naturismolibertario /&gt; Naturist individualist anarchists saw the individual in his biological, physical and psychological aspects and avoided and tried to eliminate social determinations.&lt;ref name="naturismo"&gt;"El individuo es visto en su dimensión biológica -física y psíquica- dejándose la social." (Roselló)&lt;/ref&gt; Their ideas were important in individualist anarchist circles in France but also in Spain where [[Federico Urales]] ([[pseudonym]] of Joan Montseny), promotes the ideas of Gravelle and Zisly in ''[[La Revista Blanca]]'' (1898–1905).&lt;ref name="naturismo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nodo50.org/lagarbancitaecologica/garbancita/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=150:los-origenes-del-naturismo-libertario&amp;catid=61:investigacion-formacion-debate&amp;Itemid=77|title=Los origenes del naturismo libertario|trans-title=The origins of libertarian naturism|author=Morán, Agustín|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tendency was strong enough as to call the attention of the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]&amp;ndash;[[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]] in Spain. [[Daniel Guérin]], in ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'', reports how "Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalism]] had long been concerned to safeguard the autonomy of what it called "[[affinity group]]s". There were many adepts of naturism and vegetarianism among its members, especially among the poor [[peasant]]s of the south. Both these ways of living were considered suitable for the transformation of the human being in preparation for a stateless society. At the Zaragoza congress, the members did not forget to consider the fate of groups of naturists and nudists, "unsuited to industrialization." As these groups would be unable to supply all their own needs, the Congress anticipated that their delegates to the meetings of the Confederation of communes would be able to negotiate special economic agreements with the other agricultural and industrial communes. On the eve of a vast, bloody, social transformation, the CNT did not think it foolish to try to meet the infinitely varied aspirations of individual human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Anarchism__From_Theory_to_Practice.html|title=Anarchism: From theory to practice|author=Guérin, Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Guérin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent themes ===
Anarchists contribute to an [[anti-authoritarian]] push, which challenges all abstract power on a fundamental level, striving for [[egalitarian]] relationships and promoting communities based upon [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]]. Primitivists, however, extend ideas of non-domination to all life, not just human life, going beyond the traditional anarchist's analysis. Using the work of [[anthropologists]], primitivists look at the origins of civilization so as to understand what they are up against and how current society formed in order to inform a change in direction. Inspired by the [[Luddites]], primitivists rekindle an anti-technological orientation. [[Insurrectionary anarchism|Insurrectionalists]] do not believe in waiting for critiques to be fine-tuned, instead spontaneously attacking civilization's current institutions.

Primitivists may owe much to the [[Situationists]] and their critique of the ideas in ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' and alienation from a commodity-based society. [[Deep ecology]] informs the primitivist perspective with an understanding that the well-being of all life is linked to the awareness of the inherent worth and intrinsic value of the non-human world, independent of its economic value. Primitivists see deep ecology's appreciation for the richness and diversity of life as contributing to the realization that present human interference with the non-human world is coercive and excessive.

[[Bioregionalism|Bioregionalists]] bring the perspective of living within one's bioregion, and being intimately connected to the land, water, climate, plants, animals, and general patterns of their bioregion.

Some primitivists have been influenced by the various [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures. Primitivists attempt to learn and incorporate [[sustainable]] techniques for survival and healthier ways of interacting with life. Some are also inspired by the [[Feral (subculture)|feral subculture]], where people abandon domestication and have re-integrate themselves with the wild.

{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="Anarchy is the order of the day among hunter-gatherers. Indeed, critics will ask why a small face-to-face group needs a government anyway. [...] If this is so we can go further and say that since the egalitarian hunting-gathering society is the oldest type of human society and prevailed for the longest period of time – over thousands of decades – then anarchy must be the oldest and one of the most enduring kinds of polity. Ten thousand years ago everyone was an anarchist."|source=[[Harold Barclay]], American anthropologist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=People Without Government: An Anthropology of Anarchy |last=Barclay |first=Harold |publisher=Kahn &amp; Averill |year=1996 |isbn=1-871082-16-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Some anarcho-primitivists state that prior to the advent of [[agriculture]], humans lived in small, [[nomad]]ic [[Band society|bands]] which were socially, politically, and economically [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]]. Being without [[hierarchy]], these bands are sometimes viewed as embodying a form of [[anarchism]].

Primitivists hold that following the emergence of agriculture the growing masses of humanity became evermore beholden to [[technology]] ("technoaddiction") &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Boyden, Stephen Vickers|title=Biohistory: The interplay between human society and the biosphere, past and present|journal=Man and the Biosphere Series|volume=8|location=Pari|publisher=UNESCO|year=1992|issue= supplement 173|doi=10.1021/es00028a604}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abstract power structures arising from the [[division of labor]] and hierarchy. Primitivists disagree over what degree of [[horticulture]] might be present in an anarchist society, with some arguing that [[permaculture]] could have a role but others advocating a strictly [[hunter-gatherer]] subsistence.

Primitivism has drawn heavily upon [[cultural anthropology]] and [[archaeology]]. From the 1960s forward, societies once viewed as "[[barbaric]]" were reevaluated by academics, some of whom now hold that early humans lived in relative peace and prosperity in what has been called the "[[original affluent society]]". [[Frank Hole]], an early-agriculture specialist, and [[Kent Flannery]], a specialist in [[Mesoamerican]] civilization, have noted that, "No group on earth has more leisure time than hunters and gatherers, who spend it primarily on games, conversation and relaxing."&lt;ref name="LWUM265"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gowdy, John M.|title=Limited Wants, Unlimited Means: A Reader on Hunter-Gatherer Economics
|publisher=Island Press|year=1998|page=265|isbn=1-55963-555-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]], in the article "The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Diamond, Jared|title=The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race|journal=Discover Magazine|date=May 1987|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1987/may/02-the-worst-mistake-in-the-history-of-the-human-race}}&lt;/ref&gt; said hunter-gatherers practice the most successful and longest-lasting life style in human history, in contrast with agriculture, which he described as a "mess" and that it is "unclear whether we can solve it". Based on evidence that life expectancy has decreased with the adoption of agriculture, the anthropologist [[Mark Nathan Cohen]] has called for the need to revise the traditional idea that civilization represents progress in human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Health and the Rise of Civilization |last=Nathan Cohen |first=Mark |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-300-05023-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as [[Karl Polanyi]] and [[Marshall Sahlins]] characterized primitive societies as [[gift economy|gift economies]] with "goods valued for their utility or beauty rather than cost; commodities exchanged more on the basis of need than of [[exchange value]]; distribution to the society at large without regard to labor that members have invested; labor performed without the idea of a wage in return or individual benefit, indeed largely without the notion of 'work' at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zerzan, John|title=Future Primitive and Other Essays|publisher=Autonomedia|year=1994|isbn=1-57027-000-7|url=http://www.awok.org/future_primitive/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080945/http://www.awok.org/future_primitive/|archivedate=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civilization and violence ===
Anarcho-primitivists view civilization as the [[logic]], [[institution]], and physical apparatus of [[domestication]], control, and domination. They focus primarily on the question of origins. Civilization is seen as the underlying problem or root of oppression, and must therefore be dismantled or destroyed.

Anarcho-primitivists describe the rise of civilization as the shift over the past 10,000 years from an existence deeply connected to the web of life, to one psychologically separated from and attempting to control the rest of life. They state that prior to civilization, there generally existed ample leisure time, considerable [[gender equality]] and [[social equality]], a non-destructive and uncontrolling approach to the natural world, the absence of organized [[violence]], no mediating or formal institutions, and strong health and robustness. Anarcho-primitivists state that civilization inaugurated mass warfare, the subjugation of women, population growth, busy work, concepts of property, entrenched hierarchies, as well as encouraging the spread of diseases. They claim that civilization begins with and relies on an enforced renunciation of instinctual freedom and that it is impossible to [[reform movement|reform]] away such a renunciation. Based on several anthropological references, they further state that hunter-gatherer societies are less susceptible to war, violence, and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivism.com/sedentism.htm|title=The Consequences of Domestication and Sedentism|author1=Schultz, Emily|author2=Lavenda, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Service |last=Elman |authorlink=Elman Service |title=The Hunters |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1972 |asin=B000JNRGPK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kelly, Robert L. |title=The Foraging Spectrum: Diversity in Hunter-Gatherer Lifeways |location=Washington |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |year=1995 |isbn=1-56098-465-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some—such as Lawrence Keely—contest this, citing that many tribe-based people are more prone to violence than developed states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[War Before Civilization]]: the Myth of the Peaceful Savage|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|author=Keely, Lawrence|isbn=9780199880706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestication ===
Anarcho-primitivists, such as John Zerzan, define [[domestication]] as "the will to dominate animals and plants", claiming that domestication is "civilization's defining basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zerzan, John|title=Twilight of the Machines|publisher=Feral House|year=2008|isbn=978-1-932595-31-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xi-ePQopZAgC&amp;pg=PA55|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also describe it as the process by which previously [[nomadic]] human populations shifted towards a sedentary or settled existence through [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]]. They claim that this kind of domestication demands a totalitarian relationship with both the land and the plants and animals being domesticated. They say that whereas, in a state of wildness, all life shares and competes for resources, domestication destroys this balance. Domesticated landscape (e.g. pastoral lands/agricultural fields and, to a lesser degree, [[horticulture]] and [[gardening]]) ends the open sharing of resources; where "this was everyone's," it is now "mine." Anarcho-primitivists state that this notion of ownership laid the foundation for social [[hierarchy]] as property and power emerged. It also involved the destruction, enslavement, or assimilation of other groups of early people who did not make such a transition.

To primitivists, domestication enslaves both the domesticated species as well as the domesticators. Advances in the fields of psychology, anthropology, and sociology allows humans to quantify and objectify themselves, until they too become commodities.

For most primitivist anarchists, re-wilding and reconnecting with the earth is a life project. They state that it should not be limited to intellectual comprehension or the practice of primitive skills, but, instead, that it is a deep understanding of the pervasive ways in which we are [[domesticated]], fractured, and dislocated from ourselves, each other, and the world. Re wilding is understood as having a physical component which involves reclaiming skills and developing methods for a sustainable co-existence, including how to feed, shelter, and heal ourselves with the plants, animals, and materials occurring naturally in our [[bioregion]]s. It is also said to include the dismantling of the physical manifestations, apparatus, and infrastructure of civilization.

Re-wilding is also described as having an [[emotion]]al component, which involves healing ourselves and each other from what are perceived as 10,000-year-old wounds, learning how to live together in non-hierarchical and non-oppressive communities, and de-constructing the domesticating mindset in our social patterns. To the primitivist, "rewilding includes prioritizing direct experience and passion over mediation and [[Social alienation|alienation]], re-thinking every dynamic and aspect of reality, connecting with our feral fury to defend our lives and to fight for a liberated existence, developing more trust in our intuition and being more connected to our [[instincts]], and regaining the balance that has been virtually destroyed after thousands of years of patriarchal control and domestication. Rewilding is the process of becoming uncivilized."

=== Consumerism and mass society ===
Brian Sheppard asserts that anarcho-primitivism is not a form of anarchism at all. In ''Anarchism vs. Primitivism'' he says: "In recent decades, groups of quasi-religious mystics have begun equating the primitivism they advocate (rejection of science, rationality, and technology often lumped together under a blanket term "technology") with anarchism. In reality, the two have nothing to do with each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/anarchism-vs-primitivism|author=Sheppard, Brian|title=Anarchism vs. Primitivism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Flood agrees with this assertion and points out that primitivism clashes with what he identifies as the fundamental goal of anarchism: "the creation of a free mass society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Flood, Andrew|title=Is primitivism realistic? An anarchist reply to John Zerzan and others|work=Anarchist Newswire|year=2005|url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primitivists do not believe that a "[[mass society]]" can be free. They believe industry and agriculture inevitably lead to hierarchy and alienation. They argue that the [[division of labor]] that techno-industrial societies require to function force people into reliance on factories and the labor of other specialists to produce their food, clothing, shelter, and other necessities and that this dependence forces them to remain a part of this society, whether they like it or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivism.com/mass-society.htm|title=Against Mass Society|author=Wilson, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some do not think of industrialization as a coercive force, and merely advocate a primitivist lifestyle for environmental reasons.

=== Critique of mechanical time and symbolic culture ===
Some anarcho-primitivists view the shift towards an increasingly [[symbolic culture]] as highly problematic in the sense that it separates us from direct interaction. Often the response to this, by those who assume that it means that primitivists prefer to completely eliminate all forms of symbolic culture, is something to the effect of, "So, you just want to grunt?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenanarchy.org/index.php?action=viewwritingdetail&amp;writingId=283|title=An Introduction to Anti-Civilization Anarchist Thought|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212125446/http://shiftshapers.gnn.tv/blogs/10387/An_Introduction_to_Anti_Civilization_Anarchist_Thought_and_Practice2008-12-12|archivedate=12 December 2008|author=The Green Anarchy Collective}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, typically the critique regards the problems inherent within a form of communication and comprehension that relies primarily on symbolic thought at the expense (and even exclusion) of other sensual and unmediated means of comprehension. The emphasis on the symbolic is a departure from direct experience into mediated experience in the form of language, art, number, time, etc.

Anarcho-primitivists state that symbolic culture filters our entire perception through formal and informal [[symbols]] and separates us from direct and unmediated contact with reality. It goes beyond just giving things names, and extends to having an indirect relationship with a distorted image of the world that has passed through the lens of representation. It is debatable whether humans are "hard-wired" for symbolic thought, or if it developed as a cultural change or adaptation, but, according to anarcho-primitivists, the symbolic mode of expression and understanding is limited and deceptive, and over-dependence upon it leads to objectification, alienation, and perceptual [[tunnel vision]]. Many anarcho-primitivists promote and practice getting back in touch with and rekindling dormant and/or underutilized methods of interaction and cognition, such as touch and smell, as well as experimenting with and developing unique and personal modes of comprehension and expression.

Because there are some primitivists who have extended their critique of symbolic culture to language itself, [[Georgetown University]] professor [[Mark Lance]] describes this particular theory of primitivism as "literally insane, for proper communication is necessary to create within the box a means to destroy the box."&lt;ref&gt;Lance, Mark from lecture ''Anarchist Practice, Rational Democracy, and Community'' NCOR (2004).

== {{visible anchor|Criticism}} and counter-criticism ==
Notable critics of anarcho-primitivism include [[Post-left anarchism|post-left anarchists]] Wolfi Landstreicher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/wolfi-landstreicher-a-critique-not-a-program-for-a-non-primitivist-anti-civilization-critique|title=A Critique, Not a Program: For a Non-Primitivist Anti-Civilization Critique|author=Landstreicher, Wolfi|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jason McQuinn]],&lt;ref name=mcquinn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/various-authors-a-dialog-on-primitivism#toc3|title=Why I am not a Primitivist|author=McQuinn, Jason|authorlink=Jason McQuinn}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ted Kaczynski]] (the "Unabomber"),&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ted-kaczynski-the-truth-about-primitive-life-a-critique-of-anarchoprimitivism|title=The Truth About Primitive Life: A Critique of Anarchoprimitivism|author=Kaczynski, Ted|authorlink=Ted Kaczynski|quote="It seems obvious, for example, that the politically correct portrayal of hunter-gatherers is motivated in part by an impulse to construct an image of a pure and innocent world existing at the dawn of time, analogous to the [[Garden of Eden]]," and calls the evidence of the violence of hunter-gatherers "incontrovertible."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, especially, [[libertarian socialist]] [[Murray Bookchin]], as seen in his polemical work entitled ''[[Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism]]''.

=== Wording and semantics ===
Activist writer [[Derrick Jensen]]'s wrote in ''Walking on Water'' that he is often classified as a "[[Luddite#In modern thought|Luddite]]" and "an anarcho-primitivist. Both of these labels fit well enough, I suppose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Walking on Water |author=Jensen, Derrick |page =223 |year=2005|isbn=9781931498784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, too, have designated his work with the latter term;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Integral Ecology: Uniting Multiple Perspectives on the Natural World |author1=Esbjörn-Hargens, Sean |author2=Zimmerman, Michael E.  |year=2009 |page=492|isbn=9781590304662|publisher=Shambhala Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Making a Killing: The Political Economy of Animal Rights |author=Torres, Bob |page=68 |year=2007|isbn=9781904859673}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, more recently, Jensen began to categorically reject the "primitivist" label, describing it as a "racist way to describe indigenous peoples." He prefers to be called "[[indigenism|indigenist]]" or an "ally to the indigenous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zoeblunt.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/uncivilized/ |title=Uncivilized |first=Zoe |last=Blunt |work=[[Canadian Dimension]] |year=2011 |accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hypocrisy ===
A common criticism is of [[hypocrisy]], i.e. that people rejecting civilization typically maintain a civilized lifestyle themselves, often while still using the very industrial technology that they oppose in order to spread their message. Jensen counters that this criticism merely resorts to an ''[[ad hominem]]'' argument, attacking individuals but not the actual validity of their beliefs.&lt;ref name="endgame"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jensen|first=Derrick|authorlink= Derrick Jensen |series=[[Endgame (Derrick Jensen books)|Endgame]]|volume=1|title=The Problem of Civilization |year=2006 |publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]] |location=New York City |page=128|isbn=978-1-58322-730-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further responds that working to entirely avoid such hypocrisy is ineffective, self-serving, and a convenient misdirection of activist energies.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, 2006, pp. 173–174: "[Although it's] vital to make lifestyle choices to mitigate damage caused by being a member of industrial civilization... to assign primary responsibility to oneself, and to focus primarily on making oneself better, is an immense copout, an abrogation of responsibility. With all the world at stake, it is self-indulgent, self-righteous, and self-important. It is also nearly ubiquitous. And it serves the interests of those in power by keeping our focus off them."&lt;/ref&gt; Primitivist John Zerzan admits that living with this hypocrisy is a [[necessary evil]] for continuing to contribute to the larger intellectual conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,475181,00.html|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Anarchy in the USA | location=London|date=20 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glorification of indigenous societies ===
Wolfi Landstreicher and [[Jason McQuinn]], post-leftists, have both criticized the romanticized exaggerations of indigenous societies and the [[pseudoscientific]] (and even mystical) [[appeal to nature]] they perceive in anarcho-primitivist ideology and [[deep ecology]].&lt;ref name="mcquinn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Wolfi_Landstreicher__The_Network_of_Domination.html#toc11|title=The Network of Domination}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zerzan has countered that the anarcho-primitivist view is not idealizing the indigenous, but rather "has been the mainstream view presented in anthropology and archeology textbooks for the past few decades. It sounds utopian, but it's now the generally accepted paradigm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PMldzueBcUcC&amp;q="unknown+to+most"|editor=Harmon, James L.|title=Take My Advice: Letters to the Next Generation from People Who Know a Thing or Two}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ted Kaczynski]] has also argued that certain anarcho-primitivists have exaggerated the short working week of primitive society. Arguing that they only examine the process of food extraction and not the processing of food, creation of fire and childcare, which adds up to over 40 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Truth About Primitive Life: A Critique of Primitivism|last=Kaczynski|first=Theodore|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Criticism from social anarchists ===
Besides Murray Bookchin, many [[class struggle]] oriented and [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]] criticize primitivism as offering "no way forwards in the struggle for a free society" and that "often its adherents end up undermining that struggle by attacking the very things, like mass organization, that are a requirement to win it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libcom.org/library/civilisation-primitivism-anarchism-andrew-flood|title=Civilisation, primitivism and anarchism - Andrew Flood|website=libcom.org|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other social anarchists have also argued that abandoning technology will have dangerous consequences, pointing out that around 50% of the population of the United Kingdom requires glasses and would be left severely impaired. Radioactive waste would need to be monitored for tens of thousands of years with high-tech equipment to prevent it leaking into ecosystems, that the millions of people who need regular treatment for illnesses would die and that the removal of books, recorded music, medical equipment, central heating and sanitation would result in a rapid dropping of the quality of life. Furthermore, social anarchists contend that without advanced agriculture the Earth's surface would not be able to support billions of people, meaning that building a primitivist society would require the death of billions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libcom.org/thought/anarcho-primitivism-anti-civilisation-criticism|title=Primitivism, anarcho-primitivism and anti-civilisationism - critique|date=12 October 2006|website=libcom.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16056">'''Area studies''' (also '''regional studies''') are [[interdisciplinary]] fields of research and scholarship pertaining to particular [[geography|geographical]], [[nation]]al/[[Federal government|federal]], or [[culture|cultural]] regions.  The term exists primarily as a general description for what are, in the practice of scholarship, many heterogeneous fields of research, encompassing both the [[social sciences]] and the [[humanities]]. Typical area study programs involve [[history]], [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[cultural studies]], [[languages]], [[geography]], [[literature]], and related disciplines. In contrast to cultural studies, area studies often include [[diaspora]] and [[emigration]] from the area.

==History==
[[Interdisciplinary]] area studies became increasingly common in the [[United States of America]] and in Western scholarship after World War II. Before that war American universities had just a few faculty who taught or conducted research on the non-Western world. Foreign-area studies were virtually nonexistent. After the war, liberals and conservatives alike were concerned about the U.S. ability to respond effectively to perceived external threats from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] in the context of the emerging [[Cold War]], as well as to the fall-out from the [[Decolonisation of Africa|Decolonization of Africa]] and [[decolonisation of Asia|Asia]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

{{Double image|right|Diploma_de_Especialista_Universitario_de_la_Universidad_Complutense_de_Madrid.jpg|200px|Diploma-licenciatura-estudos-europeus-universidade.jpg|200px|[[Latin American studies]] and [[European studies]] are examples of Area studies, offered both in [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] degrees, the images show examples from [[Complutense University of Madrid]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucm.es/amelat/interes&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Universidade Aberta|Aberta University]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www2.uab.pt/guiainformativo/eng_detailcursos.php?curso=14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this context, the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] convened a series of meetings producing a broad consensus that to address this knowledge deficit, the U.S. must invest in international studies. Therefore, the foundations of the field are strongly rooted in America.{{cn|date=August 2017}}  Participants argued that a large brain trust of internationally oriented [[political scientist]]s and [[economist]]s was an urgent national priority. There was a central tension, however, between those who felt strongly that, instead of applying Western models, social scientists should develop culturally and historically contextualized knowledge of various parts of the world by working closely with humanists, and those who thought social scientists should seek to develop overarching [[macrohistory | macrohistorial]] theories that could draw connections between patterns of change and development across different geographies. The former became area-studies advocates, the latter proponents of [[modernization theory]].

The [[Ford Foundation]] would eventually become the dominant player in shaping the area-studies program in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Condliffe Lagemann, ''The Politics of Knowledge: The Carnegie Corporation, Philanthropy, and Public Policy'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 the foundation established the prestigious Foreign Area Fellowship Program (FAFP), the first large-scale national competition in support of area-studies training in the United States. From 1953 to 1966 it contributed $270 million to 34 universities for area and language studies. Also during this period, it poured millions of dollars into the committees run jointly by the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] for field-development workshops, conferences, and publication programs.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Szanton, "The Origin, Nature and Challenges of Area Studies in the United States," in ''The Politics of Knowledge: Area Studies and the Disciplines'', ed. David L. Szanton (University of California Press, 2004), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the SSRC-ACLS joint committees would take over the administration of FAFP.

Other large and important programs followed Ford's. Most notably, the [[National Defense Education Act]] of 1957, renamed the Higher Education Act in 1965, allocated funding for some 125 university-based area-studies units known as [[National Resource Center]] programs at U.S. universities, as well as for [[Foreign Language and Area Studies]] fellowships for graduate students.

Meanwhile, area studies were also developed in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy within the field==
Since their inception, area studies have been subject to criticism—including by area specialists themselves. Many of them alleged that because area studies were connected to the Cold War agendas of the [[CIA]], the [[FBI]], and other intelligence and military agencies, participating in such programs was tantamount to serving as an agent of the state.&lt;ref&gt;See Bruce Cumings, "Boundary Displacement: Area Studies and International Studies during and after the Cold War," in ''Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars'' 29 (1997). http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/cumings2.htm. Retrieved 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that there is the notion that U.S concerns and research priorities will define the intellectual terrain of area studies.&lt;ref&gt;See Patrick O'Meara, "Changing perspectives on international education", (Indiana University Press 2010), pp. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Others insisted, however, that once they were established on university campuses, area studies began to encompass a much broader and deeper intellectual agenda than the one foreseen by government agencies, thus not American centric.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, W.G. 2009. “Area Studies in a Global Context.” Chronicle of Higher Education. Nov 29. http://chronicle.com/article/Area-Studies-in-a-Global-Co/49284/&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, one of the greatest threats to the area studies project was the rise of [[rational choice theory]] in political science and economics.&lt;ref&gt;See "Rational Choice Theory," by John Scott, in ''Understanding Contemporary Society: Theories of The Present'', edited by G. Browning, A. Halcli, and F. Webster (Sage Publications, 2000). {{cite web|url=http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~scottj/socscot7.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227085005/http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~scottj/socscot7.htm |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }}. Retrieved 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; To mock one of the most outspoken rational choice theory critics, Japan scholar [[Chalmers Johnson]] asked: Why do you need to know Japanese or anything about Japan's history and culture if the methods of rational choice will explain why Japanese politicians and bureaucrats do the things they do?&lt;ref&gt;See Chalmers Johnson and E. B. Keehn, "A Disaster in the Making: Rational Choice and Asian Studies," ''The National Interest'' 36 (summer 1994), pp. 14–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the demise of the [[Soviet Union]], philanthropic foundations and scientific bureaucracies moved to attenuate their support for area studies, emphasizing instead interregional themes like "development and democracy". When the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], which had long served as the national [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for raising and administering funds for area studies, underwent their first major restructuring in thirty years, closing down their area committees, scholars interpreted this as a massive signal about the changing research environment.&lt;ref&gt;See Cumings article, cited above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to an increasing interest in studying translocal, transregional, transnational and transcontinental phenomena, a Potsdam-based research network has recently coined the term "TransArea Studies" [http://www.uni-potsdam.de/tapoints/ (POINTS – Potsdam International Network for TransArea Studies)].

Other interdisciplinary research fields such as [[women's studies]] (also known as [[gender studies]]), [[disability studies]], and [[ethnic studies]] (including [[African American studies]], [[Asian American studies]], [[Latino/a studies]], and [[Native American studies]]) are not part of '''area studies''' but are sometimes included in discussion along with it.

==Institutions==

Some entire institutions of higher education (tertiary education) are devoted solely to area studies such as [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], part of the [[University of London]], or the [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]] in Japan. At the [[University of Oxford]], the School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies (SIAS)[http://www.area-studies.ox.ac.uk/][http://www.area-studies.ox.ac.uk/ School of Interdiscplinary Area Studies, Oxford] and [[St Antony's College]] specialise in area studies, and hosts a number of post-graduate teaching programmes and research centres covering various regions of the world.
[[Jawaharlal Nehru University]], New Delhi, is the only institution with immense contribution towards popularising area studies in India.
An institution which exclusively deals with Area Studies is the [[German Institute of Global and Area Studies|GIGA]] (German Institute of Global Area Studies) in Germany.  Additionally, [[Lund University]] in Sweden offers the largest [http://www.ace.lu.se/ Asian Studies] masters program in Northern Europe and is dedicated to promoting studies related to South Asia through its [http://www.sasnet.lu.se/ SASNet].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ace.lu.se/masters-programme/study-asia-in-lund|title=Study Asia in Lund!|author=|date=27 June 2017|website=lu.se|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Despite comparisons to [[panic attack]], investigators have identified ataque de nervios as a separate syndrome with measured differences in anxiety sensitivity and types of attacks.&lt;ref name=Razzouk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Keough M.

==Symptoms==
Reported aspects of the syndrome include uncontrollable screaming or shouting, crying, trembling, sensations of heat rising in the chest and head, [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociative]] experiences, and verbal or physical aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis-Fernandez, R., Guarnaccia, P.

One of several reasons why cherophobia may develop is the belief that when one becomes [[Happiness|happy]], a negative event will soon occur that will taint that happiness, as if punishing that individual for satisfaction. This belief is thought to be more prevalent in [[eastern_world|Eastern]] cultures. In [[Western cultures]], such as [[American culture]], "it is almost taken for granted that happiness is one of the most important values guiding people's [[personal life | lives]]".  Western cultures are more driven by an urge to maximize happiness and to minimize sadness. Failing to appear happy often gives cause for concern. The value placed on happiness echoes through Western [[positive psychology]] and through research on subjective well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.springer.com/about+springer/media/springer+select?SGWID=0-11001-6-1457741-0 |title= What's so bad about feeling happy? |date= 17 March 2014 |author= Joan Robinson |publisher= Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fear of happiness is associated with fragility of happiness beliefs, suggesting that one of the causes of aversion to happiness may be the belief that happiness is unstable and fragile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-014-9553-0|title= Fragility of Happiness Beliefs Across 15 National Groups|first1= Mohsen|last1= Joshanloo|first2= Dan|last2= Weijers|first3= Ding-Yu|last3= Jiang|first4= Gyuseog|last4= Han|first5= Jaechang|last5= Bae|first6= Joyce S.|last6= Pang|first7= Lok Sang|last7= Ho|first8= Maria Cristina|last8= Ferreira|first9= Melikşah|last9= Demir|first10= Muhammad|last10= Rizwan|first11= Imran Ahmed|last11= Khilji|first12= Mustapha|last12= Achoui|first13= Ryosuke|last13= Asano|first14= Tasuku|last14= Igarashi|first15= Saori|last15= Tsukamoto|first16= Sanne M.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural factors==
There are four major reasons why cherophobes avoid happiness: "believing that being happy will provoke bad things to happen; that happiness will make you a worse person; that expressing happiness is bad for you and others; and that pursuing happiness is bad for you and others".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=It's time for Western psychology to recognise that many individuals, and even entire cultures, fear happiness |url=http://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/its-time-for-western-psychology-to.html |publisher=[[The British Psychological Society]] |date=21 July 2014 |accessdate=October 4, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "some people—in Western and Eastern cultures—are wary of happiness because they believe that bad things, such as unhappiness, suffering, and death, tend to happen to happy people."&lt;ref name="livescience44233"&gt;{{citation |title=Why Happiness Scares Us |author=Stephanie Pappas |url=http://www.livescience.com/44233-fear-of-happiness.html |publisher=[[LiveScience]] |date=20 March 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings "call into question the notion that happiness is the ultimate goal, a belief echoed in any number of articles and [[self-help]] publications about whether certain choices are likely to make you happy".&lt;ref name="livescience44233"/&gt; Also, "in cultures that believe worldly happiness to be associated with sin, shallowness, and moral decline will actually feel less satisfied when their lives are (by other standards) going well",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=13 of Psychology’s Newest and Coolest Ideas |author=Susan Krauss Whitbourne |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201304/13-psychology-s-newest-and-coolest-ideas |publisher=[[Psychology Today]] |date=6 April 2013 |accessdate=4 October 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so measures of personal happiness cannot simply be considered a yardstick for satisfaction with one's life, and attitudes such as aversion to happiness have important implications for measuring happiness across cultures and ranking nations on [[Happiness economics|happiness scores]].

{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}} 
The '''black and red ware culture''' (BRW) is a late [[Bronze Age India]]n and early [[Iron Age India]]n [[archaeological culture]] of the northern and central [[Indian subcontinent]], associated with the [[Vedic civilization]].

In the Western [[Ganges]] plain (western [[Uttar Pradesh]]) it is dated to c. 1450-1200 BCE, and is succeeded by the [[Painted Grey Ware culture]]; whereas in the Central and Eastern Ganges plain (eastern Uttar Pradesh, [[Bihar]], and [[Bengal]]) and Central India ([[Madhya Pradesh]]) the BRW appears during the same period but continues for longer, until c. 700-500 BCE, when it is succeeded by the [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Southworth, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hTwuFUW5aEgC ''Linguistic Archaeology of South Asia''] (Routledge, 2005), p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western Ganges plain, the BRW was preceded by the [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture]]. The BRW sites were characterized by [[subsistence agriculture]] (cultivation of rice, barley, and legumes), and yielded some ornaments made of shell, copper, [[carnelian]], and [[terracotta]].&lt;ref&gt;Upinder Singh (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA220 ''A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India From the Stone Age to the 12th Century''], p.220&lt;/ref&gt;

In some sites, particularly in [[Punjab, India|eastern Punjab]] and [[Gujarat]], BRW pottery is associated with Late [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Harappan]] pottery, and according to some scholars like Tribhuan N. Roy, the BRW may have directly influenced the [[Painted Grey Ware]] and [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Jim. 1993, Reurbanization: The eastern Punjab and beyond. In Urban Form and Meaning in South Asia: The Shaping of Cities from Prehistoric to Precolonial Times, ed. [[Howard Spodek|H. Spodek]] and D.M. Srinivasan. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; BRW pottery is unknown west of the Indus Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Jim. Mathura: A protohistoric Perspective in D.M. Srinivasan (ed.), Mathura, the Cultural Heritage, 1989, pp. 171-180. Delhi. cited in Chakrabarti 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  

Use of iron, although sparse at first, is relatively early, postdating the beginning of the Iron Age in [[Anatolia]] ([[Hittites]]) by only two or three centuries, and predating the [[Europe]]an ([[Celt]]s) Iron Age by another two to three hundred years. Recent findings in Northern India show Iron working in the 1800-1000 BCE period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tewari |first1=Rakesh |title=The origins of iron working in India: new evidence from the Central Ganga Plain and the Eastern Vindhyas |journal=Antiquity |date=2003 |volume=77 |issue=297 |pages=536–544 |doi=10.1017/S0003598X00092590}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shaffer, the "nature and context of the iron objects involved [of the BRW culture] are very different from early iron objects found in Southwest Asia."&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer 1989, cited in Chakrabarti 1992:171&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blood compact''' ([[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]]: ''Pacto de sangre'', [[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Sanduguan'') was an ancient ritual in the [[Philippines]] intended to seal a friendship or treaty, or to validate an agreement. The contracting parties would cut their wrists and pour their blood into a cup filled with liquid, such as wine, and [[Blood as food|drink]] the mixture.

A famous example of the blood compact was the 1565 ''[[Sandugo]]'' between [[Spaniards|Spanish]] explorer [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] and [[Datu Sikatuna]], the chieftain of [[Bohol]]. Another blood compact was contracted between [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and [[Rajah Humabon]] of [[Cebu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philippinecountry.com/philippine_festivals/sandugo_festival.html Sandugo Festival Bohol Philippines] www.philippinecountry.com Retrieved December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar ritual was practiced by initiates into the 19th century revolutionary group, the [[Katipunan]]. Though they did not consume their blood, they used it to sign their membership contracts.

[[File:Moby-Dick FE title page.jpg|thumb|''[[Moby-Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]], an example of a "classic book"]]

A ''classic'' is a [[book]] accepted as being exemplary or noteworthy, for example through an [[imprimatur]] such as being listed in a list of [[great books]], or through a reader's personal opinion. Although the term is often associated with the [[Western canon]], it can be applied to works of literature from all traditions, such as the [[Chinese classics]] or the Indian [[Veda]]s.

What makes a book "classic" is a concern that has occurred to various authors ranging from [[Italo Calvino]] to [[Mark Twain]] and the related questions of "Why Read the Classics?" and "What Is a Classic?" have been essayed by authors from different genres and eras (including Calvino, [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]]).  The ability of a classic book to be reinterpreted, to seemingly be renewed in the interests of generations of readers succeeding its creation, is a theme that is seen in the writings of literary critics including [[Michael Dirda]], [[Ezra Pound]], and Sainte-Beuve.

The terms "classic book" and "[[Western canon]]" are closely related concepts, but they are not necessarily synonymous. A "canon" refers to a list of books considered to be "essential" and is presented in a variety of ways. It can be published as a collection (such as [[Great Books of the Western World]], [[Modern Library]], or [[Penguin Classics]]), presented as a list with an academic’s imprimatur (such as [[Harold Bloom]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bloom, Harold|title= The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|location= New York|publisher= Harcourt Brace &amp; Company|date= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or be the official reading list of an institution of higher learning (such as "The Reading List" at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]]&lt;ref name="Stjohnscollege.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/academic/readlist.shtml |title=St. John’s College &amp;#124; Academic Program &amp;#124; The Reading List |publisher=Stjohnscollege.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527090156/http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/academic/readlist.shtml |archivedate=May 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref name="rci.rutgers.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rci.rutgers.edu/~wcd/complist.pdf|title=Reading List:Rutgers University Senior Comprehensive Examination|website=Rutgers University|access-date=2010-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621063002/http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~wcd/complist.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern definitions ==
In the 1980s, [[Italo Calvino]] said in his essay "Why Read the Classics?" that "a classic is a book that has never finished saying what it has to say" and comes to the crux of personal choice in this matter when he says (italics in the original translation): "''Your'' classic author is the one you cannot feel indifferent to, who helps you define yourself in relation to him, even in dispute with him."&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The essay "Why Read the Classics?" is available in two different anthologies.  It was first published in 1980/82 in the Italian as a chapter in "The Uses of Literature" (in 1986 in the English translation) and then re-published in the posthumous collection titled "Why Read the Classics?"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt; Consideration of what makes a literary work a classic is for Calvino ultimately a personal choice, and, constructing a universal definition of what constitutes a Classic Book seems to him to be an impossibility, since, as Calvino says "There is nothing for it but for all of us to invent our own ideal libraries of classics."&lt;ref&gt;Calvino, ''The Uses of Literature: Essays'', Page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

What actually makes a work of literature a "classic book" is not just a consideration of extensively published authors. In 1920, Fannie M. Clark, a teacher at the Rozelle School in East Cleveland, Ohio, predates Calvino's similar conclusions by 60 years when she also essayed the question of what makes a book a "classic" in her article "Teaching Children to Choose" in ''The [[English Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=clark136&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_sRAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA135 |title=Teaching children to choose|author=Fannie Clark|year=1920|journal=The English Journal|volume=9|issue=3|pages=135&amp;ndash;138|doi=10.2307/802644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of her essay, Clark considers the question of what makes a piece of literature a classic and why the idea of "the classics" is important to society as a whole. Clark says that "teachers of English have been so long trained in the 'classics' that these 'classics' have become to them very much like the Bible, for the safety of which the rise of modern science causes such unnecessary fears."&lt;ref name=clark136/&gt; She goes on to say that among the sources she consulted was a group of eighth-graders when she asked them the question: "What do you understand by the classics in literature?" Two of the answers Clark received were "Classics are books your fathers give you and you keep them to give to your children" and "Classics are those great pieces of literature considered worthy to be studied in English classes of high school or college". Calvino agrees with the Ohio educator when he states "Schools and universities ought to help us understand that no book that talks about a book says more than the book in question, but instead they do their level best to make us think the opposite."  Clark and Calvino come to a similar conclusion that when a literary work is analyzed for what makes it 'classic', that in just the act of analysis or as Clark says "the anatomical dissection",&lt;ref name=clark136/&gt; the reader can end up destroying the unique pleasure that mere enjoyment a work of literature can hold.

While blogging on the website [[guardian.co.uk]] in 2009, Chris Cox echoes Twain's "classic" sentiments of 1900 and Bennett's witticism about classic books when he opined on the Guardian.Co "Books Blog" that there are actually two kinds of "classic novels":
The first are those we know we should have read, but probably have not. These are generally the books that make us burn with shame when they come up in conversation... The second kind, meanwhile, are those books that we've read five times, can quote from on any occasion, and annoyingly push on to other people with the words: "You have to read this. It's a classic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox |first=Chris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/dec/08/classic-novel-new-york-review |title=The other kind of classic novel|work=Guardian |date= 2009-12-08|accessdate=2010-06-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sainte-Beuve.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]]
In 1850, [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]] (1804–1869)&lt;ref&gt;Harper, George McLean. ''Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve''. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott Company, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; stated his answer to the question "What is a Classic?" ("Qu'est-ce qu'un classique?"):&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a classic implies something that has continuance and consistence, and which produces unity and tradition, fashions and transmits itself, and endures…. A true classic, as I should like to hear it defined, is an author who has enriched the human mind, increased its treasure, and caused it to advance a step; who has discovered some moral and not equivocal truth, or revealed some eternal passion in that heart where all seemed known and discovered; who has expressed his thought, observation, or invention, in no matter what form, only provided it be broad and great, refined and sensible, sane and beautiful in itself; who has spoken to all in his own peculiar style, a style which is found to be also that of the whole world, a style new without neologism, new and old, easily contemporary with all time.

In this same essay, Sainte-Beuve quoted Goethe (referring to the 'classics' concept): "Ancient works are classical not because they are old, but because they are powerful, fresh, and healthy."&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Sainte-Beuve's "What is a Classic" essay was originally published in ''[[Le Constitutionnel]]'' on October 21, 1850 as ''Qu'est-ce qu'un classique?—Lundis''("Monday"), Volume  III, 40. (Moeller-Sally, Stephen. "Gogol's afterlife: the evolution of a classic in Imperial and Soviet Russia". Page 168, Evanston, Illinois. Northwestern University Press, 2002.)  However it originated, an error regarding the date of Saint-Beauve's "What Is a Classic?" has crept into some sources.  According to historical calendars, &lt;http://arc.id.au/Calendar.html&gt;, Monday October 21 had to be the year 1850, '''not''' 1860. The year is erroneously stated as 1860 in A. Pichon's edition of Saint Beuve's work in "Causeries Du Lundi Et Portraits Littraires" (republished in 2009 in its entirety by [[BiblioBazaar|BiblioBazaar/BiblioLife, LLC]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/32/1002.html |title=Introductory Note. Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve. 1909–1914. Literary and Philosophical Essays. The Harvard Classics |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of 'the classic' was a theme of  [[T.S. Eliot]]'s literary criticism as well.  In [[The Sacred Wood (T.S. Eliot)|The Sacred Wood]] he thought that one of the reasons "Dante is a classic, and Blake only a poet of genius was "because of "the concentration resulting from a framework of mythology and theology and philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, T.S. ''The Sacred Wood''. Mineola, NY. Dover Publications, 1920, Page 92&lt;/ref&gt;  (In commenting about Eliot's influence, Professor Jan Gorak stated that "the idea of a canon has become intertwined with the idea of the classic, an idea that T.S. Eliot tried to revitalize for the 'modern experiment'".)&lt;ref&gt;Gorak, Jan. ''The Making of the Modern Canon''. New Jersey/United Kingdom. Athlone Press Limited, 1991, Page 253&lt;/ref&gt;  In echoes of Sainte-Beuve, Eliot gave a speech to the Virgil Society concerning himself with the very same question of "What is a Classic?"&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, T.S. Address to the Virgil Society on October 16, 1944; first published by Faber &amp; Faber, 1945, presently available in: ''Selected Prose of T. S. Eliot''. New York. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt/Farrar, Straus, Giroux.1975&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, there was only one author who was 'classic': "No modern language can hope to produce a classic, in the sense I have called Virgil a classic.  Our classic, the classic of all Europe, is Virgil."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, ''Selected Prose''. Page 130&lt;/ref&gt;  In this instance, though, Eliot said that the word had different meanings in different surroundings and that his concern was with "one meaning in one context".  He states his focus is to define only "one kind of art" and that it does not have to be "better...than another kind".  His opening paragraph makes a clear distinction between his particular meaning of classic having Virgil as the classic of all literature and the alternate meaning of classic as "a standard author".&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, ''Selected Prose''. Pages 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary figures from different eras have also weighed in (sometimes humorously) on the matter. [[Alan Bennett]], the modern English playwright and author, said that "Definition of a classic: a book everyone is assumed to have read and often thinks they have read themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003141/bio|title=Alan Bennett Bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Van Doren]], the [[Columbia University]] professor and poet, is quoted by [[Jim Trelease]] (in his library-monograph ''Classic Picture Books All Children Should Experience''), as saying that "A classic is any book that stays in print".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trelease-on-reading.com/classic-picturebooks.pdf|title=Classic Picture Books Every Child Should Experience|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in his "Disappearance of Literature" speech given over a century ago in 1900, [[Mark Twain]] said, (referring to a learned academic's lofty opinion of Milton's "Paradise Lost") that the work met the Professor's definition of a classic as "something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read".&lt;ref&gt;Twain, ''Mark Twain's Speeches'', Page 194&lt;/ref&gt;

Classics are often defined in terms of their lasting freshness. [[Clifton Fadiman]] thought that the works that become classic books have their start in childhood, saying that "If you wish to live long in the memory of men, you should not write for them at all.  You should write what their children will enjoy."&lt;ref&gt;Fadiman, Clifton.''Party of One, The Selected Writings of Clifton Fadiman'' New York. World Publishing. 1955. Page 387&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, the works we now judge to be classics are "great starters".  Fadiman unites classic books through the ages in a continuum (and concurs with Goethe's thoughts on the vigor and relevance of the ancient [[Classics]]), when he states that classic books share a "quality of beginningness" with the legendary writer of the [[Iliad]] and the [[Odyssey]] – [[Homer]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;Fadiman,''Party of One'', Page 42&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ezra Pound]] in his own tome on reading, ''[[ABC of Reading]]'', gave his opinion when he stated, "A classic is classic not because it conforms to certain structural rule, or fits certain definitions (of which its author had quite probably never heard).  It is classic because of a certain eternal and irrepressible freshness."&lt;ref&gt;[[ABC of Reading]], Volume 0-151, New York: New Directions (2010, ©1934). Pages 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Michael Dirda]], the 1993 [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning critic, concurred with Pound's view regarding the vitality of a classic when he wrote that "...one of the true elements of a classic" was that "they can be read again and again with ever-deepening pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;Dirda, Michael. ''Bound to Please''. New York. W.W. Norton &amp; Company. 2005. Page 182&lt;/ref&gt;

== Imprimaturs ==
[[File:CC No 05 Moby Dick.JPG|thumb|An example of one type of "Classic Book" imprimatur]]
Publishing houses (e.g., [[Easton Press]], [[The Franklin Mint#The Franklin Library|Franklin Library]], and [[Folio Society]]) and colleges/universities (such as [[Oxford University Press]] and [[Yale University Press]]) are at times in the business of classic books.  Publishers have their various types of "classic book" lines, while colleges and universities have required reading lists as well as associated publishing interests.  If these books are the works of literature that well-read people are supposed to have read or at least be familiar with, then the genesis of the classic book genre and the processes through which texts are considered for selection  (or not) is of interest.  The development of the Penguin Classics line of books, among the best-known of the classic imprints, can serve as a good example.

[[Penguin Books]], the parent company of [[Penguin Classics]], had its inception during the 1930s when the founder, [[Allen Lane]], was unable to find a book he actually wanted to read while at [[Exeter]] train station.  As the company website tells it, "appalled by the selection on offer, Lane decided that good quality contemporary fiction should be made available at an attractive price and sold not just in traditional bookshops, but also in railway stations, [[tobacconists]] and [[chain stores]]."&lt;ref name = pingu&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2015-03-22

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Allen, in speaking of Penguin Books, said: "We believed in the existence in this country of a vast reading public and staked everything on it."&lt;ref name=pingu/&gt;  Within the first year, they had sold three million paperbacks of then-contemporary authors, such as [[Agatha Christie]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and [[Andre Maurois]].&lt;ref name=pingu/&gt;

"Classic Books" reading lists now in use at some universities&lt;ref name="Stjohnscollege.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rci.rutgers.edu"/&gt; have been in modern vogue since at least the early part of the 20th century, with the additional impetus in 1909 of the [[Harvard Classics]] publishing imprimatur having individual works chosen by outgoing [[Harvard University]] president [[Charles W. Eliot]].&lt;ref name=kirsch&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kirsch, Adam |url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2001/11/the-five-foot-shelf-reco.html |title=The 'Five-foot Shelf' Reconsidered|work=Harvard Magazine|volume= 103|number =2|date= November–December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Libraries|date=  1910|publisher= Library Bureau|location= Chicago|page =75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vogue for these "Reading Lists" has continued onto the 21st century, e.g., Jane Mallison's ''Book Smart: Your Essential Reading List for Becoming a Literary Genius in 365 Days'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mallison, Jane|title= Book Smart: Your Essential Reading List for Becoming a Literary Genius in 365 Days|location= New York|publisher= McGraw-Hill|date= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[social science]]s, '''coordinated management of meaning''' ('''CMM''') provides understanding of how individuals create, coordinate and manage meanings in their process of communication. Generally, it refers to "how individuals establish rules for creating and interpreting meaning and how those rules are enmeshed in a conversation where meaning is constantly being coordinated".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introducing Communication Theory Analysis and Application (3rd Edition)|last = West|first = Richard|publisher = McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year = |isbn = 978-0-07-313561-8|location = |pages = 111|last2 = Turner|first2 = Lynn H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People live in a world where there is constant communication. In communicating with others, people assign meanings in their messages based on past [[conversation]]al experiences from previous social realities. Through communication, an underlying process takes place in which individuals negotiate a common or conflicted meanings of the world around them, thereby creating a new social reality. CMM advocates that meanings can be managed in a productive way so as to improve the state of interactions by coordinating and managing the [[meaning-making]] process.

CMM  relies on three interdependent elements: coordination, management and meaning. These elements help to explain how social realities are created through conversation.

== History and orientation ==
The theory of CMM was developed in the mid-1970s by W. Barnett Pearce (1943 - 2011) and Vernon E. Cronen. Communication Action and Meaning was devoted to CMM, is thorough explication of CMM, which Pearce and Cronen introduced to the common scholarly vernacular of the discipline. Their scholarly collaboration at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|University of Massachusetts at Amherst]] offered a major contribution to the philosophy of communication as story-centered, applicable, and ever attentive to the importance of human meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronald C|first=Arnett|year=2013|title=Philosophy Of Communication As Carrier Of Meaning: Adieu To W. Barnett Pearce|url=|journal=Qualitative Research Reports In|volume=14.1|pages=1–9|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cluster of ideas in which CMM emerged has moved from the periphery toward greater acceptance and CMM has continued to evolve along a trajectory from an interpretive [[social science]] to one with a critical edge and then to what its founders call a "practical theory".

Aware that the intellectual footing for communication theory had shifted, the first phase of the CMM project involved developing concepts that met the twin criteria of (1) adequately expressing the richness of human communication and (2) guiding empirical investigation. Pearce describes the creation of CMM through the following story:&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|align=center|...I think that I am the first person ever to use the awkward phrase "coordinated management of meaning".  Of course, tones of voice are often more informative than the verbal content of what is said, and struggle and frustration were expressed in the tones of voice in which "CMM" was first said. For years, I had been trying to bring together what I was learning from social science research, rhetorical studies, philosophy, theology, and, in my father's term, the "School of Hard Knocks". I felt that most of the models of communication that I knew were useful but that all were limited and limiting in some important ways, and that I had to invent something that was better.

Communication is about ''meaning'',... but not just in a passive sense of perceiving messages. Rather, we live in lives filled with meanings and one of our life challenges is to ''manage'' those meanings so that we can make our social worlds coherent and live within them with honor and respect. But this process of managing our meanings is never done in isolation. We are always and necessarily ''coordinating'' the way we manage our meanings with other people. So, I concluded, communication is about the coordinated management of meaning.|''W. Barnett Pearce''}}

CMM is one of an increasing number of theories that see communication as "[[performative]]" (doing things, not just talking "about" them) and "constitutive" (the material substance of the social world, not just a means of transmitting information within it). In CMM-speak, "taking the communication perspective" means looking at communication rather than through it, and seeing communication as the means by which we make the objects and events of our social worlds.

The "communication perspective" entails a shift in focus from [[theory]] to [[wikt:praxis|praxis]].&lt;ref&gt;Cronen 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; CMM concepts and models are best understood as providing tools for naming aspects of performance. To date, CMM has found greater acceptance among practitioners than among scholars. Taking the communication perspective confers something like "communication literacy"—the ability to inscribe and read the complex process of communication in real time. Among other things, CMM's concepts and models guide practitioners in helping clients become aware of the patterns of communication which make up aspects of the social world. They want to change and help both clients and practitioners identify openings or "[[bifurcation point]]s" in everyday lives. Many CMM practitioners have an explicit commitment not only to describe and understand, but to improve the conditions in which they and those around them live. They believe that the best way of making better social worlds is to improve the patterns of communication which generates them.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basics==
It has been said that "CMM theory is a kind of [[multi-tool]] (like a '[[Swiss army knife]]') that is useful in any situation".&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren 2004, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a single theory, but rather a collection of ideas to understand how humans interact during communication. According to CMM, individuals construct their own social realities while engaged in conversation. To put it simply, communicators apply rules in order to understand what is going on during their social interaction. Based on the situation, different rules are applied in order to produce "better" patterns of communication.&lt;ref name="Pearce Associates 1999, p.12"&gt;Pearce Associates 1999, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

CMM theory is a fairly complex study focusing on both the complexity in the micro-social processes and the aspects of daily interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren 2004, p.92.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, it is concerned with how we coordinate and establish meaning during interactions. The theory can be complicated to teach and/or present to others, but it is best understood when it is broken down into the basics. The theory consists of three key concepts, which are further broken down into several different building blocks.

The fundamental building blocks of CMM theory focus specifically on the flow of communication between people. The three different concepts experienced either [[consciously]] or [[unconsciously]], are coordination, management and meaning.

===1. Coordination.===
Coordination refers to "the degree to which persons perceive that their actions have fitted together into some mutually intelligible sequence or pattern of actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Watershed research traditions in human communication theory|last = Gerry|first = Phillipsen|publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It exists "when two people attempt to make sense out of the sequencing of messages in their conversation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That is, if people in the interaction can recognize what their partners are talking about, then we say the conversation come to a coordination. Scientists believes that people's desire for coordination in interaction arises from the subjectivity of meaning, which means the same message may have different meanings to different people. In order to avoid this pitfall in communication, people work together to share meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Assessing belief in coordinating meaning in romantic relationships|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that [[Sensemaking|sense making]] is the foundation of coordination. By tokens within the information connected by means of channel can the logic relationship emerges, then it contributes to the sense making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Progressive Ontology Alignment for Meaning Coordination: An Information-theoretic Foundation|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1082473.1082586|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the Fourth International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems|date = 2005-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 1-59593-093-0|pages = 737–744|series = AAMAS '05|doi = 10.1145/1082473.1082586|first = Marco|last = Schorlemmer|first2 = Yannis|last2 = Kalfoglou}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sense making helps people to establish common understanding then further develops coordination between people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Common understanding as a basis for coordination|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/13563280810869587|journal = Corporate Communications: An International Journal|date = 2008-05-09|issn = 1356-3289|pages = 147–167|volume = 13|issue = 2|doi = 10.1108/13563280810869587 | last1 = Jaatinen | first1 = Miia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of coordination has to do with the fact that our actions do not stand alone with regard to communication. The words or actions that we use during a conversation come together to produce patterns. These patterns, also known as stories lived, influence the behavior used during each interaction as a way to collaborate. Pearce and Cronen are quick to point out that coordination does not imply a commitment to coordinate "smoothly", but rather the concept is meant to provide the basis for being mindful of the other side of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2005, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three possible outcome of coordination:

1. People in the interaction achieve coordination.

2. People in the interaction failed to achieve coordination.

3. People in the interaction achieve some degree of coordination.

If the interaction fail to achieve coordination or achieve partially coordination, the possible solution is to move the level of meaning to another level.

===2. Management===
Our interactions are guided and defined by rules. "Interactants must understand the social reality and then incorporate rules as they decide how to act in a given situation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From the use of rules, individuals manage and coordinate meanings in the conversation. "Once rules are established in a [[dialogue]], interactants will have a sufficiently common symbolic framework for communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = An approach to communication theory: Toward consensus on rules|date = 1972|journal = Journal of Communication|doi = 10.1111/j.1460-2466.1972.tb00149.x|pmid = |access-date = |volume=22 |pages=217–238 | last1 = Cushman | first1 = Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, it would be ambiguous if a friend says "I hate you". Does the friend really hate whomever he/she is speaking to or he/she is just expressing his/her feelings at the moment? Rules will help clarify and explain this kind of meanings.
* '''Constitutive rules''': refer to "how behavior should be interpreted within a given context".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It tells us what the given behavior means and linking belief to one another and behaviors to beliefs.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerald W|first=Driskill|year=1995|title=Managing Cultural Differences: A Rules Analysis In A Bicultural Organization|url=|journal=Howard Journal of Communications|volume=5.4|pages=353–379|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the example above, "I hate you" in some contexts counts as an expression of slight dissatisfaction. 
* '''Regulative rules''': refer to "some sequence of action that an individual undertakes, and they communicate what happens next in a conversation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; they are also referred as "cognitive reorganizations of constitutive rules" &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In other word, it means the behavior that is requested in certain situation. Regulative rules link the meanings in the interaction with the consequences they result to. Our body reaction can reflect on the contents of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Keep meaning in conversational coordination|url = http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01397/abstract|journal = Cognitive Science|date = 2014-01-01|pmc = 4253663|pmid = 25520693|pages = 1397|volume = 5|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01397|first = Elena C.|last = Cuffari}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''"Unwanted repetitive patterns":''' It refers to "the sequential and recurring conflictual episodes that are considered unwanted by the individuals in the conflict."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This phenomenon happens because "two people with particular rule systems follow a structure that obligates them to perform specific behaviors."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Several reasons count for unwanted repetitive patterns. First, sometimes people can't find other options than being in conflict. Second, people may feel comfortable in the conflict situation because they have experience on what others will behave in this kind of situation. Third, people may be tired of finding resolution on the conflict situation.
* '''"Not everything within communication can be explained."''', which is called Mystery. It is the recognition that "the world and our experience of it is more than any of the particular stories that make it coherent or any of the activities in which we engage".&lt;ref name="Pearce Associates 1999, p.12" /&gt; Mystery has to do with the sense of awe or wonder when communication leads to a surprising outcome. Put more simply, it is the feeling (anything from attraction to hate) one experiences when engaged in conversation that cannot be linked to the situation as a whole.

CMM theory sees each conversation as a complex interconnected series of events in which each individual affects and is affected by the other. Although the primary emphasis of CMM theory has to do with the concept of first person communication, known as a [[participatory]] view, once the concepts are understood they are more readily visible during other interactions. Furthermore, this knowledge can be applied to similar situations which will in turn lead to more effective communication.

=== 3. Meaning ===
Coordinated management of meaning states that people "organize meaning in a [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchical]] manner." Theorists on CMM was in agreement on two points regarding hierarchical meaning. "First, the hierarchical of meaning defines the context in which regulative and constitutive rules are to be understood. Second, these contexts are arranged in a hierarchical af abstractness, such that higher levels of the hierarchy help to define – and may subsume – lower level."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication Theories, Perspectives, Processes, and contexts|publisher = |year = |isbn = 0-07-293794-7|location = |pages = 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can interpreted  to each of the contexts in the "hierarchical can be understood by looking at the other contexts, and each contexts is always contextualizing other contexts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eerika|first=Hedman|last2=Gesch-Karamanlidis|first2=Eleni|date=|year=2015|title=Facilitating Conversations That Matter Using Coordinated Management Of Meaning Theory|url=|journal=OD Practitioner|volume=47.2|pages=|via=1. Business Source Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six levels of meaning. ''Levels below are illustrated from lower level to higher level.''

====(1) Content====
The content or [[message]] according to CMM theory relates to the raw data and information spoken aloud during communication.To put it simply, content is the words used to communicate. The content is essentially the basic building blocks of any [[language]]; however, it is important to note that the content by itself is not sufficient to establish the meaning of the communication.&lt;ref&gt;HFCL Tutorial 2008, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====(2) Speech act====
Another integral part of the CMM theory includes the [[speech act]].  "Speech acts communicate the intention of the speaker and indicate how a particular communication should be taken."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The simplest explanation of a speech act is "actions that you perform by speaking. They include compliments, insults, promises, [[wikt:threat|threats]], assertions, and questions".&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 1994, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt; CMM theory draws upon the [[speech act theory]], which further breaks down speech acts into separate categories of sounds or utterances. Though the speech act theory is much more detailed, it is important to have an understanding of both [[illocutionary]] and [[perlocutionary]] utterances.

* An ''illocutionary utterance'' is speech that intends to make contact with a receiver.
* A ''perlocutionary utterance'' includes speech that intends to alter the behavior of the receiver.

There are many different utterances or speech acts including questions, answers, commands, promises and statements. Having knowledge of each of these plays a large part in an individual being able to participate in a communications exchange.

====(3) Episodes====
An episode is a situation created by persons in a conversation. The same content can take on different meaning when the situation is different. For example, a phrase used among close family or friends may take on an entirely different meaning in a job interview. In the interactions, people may punctuate differently on a same episode. This will result to people deal with the differences on their punctuations on subsequent episodes. Especially when people situated the bi-cultural or multi-cultural situation has identified a number of specific acts which occurred in an equivalent situation in the other culture, would have totally disrupted the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Wolfson|last2=Pearce|first2=W. Barnett|year=1983|title=A Cross-Cultural Comparison Of The Implications Of Self-Disclosure On Conversational Logics|url=|journal=Communication Quarterly|volume=31.3|pages=249–256|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete.|doi=10.1080/01463378309369511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====(4) Relationship====
Relationship is the higher level of the meaning, where "relational boundaries in that parameters are established for attitudes and behaviors."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This building block is fairly easy to understand as it is the dynamic of what connects two (or more) individuals during an exchange of information. Examples of a [[interpersonal relationship|relationship]] could be defined as a parent/child, teacher/student, strangers, etc. Communication between strangers would likely be different from conversations amongst family members.

====(5) Life scripts====

Life scripts can be understood as the patterns of episodes. On this level, "every individual's history of relationships and interactions will influence rules and interaction patterns."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Life scripts are similar to the [[autobiography]] of individuals. It comprises the person's exceptions for variety communicative events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veron E|first=Cronen|last2=Pearce|first2=W. Barnett|last3=Harris|first3=Linda M|year=1979|title=The Logic Of The Coordinated Management Of Meaning: A Rules-Based Approach To The First Course In Interpersonal Communication.|url=|journal=Communication Education|volume=28.1|pages=22–38|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several CMM texts describe this building block as a "script for who we are" as the role an individual plays in the movie of life. For example, an individual may believe they are funny, and therefore may act according to that perspective while engaged in different conversations.

====(6) Cultural patterns====
The concept of culture in CMM theory relates to a set of rules for acting and speaking which govern what we understand to be normal in a given episode. There are different rules for [[social interaction]] depending on the culture. To some extent, during communication individuals act in accordance with their cultural values. While we often don't even realize that culture impacts communication during day to day interactions, people must learn to be compatible with individuals from different cultures in order to have effective communication.

==Models and applications==
Pearce is adamant that CMM is not just an interpretive theory but is meant to be a practical theory as well.&lt;ref name="Barge 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2005, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; There is extensive literature involving the use of CMM to address [[family violence]], intra-community relations, [[workplace conflict]] and many other [[social issues]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, et al. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sundarajan and Spano 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearce and Pearce 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A research employs CMM to understand the "perceived acts of discrimination manifested within the context of everyday interactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Defining discrimination across cultural groups: Exploring the [un-]coordinated management of meaning|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147176710000088|journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations|date = 2010-05-01|pages = 283–293|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.ijintrel.2010.02.004|first = Mark P.|last = Orbe|first2 = Sakile K.|last2 = Camara}}&lt;/ref&gt; By applying CMM into research, the researchers are able to explicate the rules of meaning-making that majority and minority groups followed in understanding the discrimination act. Another application example was done in 1994 when CMM was initially recognized by people. It believes that the framework of CMM provides an understanding of "the structure and process of consumer decision making by placing those decisions within the context of a family's social reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Co‐ordinated Management of Meaning: A Case Exemplar of a New Consumer Research Technologynull|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03090569410067640|journal = European Journal of Marketing|date = 1994-08-01|issn = 0309-0566|pages = 76–99|volume = 28|issue = 8/9|doi = 10.1108/03090569410067640 | last1 = Buttle | first1 = Francis A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along this line, CMM theorists have used or developed several [[analysis]] [[scientific modelling|models]] to help understand and improve communication. The models addressed here are the hierarchy model, the serpentine model, charmed and strange loops. Examples for the first model have been adapted from ones Pearce uses in one of his writings where he analyzes the courtroom conversation between [[Ramzi Yousef]], the individual convicted of bombing the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in 1994, and Kevin T. Duffy, the [[federal judge]] who presided over his trial. In Yousef's statement before sentencing, he criticizes the US for its hypocrisy; he accuses the US of being the premier [[terrorist]], and reasserts his pride in his fight against the US. At the sentencing, Duffy accuses Yousef of being a virus, evil, perverting the principles of [[Islam]], and interested only in death. Neither individual really talks to the other, but rather at them.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2005, p.38-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1. Hierarchy model===
The hierarchy model is the hierarchy of organized meanings as illustrated in the "[[#3. Meaning|Meaning]]" section. The hierarchy model is a tool for an individual to explore the perspectives of their conversational partners while also enabling them to take a more thorough look at their own personal [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]. The elements at the top of each list form the overall context in which each story takes place and have an influence on the elements below them. The levels of meaning from lowest to highest are: content, speech act, episodes, relationship, life scripts, and cultural patterns.

Stephen W. Littlejohn and Karen A. Foss in their book ''Theories of Human Communication'' (Tenth Edition)&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, Stephen W., and Karen A. Foss. "Chapter 6: The Conversation." Theories of Human Communication. Long Grove, IL: Waveland, 2017. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; describe a type of logical force called contextual force. Contextual force causes a person to follow a form of logic that leads one to believe that an action or interpretation is a direct result of, and is appropriate to, the context. For example, "How else could I have reacted?" or "Naturally I acted that way, it was appropriate to the situation," leads to the mentality of "I did what I had to do." Secondly, in CMM contexts are extremely important and they are not static and unchanging. For example, a relationship that is longstanding can contextualize the episode of an ugly argument as something unpleasant, but unavoidable. The couple will most likely worth though this ugly argument because of their relationship contextualizing the episode. However, an episode of an ugly argument can contextualize a relationship if a couple is on their first date. Therefore the argument is more likely to contextualize the relationship is over or not worth pursuing. What contextualizes what in the hierarchy of organized meanings overlaps and is interlinked in a complicated hierarchy of meanings which can shift at any moment.

===2. Serpentine model===
The CMM theorists take the hierarchy model a step further by reinforcing the importance of interaction and adding the aspect of time. Pearce stresses that communication cannot be done alone and that furthermore this usually occurs before or after another's actions. Therefore, understanding past events and their impact on individuals is essential to improving communication. This new model is called the serpentine model and visually demonstrates how communication is a back and forth interaction between participants rather than just a simple transmission of information.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2005, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===3. Charmed and strange loop===
The embedded contexts illustrated in the hierarchy model represent a stable [[hierarchy]]. It suggests that higher levels subsume lower levels. Meanwhile, sometimes "lower levels can reflect back and affect the meaning of higher levels."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This process is termed "loop". CMM believes that there is a stronger "contextual effect", which works from higher levels to the lower levels, and a weaker "implicative effect", which works the other way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Tortured Families: A Coordinated Management of Meaning Analysis|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1545-5300.2004.00027.x/abstract|journal = Family Process|date = 2004-09-01|issn = 1545-5300|pages = 349–371|volume = 43|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/j.1545-5300.2004.00027.x|first = Edith|last = Montgomery}}&lt;/ref&gt; When loops are consistent with the hierarchy, it is identified as a "charmed loop".  In this kind of interaction, each person's perceptions and actions help to reinforce the other's perceptions and actions.&lt;ref name="Kearney 2004, p.9"&gt;Kearney 2004, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the lower levels are inconsistent with the higher levels, it is called a "strange loop". Essentially, "a 'strange' loop is a repetitive interactional pattern that alternates between [[contradictory]] meanings".&lt;ref&gt;Craig 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the alcoholic identifies that he is an alcoholic and then quits drinking. Since he has quit drinking, he convinces himself that he is not really an alcoholic and so he starts drinking again, which makes him an alcoholic. He alternates between contradictory [[perceptions]] of being an alcoholic and not being an alcoholic. The charmed and strange loop model also has its applications. In a research regarding the social construction of male college student logical forces, the charmed and strange loop model was utilized in studying male college students' narratives in describing their memorable sexual experiences.

Less commonly, there is a third variation called "subversive" loop. Texts and contexts within a subversive loop are mutually invalidating and can prevent coherence and coordination. It may result in intentionally outrageous behavior, efforts to act in uninterruptible ways, or refusal to recognize the possibility that the outsider can understand the situation of the insider.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce Associates 1999, p.37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 4. Applications ===
CMM theory is regarding as kind of multi-tool by providing a framework to structure different themes. In this regard, there are lots of qualitative study using CMM to illustrate its utility for framing their findings. Because people interpret messages and know the rules or guide which can follow and have actions constitute appropriate responses. Now, its focus on cultural influence to get insights into how individuals negotiate complex messages occurring at different levels of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mozhdeh B|first=Truss|year=2005|title=Food, Culture, And Family: Exploring The Coordinated Management Of Meaning Regarding Childhood Obesity|url=|journal=Health Communication|volume=18.2|pages=155–175|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since CMM attempts to explain the process by group member to make sense out of the regular path of messages and carried out into a group conversation. So according to CMM, individual perspective with group approach conversation need to combine and create a better meaning-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Moore|last2=Laters|first2=Amy|year=2008|title=Coordinated Management Of Meaning In Chat Rooms|url=|journal=International Communication Association|volume=|pages=1–46|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Qualitative experiment framework tool  
* Online chat room user experience by applying CMM theory, conduct a textual analysis.
* Data analysis tool though on how people use complex, multilevel systems of reference to derive meaning and guide behaviors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mark P|first=Orbe|last2=Camara|first2=Skile K|year=2012|title=Defining Discrimination Across Cultural Groups: Exploring The [Un-]Coordinated Management Of Meaning.|url=|journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations|volume=34.3|pages=283–293|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete|doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2010.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory criticism==
In order to provide criticism of the CMM theory, it is important to establish a baseline for what accounts for a "good" study. Many scholars use different criteria for determining what makes a theory relevant, but they most often surround the following six concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2001, p.4-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1: Theories should be evaluated on their ability to produce [[hypotheses]] that are consistent with relevant evidence. CMM theory falls short under the criteria of rule 1 as it does not set out to provide measureable hypotheses that can be compared to any other situation. While CMM tries to outline the cause and effect relationship of communication, it fails to create consistencies as the theory dictates that each situation is different. 
* 2: General theories are preferred to less general theories. From the perspective of this rule, CMM theory is very general; however it is also very vague. The theory has difficulty focusing on exactly what is important in each interaction thereby not allowing those who study the theory to understand what is considered critical in a communicative interaction. 
* 3: Theories that produce several hypotheses are preferred to those that produce few. From this perspective, CMM theory fails as it neglects to have even a single hypothesis that is testable.
* 4: It is more beneficial to evaluate research programs rather than individual theories. As CMM theory focuses on levels of contact between two (or more) persons engaged in communication, these findings from CMM research contribute beyond mere observation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danielle|first=Wiese|last2=Farrugia|first2=Rebekah|year=2009|title=Coordinating Communication On Facebook: An Analysis Of Meaning Development Through Close Relationships|url=|journal=Conference Papers -- National Communication Association|volume=|pages=|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is unsuccessful as a way to evaluate anything other than individual interactions.
* 5: The overall implications of a theory mean that those with several are preferred over those with few. CMM theory focuses on how we create our social environments in the present, however it fails to predict how the theory can affect future events. 
* 6: Simplicity is considered a virtue. In accordance with this rule, CMM theory falls short. CMM is an extremely broad theory with many different terms, views and loopholes which makes a multifaceted study of communication even more complex
CMM has been criticized for too broad in its scope and highly abstract in its nature. "Poole wrote 'It is difficult ... to paint with broad strokes and at the same time give difficult areas the attention they deserve'.".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1987, Brenders also stated that "in its broad - stroked approach to human interaction, CMM has missed many of the linguistic, international, and theoretical nuances necessary for an understanding of communicative meaning"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Fallacies in the coordinated management of meaning: A philosophy of language critique of the hierarchical organization of coherent conversation and related theory.|date = 1987|journal = Quarterly Journal of Speech|doi = 10.1080/00335638709383812|pmid = |access-date = |volume=73 |pages=329–348 | last1 = Brenders | first1 = David A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also criticized for its conceptual apparatus as "incomplete with regard to a full examination of the material layering of practices"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Proposal for Integrating Structuration Theory With Coordinated Management of Meaning Theory|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10510970600666867|journal = Communication Studies|date = 2006-07-01|issn = 1051-0974|pages = 173–196|volume = 57|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/10510970600666867|first = Randall A.|last = Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a humanistic perspective, CMM theory is seen as valuable as it seeks to provide a way to clarify communication for better interaction and understanding. Its utility lies in "how people achieve meaning, their potential recurring conflicts, and the influence of the self on the communication process is admirable."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It promotes [[reform]] by encouraging individuals to explain particular viewpoints in order to reach understanding.

The final point can be seen as both a criticism and positive [[critique]]. Pearce and Cronen are constantly building upon the CMM theory which was originally outlined in the 1970s. By constant corrections and revisions, the theorists are working toward improving the examination of communication interactions; however, with each new update, minor course corrections alter the terms and meanings which increase the complexity of the overall theory.

CMM has guided research in an array of context and disciplines.&lt;ref name="Barge 2004"&gt;Barge 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Further discussion of CMM concepts and applications for research can be found at the following location: [http://www.pearceassociates.com/essays/research_menu.htm CMM Research]

'''CouchSurfing''' is a [[hospitality service|hospitality]] and [[social networking service]] accessible via a website and [[mobile app]]. Members can use the service to arrange [[homestay]]s, offer [[lodging]] and [[hospitality]], and join events such as "Couch Crashes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blog.couchsurfing.com/calendar/ | title=Global Couchsurfing Event Calendar | work=Couchsurfing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://support.couchsurfing.org/hc/en-us/articles/200639760-How-do-I-join-an-event- | title=How do I join an event? | work=Couchsurfing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform is a [[gift economy]]; hosts are not allowed to charge for lodging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://support.couchsurfing.org/hc/en-us/articles/200639420-I-heard-of-someone-charging-for-a-couch-Is-that-OK- | title=I heard of someone charging for a couch.

==History==
===Conception (1999–2004)===
Couchsurfing was conceived by computer programmer and [[New Hampshire]] native Casey Fenton in 1999, when he was 21 years old.&lt;ref name=inc/&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=entr&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/220724 | title=How CouchSurfing Got its Start, and Landed VC Millions | work=[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]] | date=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea arose after Fenton found a cheap flight from [[Boston]] to [[Iceland]] but did not have lodging. Fenton hacked into a database of the [[University of Iceland]] and randomly e-mailed 1,500 students asking for a homestay. He received between 50 and 100 offers and chose to stay at the home of an Icelandic [[rhythm and blues]] singer.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; On the return flight to Boston, he came up with the idea to create the website. He registered the couchsurfing.com [[domain name]] on 12 June 1999.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whois.domaintools.com/couchsurfing.com | title=Whois Record for CouchSurfing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Couchsurfing International Inc. was formed on 2 April 2003 as a [[New Hampshire]] [[nonprofit organization]].&lt;ref name=newhampshire&gt;{{cite web | url=https://quickstart.sos.nh.gov/online/BusinessInquire/BusinessInformation?businessID=126502 | title=Business Information: COUCHSURFING INTERNATIONAL INC. | publisher=New Hampshire Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website was launched on June 12, 2004&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; with the cooperation of Dan Hoffer, Sebastien Le Tuan, and Leonardo Silveira.&lt;ref name=entr/&gt;

=== Development of the website by volunteers (2006–2011) ===
From 2006 until the company raised financing in 2011, development of the website occurred mostly at events called "Couchsurfing Collectives", in which members came together to voluntarily improve the website.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; Collectives took place in [[Montreal]], [[Vienna]], [[New Zealand]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Samara]], [[Alaska]], [[Istanbul]], and [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCfrCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190 | title=Encyclopedia of Social Networks | first=George A. | last=Barnett | publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] | date=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the collectively-coded website, which was full of [[software bug]]s, could not handle the rapid increases in traffic and [[Crash (computing)|crashes]] were common. Many members believed that the website needed to be redesigned from scratch.&lt;ref name=friendster&gt;{{cite news | url=https://gigaom.com/2015/01/10/how-couchsurfing-became-the-friendster-of-the-sharing-economy/ | title=How Couchsurfing became the Friendster of the sharing economy | work=[[GigaOm]] | last=DeAmicis | first=Carmel | date=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, problems with the website [[database]] resulted in much of it being irrevocably lost.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQx4CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA295 | title=Handbook of Research on Global Hospitality and Tourism Management | first=Angelo A. | last=Camillo | publisher=IGI Global | date=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=techcrunchdelete&gt;{{cite news | url=https://techcrunch.com/2006/06/29/couchsurfing-deletes-itself-shuts-down/ | title=CouchSurfing Deletes Itself, Shuts Down | work=[[TechCrunch]] | last=Arrington | first=Michael | date=29 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=friendster/&gt; Founder Casey Fenton posted online asking for help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://forums.mysql.com/read.php?28,99328,99328#msg-99328 | first=Casey | last=Fenton | title=Help! - Innodb and MyISAM accidental DROP DATABASE – 112 tables gone forever? | website=forums.mysql.com | date=28 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Couchsurfing Collective was underway in Montreal at the time and those in attendance raised $8,000 in donations and committed to recreate the website.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

=== Change to a for-profit corporation and financing (2011) ===
The company applied for status as a [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]] in November 2007 but was rejected by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] in early 2011.&lt;ref name=inc&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.inc.com/magazine/201206/issie-lapowsky/couchsurfing-new-profit-model.html | title=Couchsurfing Dilemma: Going for Profit | work=[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]] | first=Issie | last=Lapowesky | date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smallbusiness/&gt; Hoffer, in charge of strategic development, then believed that non-profit status was an obstacle to innovation due to the [[audit]] and regulatory requirements and that a [[for-profit corporation]] was the best structure for the company.&lt;ref name=smallbusiness/&gt;

The New Hampshire entity Couchsurfing International Inc. was dissolved on 4 November 2011.&lt;ref name=newhampshire/&gt; Its assets were sold to a for-profit [[Delaware]] corporation, also called Couchsurfing International, Inc., which was formed on 3 May 2011.&lt;ref name=decorp&gt;{{cite web | url=https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx | title=State of Delaware corporate entity search – enter "couchsurfing"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bizapedia&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bizapedia.com/de/couchsurfing-international-inc.html | title=Bizapedia: Couchsurfing International Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=techcrunchraises15/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicoleperlroth/2011/08/24/non-profit-couchsurfing-raises-millions-in-funding/ | title=Non-Profit CouchSurfing Raises Millions In Funding | work=[[Forbes]] | first=Nicole | last=Perlroth | date=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the company was a certified [[B Corporation]];&lt;ref name=inc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/money/couchsurfing-ceo-daniel-hoffer-on-become-a-b-corporation/ | title=CouchSurfing CEO Daniel Hoffer on Becoming a B Corporation | work=[[Intuit]] | first=Vanessa | last=Richardson}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is no longer listed as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bcorporation.net/ | title=B Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, in conjunction with the reorganization to a for-profit corporation, the company raised $7.6 million in a first-round financing led by [[Benchmark Capital]] and [[Omidyar Network]].&lt;ref name=raises&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110825005488/en/CouchSurfing-Raises-7.6-Million-Series-Benchmark-Capital | title=CouchSurfing Raises $7.6 Million in Series A From Benchmark Capital and Omidyar Network to Expand Services and Fuel Growth in Cultural Exchange Network | publisher=[[PRNewswire]] | date=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tnooz.com/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/08/24/benchmark-couchsurfing/ | title=Benchmark plops down $7.6M to make Couchsurfing into a for-profit | first=Dylan | last=Tweney | work=[[VentureBeat]] | date=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/couchsurfing-just-closed-a-76-million-round-of-funding-2011-8 | title=CouchSurfing Just Closed A $7.6 Million Round Of Funding | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Couchsurfing received an additional $15 million in funding from an investor group led by [[General Catalyst Partners]], with participation by [[Menlo Ventures]], as well as existing investors [[Benchmark Capital]] and [[Omidyar Network]]. The additional funding brought the company’s total funding raised to $22.6 million.&lt;ref name=techcrunchraises15&gt;{{cite web | title=CouchSurfing Raises $15 Million Series B From General Catalyst Partners, Menlo Ventures, Others | url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/22/couchsurfing-raises-15-million-series-b-from-general-catalyst-partners-others/ | work=[[TechCrunch]] | date=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has a [[burn rate]] of $2-3 million per year.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt; However, it has been as high as $800,000 per month.&lt;ref name=tony/&gt;

==== Criticism from members of the conversion to a for-profit corporation ====
The conversion to a for-profit corporation was objected to by many members.&lt;ref name=friendster/&gt;&lt;ref name=revolt&gt;{{cite news | url=https://gigaom.com/2011/09/01/after-going-for-profit-couchsurfing-faces-user-revolt/ | title=After going for-profit, CouchSurfing faces user revolt | work=[[GigaOm]] | date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://techpresident.com/news/24498/couchsurfing2 | title=How to Lose Funds and Infuriate Users: Couchsurfing, a Cautionary Tale From the Sharing Economy | work=[[techPresident]] | last=Roudman | first=Sam | date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founder Casey Fenton said he received 1,500 emails in the days after announcing the conversion.&lt;ref name=inc/&gt; Even though the founders did not receive any cash from the financing,&lt;ref name=mythsandfacts&gt;{{cite web | title=Myths and Facts: Couchsurfing’s conversion to a B Corp | url=https://blog.couchsurfing.com/myths-and-facts-couchsurfings-conversion-to-a-b-corp/ | work=Couchsurfing | date=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; members were opposed to the founders having a valuable ownership interest in an organization that was financed by donations and built using volunteer work.&lt;ref name=friendster/&gt;&lt;ref name=tnooz.com/&gt; The company spent more than $10,000 on a [[public relations]] firm to educate its directors on how to respond to the press about the conversion to a for-profit entity. A 3-page letter was sent to over 1,000 volunteers.&lt;ref name=inc/&gt;

=== Launch and development of mobile apps ===
In 2012, the company launched mobile apps for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Couchsurfing your way to a free place to stay | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/talkingtech/2013/10/12/talking-tech-couchsurfing/2959867/ | last=Graham | first=Jefferson | work=[[USA Today]] | date=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the company added a feature called "hangouts" that enables members to quickly meet with other nearby members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blog.couchsurfing.com/product-update-make-a-new-friend-with-couchsurfing-hangouts/ | title=Product Update: Make a new friend with Couchsurfing Hangouts! | work=Couchsurfing | date=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=A little-known travel app that is Airbnb-meets-Tinder helped me have the wildest night in Tokyo partying until sunrise | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-use-couchsurfing-app-to-meet-locals-traveling-2018-1/ | last=Jacobs | first=Harrison | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''day-tripper''' is a person who visits a [[tourist destination]] or [[visitor attraction]] from his/her home or hotel/hostel in the morning and returns home or to his/her hotel/hostel the same evening.

The '''day trip''' or '''daycation''' is a popular form of [[recreation]] and [[leisure]] for families who care for young children or people who are too frail to travel easily or who own pets, or for whom the logistics or cost of a night away from home may be prohibitive.

Day trips are very popular with travelers who use a city as a homebase for going to different cities for the day and then returning in the evening, typically via cars, trains, boats, or aircraft. For example, a traveler staying in [[Zürich]] may depart for cities and towns such as [[Lucerne]], [[Winterthur]], or [[Zug]] in the mornings for the day and then returning in the evenings via a car or train.

== History ==

In [[Medieval]] days a destination for such days out would be [[religious]] (to a nearby [[shrine]]) or commercial, for example to a seasonal [[fair]]. Later, in England, visits to [[stately home]]s by those who regarded themselves [[middle class]] became frequent and it was the tradition to reward the [[butler]] or housekeeper with a tip for providing access to their employers' home. As such homes were meant for show it is unlikely that the owning family would object, provided they were not in residence at the time.

The arrival of the [[railway excursion]], often using Day Tripper tickets, in the mid 19th century saw the blossoming of a distinctive day-tripper industry. Trippers also travelled in their thousands by [[paddlesteamer]] or [[steamship]] to the many [[pier]]s around [[Victorian era]] [[seaside resort]]s. The [[General Slocum]] excursion was an example. 

[[Cycling]] became a very popular day-tripper activity, especially amongst [[urban area|urban]] and [[suburban]] workers from the mid-1880s onwards. 

[[Coach (vehicle)|Coach]] and [[charabanc]] outings followed as the [[internal combustion engine]] became reliable enough to get the paying customers out and back again. Works outings and church or chapel excursions were extremely popular until the 1970s. 

While all of the foregoing still exist, the modern day-tripper experience is usually by [[motor car]] as a result of the growth of car ownership. Also, [[airline]]s such as [[Palmair]] promote day trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/africa/a-taste-of-egypt-and-home-for-tea-651761.html|title=Indyplus video: Outnumbered - BBC|date=5 March 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Designer jeans */Changed start of caption on Armani Jeans photo, "Customers shopping at...", to "Staff working at...", as careful inspection of photo shows there are most likely no customers, but rather three staff pictured. Thus the caption was inaccurate—and, if literally nobody shops here, misleading. See Talk page for details.</comment>

'''Designer clothing''' is luxury clothing.

== Brands ==

Designer clothing is not always created by the founder of the company. For example, the actual designer of [[Chanel]] is not its original founder and designer, [[Gabrielle Chanel]], but German designer [[Karl Lagerfeld]]. The quality of the clothing and degree of its resemblance, if any, to the designer's work vary considerably depending on the licensee and the terms of the agreement the designer has struck. Some terms may limit the number of garment styles that may be produced, allowing the designer to veto any designs he or she finds unappealing. Examples include:

* [[Armani]]
*[[BT21]]
* [[Calvin Klein]]
* [[Dean and Dan Caten|DSquared&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]
* [[Dior]]
* [[Givenchy]]
* [[Gucci]]
* [[Jean Paul Gaultier]]
* [[Jil Sander (brand)|Jil Sander]]
* [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]
* [[Polo Ralph Lauren]]
* [[Philipp Plein]]
* [[Saint Laurent Paris]]
* [[Adidas]]
* [[Tommy Hilfiger (company)|Tommy Hilfiger]]
* [[Versace]]

This licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers like [[Pierre Cardin]] in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the fashion industry from about the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fashion-history.lovetoknow.com/fashion-clothing-industry/fashion-designers/pierre-cardin|title=Pierre Cardin|last=Walker|first=Myra|date=|website=www.lovetoknow.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designer jeans are available at many different price points usually at several hundreds of dollars, with some even approaching $1,000 USD.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. Before the "Great Recession," premium denim was one of the fastest growing categories of the apparel business, and there seemed to be no limit to what customers would pay for the latest label, fit, finish, or wash.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Wilson, Eric|[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/29/fashion/29JEANS.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0]| "Preshrunk Prices", October 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
Americans bought $13.8 billion USD of men's and women's jeans in the year ended April 30, 2011, according to market-research firm NPD Group. But only about 1% of jeans sold in the U.S. over that year cost more than $50.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;Binkley, Christina|[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303365804576429730284498872]| "How Can Jeans Cost $300?", July 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Since the "Great Recession," the landscape for premium jeans has changed: “Charging $600 for jeans for no reason at all — those days are over,” said You Nguyen, the senior vice president of women’s merchandising and design for Levi Strauss &amp; Company.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;   

The difference between the $300 jeans and the $30 jeans often has to do with the fabric quality, hardware, washes, design details, abrasions, and where they are manufactured. A "fancy" pair of jeans that has been treated with abrasions, extra washes, etc., to break the denim down to achieve a texture has undergone a certain amount of damage to get the 'worn in' feel. In this sense, the expensive jeans may be more delicate than the cheap ones. Jeans brands also try to stand out from season to season by using patented materials, such as rivets and stitching, and by using special washes and distressing methods. These might involve dying, pressing, and even using sandpaper and drills on the raw jeans. These methods can be particularly expensive when done in the U.S., where factories must meet more stringent environmental and labor standards than in many low-cost nations.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;   

To be produced domestically (in the United States), jeans have to be priced at "$200-plus," says Shelda Hartwell-Hale, a vice president at Directives West, an L.A.-based division of fashion consulting firm Doneger Group.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; The profit margins on premium jeans can be substantial. One retail executive says his gross profit margins for private-label jeans, which he makes for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Sears Holdings Corp., and other retailers, are less than 20%, whereas the margins for his own premium lines are 40%-to-50%.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

'''Enculturation''' is the process by which people learn the dynamics of their surrounding [[culture]] and acquire values and norms appropriate or necessary in that culture and worldviews.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"&gt;Grusec, Joan E.; Hastings, Paul D. "Handbook of Socialization: Theory and Research", 2007, Guilford Press; {{ISBN|1-59385-332-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59385-332-7}}; p&amp;nbsp;547.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this process, the influences that limit, direct, or shape the individual (whether deliberately or not) include parents, other adults, and peers. If successful, enculturation results in competence in the language, values, and rituals of the culture.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt;

Enculturation is related to [[socialization]]. In some academic fields, socialization refers to the deliberate shaping of the individual. In others, the word may cover both deliberate and informal enculturation.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt;

[[Conrad Phillip Kottak]] (in ''Window on Humanity'') writes:

{{quote|Enculturation is the process where the culture that is currently established teaches an individual the accepted norms and values of the culture or society where the individual lives. The individual can become an accepted member and fulfill the needed functions and roles of the group. Most importantly the individual knows and establishes a context of boundaries and accepted behavior that dictates what is acceptable and not acceptable within the framework of that society. It teaches the individual their role within society as well as what is accepted behavior within that society and lifestyle.}}

''Enculturation'' is sometimes referred to as ''[[acculturation]]'', a word recently used to more distinctively refer only to exchanges of cultural features with foreign cultures. Note that this is a recent development, as ''acculturation'' in some literatures has the same meaning as ''enculturation''.

'''''Encyclopaedia Biblica''''' ({{lang-he|אנציקלופדיה מקראית}}) is a scientific encyclopedia of the [[Hebrew Bible]], published in [[Israel]] by [[Bialik Institute]] in the [[Hebrew language]]. The work is scientific, rather than religious, but because of its Jewish background, it only deals with the Hebrew Bible and some [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]], but not with the [[New Testament]], which is considered a part of the Bible in [[Christianity]].

The work on the encyclopedia started in 1942, before the establishment of the state of Israel. Biblical encyclopedias in several languages existed then, but there was no such in work in Hebrew, which by that time was already the living spoken and literary language of the Jewish community in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] (''[[Yishuv]]''). The initiative was started by the archaeologist [[Eleazar Sukenik]], who proposed the idea to the Bialik Institute. The Institute supported it and created a commission of scholars to determine the format of the future work. Among those scholars were [[Naftali Herz Tur-Sinai]], [[Leo Aryeh Mayer]], [[Moshe Zvi Segal]], [[Moshe David Cassuto]], [[Shmuel Yevin]], [[Fishel Lakhover]], [[Benjamin Mazar]] (Maisler) and [[Menachem Solieli]].

Initially, the work was supposed to include 6,700 articles in five volumes. According to the plan, the work on it was supposed to be completed in five years. The first example pages were published in 1947. The [[1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]] and the [[Battle for Jerusalem (1948)|battles for Jerusalem]] disrupted the work on the encyclopedia. Eventually, the first volume was published in 1950, the scope of the work grew to eight volumes, and the final volume was only published in 1982.

The '''Ennead''' or '''Great Ennead''' was a group of nine [[Egyptian pantheon|deities]] in [[Egyptian mythology]] worshiped at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]: the [[sun god]] [[Atum]]; his children [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and [[Tefnut]]; their children [[Geb]] and [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]]; and their children [[Osiris]], [[Isis]], [[Seth (mythology)|Seth]], and [[Nephthys]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/937102309|title=Gods and men in Egypt : 3000 BCE to 395 CE|last=Dunand|first=Françoise|last2=Zivie-Coche|first2=Christiane|authorlink=Françoise Dunand|location=Ithaca, NY|year=2004|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801488532|oclc=937102309}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ennead sometimes includes the son of Osiris and Isis, [[Horus]]. It rose to importance in [[Dynasty V|Dynasties V]] and [[Dynasty VI|VI]] and remained prominent in Egypt into its [[Ptolemaic Egypt|occupation]] by the [[ancient Macedonia|Macedonian]] [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] established by [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[diadochi|successor]] in the area, [[Ptolemy I]].

The Great Ennead was only one of several such groupings of nine deities in ancient Egypt and its claims to preeminence by its Heliopolitan priests were not respected throughout Egypt.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creation Accounts in the Ancient Near East|last=Clifford|first=Richard|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=99-116}}&lt;/ref&gt; As close as [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] (also within modern [[Cairo]]), the priests of [[Ptah]] celebrated him as superior to the Nine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to Memphis having its own creation myth, the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]]/Hermopolitan centered around physical creation and 8 primordial gods was another creation story that existed at the same time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ennead is a borrowing via [[Latin]] of the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] name ''Enneás'' ({{lang|grc|Ἐννεάς}}), meaning "the Nine".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=ennead, ''n.'' |title=Oxford English Dictionary |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |contribution-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/62478 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was a [[calque]] of the Egyptian name, written ''{{lang|egy|Psḏt}}'' and also meaning "the Nine". Its original pronunciation is uncertain, since hieroglyphs do not record vowels. [[Egyptologist]]s conventionally transcribe it as ''Pesedjet''.

The [[ancient Egyptians]] created several enneads as their [[unification of Egypt|unification]] under [[Dynasty I]] brought numerous local cults into contact with one another. The ancient Egyptian mythology often had many different explanations for the same phenomenon. This concept is especially unique because no single story was more accurate than another, but rather the truth was a mix of them all&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The [[Pyramid Texts]] of [[Dynasty V|Dynasties V]] and [[Dynasty VI|VI]] mention the "Great Ennead", the "Lesser Ennead", the "Dual Ennead", and the "Seven Enneads". Some [[pharaoh]]s established enneads that [[apotheosis|incorporated themselves as gods]]. The most notable case is [[Seti I]] of [[Dynasty XIX]], whose temple at [[Redesiyah]] celebrated an ennead of six major gods and three deified forms of himself. In the [[Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days]],&lt;ref&gt;Papyrus Cairo 86637.&lt;/ref&gt; the ennead mentioned may reference the [[Pleiades]].{{sfnp|Jetsu &amp; al.|2015}}

The most important was the "Great" or "Heliopolitan Ennead" of Awanu ({{lang-egy|I͗wnw}}), known under the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Greeks]] and [[Roman Egypt|Romans]] as [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]. It celebrated the family of the [[sun god]] [[Atum]] (sometimes referred to as Atum-[[Atum-re|Re]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) and thrived from the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] to the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic period]].

Its development remains uncertain, although it appears to have first appeared when [[Ra (god)|Ra]]'s cult—supreme under [[Dynasty V]]—declined in importance under [[Dynasty VI]]. [[Egyptologist]]s have traditionally theorized that the Heliopolitan priesthood established it to establish the preeminence of Atum over the others, incorporating some major gods in lesser positions and omitting others entirely. The most prominent of such deities was [[Osiris]], [[vegetation deity|god of vegetation]] and the [[Egyptian netherworld|afterlife]], who was incorporated into the Ennead as Atum's great-grandson. However, in the 20th century, some Egyptologists{{Who|date=December 2009}} question the whole scenario. After the Great Ennead was well established, the cult of Ra—[[syncretization|identified with]] Atum—recovered much of its importance until superseded by the cult of [[Horus (god)|Horus]]. The two were then combined as Ra–Horus of the Horizons.

{{anchor|Legend|Legends|Myth}}

==Myths==
According to the [[creation story]] of the Heliopolitan priests, the world originally consisted of the primordial waters of precreation personified as [[Naunet|Nun]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From it arose a mound on the First Occasion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Upon the mound sat the self-begotten god [[Atum]], who was equated with the [[sun god]] [[Ra (god)|Ra]]. [[Atum]] evolved from Nun through self-creation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Atum either [[spitting|spat]] or [[masturbation|masturbated]], producing [[Air (classical element)|air]] personified as [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and [[humidity|moisture]] personified as [[Tefnut]]. The siblings Shu and Tefnut mated to produce the earth personified as [[Geb]] and the nighttime sky personified as [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]].

Geb and Nut were the parents of [[Osiris (god)|Osiris]] and [[Isis (goddess)|Isis]] and of [[Set (god)|Set]] and [[Nephthys]], who became respective couples in turn. Osiris and Isis represent fertility and order, while Set and Nephthys represent chaos to balance out Osiris and Isis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Horus]], the son of Osiris and Isis, is often included in this creation tradition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to the duality of Ancient Egyptian myths, this is only one of [[Ancient Egyptian creation myths|many creation stories]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Egyptians believed no specific myth was more correct than the other, rather that some combination of these myths was correct.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This creation story, the Heliopolitan tradition, is one of physiological creation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The other major creation traditions are the [[Memphite Theology|Memphite]] Tradition and Hermopolitian/[[Ogdoad creation myth|Ogdoad]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Ethnogenesis''' (from [[Greek Language|Greek]] ''ethnos'' {{lang|grc|ἔθνος}}, "group of people, [[nation]]", and ''genesis'' {{lang|grc|γένεσις}}, "beginning, coming into being"; plural '''ethnogeneses''') is "the formation and development of an ethnic group."&lt;ref&gt;According to ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'' [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethnogenesis].&lt;/ref&gt; This can originate through a process of self-identification as well as come about as the result of outside identification.

The term is a mid-20th century neologism, refers to the observable phenomenon of emergence of new social groups that are identified as having a cohesive identity, i.e. an "ethnic group" in anthropological terms. Relevant sciences do not only observe this phenomenon but search for explanation of its causes. The term ''ethnogeny'' is also used as a variant of ''ethnogenesis''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/39846744/Ethnogesesis.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1527883691&amp;Signature=DnTxPmqi06w8%2BLfDbc2qeyg409E%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DEthnogenesis_A_Contested_Model_of_Early.pdf Andrew Gillett, "Ethnogenesis: A Contested Model of Early Medieval Europe", ''History Compass'' 4/2 (2006): 241–260 p. 244.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passive or active ethnogenesis==
Ethnogenesis can occur passively, in the accumulation of markers of group identity forged through interaction with the physical environment, cultural and religious divisions between sections of a society, migrations and other processes, for which ethnic subdivision is an unintended outcome. It can occur actively, as persons deliberately and directly 'engineer' separate identities to attempt to solve a political problem – the preservation or imposition of certain cultural values, power relations, etc.  Since the late eighteenth century, such attempts have often been related to [[language]] revival or creation of a new language, in what eventually becomes a "[[national literature]]".

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, societies challenged by the obsolescence of those [[narrative]]s which previously afforded them coherence have fallen back on ethnic or racial narratives as a means of maintaining or reaffirming their collective identity, or ''polis''.&lt;ref&gt;Geary, Patrick J. ''The Myth of Nations: The Medieval Origins of Europe.'' Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inclusive or exclusive nationalism ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

Ethnogenesis can be promoted to include or exclude any ethnic minority living within a certain country. In [[France]], the integrationalist policy of the [[French Republic]] was inclusive; their laws stated all persons born or legally residing in France proper (including overseas departments and territories) were "Frenchmen".  The law did not make any ethnic distinctions nor racial categories in between the "French" people. All people in France were Frenchmen and became citizens of the French Republic as far the country's law was concerned.

==Language revival==
Language has been a critical asset for authenticating ethnic identities.  The process of reviving an antique ethnic identity often poses an immediate language challenge, as obsolescent languages  lack expressions for contemporary experiences.  In Europe in the 1990s, examples of proponents of ethnic revivals were from [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] fringes in [[Wales]] and nationalists in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]].  Activists' attempts since the 1970s to revive the [[Occitan language]] in [[Southern France]] are a similar example.

Similarly, in the 19th century, the [[Fennoman]] [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] aimed to raise the [[Finnish language]] from peasant-status to the position of an official national language, which had been only [[Swedish language|Swedish]] for some time.  The Fennoman also founded the [[Finnish Party]] to pursue their nationalist aims. The publication in 1835 of the Finnish [[national epic]], ''[[Kalevala]]'', was a founding stone of Finnish nationalism and ethnogenesis.  Finnish was recognized as the [[official language]] of Finland only in 1892.  Fennomans were opposed by the [[Svecomans]], headed by [[Axel Olof Freudenthal]] (1836–1911).  He supported continuing the use of [[Swedish language|Swedish]] as the official language; it had been a minority language used by the educated elite in government and administration. In line with contemporary [[scientific racism]] theories, Freudenthal believed that Finland had two "[[race (historical definition)|races]]", one speaking Swedish and the other Finnish. The Svecomans claimed that the Swedish "Germanic race" was superior to the majority Finnish people. In [[Ireland]], revival of the [[Irish language]] was part of the reclaiming of [[Irish people|Irish]] identity in the republic.

Language has been an important and divisive political force in [[Belgium]] between the Dutch and Germanic [[Flemings]] and Franco-Celtic [[Walloons]] since the kingdom was created in 1831. [[Switzerland]] is divided among Alemannic [[ethnic German|German-speaking]] or ''[[Swiss German|Deutschschweizer]]'' against the [[French Swiss|French-speaking]] ''Romands'' or Arpitians, and the [[Italian language|Italian]]/[[Lombard language|Lombard]] and [[Romansch language|Romansh]]-speaking minorities in the south and east.

In [[Italy]], there were ethnological and linguistic differences between regional groups, from the [[Lombardy|Lombardians]] of the North to the [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilians]] of the south.  Mountainous terrain had allowed the development of relatively isolated communities and numerous dialects and languages before unification in the 19th century.

==Religion==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2007}}
The set of cultural markers that accompanies each of the major [[religion]]s may become a component of distinct ethnic identities, but they almost never exist in isolation.  Ethnic definitions are subject to change over time, both within and outside groups. For example, 19th-century Europeans classified Jews and Arabs as one 'ethnic' bloc, the [[Semitic people|Semites]] or [[Hamitic|Hamites]]. Later, the term Hamites came to be associated with [[Sub-Saharan African]]s instead.

Christian, Jewish, Hindu and Muslim followers have historically been aligned with ethnicities (and later nations) speaking different languages and having different cultures that arise on the basis of the languages that followers of each religion historically favoured:{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} ([[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Sanskrit Language|Sanskrit]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], respectively). The sources of religious differentiation are contested among [[sociology of religion|sociologists]] and among [[anthropology of religion|anthropologists]], as much as between the faith groups themselves.

The line between a well-defined religious [[sect]] and a discrete ethnicity cannot always be sharply defined. Sects that most observers would accept as constituting a separate ethnicity usually have, as a minimum, a firm set of rules related to maintenance of [[endogamy]], censuring those who 'marry out' or who fail to raise their children in the proper faith. Examples might include the [[Amish]], [[Druze]], [[Mormons]], [[Sikh]]s, [[Yazidi]] and [[Zoroastrians]]&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;[[#Harrison|Harrison]], p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Geographical factors can lead to both cultural and [[Genetics|genetic]] isolation from larger human societies.  Groups which settle remote habitats and intermarry over generations will acquire distinctive cultural and genetic traits, evolving from cultural continuity and through interaction with their unique environmental circumstances.  Ethnogenesis in these circumstances typically results in an identity that is less value-laden than one forged in contradistinction to competing populations.  Particularly in [[pastoral]] mountain peoples, social organization tends to hinge primarily on familial identification, not a wider [[collective identity]].

== Specific cases ==

===Ancient Greeks===
[[Anthony D. Smith]] notes that in general there is a lack of evidence which hampers the assessement of existence of nations or nationalisms in antiquity. The two cases where more evidence exists are those of ancient Greece and Israel. In Ancient Greece a cultural rather than political unity is observed. Yet, there were ethnic divisions within the wider Hellenic ethnic community, mainly the divisions between Ionians, Aeolians, Boeotians and Dorians. These groups were further divided into   city-states. Smith postulates that there is no more than a semblance of nationalism in ancient Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.gr/books?hl=el&amp;lr=&amp;id=bEAJbHBlXR8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=ancient+greek+national+identity&amp;ots=fMkUNma1Fm&amp;sig=t3tg_wUoqqk70ONPdh13NuuwVZs&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Greece&amp;f=false Anthony D. Smith, National Identity, University of Nevada Press, 1991, pp  47, 48]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan M. Hall]]'s work “Ethnic Identity in Greek Antiquity” (1997), was acclaimed as the first full-length modern study on Ancient Greek ethnicity. According to Hall, Ancient Greek ethnic identity was much based on kinship, descent and genealogy, which was reflected in elaborate genealogy myths. On his view, genealogy is the most fundamental way any population defines itself as an ethnic group. There was a change in the way Greeks constructed their ethnic identity in the Persian Wars period (first half of  5th c BC). Before that (archaic period) Greeks tended to attach themselves to one another by a process of genealogical assimilation. After the Persian invasion, they tended to define themselves against the enemy they perceived as the barbarian “other”. An indication of this disposition is the Athenians' speech to their allies in 480 BC, mentioning that all Hellenes are bound with the ''homaimon'' (“same blood”), ''homoglosson'' (same language) and common religious practices. Hall believes that Hellenic identity was clearly envisaged in the 6th c. BC as being ethnic in character, cultural forms of identification emerged in the 5th century, and there is evidence that by the 4th century this identity was conceived more in cultural terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2004/2004-04-26.html Jonathan M. Hall, Hellenicity: Between Ethnicity and Culture.   University of Chicago Press, 2002.  Pp. 312.   Reviewed by Kathryn Lomas, Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2004.04.26]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goths ===
Herwig Wolfram offers "a radically new explanation of the circumstances under which the [[Goths]] were settled in [[Gaul]], [[Hispania|Spain]] and [[Italy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Thomas J. Dunlap, tr.''History of the Goths'' (1979, 1988) Preface, p. x&lt;/ref&gt; Since "they dissolved at their downfall into a myth accessible to everyone" at the head of a long history of attempts to lay claim to a "Gothic" tradition, the ethnogenesis by which disparate bands came to self-identify as "Goths" is of wide interest and application. The problem is in extracting a [[ethnohistory|historical ethnography]] from sources that are resolutely Latin and Roman-oriented.

=== American Indian North American Southwest ===
With the arrival of the Spanish in southwestern North America, the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Jumano]] cultural sphere underwent social changes partly in reaction, which spurred their ethnogenesis, Clayton Anderson has observed.&lt;ref&gt;See Clayton Anderson, ''The Indian Southwest, 1580-1830: Ethnogenesis and Reinvention'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press) 1999; a broader scope is included in the articles in  Jonathan D. Hill (ed.), ''History, Power, and Identity: Ethnogenesis in the Americas, 1492-1992'', (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press) 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnogenesis in the [[Texas Plains]] and along the coast took two forms: a disadvantaged group identified with a stronger group and became absorbed into it, on the one hand, and on the other hand, cultural institutions were modified and in a sense reinvented. The 17th-century Jumano disintegration, a collapse in part by the widespread deaths from introduced diseases, was followed by their reintegration as [[Kiowa]], Nancy Hickerson has argued.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Parrott Hickerson, ''The Jumanos: Hunters and Traders of the South Plains'' (University of Texas Press) 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exterior stresses that produced ethnogenetic shifts preceded the arrival of the Spanish and their horse culture: recurring cycles of drought had previously forced non-kin to band together or to disband and mobilize. Intertribal hostilities forced weaker groups to associate with stronger ones.

=== Southeastern North American Indians===
From 1539 to 1543, a Spanish expedition led by [[Hernando de Soto]] departed [[Cuba]] for [[Florida]] and the [[American Southeast]].  Although asked to practice restraint, Soto led 600 men on a violent rampage through present-day Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and East Texas. Frustrated with not finding gold or silver in the areas suspected to contain such valuable materials, they destroyed villages and decimated native populations. Despite his death in 1542, Soto's men continued their expedition until 1543 when about half of their original force reached Mexico. Their actions introduced European diseases that further weakened native populations.  The population collapse forced natives to relocate from their cities into the countryside, where smaller villages and new political structures developed, replacing the older chiefdom models of tribal governance. By 1700, the major tribal settlements Soto and his men had encountered were no more.  Smaller tribes began to form loose confederations of smaller, more autonomous villages. From that blending of many tribes, ethnogenesis led to the emergence of new ethnic groups and identities for the consolidated natives who had managed to survive the invasion of European people, animals, and diseases.  After 1700, most North American Indian "tribes" were relatively new composite groups formed by these refugees who were trying to cope with massive epidemics and violence brought by the Europeans who were exploring the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Alan|title=American Colonies:  The Settling of North America|date=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-200210-0|pages=72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North American Aboriginals in the Canadian West ===
The bringing of disease by the Europeans redistributed the indigenous communities and this caused a lot of war, disagreements (since they were going into each other's land and sacred areas), and a rise in mortality rates. Some Aboriginal groups were destroyed while some began to band together and create new Aboriginal groups within these areas of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/840250989|title=Clearing the Plains : disease, politics of starvation, and the loss of Aboriginal life|last=1961-|first=Daschuk, James W. (James William),|isbn=9780889772960|location=Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada|oclc=840250989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creation of Moldovan identity ===
The separate [[Moldovans|Moldovan]] ethnic identification was promoted under Soviet rule when the Soviet Union set up an autonomous [[Moldavian ASSR|Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1924. It was set apart from the [[Ukrainian SSR]] on part of the territory between the [[Dniester]] and [[Southern Bug]] rivers ([[Transnistria]]). The scholar Charles King concluded&lt;ref&gt;Charles King, ''The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture'', Hoover Institution Press, 2000:54.&lt;/ref&gt; that this action was in part a prop to Soviet propaganda and help for a potential communist revolution in Romania. At first, a Moldovan ethnicity supported territorial claims to the then-Romanian territories of [[Bessarabia]] and [[Northern Bukovina]]. The claims were based on the fact that the territory of eastern Bessarabia with Chisinau had belonged to the Russian Empire between 1812 and 1918. After having been for 500 years part of the Romanian Principality of Moldova, Russia was awarded the East of Moldova as a recompensation for its losses during the Napoleonic Wars: that was the beginning of the 100 years Russian history in East Moldova. After the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum|Soviet occupation of the two territories in 1940]], potential reunification claims were offset by the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. At the establishment of the Moldaivan ASSR, Chișinău was named its capital, a role which it continued to play after the formation of the [[Moldavian SSR]] in 1940.

The recognition of [[Moldovans]] as a separate ethnicity, distinct from [[Romanians]], remains today a controversial subject. On one side, the Moldovan Parliament adopted in 2003 "The Concept on National Policy of the Republic of Moldova", which states that Moldovans and Romanians are two distinct peoples and speak two different languages, Romanians form an ethnic minority in Moldova, and the Republic of Moldova is the legitimate successor to the Principality of Moldavia. However, Moldovans are recognized as a distinct ethnic group only by former Soviet states.

Moreover, in Romania, people from Wallachia and Transylvania call the Romanians inhabiting western Moldavia, now part of Romania, as Moldovans. People in Romanian Moldova call themselves Moldovans, as subethnic denomination, and Romanians, as ethnic denomination (like Kentish and English for English people living in Kent). Romanians from Romania call the Romanians of the Republic of Moldova Bessarabians, as identification inside the subethnic group, Moldovans as subethnic group and Romanians as ethnic group. The subethnic groups referred to here are historically connected to independent Principalities. The Principality of Moldavia/Moldova founded in 1349 had various extensions between 1349 and 1859 and comprised Bucovina and Bessarabia as regional subdivisions. That way, Romanians of southern Bukovina (today part of Romania and formerly part of the historical Moldova) are called Bukovinans, Moldovans and Romanians.

In the [[2004 Moldovan Census]], of the 3,383,332 people living in Moldova, 16.5% (558,508) chose Romanian as their mother tongue, and 60% chose Moldovan. While 40% of all [[urban area|urban]] Romanian/Moldovan speakers indicated Romanian as their mother tongue, in the countryside, barely one out of seven Romanian/Moldovan speakers indicated Romanian as his mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;National Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova: [http://www.statistica.md/recensamint.php?lang=ro Census 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311020813/http://www.statistica.md/recensamint.php?lang=ro |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical scholarship==
Within the historical profession, the term "ethnogenesis" has been borrowed as a [[neologism]] to explain the origins and evolution of so-called [[barbarian]] ethnic cultures,&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Pohl]]. "Aux origines d'une Europe ethnique. Transformations d'identites entre Antiquite et Moyen Age". ''Annales HSS'' 60 (2005): 183-208, and Pohl, "Conceptions of Ethnicity in Early Medieval Studies" ''Debating the Middle Ages: Issues and Readings'', ed. Lester K. Little and Barbara H. Rosenwein, (Blackwell), 1998, pp 13-24.([http://www.kroraina.com/bulgar/pohl_etnicity.html  On-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt; stripped of its metaphoric connotations drawn from biology, of "natural" birth and growth. That view is closely associated with the Austrian historian [[Herwig Wolfram]] and his followers, who argued that such ethnicity was not a matter of genuine genetic descent ("tribes").

Rather, using Reinhard Wenskus' term ''Traditionskerne'' ("nuclei of tradition"),&lt;ref&gt;Wenskus' comparative study of German ethnogeneses is ''Stammesbildung und Verfassung'' (Cologne and Graz) 1961&lt;/ref&gt; ethnogenesis arose from small groups of aristocratic warriors carrying ethnic traditions from place to place and generation to generation. Followers would coalesce or disband around these nuclei of tradition; ethnicities were available to those who wanted to participate in them with no requirement of being born into a "tribe". Thus, questions of race and place of origin became secondary.

Proponents of ethnogenesis may claim it is the only alternative to the sort of [[ethnocentric]] and [[historiography and nationalism|nationalist scholarship]] that is commonly seen in disputes over the origins of many ancient peoples such as the [[Franks]], [[Goths]], and [[Huns]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kulikowski]] (2006). ''Rome's Gothic Wars''. Cambridge University Press. Page 53&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been used as an alternative to the Near East's "race history" that had supported [[Phoenicianism]] and claims to the antiquity of the variously called [[Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac people]]s.

'''Event videography''' is a [[video production]], the art of capturing social and special events onto video by a [[videographer]]. The term is used to describe the [[videography]] of any event, aside from weddings and [[wedding videography]].

==History==
Event videography is an offshoot of wedding videography and encompasses the video documentation of social functions, such as [[First Communion]]s, anniversaries, dance recitals, bar mitzvahs, color guard contests, [[prom]]s, concerts, etc.

Event videography started shortly after the introduction of consumer-based video cameras, or [[camcorders]], in the late 1970s, as videographers, who had businesses documenting weddings, began to look for other [[Market (economics)|market]]s to offer their services.

==Event videography today==
The art of event videography is somewhat similar today as it was back when the camcorder was first introduced. The main differences lie in the improved video camera technology and equipment. Advances in [[High-definition video|high definition]] technology are being applied to event videography.

A '''flower seller''', normally a woman, traditionally sells flowers on the street. Often the flowers are carried, in a basket for example. The subject matter has been a favorite of artists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Toulouse-Lautrec]],

The 1920s series of British ''[[Squibs (1921 film)|Squibs]]'' films were constructed around the adventures of a [[London]] flower girl played by [[Betty Balfour]].

[[File:Igualtat de sexes.svg|thumb|upright|A generic symbol for gender equality]]
'''Gender equality''', also known as '''sexual equality''', is the state of equal ease of access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender, including economic participation and decision-making; and the state of valuing different behaviors, aspirations and needs equally, regardless of gender.

{{Quote|text=Gender equality, equality between men and women, entails the concept that all human beings, both men and women, are free to develop their personal abilities and make choices without the limitations set by stereotypes, rigid gender roles and prejudices. Gender equality means that the different behaviour, aspirations and needs of women and men are considered, valued and favoured equally. It does not mean that women and men have to become the same, but that their rights, responsibilities and opportunities will not depend on whether they are born male or female. Gender equity means fairness of treatment for women and men, according to their respective needs. This may include equal treatment or treatment that is different but which is considered equivalent in terms of rights, benefits, obligations and opportunities.|sign=ABC Of Women Worker's Rights And Gender Equality|source=ILO, 2000. p. 48.}}

Gender equality is the goal, while gender neutrality and gender equity are practices and ways of thinking that help in achieving the goal. Gender parity, which is used to measure gender balance in a given situation, can aid in achieving gender equality but is not the goal in and of itself. Gender equality is more than equal representation, it is strongly tied to [[women's rights]], and often requires policy changes. As of 2017, the global movement for gender equality has not incorporated the proposition of [[Third gender|genders besides women and men]], or [[Gender identity|gender identities]] outside of the [[gender binary]].

[[UNICEF]] says gender equality "means that women and men, and girls and boys, enjoy the same rights, resources, opportunities and protections. It does not require that girls and boys, or women and men, be the same, or that they be treated exactly alike."&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Overarching_2Pager_Web.pdf|title=Promoting Gender Equality: An Equity-based Approach to Programming|first=Roger|date=2011|website=Operational Guidance Overview in Brief|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=2011-01-28|author=LeMoyne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a global scale, achieving gender equality also requires eliminating harmful practices against women and girls, including [[sex trafficking]], [[femicide]], [[wartime sexual violence]], and other [[Violence against women|oppression tactics]]. [[UNFPA]] stated that, "despite many international agreements affirming their human rights, women are still much more likely than men to be poor and illiterate. They have less access to property ownership, credit, training and employment. They are far less likely than men to be politically active and far more likely to be victims of domestic violence."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender-equality|title=Gender equality|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Population Fund|publisher=UNFPA|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, gender equality is the fifth of seventeen [[Sustainable Development Goals|sustainable development goals]] of the [[United Nations]]. [[Gender inequality]] is measured annually by the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s [[Human Development Report]]s.

== History ==
[[Christine de Pizan]], an early advocate for gender equality, states in her 1405 book ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]'' that the oppression of women is founded on irrational prejudice, pointing out numerous advances in society probably created by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Real Wealth of Nations: Creating a Caring Economics|author=Riane Eisler|authorlink=Riane Eisler|year=2007|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shakers]], an evangelical group, which practiced segregation of the sexes and strict [[celibacy]], were early practitioners of gender equality. They branched off from a [[Quaker]] community in the north-west of England before emigrating to America in 1774. In America, the head of the Shakers' central ministry in 1788, Joseph Meacham, had a revelation that the sexes should be equal. He then brought [[Lucy Wright]] into the ministry as his female counterpart, and together they restructured the society to balance the rights of the sexes. Meacham and Wright established leadership teams where each elder, who dealt with the men's spiritual welfare, was partnered with an eldress, who did the same for women. Each deacon was partnered with a deaconess. Men had oversight of men; women had oversight of women. Women lived with women; men lived with men. In Shaker society, a woman did not have to be controlled or owned by any man. After Meacham's death in 1796, Wright became the head of the Shaker ministry until her death in 1821.

Shakers maintained the same pattern of gender-balanced leadership for more than 200 years. They also promoted equality by working together with other women's rights advocates. In 1859, Shaker Elder Frederick Evans stated their beliefs forcefully, writing that Shakers were "the first to disenthrall woman from the condition of vassalage to which all other religious systems (more or less) consign her, and to secure to her those just and equal rights with man that, by her similarity to him in organization and faculties, both God and nature would seem to demand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frederick William |last=Evans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fg2bS2pDUVMC&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Shakers: Compendium of the Origin, History, Principles, Rules and Regulations, Government, and Doctrines of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing |place=New York |publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Co. |year=1859 |page=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans and his counterpart, Eldress Antoinette Doolittle, joined women's rights advocates on speakers' platforms throughout the northeastern U.S. in the 1870s. A visitor to the Shakers wrote in 1875:
{{Quote|Each sex works in its own appropriate sphere of action, there being a proper subordination, deference and respect of the female to the male in his order, {{em|and of the male to the female in her order}} [emphasis added], so that in any of these communities the zealous advocates of "women’s rights" may here find a practical realization of their ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Glendyne R. Wergland, ''Sisters in the Faith: Shaker Women and Equality of the Sexes'' (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Shakers were more than a radical religious sect on the fringes of American society; they put equality of the sexes into practice. It has been argued that they demonstrated that gender equality was achievable and how to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy R. Benningfield, Appeal of the Sisterhood: The Shakers and the Woman's Rights Movement (University of Kentucky Lexington doctoral dissertation, 2004), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In wider society, the movement towards gender equality began with the [[suffragette|suffrage movement]] in Western cultures in the late-19th century, which sought to allow women to vote and hold elected office. This period also witnessed significant changes to [[women's property rights]], particularly in relation to their marital status. (See for example, [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]].)

===Post-war era===

{{Further|Timeline of women's legal rights (other than voting)}}
Since [[World War II]], the [[women's liberation]] movement and [[feminism]] have created a general movement towards recognition of [[women's rights]]. The [[United Nations]] and other international agencies have adopted several conventions which promote gender equality. These conventions have not been uniformly adopted by all countries, and include:
* The [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] was adopted in 1960, and came into force in 1962 and 1968.
* The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW) was adopted in 1979 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. It has been described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women, which came into force on 3 September 1981.
* The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], a [[human rights]] declaration adopted by consensus at the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] on 25 June 1993 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. Women's rights are addressed at para 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees | author-link = United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees | title = Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action | url = http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=topic&amp;tocid=459d17822&amp;toid=459b17a82&amp;docid=3ae6b39ec&amp;skip=O | publisher = [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] | accessdate = 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1993.
* In 1994, the twenty-year ''Cairo Programme of Action'' was adopted at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) in [[Cairo]]. This [[Non-binding resolution|non binding]] programme-of-action asserted that governments have a responsibility to meet individuals' reproductive needs, rather than demographic targets. As such, it called for [[family planning]], [[reproductive rights]] services, and strategies to promote gender equality and stop violence against women.
* Also in 1994, in the Americas, the [http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women], known as the ''Convention of Belém do Pará'', called for the end of violence and discrimination against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Organization of American States | author-link = Organization of American States | title = Follow-up Mechanism to the Belém do Pará Convention (MESECVI): About the Belém do Pará Convention | publisher = [[Organization of American States]] | url = http://www.oas.org/en/mesecvi/convention.asp | accessdate = 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At the end of the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]], the UN adopted the [[Beijing Declaration]] on 15 September 1995 - a [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|resolution]] adopted to promulgate a set of principles concerning gender equality.
* The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325]] (UNSRC 1325), which was adopted on 31 October 2000, deals with the rights and protection of women and girls during and after [[armed conflict]]s.
* The [[Maputo Protocol]] guarantees comprehensive rights to women, including the right to take part in the political process, to social and political equality with men, to control their [[reproductive health]], and an end to [[female genital cutting|female genital mutilation]]. It was adopted by the [[African Union]] in the form of a protocol to the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] and came into force in 2005.
* The EU [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] ''Directive 2002/73/EC - equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions'' states that: "Harassment and sexual harassment within the meaning of this Directive shall be deemed to be discrimination on the grounds of sex and therefore prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1976L0207:20021005:EN:PDF|title=Directive 2002/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of European Communities|last=|first=|date=9 February 1976|publisher=EUR-Lex Access to European Union law|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Convention of Belém do Pará and the Istanbul Convention: a response to violence against women worldwide | url = https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = [[Organization of American States]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Permanent Mission of France to the United Nations]] and Permanent Mission of Argentina to the United Nations | date = March 2014 }} CSW58 side event flyer 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; came into force in 2014.
* The [[Council of Europe]]'s ''Gender Equality Strategy 2014-2017'', which has five strategic objectives:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=2105977&amp;Site=COE&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383|title=Committee of Ministers - Gender Equality Commission (GEC) - Gender Equality Strategy 2014-2017 [1183 meeting]|author=Council of Europe, Committee of Ministers, CM document (CM)|website=Wcd.coe.int|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Combating [[gender stereotypes]] and sexism
:*Preventing and combating [[violence against women]]
:*Guaranteeing Equal Access of Women to Justice
:*Achieving balanced participation of women and men in political and public decision-making
:*Achieving [[Gender mainstreaming|Gender Mainstreaming]] in all policies and measures

Such [[legislation]] and [[affirmative action]] policies have been critical to bringing changes in societal attitudes. A 2015 Pew Research Center survey of citizens in 38 countries found that majorities in 37 of those 38 countries said that gender equality is at least "somewhat important," and a global median of 65% believe it is "very important" that women have the same rights as men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/08/strong-global-support-for-gender-equality-especially-among-women/|title=Strong global support for gender equality, especially among women|last=Zainulbhai|first=Hani|date=2016-03-08|website=Pew Research|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most occupations are now equally available to men and women, in many countries.{{Refn|For example, many countries now permit women to serve in the [[armed forces]], the [[police|police forces]] and to be [[fire fighter]]s – occupations traditionally reserved for men. Although these continue to have a male majority, an increasing number of women are now active, especially in directive fields such as politics, and occupy high positions in business.|group=lower-roman}}

Similarly, men are increasingly working in occupations which in previous generations had been considered [[women's work]], such as [[nursing]], [[Maid|cleaning]] and [[child care]]. In domestic situations, the role of [[Parenting]] or child rearing is more commonly shared or not as widely considered to be an exclusively female role, so that women may be free to pursue a [[career]] after [[childbirth]]. For further information, see [[Shared earning/shared parenting marriage]].

Another manifestation of the change in social attitudes is the [[Married and maiden names#Feminism and preserving one's personal name|non-automatic taking by a woman of her husband's surname on marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29804450|title=Why should women change their names on getting married?|last=Coulombeau|first=Sophie|date=1 November 2014|publisher=BBC|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly contentious issue relating to gender equality is the role of women in [[religious law|religiously orientated societies]].{{Refn|For example, [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam#Contents|the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] declared that women have equal dignity but not equal rights, and this was accepted by many predominantly Muslim countries.|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|In some [[Christianity|Christian churches]], the practice of [[churching of women]] may still have elements of [[ritual purification]] and the [[Ordination of women]] to the priesthood may be restricted or forbidden.|group=lower-roman}} Some Christians or Muslims believe in [[Complementarianism]], a view that holds that men and women have different but complementing roles. This view may be in opposition to the views and goals of gender equality.

In addition, there are also non-Western countries of low religiosity where the contention surrounding gender equality remains. In China, a [[Sex-selective abortion and female infanticide#Cultural preference|cultural preference for a male child]] has resulted in a [[Missing women of Asia|shortfall of women]] in the population. [[Feminism in Japan|The feminist movement in Japan]] has made many strides which resulted in Rethe [[Gender Equality Bureau]], but Japan still remains low in gender equality compared to other industrialized nations.

The notion of gender equality, and of its degree of achievement in a certain country, is very complex because there are countries that have a history of a high level of gender equality in certain areas of life but not in other areas.{{Refn|An example is [[Finland]], which has offered very high opportunities to women in public/professional life but has had a weak legal approach to the issue of [[violence against women]], with the situation in this country having been called a [[paradox]].&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Clarke | first = Kris | title = The paradoxical approach to intimate partner violence in Finland | journal = [[Tokiwa University#Publications|International Perspectives in Victimology]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–19 | doi = 10.5364/ipiv.6.1.19 | date = August 2011 | url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/83438809/paradoxical-approach-intimate-partner-violence-finland | ref = harv | postscript = .| doi-broken-date = 2018-08-27 }} [https://www.academia.edu/992154/The_Paradoxical_Approach_to_Intimate_Partner_Violence_in_Finland Available through academia.edu.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=McKie |first1=Linda |last2=Hearn |first2=Jeff |title=Gender-neutrality and gender equality: comparing and contrasting policy responses to 'domestic violence' in Finland and Scotland |journal=[[Scottish Affairs]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=85–107 |doi=10.3366/scot.2004.0043 |date=August 2004 |ref=harv |postscript=. }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20131021023708/http://www.scottishaffairs.org/backiss/pdfs/sa48/sa48_McKie_and_Hearn.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;"Finland is repeatedly reminded of its widespread problem of violence against women and recommended to take more efficient measures to deal with the situation. International criticism concentrates on the lack of measures to combat violence against women in general and in particular on the lack of a national action plan to combat such violence and on the lack of legislation on domestic violence. (...) Compared to Sweden, Finland has been slower to reform legislation on violence against women. In Sweden, domestic violence was already illegal in 1864, while in Finland such violence was not outlawed until 1970, over a hundred years later. In Sweden the punishment of victims of incest was abolished in 1937 but not until 1971 in Finland.

Not all beliefs relating to gender equality have been popularly adopted. For example, [[topfreedom]], the right to be bare breasted in public, frequently applies only to males and has remained a marginal issue. [[Breastfeeding in public]] is now more commonly tolerated, especially in semi-private places such as restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jordan | first = Tim | title = Social Change (Sociology and society) | publisher = Blackwell|year=2002|isbn=978-0-631-23311-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender biases==
There has been criticism from some feminists towards the political discourse and policies employed in order to achieve the above items of "progress" in gender equality, with critics arguing that these gender equality strategies are superficial, in that they do not seek to challenge social structures of male domination, and only aim at improving the situation of women within the societal framework of subordination of women to men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/966913723|title=Man's dominion : religion and the eclipse of women's rights in world politics|last=Sheila|first=Jeffreys,|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9780415596732|location=|pages=94|oclc=966913723}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that official public policies (such as state policies or international bodies policies) are questionable, as they are applied in a patriarchal context, and are directly or indirectly controlled by agents of a system which is for the most part male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=EU Gender Policy: Trapped in the 'Wollstonecraft Dilemma'?|first=Emanuela|last=Lombardo|date=1 May 2003|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|volume=10|issue=2|pages=159–180|doi=10.1177/1350506803010002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the criticisms of the gender equality policies, in particular, those of the [[European Union]], is that they disproportionately focus on policies integrating women in public life, but do not seek to genuinely address the deep private sphere oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/647686058|title=Multiple meanings of gender equality : a critical frame analysis of gender policies in Europe|last=Lombardo|first=Emanuela|last2=Jalušiè|first2=Vlasta|last3=Maloutas|first3=Maro Pantelidou|last4=Sauer|first4=Birgit|date=|publisher=Central European University Press Budapest|year=2007|isbn=9786155211393|editor-last=Verloo|editor-first=Mike|location=New York|pages=79–108|chapter=III.

A further criticism is that a focus on the situation of women in non-Western countries, while often ignoring the issues that exist in the West, is a form of [[imperialism]] and of reinforcing Western moral superiority; and a way of "othering" of domestic violence, by presenting it as something specific to outsiders - the "violent others" - and not to the allegedly progressive Western cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/sp/article-abstract/20/4/534/1714604/The-Othering-of-Domestic-Violence-The-EU-and|title=The Othering of Domestic Violence: The EU and Cultural Framings of Violence against Women|first1=Celeste|last1=Montoya|first2=Lise|last2=Rolandsen Agustín|date=1 December 2013|journal=Soc Polit|volume=20|issue=4|pages=534–557|via=sp.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1093/sp/jxt020}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics point out that women in Western countries often face similar problems, such as domestic violence and rape, as in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/316143234|title=An introduction to feminist philosophy|last=Alison|first=Stone|date=|publisher=Polity Press|year=2008|isbn=9780745638836|location=|pages=209–211|oclc=316143234}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also cite the fact that women faced de jure legal discrimination until just a few decades ago; for instance, in some Western countries such as Switzerland, Greece, Spain, and France, women obtained equal rights in [[family law]] in the 1980s.{{Refn|In Switzerland in 1985, a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450|title=Switzerland profile - Timeline|date=28 December 2016|website=Bbc.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html|title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology|first=Markus G.

==Efforts to fight inequality==
{{see also|Gender inequality}}
In 2010, the [[European Union]] opened the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE) in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]] to promote gender equality and to fight [[sex discrimination]]. In 2015 the EU published the Gender Action Plan 2016–2020.&lt;ref name="GAP2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=The European Union's new Gender Action Plan 2016–2020: gender equality and women's empowerment in external relations|url=https://www.odi.org/publications/10021-gender-equality-empowerment-eu-external-relations-gap-2016_2020|website=odi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender equality is part of the national curriculum in Great Britain and many other European countries. By presidential decree, the Republic of Kazakhstan created a Strategy for Gender Equality 2006–2016 to chart the subsequent decade of gender equality efforts.&lt;ref name="sgeinkz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategy for Gender Equality in Kazakhstan 2006–2016|url=https://www.ndi.org/files/Kazakhstan-Gender-Strategy-2006-2016.pdf|website=NDI.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personal, Social and Health Education]], [[Religious education|religious studies]] and [[Language acquisition]] curricula tend to address gender equality issues as a very serious topic for discussion and analysis of its effect in society.

A large and growing body of research has shown how gender inequality undermines health and development. To overcome gender inequality the [[United Nations Population Fund]] states that, "Women's empowerment and gender equality requires strategic interventions at all levels of programming and policy-making. These levels include reproductive health, economic empowerment, educational empowerment and political empowerment."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/resources/engaging-men-and-boys-brief-summary-unfpa-experience-and-lessons-learned|title=Engaging Men and Boys: A Brief Summary of UNFPA Experience and Lessons Learned|last=|first=|date=2013|website=UNFPA: United Nations Population Fund|language=en|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNFPA]] says that "research has also demonstrated how working with men and boys as well as women and girls to promote gender equality contributes to achieving health and development outcomes."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{Further|Gender disparities in health}}
Social constructs of [[gender]] (that is, cultural ideals of socially acceptable [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]]) often have a negative effect on health. The World Health Organization cites the example of women not being allowed to travel alone outside the home (to go to the hospital), and women being prevented by cultural norms to ask their husbands to use a condom, in cultures which simultaneously encourage male promiscuity, as social norms that harm [[women's health]]. Teenage boys suffering accidents due to social expectations of impressing their peers through [[risk|risk taking]], and men dying at much higher rate from [[lung cancer]] due to [[smoking]], in cultures which link smoking to masculinity, are cited by the WHO as examples of gender norms negatively affecting [[men's health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender/genderandhealth/en/|title=WHO: World Health Organization|website=Who.int|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization has also stated that there is a strong connection between gender socialization and transmission and lack of adequate management of [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

====Violence against women====
[[File:FGM road sign, Bakau, Gambia, 2005.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Anti-[[FGM]] road sign, Bakau, Gambia, 2005]]
{{Main article|Violence against women}}
[[Violence against women]] is a technical term used to collectively refer to violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women.{{Refn|Forms of violence against women include [[Sexual violence]] (including [[War Rape]], [[Marital rape]], [[Date rape]] by drugs or alcohol, and [[Child sexual abuse]], the latter often in the context of [[Child marriage]]), [[Domestic violence]], [[Forced marriage]], [[Female genital mutilation]], [[Forced prostitution]], [[Sex trafficking]], [[Honor killing]], [[Dowry killing]], [[Acid attacks]], [[Stoning]], [[Flogging]], [[Forced sterilisation]], [[Forced abortion]], violence related to accusations of witchcraft, mistreatment of widows (e.g. widow inheritance). Fighting against violence against women is considered a key issue for achieving gender equality. The Council of Europe adopted the Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention).|group=lower-roman}} This type of violence is gender-based, meaning that the acts of violence are committed against women expressly ''because'' they are women, or as a result of patriarchal gender constructs.{{Refn|The UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] defines violence against women as "any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life" and states that:"violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women|author=|publisher=United Nations General Assembly|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Violence and mistreatment of women in marriage has come to international attention during the past decades. This includes both violence committed inside marriage ([[domestic violence]]) as well as violence related to marriage customs and traditions (such as [[dowry]], [[bride price]], [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]]).

According to some theories, violence against women is often caused by the acceptance of violence by various cultural groups as a means of conflict resolution within intimate relationships. Studies on [[Intimate partner violence]] victimization among ethnic minorities in the United Studies have consistently revealed that immigrants are a high-risk group for intimate violence.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman, Ronet (January 1994).&amp;nbsp;[https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/digitization/145325ncjrs.pdf Violence Against Women: A National Crime Victimization Survey Report]&amp;nbsp;(PDF)(Report).

In countries where gang murders, armed kidnappings, civil unrest, and other similar acts are rare, the vast majority of murdered women are killed by partners/ex-partners.{{Refn|As of 2004–2009, former and current partners were responsible for more than 80% of all cases of [[femicide|murders of women]] in [[Cyprus]], [[France]], and [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/H-Research_Notes/SAS-Research-Note-14.pdf|title=Femicide: A Global Problem|last=|first=|date=February 2012|website=Small Arms Survey|publisher=Research Notes: Armed Violence|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} By contrast, in countries with a high level of organized criminal activity and gang violence, murders of women are more likely to occur in a public sphere, often in a general climate of indifference and impunity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, many countries do not have adequate comprehensive data collection on such murders, aggravating the problem.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In some parts of the world, various forms of violence against women are tolerated and accepted as parts of everyday life.{{Refn|According to UNFPA:&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender/practices.htm|title=Gender equality|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, it is only in more recent decades that domestic violence against women has received significant legal attention. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] acknowledges the long tradition of European countries of ignoring this form of violence.{{Refn|In its [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm explanatory report] at para 219, it states:

In some cultures, acts of violence against women are seen as crimes against the male 'owners' of the woman, such as husband, father or male relatives, rather the woman herself. This leads to practices where men inflict violence upon women in order to get revenge on male members of the women's family.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf|title=Supplement to the Handbook for Legislation on Violence Against Women: Harmful Practices Against Women|last=|first=|date=2012|website=UN Women|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such practices include [[Types of rape#Payback rape|payback rape]], a form of rape specific to certain cultures, particularly the [[Pacific Islands]], which consists of the rape of a female, usually by a group of several males, as revenge for acts committed by members of her family, such as her father or brothers, with the rape being meant to humiliate the father or brothers, as punishment for their prior behavior towards the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://waaiabulletin.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/png_activist_toolkit_16_days_2009_-_iwd_2010.pdf|title=Many Voices One Message: Stop Violence Against Women in PNG|last=|first=|date=2009–2010|website=Activist Toolkit, Amnesty International|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard A. Posner]] writes that "Traditionally, rape was the offense of depriving a father or husband of a valuable asset — his wife's chastity or his daughter's virginity".&lt;ref&gt;''Sex and Reason'', by Richard A. Posner, page 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, rape was seen in many cultures (and is still seen today in some societies) as a crime against the [[Family honor|honor of the family]], rather than against the self-determination of the woman. As a result, victims of rape may face violence, in extreme cases even honor killings, at the hands of their family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml|title=Ethics: Honour crimes |website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895|title=Libya rape victims 'face honour killings'|website=BBC News|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that in male dominated societies, sexual intercourse is imposed on women in a coercive and unequal way, creating a continuum of victimization, where women have few positive sexual experiences.{{Refn|She writes "To know what is wrong with rape, know what is right about sex. If this, in turn, is difficult, the difficulty is as instructive as the difficulty men have in telling the difference when women see one. Perhaps the wrong of rape has proved so difficult to define because the unquestionable starting point has been that rape is defined as distinct from intercourse, while for women it is difficult to distinguish the two under conditions of male dominance."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'', by Catharine A.

The importance of women having the right and possibility to have control over their body, reproduction decisions, and sexuality, and the need for gender equality in order to achieve these goals are recognized as crucial by the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing and the UN [[International Conference on Population and Development]] Program of Action. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that promotion of gender equality is crucial in the fight against [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender/hiv_aids/en/|title=WHO: World Health Organization|website=Who.int|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maternal mortality]] is a major problem in many parts of the world. [[UNFPA]] states that countries have an obligation to protect women's right to health, but many countries do not do that.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/reducing_mm.pdf|title=Reducing Maternal Mortality: The contribution of the right to the highest attainable standard of health|last=Hunt|first=Paul|last2=Mezquita de Bueno|first2=Julia|publisher=University of Essex|year=2010|isbn=|location=United Nations Population Fund|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maternal mortality is considered today not just an issue of development but also an issue of [[human rights]].{{Refn|[[UNFPA]] says that, "since 1990, the world has seen a 45 per cent decline in maternal mortality – an enormous achievement. But in spite of these gains, almost 800 women still die every day from causes related to pregnancy or childbirth. This is about one woman every two minutes."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/maternal-health|title=Maternal health: UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to UNFPA:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

:"Preventable maternal mortality occurs where there is a failure to give effect to the rights of women to health, equality, and non-discrimination. Preventable maternal mortality also often represents a violation of a woman’s right to life."|group=lower-roman}}

The right to reproductive and sexual autonomy is denied to women in many parts of the world, through practices such as [[forced sterilization]], forced/coerced sexual partnering (e.g. [[forced marriage]], [[child marriage]]), criminalization of consensual sexual acts (such as [[sex outside marriage]]), lack of criminalization of [[marital rape]], violence in regard to the choice of partner ([[honor killings]] as punishment for 'inappropriate' relations).{{Refn|Amnesty International’s Secretary General has stated that: "It is unbelievable that in the twenty-first century some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity – even punishable by death."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/sexual-and-reproductive-rights-under-threat-worldwide-2014-03-06|title=Sexual and reproductive rights under threat worldwide|publisher=Amnesty International|date=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} The sexual health of women is often poor in societies where a woman's right to control her sexuality is not recognized.{{Refn|High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Navi Pillay]] has called for full respect and recognition of women's autonomy and sexual and reproductive health rights, stating:

:"Violations of women's human rights are often linked to their sexuality and reproductive role. Women are frequently treated as property, they are sold into marriage, into trafficking, into sexual slavery. Violence against women frequently takes the form of sexual violence. Victims of such violence are often accused of promiscuity and held responsible for their fate, while infertile women are rejected by husbands, families, and communities. In many countries, married women may not refuse to have sexual relations with their husbands, and often have no say in whether they use contraception."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chr.up.ac.za/images/files/news/news_2012/Navi%20Pillay%20Lecture%2015%20May%202012.pdf|title=Valuing Women as Autonomous Beings: Women's sexual and reproductive rights|last=Pillay|first=Navi|date=May 15, 2012|website=University of Pretoria, Centre for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These practices infringe on the right of achieving reproductive and sexual health.|group=lower-roman}}

[[Adolescent]] girls have the highest risk of sexual coercion, sexual ill health, and negative reproductive outcomes. The risks they face are higher than those of boys and men; this increased risk is partly due to gender inequity (different socialization of boys and girls, gender based violence, child marriage) and partly due to biological factors.{{Refn|Females' risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections during unprotected sexual relations is two to four times that of males'.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/resources/giving-special-attention-girls-and-adolescents|title=Giving Special Attention to Girls and Adolescents|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}

=====Family planning and abortion=====

[[Family planning]] is the practice of freely deciding the number of children one has and the intervals between their births, particularly by means of contraception or voluntary sterilization. Abortion is the induced termination of pregnancy. [[Abortion law]]s vary significantly by country. The availability of contraception, sterilization and abortion is dependent on laws, as well as social, cultural and religious norms. Some countries have liberal laws regarding these issues, but in practice it is very difficult to access such services due to doctors, pharmacists and other social and medical workers being [[conscientious objector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/italian-gynaecologists-refuse-abortions-miscarriages|title=Seven in 10 Italian gynaecologists refuse to carry out abortions|first1=Stephanie Kirchgaessner Pamela|last1=Duncan|first2=Alberto|last2=Nardelli|first3=Delphine|last3=Robineau|date=11 March 2016|website=Theguardian.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/doctors-refusal-to-perform-abortions-divides-croatia-02-13-2017|title=Doctors' Refusal to Perform Abortions Divides Croatia |website=Balkan Insight |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family planning is particularly important from a women's rights perspective, as having very many pregnancies, especially in areas where malnutrition is present, can seriously endanger women's health. UNFA writes that "Family planning is central to gender equality and women’s empowerment, and it is a key factor in reducing poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/family-planning|title=Family planning: UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family planning is often opposed by governments who have strong [[natalist]] policies. During the 20th century, such examples have included the aggressive natalist policies from [[communist Romania]] and [[communist Albania]]. State mandated [[forced marriage]] was also practiced by some authoritarian governments as a way to meet population targets: the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]] systematically forced people into marriages, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf |format=PDF|author=Natalae Anderson|title=Documentation Center of Cambodia, ''Memorandum: Charging Forced Marriage as a Crime Against Humanity,''|date=September 22, 2010|website=D.dccam.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the [[one child policy]] of China (1979–2015) included punishments for families with more than one child and [[forced abortion]]s. Some governments have sought to prevent certain ethnic or social groups from reproduction. Such policies were carried out against ethnic minorities in Europe and North America in the 20th century, and more recently in Latin America against the Indigenous population in the 1990s; in [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of a sterilization program put in place by his administration targeting indigenous people (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2148793.stm|title=Mass sterilisation scandal shocks Peru|date=24 July 2002|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Investigation and prosecution of crimes against women and girls====
Human rights organizations have expressed concern about the legal [[impunity]] of perpetrators of crimes against women, with such crimes being often ignored by authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/ImpunityForVAWGlobalConcern.aspx|title=Impunity for violence against women is a global concern|website=Ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case with murders of women in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/ngos/CDDandCMDPDH_forthesession_Mexico_CEDAW52.pdf|format=PDF|title=Femicide and Impunity in Mexico: A context of structural and genearlized violence|website=2.ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2013/4/femicide-in-latin-america|title=Femicide in Latin America|website=Unwomen.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgrs.uchastings.edu/our-work/central-america-femicides-and-gender-based-violence|title=Central America: Femicides and Gender-Based Violence|website=Cgrs.uchastings.edu|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there is impunity in regard to [[domestic violence]].{{Refn|High Commissioner for Human Rights, [[Navi Pillay]], has stated on domestic violence against women: "The reality for most victims, including victims of honor killings, is that state institutions fail them and that most perpetrators of domestic violence can rely on a culture of impunity for the acts they commit – acts which would often be considered as crimes, and be punished as such, if they were committed against strangers."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9869&amp;LangID=E|title=High Commissioner speaks out against domestic violence and "honour killing" on occasion of International Women's Day"|website=Ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}

Women are often, in law or in practice, unable to access legal institutions. UN Women has said that: "Too often, justice institutions, including the police and the courts, deny women justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://progress.unwomen.org/|title=Progress of the World's Women 2015–2016|website=My Favorite News|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, women are denied legal recourse because the state institutions themselves are structured and operate in ways incompatible with genuine justice for women who experience violence.{{Refn|According to Amnesty International, "Women who are victims of gender-related violence often have little recourse because many state agencies are themselves guilty of gender bias and discriminatory practices."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/violence-against-women-information|title=Violence Against Women Information|website=Amnesty International USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}

====Harmful traditional practices====
[[File:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|Anti-dowry poster in [[Bangalore, India]]]]

"Harmful traditional practices" refer to forms of violence which are committed in certain communities often enough to become cultural practice, and accepted for that reason. Young women are the main victims of such acts, although men can be affected.&lt;ref name="NHS Traditional"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbv.scot.nhs.uk/gbv/harmful-traditional-practices|title=National Gender Based Violence &amp; Health Programme|website=Gbv.scot.nhs.uk|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They occur in an environment where women and girls have unequal rights and opportunities.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet23en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Fact Sheet No.23, Harmful Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children|website=Ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These practices include, according to the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]]:&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

{{Quote|[[female genital mutilation]] (FGM); forced feeding of women; early marriage; the various taboos or practices which prevent women from controlling their own fertility; nutritional taboos and traditional birth practices; son preference and its implications for the status of the girl child; female infanticide; early pregnancy; and dowry price}}

Son preference refers to a cultural preference for sons over daughters, and manifests itself through practices such as sex selective abortion; female infanticide; or abandonment, neglect or abuse of girl-children.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

Abuses regarding nutrition are taboos in regard to certain foods, which result in poor nutrition of women, and may endanger their health, especially if pregnant.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

The [[caste system in India]] which leads to [[untouchability]] (the practice of ostracizing a group by segregating them from the mainstream society) often interacts with gender discrimination, leading to a double discrimination faced by [[Dalit]] women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/chrgj-hrw.pdf|format=PDF|title=CASTE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST DALITS OR SO-CALLED UNTOUCHABLES IN INDIA|website=2.ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 survey, 27% of Indians admitted to practicing untouchability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/one-in-four-indians-admit-to-practising-untouchability-biggest-caste-survey/|title=Biggest caste survey: One in four Indians admit to practising untouchability|date=29 November 2014|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional customs regarding birth sometimes endanger the mothers. Births in parts of Africa are often attended by traditional birth attendants (TBAs), who sometimes perform rituals that are dangerous to the health of the mother. In many societies, a difficult labour is believed to be a divine punishment for marital infidelity, and such women face abuse and are pressured to "confess" to the infidelity.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

Tribal traditions can be harmful to males; for instance, the [[Satere-Mawe]] tribe use [[bullet ant]]s as an [[initiation rite]]. Men must wear gloves with hundreds of bullet ants woven in for ten minutes: the ants' stings cause severe pain and paralysis. This experience must be completed twenty times for boys to be considered "warriors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/travel/Holidays/Wildlife/article77936.ece|title=Bitten by the Amazon|last=Backshall|first=Steve|date=6 January 2008|publisher=The Sunday Times|location=London|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other harmful traditional practices include [[marriage by abduction]], ritualized [[sexual slavery]] ([[Devadasi]], [[Trokosi]]), [[breast ironing]] and [[widow inheritance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/T-Anth/Anth-13-0-000-11-Web/Anth-13-2-000-11-Abst-Pdf/Anth-13-2-121-11-720-Wadesango-N/Anth-13-2-121-11-720-Wadesango-N-Tt.pdf|format=PDF|title=Violation of Women's Rights by Harmful Traditional Practices|author1=Newman Wadesango|author2= Symphorosa Rembe|author3=Owence Chabaya|website=Krepublishers.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/elim-disc-viol-girlchild/ExpertPapers/EP.4%20%20%20Raswork.pdf|format=PDF|title=The impact of harmful traditional practices on the girl child|website=Un.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/CEDAW/HarmfulPractices/GenderEmpowermentandDevelopment.pdf|format=PDF|title=Breast Ironing...

[[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]] regard the practice of [[female genital mutilation]] as "a manifestation of deeply entrenched gender inequality. It persists for many reasons. In some societies, for example, it is considered a rite of passage. In others, it is seen as a prerequisite for marriage. In some communities – whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim – the practice may even be attributed to religious beliefs." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/female-genital-mutilation|title=Female genital mutilation: UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 125 million women and girls living today have undergone FGM in the 29 countries where data exist. Of these, about half live in Egypt and Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/unfpa-unicef-joint-programme-female-genital-mutilationcutting-accelerating-change|title=UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: Accelerating Change|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly carried out on girls between infancy and 15 years old.&lt;ref name="NHS Traditional" /&gt;

=====Forced marriage=====
[[File:Girl Summit - 22nd July in London (14498368279).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Poster against child and forced marriage]]
{{Main|Forced marriage}}
Early marriage, child marriage or [[forced marriage]] is prevalent in parts of Asia and Africa. The majority of victims seeking advice are female and aged between 18 and 23.&lt;ref name="NHS Traditional" /&gt; Such marriages can have harmful effects on a girl's education and development, and may expose girls to social isolation or abuse.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58008.html|title=Child marriage|date=22 October 2014|website=UNICEF|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/topic/womens-rights/child-marriage|title=Child Marriage|website=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 UN Resolution on Child, Early and Forced Marriage calls for an end to the practice, and states that "Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a harmful practice that violates abuses, or impairs human rights and is linked to and perpetuates other harmful practices and human rights violations, that these violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls [...]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/events/2014/child_marriage.pdf?ua=1|format=PDF|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly : 69/XX. Child, Early and Forced Marriage|website=Who.int|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a near-universal commitment by governments to end child marriage, "one in three girls in developing countries (excluding China) will probably be married before they are 18."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/end-child-marriage|title=End Child Marriage|website = UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNFPA]] states that, "over 67 million women 20–24 year old in 2010 had been married as girls. Half were in Asia, one-fifth in Africa. In the next decade 14.2 million girls under 18 will be married every year; this translates into 39,000 girls married each day. This will rise to an average of 15.1 million girls a year, starting in 2021 until 2030, if present trends continue."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org2" /&gt;

=====Bride price=====
{{Main|Bride price}}
[[Bride price]] (also called bridewealth or bride token) is money, property, or other form of wealth paid by a groom or his family to the parents of the bride. This custom often leads to women having reduced ability to control their fertility. For instance, in northern Ghana, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control face threats, violence and reprisals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf|format=PDF|title=Women's Fears and Men's Anxieties : The Impact of Family Planning on Gender Relations in Northern Ghana|website=Popcouncil.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom of bride price has been criticized as contributing to the mistreatment of women in marriage, and preventing them from leaving abusive marriages. [[UN Women]] recommended its abolition, and stated that: "Legislation should [...] State that divorce shall not be contingent upon the return of bride price but such provisions shall not be interpreted to limit women’s right to divorce; State that a perpetrator of [[domestic violence]], including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defence to a domestic violence charge."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The custom of bride price can also curtail the free movement of women: if a wife wants to leave her husband, he may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the woman's family; and the woman's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back, making it difficult for women to move out of violent husbands' homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equality Now (2007) Protecting the girl child: Using the law to end child, early and forced marriage and related human rights violations|url=http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf|format=PDF|website=Equalitynow.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lelieveld, M.|date=2011|title=Child protection in the Somali region of Ethiopia.

[[Gender-based price discrimination]] involves companies selling almost identical units of the same product or service at comparatively different prices, as determined by the target market. Studies have found that women pay about $1,400 a year more than men due to gendered discriminatory pricing.

====Gendered arrangements of work and care====
{{Main article|Women's work|Gender role}}
Since the 1950s, social scientists as well as feminists have increasingly criticized gendered arrangements of work and care and the male breadwinner role.

Western countries with a strong emphasis on women fulfilling the role of homemakers, rather than a professional role, include parts of German speaking Europe (i.e. parts of Germany, Austria and Switzerland); as well as the Netherlands and Ireland.{{Refn|In 2011, [[Jose Manuel Barroso]], then president of the [[European Commission]], stated "Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, should look at the example of the northern countries [...] that means removing obstacles for women, older workers, foreigners and low-skilled job-seekers to get into the workforce".&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-persistently-low-birthrate-gets-marginal-boost/a-15325123-0|title=Germany's persistently low birthrate gets marginal boost |date=18 August 2011 |website=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|The Netherlands and Ireland are among the last Western countries to accept women as professionals; despite the Netherlands having an image as progressive on gender issues, women in the Netherlands work less in paid employment than women in other comparable Western countries.

A key issue towards insuring gender equality in the workplace is the respecting of [[maternity rights]] and [[reproductive rights]] of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=a40b96ed-8bf4-4db1-9ceb-71ca2d6fada4 |title=Modern workplaces, maternity rights, and gender equality  |accessdate=2016-04-26 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509134200/http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Modern-Workplaces-Policy-Position-November-2012.pdf |archivedate=2016-05-09 |publisher = Fawcett Society |date = November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different countries have different rules regarding [[maternity leave]], paternity leave and [[parental leave]].{{Refn|In the [[European Union]] (EU) the policies vary significantly by country, but the EU members must abide by the minimum standards of the [[Pregnant Workers Directive]] and [[Parental Leave Directive]].&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/rights/work-life-balance/index_en.htm|title=Professional, private and family life – European Commission|website=Ec.europa.eu|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Another important issue is ensuring that employed women are not ''[[de jure]]'' or ''[[de facto]]'' prevented from having a child.{{Refn|For example, some countries have enacted legislation explicitly outlawing or restricting what they view as abusive clauses in [[employment contract]]s regarding reproductive rights (such as clauses which stipulate that a woman cannot get pregnant during a specified time) rendering such contracts [[void (law)|void]] or [[voidable]].&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160509070119/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/file?uuid=d01c336a-95bd-4b7d-b291-59623c7918be&amp;owner=8318a38b-02db-4343-8ee4-c81474278688]&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} In some countries, employers ask women to sign formal or informal documents stipulating that they will not get pregnant or face legal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite web|title=Law n. 202/2002, Art. 10 (4) and Art. 37|url=http://www.dreptonline.ro/legislatie/legea_egalitatii_sanse_femei.php|website=Romanian Law Online|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women often face severe violations of their reproductive rights at the hands of their employers; and the [[International Labour Organization]] classifies [[forced abortion]] coerced by the employer as [[Exploitation of labour|labour exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@ed_norm/@declaration/documents/publication/wcms_105035.pdf|title=Details of indicators for labour exploitation|website=Ilo.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|Being the victim of a forced abortion compelled by the employer was ruled a ground of obtaining [[political asylum]] in the US.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6729339.stm|title=US asylum rule on forced abortion|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Other abuses include routine [[virginity test]]s of unmarried employed women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/hrw-calls-on-indonesia-to-scrap-virginity-tests-for-female-police/a-18082547|title=HRW calls on Indonesia to scrap 'virginity tests' for female police|website=Dw.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igfm-muenchen.de/tibet/Phayul/2006/TWA-CEDAWReport_Aug2006_form.pdf|format=PDF|title=THE CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN (CEDAW)|website=Igfm-muenchen.de|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Freedom of movement====
[[File:Group of Women Wearing Burkas.jpg|thumb|Women in [[Afghanistan]] wearing [[burqa]]s. Some clothes that women are required to wear, by law or custom, can restrict their movements]]
{{Further|Freedom of movement}}
The degree to which women can participate (in law and in practice) in public life varies by culture and socioeconomic characteristics. [[Seclusion]] of women within the home was a common practice among the [[upper classes]] of many societies, and this still remains the case today in some societies. Before the 20th century it was also common in parts of Southern Europe, such as much of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;''Liberating Women's History:Theoretical and Critical Essays'', edited by Berenice A. Carroll, pp. 161–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's [[freedom of movement]] continues to be legally restricted in some parts of the world. This restriction is often due to [[marriage laws]].{{Refn|For instance, in [[Yemen]], marriage regulations stipulate that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.&lt;ref name="www2.ohchr.org" group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf|title=Yemen's Dark Side: Discrimination and violence against women and girls.|website=2.ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} In some countries, women must legally be accompanied by their male guardians (such as the husband or male relative) when they leave home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/24691034|title=Why can't women drive in Saudi Arabia?|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 June 2015|date = 27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) states at Article 15 (4) that:
{{Quote|4. States Parties shall accord to men and women the same rights with regard to the law relating to the movement of persons and the freedom to choose their residence and domicile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |title=CEDAW 29th Session 30 June to 25 July 2003 |publisher= |accessdate=14 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xc2eRFDv?url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |archivedate=April 1, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to laws, women's freedom of movement is also restricted by social and religious norms.{{Refn|For example, [[purdah]], a religious and social practice of female seclusion prevalent among some Muslim communities in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] as well as upper-caste Hindus in [[North India|Northern India]], such as the [[Rajputs]], which often leads to the minimizing of the movement of women in public spaces and restrictions on their social and professional interactions;&lt;ref name=Papanek group=upper-roman&gt;Papanek, Hanna.

====Girls' access to education====

In many parts of the world, girls' access to education is very restricted. In developing parts of the world women are often denied opportunities for education as girls and women face many obstacles. These include: early and forced marriages; early pregnancy; prejudice based on gender stereotypes at home, at school and in the community; violence on the way to school, or in and around schools; long distances to schools; vulnerability to the HIV epidemic; school fees, which often lead to parents sending only their sons to school; lack of gender sensitive approaches and materials in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/12978|title=Global issues affecting women and girls |website=National Union of Teachers|accessdate=14 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429020903/http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/12978|archivedate=29 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignforeducationusa.org/obstacles-to-education-for-girls-and-women|title=Global Campaign For Education United States Chapter|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plan-international.org/files/Africa/progress-and-obstacles-to-girls-education-in-africa|title=Progress and Obstacles to Girls' Education in Africa|website=Plan International|date = 16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[OHCHR]], there have been multiple attacks on schools worldwide during the period 2009–2014 with "a number of these attacks being specifically directed at girls, parents and teachers advocating for gender equality in education".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15555&amp;LangID=E|title=Attacks against girls' education occurring with "increasing regularity" – UN human rights report|last=|first=|date=9 February 2015|website=Ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Population Fund]] says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender-equality|title=Gender equality|website=[[United Nations Population Fund]]|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|About two thirds of the world's [[Literacy#Gender disparities|illiterate]] adults are women. Lack of an education severely restricts a woman's access to information and opportunities. Conversely, increasing women's and girls' educational attainment benefits both individuals and future generations. Higher levels of women's education are strongly associated with lower infant mortality and lower fertility, as well as better outcomes for their children.}}

The legal and social treatment of married women has been often discussed as a political issue from the 19th century onwards.{{Refn|[[John Stuart Mill]], in ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1869) compared marriage to [[slavery]] and wrote that: "The law of servitude in marriage is a monstrous contradiction to all the principles of the modern world, and to all the experience through which those principles have been slowly and painfully worked out."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mill-john-stuart/1869/subjection-women/ch04.htm|title=The Subjection of Women by John Stuart Mill|website=Marxists.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|In 1957, James Everett, then Minister for Justice in Ireland, stated: "The progress of organised society is judged by the status occupied by married women".&lt;ref name=Oireachtas group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web |url= http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad1957011600008?opendocument |title= Married Women's Status Bill, 1956—Second Stage: Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) |website= [[Houses of the Oireachtas|Oireachtas]] |date= 16 January 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Until the 1970s, legal subordination of married women was common across European countries, through [[marriage laws]] giving legal authority to the husband, as well as through [[marriage bar]]s.{{Refn|In France, married women obtained the right to work without their husband's consent in 1965;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092212/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children); and a new reform in 1985 abolished the stipulation that the father had the sole power to administer the children's property.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceflonline.net/wp-content/uploads/France-Parental-Responsibilities.pdf|title=National Report: France|website=Ceflonline.net|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|In [[Austria]], the marriage law was overhauled between 1975 and 1983, abolishing the restrictions on married women's right to work outside the home, providing for equality between spouses, and for joint ownership of property and assets.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;''Women and Politics in Contemporary Ireland: From the Margins to the Mainstream'', by Yvonne Galligan, pp.90&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} In 1978, the [[Council of Europe]] passed the ''Resolution (78) 37 on equality of spouses in civil law''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RESOLUTION   (78)  37 ON   EQUALITY   OF   SPOUSES  IN   CIVIL   LAW|url=https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=596422&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=662346&amp;Usage=2|publisher=Council of Europe|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121025014/https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=596422&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=662346&amp;Usage=2|archivedate=21 January 2016|date=27  September  1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switzerland]] was one of the last countries in Europe to establish gender equality in marriage, in this country married women's rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing for gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, come into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a [[Voting in Switzerland|referendum]], who narrowly voted in favor with 54.7% of voters approving).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/23/world/swiss-grant-women-equal-marriage-rights.html|title=SWISS GRANT WOMEN EQUAL MARRIAGE RIGHTS|date=23 September 1985|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450|title=Switzerland Profile: Timeline|website=BBC News|date = 21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html|title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology|author=Markus G.

There have been and sometimes continue to be unequal treatment of married women in various aspects of everyday life.

==== Political Gender Equality ====
Two recent movements in countries with large Kurdish populations have implemented political gender equality. One has been the Kurdish movement in southeastern Turkey led by the [[Democratic Regions Party]] (DBP) and the [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|Peoples' Democratic Party]] (HDP),&lt;!-- The apostrophe is correctly placed. The party is pro-minority, and the name is also translated as Democratic Party of the People{{uu|s}} --&gt; from 2006 or before.
The mayorships of 2 metropolitan areas and 97 towns{{citation needed|date=January 2018|reason= The citation was to [[Turkish local elections, 2014]]. See [[WP:CIRC]] and [[Talk:Gender equality#new section Political Gender Equality|Political Gender Equality]].}} are led jointly by a man and a woman, both called co-mayors. Party offices are also led by a man and a woman. Local councils were formed, which also had to be co-presided over by a man and a woman together. However, in November 2016 the Turkish government cracked down on the HDP, jailing ten of its members of Parliament, including the party's male and female co-leaders.&lt;ref name=Nordland&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/world/middleeast/turkey-kurds-womens-rights.html |title=Crackdown in Turkey Threatens a Haven of Gender Equality Built by Kurds |last=Nordland |first=Rod| date=2016-12-07|work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See|Gender role}}
Gender [[stereotype]]s arise from the socially approved roles of women and men in the private or public sphere, at home or in the workplace. In the household, women are typically seen as mother figures, which usually places them into a typical classification of being "supportive" or "nurturing". Women are expected to want to take on the role of a mother and take on primary responsibility for household needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Voices and Feminist Visions|last=Shaw and Lee|first=Susan and Janet|year=|isbn=|location=|page=450|quote="Women are expected to want to be mothers"|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their male counterparts are seen as being "assertive" or "ambitious" as men are usually seen in the workplace or as the primary breadwinner for his family.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geteverwise.com/human-resources/how-does-gender-bias-really-affect-women-in-the-workplace/|title=How Does Gender Bias Really Affect Women in the Workplace?|date=2016-03-24|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these views and expectations, women often face discrimination in the public sphere, such as the workplace.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A [[gender role]] is a set of societal [[norm (social)|norms]] dictating the types of behaviors which are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for people based on their sex. Gender roles are usually centered on conceptions of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]], although there are [[Third gender|exceptions]] and [[genderqueer|variations]].

====Portrayal of women in the media====
{{Main article|Exploitation of women in mass media}}
The way women are represented in the media has been criticized as perpetuating negative gender stereotypes. The [[exploitation of women in mass media]] refers to the criticisms that are levied against the use or objectification of women in the [[mass media]], when such use or portrayal aims at increasing the appeal of media or a product, to the detriment of, or without regard to, the interests of the women portrayed, or women in general. Concerns include the fact that all forms of media have the power to shape the population's perceptions and portray images of unrealistic stereotypical perceptions by portraying women either as submissive housewives or as sex objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2013/474442/IPOL-FEMM_ET%282013%29474442_EN.pdf|format=PDF|title=Women and Girls as Subjects of Media's Attention and Advertisement Campaigns : The Situation in Europe, Best Practices and Legislations|website=Europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media emphasizes traditional domestic or sexual roles that normalize violence against women. The vast array of studies that have been conducted on the issue of the portrayal of women in the media have shown that women are often portrayed as irrational, fragile, not intelligent, submissive and
subservient to men.&lt;ref name="Acevedo 2010"&gt;Acevedo et all. 2010. 'A Content Analysis of the Roles Portrayed by Women in Commercials: 1973 – 2008', Revista Brasileira de Marketing Vol. 9. Universidade Nove de Julho, Sao Paulo.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that stereotyped images such as these have been shown to negatively impact on the mental health of many female viewers who feel bound by these roles, causing amongst other problems, self-esteem issues, depression and anxiety.&lt;ref name="Acevedo 2010"/&gt;

According to a study, the way women are often portrayed by the media can lead to:  "Women of average or normal appearance feeling inadequate or less beautiful in comparison to the overwhelming use of extraordinarily attractive women"; "Increase in the likelihood and acceptance of sexual violence"; "Unrealistic expectations by men of how women should look or behave"; "Psychological disorders such as body dysmorphic disorder, anorexia, bulimia and so on"; "The importance of physical appearance is emphasized and reinforced early in most girls' development." Studies have found that nearly half of females ages 6–8 have stated they want to be slimmer.

====Informing women of their rights====
While in many countries, the problem lies in the lack of adequate legislation, in others the principal problem is not as much the lack of a legal framework, but the fact is that most women do not know their legal rights. This is especially the case as many of the laws dealing with women's rights are of recent date. This lack of knowledge enables to abusers to lead the victims (explicitly or implicitly) to believe that their abuse is within their rights. This may apply to a wide range of abuses, ranging from domestic violence to employment discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/law-crime-and-justice/criminal-justice/bc-criminal-justice-system/if-victim/publications/hsh-english-domestic-violence.pdf|format=PDF|title=Help is available if you or someone you know is a victim of Domestic Violence|website=2.gov.bc.ca|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maternityaction.org.uk/2015/01/know-your-rights-get-your-rights/|title=Know your rights – get your rights!|website=Maternityaction.org.uk|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Development Programme states that, in order to advance gender justice, "Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/crisispreventionandrecovery/focus_areas/gender_equality_andwomensempowerment/eight_point_agendaforwomensempowermentandgenderequality.html|title=Eight Point Agenda for Women's Empowerment and Gender Equality|website=Undp.org|accessdate=14 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509195554/http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/crisispreventionandrecovery/focus_areas/gender_equality_andwomensempowerment/eight_point_agendaforwomensempowermentandgenderequality.html|archivedate=9 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1993 UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] states at Art. 4 (d) [...] "States should also inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104 – Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women – UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|first=United Nations General|last=Assembly|website=Un-documents.net|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enacting protective legislation against violence has little effect, if women do not know how to use it: for example a study of Bedouin women in Israel found that 60% did not know what a [[restraining order]] was;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/study-most-bedouin-victims-of-domestic-violence-believe-it-s-a-decree-from-god-1.427190|title=Study: Most Bedouin Victims of Domestic Violence Believe It's a 'Decree From God'|first=Jack|last=Khoury|date=30 April 2012|website=Haaretz.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if they don't know what acts are illegal: a report by Amnesty International showed in Hungary, in a public opinion poll of nearly 1,200 people in 2006, a total of 62% did not know that marital rape was an illegal (it was outlawed in 1997) and therefore the crime was rarely reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/465bfa162.pdf|format=PDF|title=Hungary : Cries unheard : The failure to protect women from rape and sexual violence in the home|website=Refworld.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6643727.stm|title=Hungary law 'fails rape victims'|date = 10 May 2007 |work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ensuring women have a minim understanding of health issues is also important: lack of access to reliable medical information and available medical procedures to which they are entitled hurts [[women's health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/gender/women_health_report/full_report_20091104_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Women and health : today's evidence tomorrow's agenda|website=Who.int|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender mainstreaming====
{{Main article|Gender mainstreaming}}
Gender mainstreaming is described as the [[public policy]] of assessing the different implications for women and men of any planned [[policy]] action, including [[legislation]] and [[Program (management)|programmes]], in all areas and levels, with the aim of achieving gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, C. and Bennett, (2002) "Gender Mainstreaming in the European Union", ''European Journal of Women's Studies'' 9 (4): 430–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/gender/newsite2002/about/defin.htm|title=Definition of Gender Mainstreaming|website=International Labor Organization|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of gender mainstreaming was first proposed at the 1985 Third World Conference on Women in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. The idea has been developed in the [[United Nations]] development community.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20010708124202/http://www.jeanmonnetprogram.org/papers/00/000201-03.html II. The Origins of Gender Mainstreaming in the EU]", ''[http://www.jeanmonnetprogram.org/ Academy of European Law online]''&lt;/ref&gt; Gender mainstreaming "involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/gendermainstreaming.htm|title=Gender Mainstreaming|website=UN Women|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Council of Europe definition: "Gender mainstreaming is the (re)organization, improvement, development and evaluation of policy processes, so that a gender equality perspective is incorporated in all policies at all levels and at all stages, by the actors normally involved in policy-making."&lt;ref name="coe.int"/&gt;

An integrated gender mainstreaming approach is "the attempt to form alliances and common platforms that bring together the power of faith and gender-equality aspirations to advance human rights."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/gender-heart-icpd|title=Gender at the Heart of ICPD: The UNFPA Strategic Framework on Gender Mainstreaming and Women's Empowerment |website=United Nations Population Fund|date = 2011|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "in Azerbaijan, [[UNFPA]] conducted a study on gender equality by comparing the text of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women with some widely recognized Islamic references and resources. The results reflect the parallels between the Convention and many tenets of Islamic scripture and practice. The study showcased specific issues, including VAW, child marriage, respect for the dignity of women, and equality in the economic and political participation of women. The study was later used to produce training materials geared towards sensitizing religious leaders."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org3"/&gt;

'''Harry Underwood''' (1969) is a painter known for his use of stenciled images and literary elements atop wood panels. His pictures are painted with house paints and written upon with ordinary No. 2 pencils. His subjects are an eclectic mix of realism, surrealism, pop art and invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parr-Moody |first1=Karen |title=Reveries of a Complicated Sign Painter |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2010/12/harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry has been labelled an [[outsider artist]], a pop artist, and a folk artist. However, unlike most folk artists, his paintings are carefully planned often taking months prior to their execution. One critic said of the detailed planning that goes into Harry's work that "what results is more a cocktail of realism, surrealism, and pop, of [[Edward Hopper]] meets [[Salvador Dali]] meets [[Andy Warhol]]."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parr-Moody |first1=Karen |title=Reveries of a Complicated Sign Painter |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2010/12/harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is popularly known by his first name "Harry", and distinctively signs his paintings with this moniker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nolan |first1=Joe |title=Harry Underwood at Estel Gallery |url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/arts-culture/article/13017001/harry-underwood-at-estel-gallery |website=Nashville Scene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Harry Underwood was born in 1969 in Miami, FL. His father was a carpenter and his mother worked in a supermarket. His family was deeply religious and he attended the Church of God pentecostal church with them until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Harry cleaned pools at motels and bussed tables at the Capri Italian Restaurant in Florida City, FL. He was uprooted by [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992 and spent time in Austin, TX and New Orleans, LA before settling in Nashville, TN where he found work in the construction industry. He began painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry's work is infused with romanticism and an undercurrent of nostalgia for a life not necessarily experienced, but wished for. Repeated images flesh out his work; bathing beauties, motel pools, vintage cars, commercial signs, palm trees, old bicycles, and dancing couples. There is a sense of mid-twentieth century Americana in his works which evokes nostalgia or longing for the vacation one never got to take, or the life one might have lived in the past, with touches of irony and commercialization that relate to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Harry Underwood |url=https://www.justfolk.com/product-category/outsider-art/underwood/ |website=Just Folk |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Harry first started painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer and house painter in Nashville, TN. He discovered his color palette while going through half-used paint cans in the garage of a house at which he was working.

His first major solo show was titled "A Pictorial History of Wishful Thinking" and hosted by the Estel Gallery in Nashville, TN in 2007. Since then, his work has been exhibited at numerous leading galleries and institutions across the United States, United Kingdom, and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response to "Outsider Artist" Label ==

Though labeled an outsider artist, Harry avoids the term. When asked about it once by a University of North Carolina (Wilmington) researcher, he answered "I don’t think of that label as having anything to do with my vision or how I approach work each day. I don’t consider myself part of a movement. I wasn’t aware of artists like Darger or Edward Hopper until I was meeting people at my shows and they began telling me I reminded them of all that. Persistence is what making art is about. The world is designed to wreck your imagination. I don’t expect I’ll be tied to folk art forever. It wouldn’t be bad if I was. A friend recently called it “Americana,” and I kind of like that." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Louise Smith |first1=Emily |title=A Conversation with Harry Underwood |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/464134/pdf |website=John Hopkins University |publisher=University of North Carolina, Wilmington |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
* Invade the Wild Kingdom
* Location is Not Essential
* Fine Weather From A Friendly Place
* Landmark Preservation - Measuring 4' x 6', Landmark Preservation is one of Harry Underwood's largest works. It is on long-term display at the [[Belcourt Theatre]] in Nashville, TN. The painting is a commentary on the uncertainty created when rapidly developing cities start to demolish historical buildings in order to make room for new construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2016/01/landmark-preservation-new-painting-opinion-nashville-artist-harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Hellenic" refers to a period in Ancient Greek history between 507 [[BCE]] (the date of the first [[democracy]] in [[Athens]]) and 323 BCE (the death of [[Alexander the Great]]).
This period is also referred to as the age of [[Classical Greece]] and should not be confused with The Hellenistic World, which designates the period between Alexander's death and the [[Roman Empire]]'s conquest of Greece (323/146/31 BCE). The Hellenic World of [[ancient Greece]] consisted of the Greek mainland, [[Crete]], the islands of the [[Greek archipelago]] and the coast of [[Asia Minor]] primarily (though mention is made of cities within the interior of Asia Minor and, of course, the colonies in southern Italy). This is the great Golden Age of Greece and, in the popular imagination, resonates as 'ancient Greece'.

The great law-giver, [[Solon]], having served as [[Archon]] of Athens for 22 years, retired from public life and saw the city, almost immediately, fall under the dictatorship of [[Peisistratus]]. Though a dictator, Peisistratus understood Solon's wisdom, carried on his policies and after his death, his son [[Hippias]] continued this tradition (though maintaining a dictatorship that favored the aristocracy). His younger brother was assassinated (inspired, according to [[Thucydides]], by a love affair gone wrong and not, as later thought, politically motivated) Hippias then became wary of the Athenians, instituted a rule of terror and was finally overthrown by the army under [[Kleomenes I]] of [[Sparta]] and [[Cleisthenes]] of Athens. Cleisthenes reformed the Athenian constitution and established democracy in the city during 507 BCE. He also followed Solon's lead, but instituted new laws that decreased the artistocracy's power, raised the status of the common people and attempted to join the separate tribes of the mountain, the plain and the shore into one, unified people under a new form of government. According to [[Will Durant]], "The Athenians themselves were exhilarated by this adventure into sovereignty...they knew the zest of freedom in action, speech and thought; and from that moment they began to lead all Greece in literature and art, even in statesmanship and war".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} This foundation of democracy, of a free state consisting of men who "owned the soil that they tilled and who ruled the state that governed them", stabilized Athens and provided the groundwork for the Golden Age.

The list of thinkers, writers, doctors, artists, scientists, statesmen and warriors of the Hellenic World important contributions to [[western civilization]]: The statesman Solon, poets [[Pindar]] and [[Sappho]], playwrights [[Sophocles]], [[Euripides]], [[Aeschylus]] and [[Aristophanes]], the orator [[Lysias]], historians [[Herodotus]] and Thucydides, philosophers [[Zeno of Elea]], [[Protagoras of Abdera]], [[Empedocles of Acragas]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Xenophanes]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], writer and general [[Xenophon]], physician [[Hippocrates]], sculptor [[Phidias]], statesman [[Pericles]], generals [[Alcibiades]] and [[Themistocles]] and many more lived during this period. The Golden Age, according to the poet [[Shelley]], "is undoubtedly...the most memorable in the history of the world" for the accomplishments and advancements made by the people of that time. Herodotus considered his own age as lacking in many ways and looked back to a more ancient past for a paradigm of a true greatness. The writer [[Hesiod]], an 8th-century BCE contemporary of [[Homer]], claimed precisely the same thing about the age Herodotus admired and called his own age "wicked, depraved and dissolute" and hoped the future would produce a better breed of man for Greece.

==Geography==

Major [[city-states]] and sacred places of pilgrimage in the Hellenic World were [[Argos]], Athens, [[Eleusis]], [[Corinth]], [[Delphi]], [[Ithaca]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], [[Sparta]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Thrace]] and [[Mount Olympus]], the home of the gods. The gods played an important part in the lives of the people; so much so that one could face execution for questioning - or even allegedly questioning - their existence, as in the case of Protagoras, Socrates and Alcibiades (the Athenian statesman [[Critias]], sometimes referred to as `the first atheist', only escaped condemnation because he was so powerful). Great works of art and beautiful temples were created for the worship and praise of the various gods and goddesses of the Greeks such as the [[Parthenon of Athens]], dedicated to the goddess [[Athena Parthenos]] (Athena the Virgin) and the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]] (listed as an Ancient Wonder) at Olympia (both works to which Phidias contributed). The [[temple of Demeter]] at Eleusis was the site of the famous [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] and is considered the most important rite in ancient Greece. In his works, ''The Iliad'' and ''The Odyssey'', immensely popular and influential in the Hellenic World, Homer depicted the gods and goddesses as intimately involved in the lives of the people. The deities were regularly consulted in domestic matters as well as affairs of state. The [[Oracle at Delphi]] was considered so important at the time that people from all over the known world came to Greece to ask advice or favors from the god. It was considered vital to consult with the supernatural forces before embarking on any military campaign.

Among the famous battles of the Hellenic World were the [[Battle of Marathon]] (490 BCE), the [[Battle of Thermopylae|Battles of Thermopylae]] and [[Battles of Salamis|Salamis]] (480 BCE), [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]] (479 BCE,) and the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] (338 BCE) where the forces of the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] [[Philip II of Macedon|King Philip II]] commanded, in part, by his son Alexander, defeated the Greek forces and unified the Greek city-states. After Philip's death, Alexander conquered the world of his day, becoming Alexander the Great. His campaigns brought Greek culture, language and civilization to the world and, after his death, left the legacy that came to be known as the Hellenistic World.

The inaugural chair-holder, [[Dr. André Gerolymatos]], has since worked to secure more funding and resources to expand the discipline at SFU.

In 2011, these efforts culminated in the establishment of the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Centre for Hellenic Studies, through a generous multimillion-dollar donation by the [[Stavros Niarchos Foundation]]. The centre supports the Hellenic Studies Program at SFU which offers undergraduate courses in Ancient, Byzantine, Early Modern and Modern Greek History, in addition to Archaeology and Greek language training. Graduate students working with Hellenic Studies faculty receive significant financial support as well as teaching and publication opportunities.

The SNF Centre for Hellenic Studies is also host to the SNF New Media Lab, a leading innovator of online and mobile solutions for the education and cultural sectors.

'''Heritage science''' is cross-disciplinary scientific research of [[cultural heritage]]. It encompasses research enabling access to [[cultural heritage]], its [[Art conservation|conservation]], [[Interpretation (aesthetics)|interpretation]] and [[management]].

The term has become widely used after 2006 when it became increasingly evident that the more traditional terms [[conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]] or preservation science inadequately reflected the breadth of research into [[cultural heritage]]. Heritage scientists in museums, galleries, libraries, archives, universities and research institutions support conservation (often called [[conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]]), access (e.g. development of new [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] tools), interpretation, including [[archaeometry]] and [[archaeological science]] (e.g. dating, [[Provenance|provenancing]], attribution), heritage management (e.g. development of tools and knowledge supporting strategic or environmental management decisions) and wider societal engagement with heritage (e.g. heritage [[Value (ethics)|values and ethics]]). Heritage science is also an excellent vehicle for public engagement with science as well as heritage.

Heritage science is seen as "key to the long-term sustainability of heritage: it is about managing change and risk and maximising social, cultural and economic benefit not just today, but in such a way that we can pass on to future generations that which we have inherited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldsctech/256/256.pdf |format=PDF |title=Science and Technology Committee : Science and Heritage |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domains of research, where heritage science makes a particular input were recognised to be museums, galleries, libraries and archives; the built historic environment and archaeology, by the United Kingdom National Heritage Science Strategy documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescienceforum.org.uk/strategy.php | title=UK National Heritage Science Strategy | accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
[[File:Red Rot Leather.jpg|right|thumbnail|Red rot on leather bindings was one of the first conservation issues to excite scientists.]]
The field still requires its literature canon and opinions on whether heritage science is a domain in its own right or a field of research diverge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5SpIq80XpU | title=Round Table discussion on the Future of Heritage Science| accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this appears a matter of academic recognition, rather than a matter of research practice.

Heritage science is an old field of research: in his [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] in 1843, [[Michael Faraday]] already pointed out how pollution importantly contributes to book degradation. The following premises appear to be of defining importance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://heritagescienceresearch.wordpress.com/2015/11/17/theory_heritagescience/ | title=A Brief Theory of Heritage Science| accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Heritage science is inherently biased, as scientists, by doing research on heritage, contribute to its value: they create and popularize heritage through their research. 
# Heritage science is neither fundamental nor experimental: work with actual heritage objects, building or sites cannot be repeatable because heritage is not an experiment. On the other hand, the [[scientific method]] and deductive reasoning is easily applied when working with models and model objects, which heritage scientists often do due to the high value of actual historic objects and consequentially, sampling restrictions.

Since the context of heritage is often unknown, there can be any number of variables affecting the heritage system under observation – inductive reasoning is therefore often applied in heritage science. In this aspect, the premise of heritage science comes close to social science.
Heritage that is accessible, in its preserved authentic form or as a (digital) reproduction, is a "resource for economic growth, employment and social cohesion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/library/publications/2014-heritage-communication_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe |publisher=EU |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through improved access, heritage science therefore contributes to well-being. Heritage science is proof that there is no world of [[The Two Cultures|'Two Cultures']]. A scientist, researching heritage defies the existence of the divide: there can be no scientific research of heritage without a contribution by humanities research. Heritage science also successfully bridges science and culture, because it provides an attractive vehicle to convey ideas and concepts related to technology and engineering, as well as culture and society. Heritage science can be considered an anthropogenic analog to environmental geography, which was defined by [[Halford Mackinder]] in 1887 as a discipline that aims to "bridge one of the greatest of all gaps" between "the natural sciences and the study of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacKinder|first=H. J.|date=1887|title=On the Scope and Methods of Geography|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1801248|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society and Monthly Record of Geography|volume=9|issue=3|pages=141–174|doi=10.2307/1801248}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Research==
[[Image:WoS publications 2015.png|right|thumbnail|Publication trends in the heritage science field, 2005-2014.]]

Heritage science is an increasingly lively science domain. Materials and techniques of the past are often very difficult to study and state-of-the-art techniques and methods need to be employed. Discoveries new to science are often the result of such endeavours, e.g. new antibiotics from bacteria discovered in the [[Cave of Altamira]], in Spain. With its wide definition, heritage science spans a significant variety of scientific activities. In order to support conservation, access, interpretation and management, heritage science must be based on an [[interdisciplinary]] palette of knowledge, from fundamental sciences ([[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[biology]]) to [[arts]] and [[humanities]] (conservation, [[archaeology]], [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[history]], [[art history]] etc.), including [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[computer science]]s and [[engineering]].

In academia, heritage science is often performed by scientists spending a proportion of their time on heritage-related research. The academic field, judged by the number of academic outputs published annually, is steadily increasing. This could be taken to estimate the domain size – with the number of outputs in 2014 being 6,800 (Source: Web of Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ |title=ISI Web of Knowledge |publisher=Images.isiknowledge.com |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it could be assumed that there are about 3,000 heritage scientists active in the field (publishing on average 2 academic publications per year). This goes against the generally held view that the field is small.

The proportion per country varies greatly, about 20% of researchers being active in the US, 15% in the UK, 10% in Italy, 5% France, and 5% in China (with a strong increase in the last decade).

Since 2013, the scientific domain has its own flagship journal, ''Heritage Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagesciencejournal.com/ |title=Heritage Science |publisher=Heritagesciencejournal.com |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Mind the Gap project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/our-role/collection-care/heritage-science-research-and-development/collaborative-working-practices-mind-the-gap/ |title= Mind the gap project |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the UK EPSRC/AHRC Science and Heritage Programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescience.ac.uk/ |title= UK AHRC/EPSRC Science and Heritage Programme |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported on the drivers and impediments in cross-disciplinary research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mind-the-gap-report-jan-2014.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mind the Gap Report |publisher=AHRC |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project found that there is no gap between rigour and relevance in heritage science research but rather that there is a continuum of activity. However, there was less satisfaction with heritage science research in relation to its impact on practice, in comparison to its academic impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagesciencejournal.com/content/2/1/11 |title= Mind the gap: rigour and relevance in collaborative heritage science research |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:SEAHA Mobile Heritage Lab.jpg|thumbnail|The SEAHA Mobile Heritage Laboratory for field research and public engagement with science and heritage.]]
The heritage science career paths are various. Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of heritage science, any academic background is suitable, from [[formal sciences]], [[natural sciences]] to [[social sciences]]. 
Most researchers have entered the field by carrying out doctoral research in the field, which is due to the fact that there is currently no undergraduate course in this domain. Since 2010, Master's degree courses in heritage science have become available at [[University College London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/heritage/programmes/mres-msc/mres-seaha |title=Heritage Science Masters at UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Queens University Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/gap/ProspectiveStudents/PostgraduateStudies/GraduateStudiesTaught/HeritageScience/ |title=Heritage Science Masters at Queens University, Belfast |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, students can obtain undergraduate and/or graduate degrees in conservation science at the [[University of Florence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unifi.it/p-cor2-2016-101227-B194-GEN-1-1.html|title=Offerta formativa - Università degli Studi di Firenze - UniFI|website=www.unifi.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Bologna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://corsi.unibo.it/SCIENCEFORCONSERVATION/Pages/default.aspx|title=Two year master in Science for the conservation-restoration of cultural heritage - Ravenna - Università di Bologna|website=corsi.unibo.it|language=en|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a recently created programme at the [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice|University of Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unive.it/pag/20740/|title=Summary: Master's Degree Programme in Conservation Science and Technology for Cultural Heritage - Ca' Foscari|website=www.unive.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other universities in Italy have faculty members whose primary research focus is in heritage science; these groups often accept international students who would like to obtain a PhD in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scich.it/index.html|title=COLOMBINI GROUP - Chemical Science for the Safeguard of Cultural Heritage|website=www.scich.it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scienzadeimateriali.campusnet.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Alias?oscar.chiantore#profilo|title=Prof. Oscar Chiantore - Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Scienza dei Materiali - Università degli Studi di Torino|last=Torino|first=Università degli Studi di|website=scienzadeimateriali.campusnet.unito.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taught courses in heritage science programmes include elements of heritage science, e.g. technical art history is often part of [[art history]] courses, and [[natural sciences]] are often taught in conservation courses. [[Brandenburg University of Technology]] in Germany offers the international Master's programme World Heritage Studies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b-tu.de/en/heritage-studies-phd/|title=World Heritage Studies, Master of Arts|website=www.b-tu.de|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and PhD programme Heritage Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b-tu.de/worldheritage-ma/|title=PhD Programme Heritage Studies|website=www.b-tu.de|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[University College London|UCL]], [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Brighton]], the Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology ([http://www.seaha-cdt.ac.uk/ SEAHA]) was established in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaha-cdt.ac.uk/ |title=Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key aspect of the SEAHA scheme is the collaborative nature of projects, enabling partnerships between academic institutions, industry and national heritage agencies and giving an applied focus to the research training.

Since the field requires significant cross-disciplinary and transferrable skills, graduates may be able to take jobs in industry and academia. To work within the field of heritage science (e.g. in a museum laboratory), a PhD in the physical sciences and significant experience in a museum or conservation studio is typically required.

A UK body, the National Heritage Science Forum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescienceforum.org.uk/about.php |title=National Heritage Science Forum - Home |publisher=Heritagescienceforum.org.uk |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established to enable the 'users' and 'doers' of heritage science to access information on heritage science research, to exchange knowledge and increase collaboration. In 2016, the forum had 20 institutional members.

Several international professional associations have heritage science groups:
* Committee for Conservation, Working Group Scientific Research ([[International Council of Museums]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icom-cc.org/37/working-groups/scientific-research/ |title=Scientific Research |publisher=Icom-cc.org |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Royal Society of Chemistry, Heritage Science Sub-Committee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/Membership/Networking/InterestGroups/Analytical/AMC/Heritage-Science-sub-committee.asp |title=Heritage Science Sub-Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heritage Science Research Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://heritagescienceresearch.wordpress.com |title=Heritage Science Research Network |publisher=HSRN |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; captures the current activity in the field in the UK. In Spain, the Spanish Network of Science and Technology for the Conservation of Cultural Heritage ([http://www.technoheritage.es TechnoHeritage]) brings together more than 65 research groups working in heritage science, from the Spanish National Research Council ([[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]), universities, conservation institutes and other cultural institutions. 

==Events==
The major heritage science events (conferences, symposia, meetings etc.) are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1995">The term '''hermit kingdom''' can be used to refer to any country, organization or society which willfully walls itself off, either metaphorically or physically, from the rest of the world - The country of [[North Korea]] is a prime example of a hermit kingdom.

Korea in the age of [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]] was the subject of the first use of the term, in [[William Elliot Griffis]]' 1882 book ''Corea: The Hermit Nation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=David H.|title=Historians' Fallacies: Toward a Logic of Historical Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Myoung Chung|title=Korean Government Publications: An Introductory Guide. Lantham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2000.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Korea was frequently described as a hermit kingdom until 1905 when it became a protectorate of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/07/28/104992374.pdf The Obliteration of the Kingdom of Korea] by [[Stephen Bonsal]], ''The New York Times'', July 28, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; The term is still commonplace throughout Korea and it is often used by [[Koreans]] themselves to describe pre-modern Korea. Today, the term is often applied to North Korea in news and social media, and in 2009 it was used by United States former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=World&amp;ArticleID=news/capfeed/world/w022017A.xml{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!--
Several other countries reluctant to engage in dialogue with the outside world have also been described as hermit kingdoms, including: [[Bhutan]],{{cn}} the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]],{{cn}} and the early African civilization of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Axum]].{{cn}}

{{refimprove|date=March 2014}}

The '''hook''' is the nucleus of both a film and its [[screenplay]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} It is what grabs the viewer's attention, preferably in the first 5–10 minutes, as a reader might expect to find a literary [[Narrative hook|hook]] in the first chapter of a novel.

During the [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] process, a screenwriter will use a hook to prove the "bankable" quality of their screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craftyscreenwriting.com/hook.html |title=The Hook |publisher=Crafty Screenwriting |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing the importance of a good hook, many screenwriters write their hooks first. Conceivably, the life of a screenplay might evolve from hook to 1-page synopsis, to 4-page treatment, to full [[Film treatment|treatment]], to [[scriptment]], to screenplay.

One can briefly state a good hook in one or two sentences, introducing the protagonist, the conflict that drives the story, and what the [[protagonist]] will achieve with either triumph or defeat. The "hook" is the viewer's own question of whether the conflict can be resolved, so a screenwriter might want to test the hook by turning it into a question. For example, "Johnny must catch the murderer so that he can get the girl" might become "Will Johnny catch the murderer? Or will he lose the girl?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scriptfly.com/sceneanalysis/index.shtml |title=How to Write Your Screenplay's Hook |publisher=Scriptfly.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the screenwriter can use the hook as a tool when writing the screenplay.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="913">The '''human dartboard''' is a contemporary [[sideshow]] act in which one person throws [[Dart (missile)|darts]] at another person.  Usually the thrower is the target's assistant or a member of the [[audience]].  This act was popularized by the [[Jim Rose Circus]], where it was performed by Jim, in the role of the target, and his wife Bebe, who threw the darts.  Usually darts are thrown into the back of the target, and the [[vertebral column|spine]] is protected by a board or other long object stuck into the waistband.

For clarifications about the [[Global intellectual history|latter topic]], please consult the writings of the [[Intellectual history#Prominent individuals|intellectual historians listed here]] and entries on individual thinkers.}}

'''Intellectual history''' refers to the [[historiography]] of ideas and thinkers.  This [[history]] cannot be considered without the knowledge of the humans who created, discussed, wrote about, and in other ways were concerned with ideas. Intellectual history as practiced by [[historian]]s is parallel to the [[history of philosophy]] as done by philosophers, and is more akin to the [[history of ideas]]. Its central premise is that ideas do not develop in isolation from the people who create and use them, and that one must study ideas not as abstract propositions but in terms of the culture, lives, and historical contexts that produced them.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, "The history of ideas: Precept and practice, 1950-2000 and beyond." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 67#1 (2006): 1-32. [http://sydney.edu.au/intellectual-history/documents/grafton-history-ideas.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual history aims to understand ideas from the past by understanding them in context. The term "context" in the preceding sentence is ambiguous: it can be political, cultural, intellectual, and social. One can read a text both in terms of a chronological context (for example, as a contribution to a discipline or tradition as it extended over time) or in terms of a contemporary intellectual moment (for example, as participating in a debate particular to a certain time and place). Both of these acts of contextualization are typical of what intellectual historians do, nor are they exclusive. Generally speaking, intellectual historians seek to place concepts and texts from the past in multiple contexts.

It is important to realize that intellectual history is not just the history of intellectuals. It studies ideas as they are expressed in texts, and as such is different from other forms of [[cultural history]] which deal also with visual and other non-verbal forms of evidence. Any written trace from the past can be the object of intellectual history. The concept of the "[[intellectual]]" is relatively recent, and suggests someone professionally concerned with thought. Instead, anyone who has put pen to paper to explore his or her thoughts can be the object of intellectual history. A famous example of an intellectual history of a non-canonical thinker is [[Carlo Ginzburg]]'s study of a 16th-century Italian miller, [[Menocchio]], in his seminal work ''The Cheese and the Worms''.

Although the field emerged from European disciplines of ''[[Kulturgeschichte]]'' and ''[[Geistesgeschichte]]'', the historical study of ideas has engaged not only western intellectual traditions but others as well, including those in other parts of the world. Increasingly, historians are calling for a [[Global intellectual history]] that will show the parallels and interrelations in the history of thought of all human societies. Another important trend has been the [[history of the book]] and of reading, which has drawn attention to the material aspects of how books were designed, produced, distributed, and read.

==Intellectual historiography==
Intellectual history as a self-conscious discipline is a relatively recent phenomenon. It has precedents, however, in the [[history of philosophy]], the [[history of ideas]], and in [[cultural history]] as practiced since [[Jacob Burckhardt|Burckhardt]] or indeed since [[Voltaire]]. The history of the human mind, as it was called in the eighteenth century, was of great concern to scholars and philosophers, and their efforts can in part be traced to [[Francis Bacon]]’s call for what he termed a literary history in his [[The Advancement of Learning]]. In economics, [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883-1946) was both a historian of economic thought himself,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[John Maynard Keynes]], ''Essays in Biography'', Macmillan, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; and the subject of study by historians of economic thought because of the significance of the [[Keynesian revolution]].&lt;ref&gt; E.g. [[Peter Clarke (historian)]], ''The Keynesian Revolution in the Making, 1924-1936'', 1988. [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the discipline of intellectual history as it is now understood emerged only in the immediate postwar period, in its earlier incarnation as "the [[history of ideas]]" under the leadership of [[Arthur Lovejoy]], the founder of the [[Journal of the History of Ideas]]. Since that time, Lovejoy's formulation of "unit-ideas" has been discredited and replaced by more nuanced and more historically sensitive accounts of intellectual activity, and this shift is reflected in the replacement of the phrase [[history of ideas]] by ''intellectual history''.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Richter,  "Begriffsgeschichte and the History of Ideas." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1987): 247-263. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709557 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual history includes the history of thought in many disciplines, such as the [[history of philosophy]], and the [[history of economic thought]]. Analytical concepts - such as the nature of paradigms and the causes of paradigm shifts - have been borrowed from the study of other disciplines, exemplified by the use of the ideas of [[Thomas Kuhn]] about [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] to explain revolutions in thought in economics and other disciplines.&lt;ref&gt; E.g. Ghanshyam Mehta, ''The structure of the Keynesian Revolution'', 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain the [[history of political thought]] has been a particular focus since the late 1960s and is associated especially with [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|historians at Cambridge]], such as  [[John Dunn (political theorist)|John Dunn]] and [[Quentin Skinner]]. They studied European political thought in its historical context, emphasizing the emergence and development of such concepts as the state and freedom. Skinner in particular is renowned for his provocative methodological essays, which were and are widely read by philosophers and practitioners of other humanistic disciplines, and did much to give prominence to the practice of intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Richter, "Reconstructing the history of political languages: Pocock, Skinner, and the Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe." History and Theory (1990): 38-70. [http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/122486/bdf9f28ccd0e5fa91c1b6dae307c0eed.pdf?sequence=1 online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States, intellectual history is understood more broadly to encompass many different forms of intellectual output, not just the history of political ideas, and it includes such fields as the history of historical thought, associated especially with [[Anthony Grafton]] of [[Princeton University]] and [[J.G.A. Pocock]] of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Formalized in 2010, the History and Culture Ph.D. at [[Drew University]] is one of a few graduate programs in the US currently specializing in intellectual history, both in its American and European contexts. Despite the prominence of early modern intellectual historians (those studying the age from the [[Renaissance]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), the intellectual history of the modern period has also been the locus of intense and creative output on both sides of the Atlantic. Prominent examples of such work include [[Louis Menand]]'s ''[[The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America|The Metaphysical Club]]'' and [[Martin Jay]]'s ''[[The Dialectical Imagination]]''.

In continental Europe, equivalents of intellectual history can be found. An example is [[Reinhart Koselleck]]’s ''Begriffsgeschichte'' (history of concepts), though there are methodological differences between the work of Koselleck and his followers and the work of Anglo-American intellectual historians.

'''Interstitial art''' is any work of art whose basic nature falls between, rather than within, the familiar boundaries of accepted [[genres]] or media, thus making the work difficult to categorize or describe within a single artistic discipline.

==The concept of interstitiality==
The word ''interstitial'' means "between spaces", and is commonly used to denote "in-betweenness" in several different cultural contexts. Architects refer to the leftover gaps between building walls as "interstitial space", being neither inside any room nor outside the building. Medical doctors have used  the term for hundreds of years to refer to a space within the human body that lies in between blood vessels and organs, or in between individual cells. Television station programmers refer to any short piece of content that is neither a show nor a commercial, but is sandwiched between them, as "an interstitial".

==How art can be interstitial==
Take [[fiction]] as an example: If a librarian isn't sure where to shelve a book, that may be because the material is interstitial in some way, not fitting comfortably into a single, conventional literary category. For instance, when novelist [[Laurell K. Hamilton]] first began writing and publishing romances featuring [[vampires]] and [[fairies]], bookstores faced a dilemma: How do you file these stories when you're working in a system that clearly labels one shelf for romances, a second shelf for fantasies, and a third shelf for tales of horror? There's no single, obvious answer, because such a novel is interstitial fiction, its essence residing somewhere in between the boundaries of these genres.

Or consider the performance artist [[Laurie Anderson]]: She might go onstage and sing, tell a spoken-word story, project shadow puppets on a screen, and play a hacked violin whose bow is strung with audio tape. Is she a singer, a monologist, a puppeteer, or some kind of tinkering instrumentalist? Classifying such an act as interstitial [[performance art]] would be imprecise but efficient and accurate.

==The interstitial arts movement==
In the mid-1990s, [[Delia Sherman]], [[Ellen Kushner]], [[Terri Windling]], [[Heinz Insu Fenkl]], [[Midori Snyder]], [[Kelly Link]], [[Gavin Grant (editor)|Gavin Grant]], [[Gregory Frost]], [[Theodora Goss]], [[Veronica Schanoes]], Carolyn Dunn, Colson Whitehead, and other American writers interested in fantastic literature found themselves commiserating over the common perception that the genre-oriented [[publishing]] industry found it difficult to market truly innovative fiction involving unusual, fantastical, or cross-genre elements—because the mainstream [[literary fiction]] field demanded stories based in [[Realism (arts)|realism]], while the [[fantasy]] field demanded stories that mostly followed the standard conventions of [[sword and sorcery]] or [[high fantasy]]. Yet it seemed to the authors that some of the best literature was that which didn't quite fit tidily into either category but instead was being discussed in terms of more amorphous, "in-between" descriptors such as "[[magic realism]]", "[[mythic fiction]]", or "the [[New Weird]]". Further, the idea of interstitiality applied to other kinds of "in-between" fiction (unrelated to fantasy) and other "in-between" arts.

Over a period of several years, Kushner and Sherman prompted ongoing discussion about the importance of cultivating artistic "in-betweenness" led to the formulation of the broad concept of interstitial art. In 2002, literary scholar [[Heinz Insu Fenkl]] founded ISIS: The Interstitial Studies Institute at the [[State University of New York at New Paltz]], and in 2003–04, Sherman &amp; Kushner and some of their colleagues established the Interstitial Arts Foundation, a [[501(c)(3)|501c(3)]] nonprofit organization dedicated to developing community and support for artists, arts-industry professionals and audiences whose creative pursuits are interstitial in nature.

==Interstitial Arts Projects==
=== ''Interfictions'' ===
In 2007, the Interstitial Arts Foundation published an anthology of interstitial fiction through [[Small Beer Press]] titled ''Interfictions''.  It features 19 stories from new and established writers in the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK, and fiction translated from Spanish, Hungarian, and French.  The anthology strives to "change your mind about what stories can and should do as they explore the imaginative space between conventional genres".

The anthology raised several questions and started many debates on the nature of interstitiality as applied to fiction.  Reviewers raised the question of how important the definition, or lack thereof, was to understanding the anthology as a whole and the stories individually.  "The 19 stories contained within ''Interfictions'' serve as examples but not as points of an argument that could lead to a listing in a Funk and Wagnalls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.citypaper.com/arts/review.asp?rid=11820 |title=The Go-Betweens: Writers Dismantle And Recombine Genre In Seek Of Fresh Modes Of Storytelling |first=Adrienne |last=Martini |date= 30 May 2007 |work=[[Baltimore City Paper]] |accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though many of the stories are written by science fiction, fantasy, and horror writers and contain fantastic or supernatural elements, ''Interfictions'' is not a genre anthology.  "...interstitial fiction mixes and matches these precepts—ghost stories, science fiction, nursery rhymes, detective story, whatever may be handy—as part of a variegated prism to focus on the psychology of existence even while bending its collectively recognized state. ...each 'interfiction' shares this sense of disjointed narrative, but in very different ways that do not lend themselves to easy genre categorization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2007/07/interfictions_e.shtml |title=''Interfictions'', edited by Theodora Goss and Delia Sherman |first=David |last=Soyka |date=25 July 2007 |work=[[Strange Horizons]] |accessdate=9 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525074044/http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2007/07/interfictions_e.shtml |archivedate=25 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intervac International''' is a [[hospitality service]] used to arrange [[home exchange]]s. It has over 30,000 members in 52 countries worldwide, but is most popular in Europe, particularly [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=swap/&gt;&lt;ref name=home/&gt;&lt;ref name=alexa/&gt;&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web | url=https://us.intervac-homeexchange.com/facts-about-intervac | title=Facts About Intervac | publisher=Intervac International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
Intervac offers a free 20-day trial membership and charges an annual membership fee of US$100.&lt;ref name=home/&gt;&lt;ref name=swap&gt;{{cite news | first=Joseph | last=Blake | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/travel/activities-and-interests/family-travel/with-young-children/swap-your-home-to-see-the-world-for-less/article2121040/ | title=Swap your home to see the world for less | work=[[The Globe and Mail]] | date=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members create a profile with information and photos of themselves and  the [[residence]] they have to swap including amenities such as automobile use, the size of their family, the dates and length desired, and the destination desired. Members can then search for houses that fit their desires or wait until they are contacted by others.&lt;ref name=home&gt;{{cite news | first=JAY | last=ROMANO | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/11/realestate/your-home-smoothing-vacation-exchanges.html | title=YOUR HOME; Smoothing Vacation Exchanges | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most [[homestay]]s, terms of the stay are negotiated in advance.&lt;ref name=swap/&gt;

==History==
Intervac was the first [[home exchange]] network, founded in 1953 in [[Switzerland]] by several teachers that wanted to travel internationally with a limited budget during their summer vacations.&lt;ref name=swap/&gt;&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1702">'''Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck's values orientation theory''' (put forward in 1961) proposes that all [[human societies]] must answer a limited number of universal problems, that the value-based solutions are limited in number and universally known, but that different cultures have different preferences among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&amp;context=orpc |title=Theory |website=scholarworks.gvsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/culture/kluckhohn_strodtbeck_culture.htm|title=Kluckholn and Strodtbeck's Dimensions of Culture|website=changingminds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggested questions include humans' relations with time, nature and each other, as well as basic human motives and the nature of human nature. Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck suggested alternate answers to all five, developed culture-specific measures of each, and described the value orientation profiles of five SW USA cultural groups. Their theory has since been tested in many other cultures, and used to help negotiating ethnic groups understand one another, and to examine the inter-generational value changes caused by migration. Other theories of universal values (Rokeach, Hofstede, Schwartz) have produced value concepts sufficiently similar to suggest that a truly universal set of human values does exist and that cross-cultural psychologists are close to discovering what they are.

In [[cultural anthropology]], a '''leveling mechanism''' is a practice that acts to ensure [[social equality]], usually by shaming or humbling members of a group that attempt to put themselves above other members.&lt;ref name=routledge&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cw.routledge.com/textbooks/9780415485395/glossary.asp |title=Cultural Anthropology: Global Forces, Local Issues - Student Resources Glossary|author=Eller, Jack David |publisher=[[Routledge]] |work=Cultural Anthropology: Global Forces, Local Lives |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One commonly given example of a leveling mechanism is the [[ǃKung people|!Kung]] practice of "shaming the meat", particularly as illustrated by the Canadian anthropologist [[Richard Borshay Lee]] in his article "Eating Christmas in the Kalahari" (1969).&lt;ref name="christmas"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://windward.hawaii.edu/facstaff/dagrossa-p/articles/EatingChristmas.pdf |title=Eating Christmas in the Kalahari |publisher=[[American Museum of Natural History]] |year=1969 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704230658/http://windward.hawaii.edu/facstaff/dagrossa-p/articles/EatingChristmas.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Lee gave the !Kung an ox as a Christmas gift, the !Kung responded by insulting the gift, calling it a "bag of bones" and joking that they would have to eat the horns because there was no meat on it. Lee later asked a man named Tomazo why his gift was insulted in this way. He responded that it was because the gift was arrogant. Lee asked what he meant by this and was told:

{{quote|"Yes, when a young man kills much meat he comes to think of himself as a chief or a big man, and he thinks of the rest of us as his servants or inferiors. We can’t accept this. We refuse one who boasts, for someday his pride will make him kill somebody. So we always speak of his meat as worthless. This way we cool his heart and make him gentle."|Tomazo|"Eating Christmas in the Kalahari" &lt;ref name="christmas"/&gt;}}

A '''meme''' ({{IPAc-en|m|iː|m}} {{respell|MEEM}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/meme|title=meme|website=Oxford Dictionaries|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/meme|language=en|website=Cambridge Dictionary|title=meme Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/meme?q=meme|title=meme noun|language=en|website=Oxford Learner's Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture—often with the aim of conveying a particular phenomenon, theme, or meaning represented by the meme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meme Meme]. ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; A meme acts as a unit for carrying [[culture|cultural]] ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to [[gene]]s in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to [[natural selection|selective pressures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graham|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents theorize that memes are a [[viral phenomenon]] that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of [[biological evolution]]. Memes do this through the processes of [[genetic diversity|variation]], [[mutation]], [[competition]], and [[heredity|inheritance]], each of which influences a meme's reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that [[fecundity|propagate]] less prolifically may become [[extinction|extinct]], while others may survive, spread, and (for better or for worse) mutate. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|1994 | p. 360}} "But if we consider culture as its own self-organizing system—a system with its own agenda and pressure to survive—then the history of humanity gets even more interesting. As Richard Dawkins has shown, systems of self-replicating ideas or memes can quickly accumulate their own agenda and behaviours. I assign no higher motive to a cultural entity than the primitive drive to reproduce itself and modify its environment to aid its spread. One way the self organizing system can do this is by consuming human biological resources."&lt;/ref&gt;

A field of study called [[memetics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Heylighen|Chielens|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an [[evolutionary model]]. Criticism from a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can examine memes [[empirical]]ly. However, developments in [[Functional neuroimaging|neuroimaging]] may make empirical study possible.&lt;ref name="mcnamara"&gt;{{harvnb|McNamara|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators in the social sciences question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture in terms of discrete units, and are especially critical of the biological nature of the theory's underpinnings.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Jameson (2011). Memes and narrative analysis: A potential direction for the development of neo-Darwinian orientated research in organisations. In: Euram 11 : proceedings of the European Academy of Management. European Academy of Management.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that this use of the term is the result of a misunderstanding of the original proposal.&lt;ref name="misunderstanding"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burman | first1 = J.

The word ''meme'' is a [[neologism]] coined by [[Richard Dawkins]].&lt;ref name="cream"&gt;{{Citation |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Selfish Gene |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |edition=2 |isbn=978-0-19-286092-7 |page=192 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WkHO9HI7koEC&amp;pg=PA192 |quote=We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of ''imitation''. 'Mimeme' comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like 'gene'. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to ''meme''. If it is any consolation, it could alternatively be thought of as being related to 'memory', or to the French word ''même''. It should be pronounced to rhyme with 'cream'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It originated from Dawkins' 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''. Dawkins's own position is somewhat ambiguous: he welcomed [[Nicholas Keynes Humphrey|N. K. Humphrey]]'s suggestion that "memes should be considered as living structures, not just metaphorically"&lt;ref name="Humphrey"&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|1989 | p = 192}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed to regard memes as "physically residing in the brain".&lt;ref name="TEP"&gt;{{Citation |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Extended Phenotype |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-19-286088-0 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he argued that his original intentions, presumably before his approval of Humphrey's opinion, had been simpler.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins' foreword to {{harvnb|Blackmore|1999}}, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The word ''meme'' is a shortening (modeled on ''gene'') of ''mimeme'' (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|μίμημα}} {{IPA-el|míːmɛːma|pron}} ''mīmēma'', "imitated thing", from {{lang|el|μιμεῖσθαι}} ''mimeisthai'', "to imitate", from {{Lang|el|μῖμος}} ''mimos'', "mime")&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'': Fourth Edition, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; coined by British evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976)&lt;ref name="cream"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Millikan|2004|p=16}}; [https://books.google.com/books?id=YphlBwpbJCUC&amp;pg=PA16 Varieties of meaning]. "Richard Dawkins invented the term 'memes' to stand for items that are reproduced by imitation rather than reproduced genetically."&lt;/ref&gt; as a concept for discussion of [[evolution]]ary principles in explaining the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. Examples of memes given in the book included melodies, [[catchphrase]]s, fashion, and the technology of building arches.&lt;ref name="selfish"&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|1989 | p = 352}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Pike]] coined the related terms [[emic|emic and etic]], generalizing the linguistic idea of [[phoneme]], [[morpheme]], [[grapheme]], [[lexeme]], and [[tagmeme]] (as set out by [[Leonard Bloomfield]]), characterizing them as insider view and outside view of behaviour and extending the concept into a tagmemic theory of human behaviour (culminating in ''Language in Relation to a Unified Theory of the Structure of Human Behaviour'', 1954).

== Origins ==

[[File:Richard dawkins lecture.jpg|175 px|left|alt=|thumb|[[Richard Dawkins]] coined the word ''meme'' in his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''.]]

The word ''meme'' originated with [[Richard Dawkins]]' 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''. Dawkins cites as inspiration the work of geneticist [[L. L. Cavalli-Sforza]], anthropologist F. T. Cloak&lt;ref&gt;Cultural microevolution, 1966. Research Previews 13: (2) pp. 7–10. Also presented at the November, 1966 annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; and ethologist J. M. Cullen.&lt;ref&gt;"Is a cultural ethology possible?" ''Hum. Ecol.'' 3, 161–182. Cullen, J. M. (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins wrote that evolution depended not on the particular chemical basis of genetics, but only on the existence of a self-replicating unit of transmission—in the case of biological evolution, the gene. For Dawkins, the meme exemplified another self-replicating unit with potential significance in explaining human behavior and cultural evolution.  Although Dawkins invented the term 'meme' and developed meme theory, the possibility that ideas were subject to the same pressures of evolution as were biological attributes was discussed in Darwin's time. T. H. Huxley claimed that 'The struggle for existence holds as much in the intellectual as in the physical world. A theory is a species of thinking, and its right to exist is coextensive with its power of resisting extinction by its rivals.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huxley|first=T. H.|title=The coming of age of 'The origin of species'|journal=(1880) Science|volume=1, 15–17.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kilroy was here (re-drawn).gif|thumb|right|"[[Kilroy was here]]" was a [[Graffiti|graffito]] that became popular in the 1940s, and existed under various names in different countries, illustrating how a meme can be modified through replication. This is seen as one of the first widespread memes in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/05/books/bk-5402 |title=Kilroy Was Here - Los Angeles Times |publisher=articles.latimes.com |date=2000-03-05 |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Dawkins used the term to refer to any cultural entity that an observer might consider a [[self-replication|replicator]]. He hypothesized that one could view many cultural entities as replicators, and pointed to melodies, fashions and learned skills as examples. Memes generally replicate through exposure to humans, who have evolved as efficient copiers of information and behavior. Because humans do not always copy memes perfectly, and because they may refine, combine or otherwise modify them with other memes to create new memes, they can change over time. Dawkins likened the process by which memes survive and change through the [[cultural evolution|evolution of culture]] to the natural selection of genes in biological [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="selfish"/&gt;

Dawkins defined the ''meme'' as a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation and replication, but later definitions would vary. The lack of a consistent, rigorous, and precise understanding of what typically makes up one unit of cultural transmission remains a problem in debates about [[memetics]].&lt;ref name="machine"&gt;{{harvnb|Blackmore|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the concept of genetics gained concrete evidence with the [[DNA#History of DNA research|discovery]] of the [[DNA#Biological functions|biological functions]] of [[DNA]]. Meme transmission requires a physical medium, such as photons, sound waves, touch, taste, or smell because memes can be transmitted only through the senses.

Dawkins noted that in a society with culture a person need not have descendants to remain influential in the actions of individuals thousands of years after their death:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But if you contribute to the world's culture, if you have a good idea...it may live on, intact, long after your genes have dissolved in the common pool. [[Socrates]] may or may not have a gene or two alive in the world today, as [[George C. Williams (biologist)|G.C. Williams]] has remarked, but who cares? The meme-complexes of Socrates, [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Copernicus]] and [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] are still going strong.&lt;ref name="The Selfish Gene 30th Anniversary Edition section on survival"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard |title=The Selfish Gene 30th Anniversary Edition |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191537554 |page=199 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Dawkins invented the term ''meme'', he has not claimed that the idea was entirely novel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/formerly-hyper-weird/memetics.html |title=Memes |website=Center for the Study of Complex Systems |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=14 August 2009 |last=Shalizi |first= Cosma Rohilla}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been other expressions for similar ideas in the past.&lt;ref name="mneme"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Laurent| first=John| year=1999| title=A Note on the Origin of 'Memes'/'Mnemes'| work=Journal of Memetics| volume=3 | issue=1| pages=14–19| url =http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/1999/vol3/laurent_j.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, [[Richard Semon]] published ''Die Mneme'' (which appeared in English in 1924 as ''The Mneme''). The term ''mneme'' was also used in [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s ''The Life of the White Ant'' (1926), with some parallels to Dawkins's concept.&lt;ref name=mneme/&gt;

== Memetic lifecycle: transmission, retention ==
{{See also|Diffusion of innovations}}&lt;!-- Similar process, although memes are not necessarily "innovations". Sections "Process" and "Rate of Adoption". --&gt;

Memes, analogously to genes, vary in their aptitude to replicate; successful memes remain and spread, whereas unfit ones stall and are forgotten. Thus memes that prove more effective at replicating and surviving are selected in the meme pool.

Memes first need retention. The longer a meme stays in its hosts, the higher its chances of propagation are. When a host uses a meme, the meme's life is extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heylighen|first=Francis|title=Meme replication: the memetic life-cycle|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MEMEREP.html|website=Principia Cybernetica|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reuse of the neural space hosting a certain meme's copy to host different memes is the greatest threat to that meme's copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=R. Evers|first=John|title=A justification of societal altruism according to the memetic application of Hamilton's rule|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Conf/MemePap/Evers.html|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meme which increases the longevity of its hosts will generally survive longer. On the contrary, a meme which shortens the longevity of its hosts will tend to disappear faster. However, as hosts are mortal, retention is not sufficient to perpetuate a meme in the long term; memes also need transmission.

Life-forms can transmit information both vertically (from parent to child, via replication of genes) and horizontally (through viruses and other means).
Memes can replicate vertically or horizontally within a single biological generation. They may also lie dormant for long periods of time.

Memes reproduce by copying from a nervous system to another one, either by communication or [[imitation]]. Imitation often involves the copying of an [[observation|observed]] behavior of another individual. Communication may be direct or indirect, where memes transmit from one individual to another through a copy recorded in an inanimate source, such as a book or a [[Sheet music|musical score]]. Adam McNamara has suggested that memes can be thereby classified as either internal or external memes (i-memes or e-memes).&lt;ref name="mcnamara" /&gt;

Some commentators have likened the transmission of memes to the spread of [[infectious disease|contagions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blackmore|1998}}; "The term 'contagion' is often associated with memetics. We may say that certain memes are contagious, or more contagious than others."&lt;/ref&gt; Social contagions such as [[Bandwagon effect|fads]], [[Hysterical contagion|hysteria]], [[copycat crime]], and [[copycat suicide]] exemplify memes seen as the contagious imitation of ideas. Observers distinguish the contagious imitation of memes from instinctively contagious phenomena such as yawning and laughing, which they consider innate (rather than socially learned) behaviors.&lt;ref name="defmeme"&gt;{{harvnb|Blackmore|1998}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aaron Lynch (writer)|Aaron Lynch]] described seven general patterns of meme transmission, or "thought contagion":&lt;ref name="lynch"&gt;{{harvnb|Lynch|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Quantity of parenthood'': an idea that influences the number of children one has. Children respond particularly receptively to the ideas of their parents, and thus ideas that directly or indirectly encourage a higher birthrate will replicate themselves at a higher rate than those that discourage higher birthrates.
# ''Efficiency of parenthood'': an idea that increases the proportion of children who will adopt ideas of their parents. Cultural [[separatism]] exemplifies one practice in which one can expect a higher rate of meme-replication—because the meme for separation creates a barrier from exposure to competing ideas.
# ''Proselytic'': ideas generally passed to others beyond one's own children. Ideas that encourage the [[proselytism]] of a meme, as seen in many religious or political movements, can replicate memes horizontally through a given generation, spreading more rapidly than parent-to-child meme-transmissions do.
# ''Preservational'': ideas that influence those that hold them to continue to hold them for a long time. Ideas that encourage longevity in their hosts, or leave their hosts particularly resistant to abandoning or replacing these ideas, enhance the preservability of memes and afford protection from the competition or proselytism of other memes.
# ''Adversative'': ideas that influence those that hold them to attack or sabotage competing ideas and/or those that hold them. Adversative replication can give an advantage in meme transmission when the meme itself encourages aggression against other memes.
# ''Cognitive'': ideas perceived as cogent by most in the population who encounter them. Cognitively transmitted memes depend heavily on a cluster of other ideas and cognitive traits already widely held in the population, and thus usually spread more passively than other forms of meme transmission. Memes spread in cognitive transmission do not count as self-replicating.
# ''Motivational'': ideas that people adopt because they perceive some self-interest in adopting them. Strictly speaking, motivationally transmitted memes do not self-propagate, but this mode of transmission often occurs in association with memes self-replicated in the efficiency parental, proselytic and preservational modes.

== Memes as discrete units ==

Dawkins initially defined ''meme'' as a noun that "conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of ''imitation''".&lt;ref name="selfish"/&gt; John S. Wilkins retained the notion of meme as a kernel of cultural imitation while emphasizing the meme's evolutionary aspect, defining the meme as "the least unit of sociocultural information relative to a selection process that has favorable or unfavorable selection bias that exceeds its endogenous tendency to change".&lt;ref name="wilkins"&gt;{{citation |last=Wilkins |first=John S. |title=What's in a Meme? Reflections from the perspective of the history and philosophy of evolutionary biology
|periodical=Journal of Memetics |publication-date=1998 |volume=2 |url=http://jom-emit.cfpm.org/}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The meme as a unit provides a convenient means of discussing "a piece of thought copied from person to person", regardless of whether that thought contains others inside it, or forms part of a larger meme. A meme could consist of a single word, or a meme could consist of the entire speech in which that word first occurred. This forms an analogy to the idea of a gene as a single unit of self-replicating information found on the self-replicating [[chromosome]].

While the identification of memes as "units" conveys their nature to replicate as discrete, indivisible entities, it does not imply that thoughts somehow become [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] or that "[[atom]]ic" ideas exist that cannot be dissected into smaller pieces. A meme has no given size. [[Susan Blackmore]] writes that melodies from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s symphonies are commonly used to illustrate the difficulty involved in delimiting memes as discrete units. She notes that while the first four notes of [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Fifth Symphony]] ({{Audio|Beet5mov1bars1to5.ogg|listen}}) form a meme widely replicated as an independent unit, one can regard the entire symphony as a single meme as well.&lt;ref name="machine"/&gt;

The inability to pin an idea or cultural feature to quantifiable key units is widely acknowledged as a problem for memetics. It has been argued however that the traces of memetic processing can be quantified utilizing neuroimaging techniques which measure changes in the connectivity profiles between brain regions."&lt;ref name="mcnamara"/&gt; Blackmore meets such criticism by stating that memes compare with genes in this respect: that while a [[gene]] has no particular size, nor can we ascribe every [[phenotype|phenotypic]] feature directly to a particular gene, it has value because it encapsulates that key unit of inherited expression subject to evolutionary pressures. To illustrate, she notes evolution selects for the gene for features such as eye color; it does not select for the individual nucleotide in a strand of [[DNA]]. Memes play a comparable role in understanding the evolution of imitated behaviors.&lt;ref name="machine"/&gt;

The 1981 book ''Genes, Mind, and Culture: The Coevolutionary Process'' by [[Charles J. Lumsden]] and [[E. O. Wilson]] proposed the theory that genes and culture co-evolve, and that the fundamental biological units of culture must correspond to neuronal networks that function as nodes of semantic [[memory]]. They coined their own word, "[[culturgen]]", which did not catch on. Coauthor Wilson later acknowledged the term ''meme'' as the best label for the fundamental unit of cultural inheritance in his 1998 book ''[[Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]]'', which elaborates upon the fundamental role of memes in unifying the [[Natural science|natural]] and [[social sciences|social]] sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary influences on memes==
Dawkins noted the three conditions that must exist for evolution to occur:&lt;ref name="conscious"&gt;{{harvnb|Dennett|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# variation, or the introduction of new change to existing elements;
# heredity or replication, or the capacity to create copies of elements;
# differential "fitness", or the opportunity for one element to be more or less suited to the environment than another.
Dawkins emphasizes that the process of evolution naturally occurs whenever these conditions co-exist, and that evolution does not apply only to organic elements such as genes. He regards memes as also having the properties necessary for evolution, and thus sees meme evolution as not simply analogous to genetic evolution, but as a real phenomenon subject to the laws of [[natural selection]]. Dawkins noted that as various ideas pass from one [[generation]] to the next, they may either enhance or detract from the survival of the people who obtain those ideas, or influence the survival of the ideas themselves. For example, a certain culture may develop unique designs and methods of [[tool]]-making that give it a competitive advantage over another culture. Each tool-design thus acts somewhat similarly to a biological [[gene]] in that some populations have it and others do not, and the meme's function directly affects the presence of the design in future generations. In keeping with the thesis that in evolution one can regard organisms simply as suitable "hosts" for reproducing genes, Dawkins argues that one can view people as "hosts" for replicating memes. Consequently, a successful meme may or may not need to provide any benefit to its host.&lt;ref name="conscious"/&gt;

Unlike genetic evolution, memetic evolution can show both [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] and [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] traits. Cultural memes will have the characteristic of Lamarckian inheritance when a host aspires to replicate the given meme through inference rather than by exactly copying it. Take for example the case of the transmission of a simple skill such as hammering a nail, a skill that a learner imitates from watching a demonstration without necessarily imitating every discrete movement modeled by the teacher in the demonstration, stroke for stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Blackmore]] distinguishes the difference between the two modes of inheritance in the evolution of memes, characterizing the Darwinian mode as "copying the instructions" and the Lamarckian as "copying the product."&lt;ref name="machine"/&gt;

Clusters of memes, or ''[[memeplex]]es'' (also known as ''meme complexes'' or as ''memecomplexes''), such as cultural or political doctrines and systems, may also play a part in the acceptance of new memes. Memeplexes comprise groups of memes that replicate together and coadapt.&lt;ref name="machine"/&gt; Memes that fit within a successful memeplex may gain acceptance by "piggybacking" on the success of the memeplex.
As an example, John D. Gottsch discusses the transmission, mutation and selection of religious memeplexes and the theistic memes contained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/2001/vol5/gottsch_jd.html "Mutation, Selection, And Vertical Transmission Of Theistic Memes In Religious Canons"] in ''Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission'', Volume 5, Issue 1, 2001. Online version retrieved 2008-01-27.
&lt;/ref&gt; Theistic memes discussed include the "prohibition of aberrant sexual practices such as incest, adultery, homosexuality, bestiality, castration, and religious prostitution", which may have increased vertical transmission of the parent religious memeplex. Similar memes are thereby included in the majority of religious memeplexes, and harden over time; they become an "inviolable canon" or set of [[dogma]]s, eventually finding their way into secular [[law]]. This could also be referred to as the propagation of a [[taboo]].

==Memetics==
{{Main|Memetics}}

The discipline of memetics, which dates from the mid-1980s, provides an approach to [[evolutionary model]]s of cultural [[information transfer]] based on the concept of the meme. [[Memeticist]]s have proposed that just as memes function analogously to [[gene]]s, memetics functions analogously to [[genetics]]. Memetics attempts to apply conventional scientific methods (such as those used in [[population genetics]] and [[epidemiology]]) to explain existing patterns and transmission of [[culture|cultural]] ideas.

Principal criticisms of memetics include the claim that memetics ignores established advances in other fields of cultural study, such as [[sociology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[social psychology]]. Questions remain whether or not the meme concept counts as a [[philosophy of science|validly disprovable]] scientific theory. This view regards memetics as a theory in its infancy: a [[protoscience]] to proponents, or a [[pseudoscience]] to some detractors.

==Criticism of meme theory==
An objection to the study of the evolution of memes in genetic terms (although not to the existence of memes) involves a perceived gap in the gene/meme analogy: the cumulative evolution of genes depends on biological selection-pressures neither too great nor too small in relation to mutation-rates. There seems no reason to think that the same balance will exist in the selection pressures on memes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Sterelny|Griffiths|1999}}; p. 333
&lt;/ref&gt;

Luis Benitez-Bribiesca M.D., a critic of memetics, calls the theory a "[[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[dogma]]" and "a dangerous idea that poses a threat to the serious study of [[consciousness]] and [[Sociocultural evolution|cultural evolution]]". As a factual criticism, Benitez-Bribiesca points to the lack of a "code script" for memes (analogous to the DNA of genes), and to the excessive instability of the meme mutation mechanism (that of an idea going from one brain to another), which would lead to a low replication accuracy and a high mutation rate, rendering the evolutionary process chaotic.&lt;ref&gt;

British political philosopher [[John N. Gray|John Gray]] has characterized Dawkins' memetic theory of religion as "nonsense" and "not even a theory... the latest in a succession of ill-judged Darwinian metaphors", comparable to [[Intelligent Design]] in its value as a science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/15/society | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=John | last=Gray | title=John Gray on secular fundamentalists | date=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critique comes from [[semiotic]] theorists such as Deacon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deacon | first1 = Terrence | authorlink = Terrence Deacon | year = | title = The trouble with memes (and what to do about it)| url = | journal = The Semiotic Review of Books | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kull | first1 = Kalevi | authorlink = Kalevi Kull | year = 2000 | title = Copy versus translate, meme versus sign: development of biological textuality | url = | journal = European Journal for Semiotic Studies | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 101–120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view regards the concept of "meme" as a primitivized concept of [[Sign (semiotics)|"sign"]]. The meme is thus described in memetics as a sign lacking a [[Sign (semiotics)#Triadic signs|triadic]] nature. Semioticians can regard a meme as a "degenerate" sign, which includes only its ability of being copied. Accordingly, in the broadest sense, the objects of copying are memes, whereas the objects of translation and interpretation are signs.{{Clarify|date=February 2009|reason=This last paragraph could be better explained.

&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] disapproved of Dawkins' gene-based view and usage of the term "meme", asserting it to be an "unnecessary synonym" for "[[concept]]", reasoning that concepts are not restricted to an individual or a generation, may persist for long periods of time, and may evolve.&lt;ref name=pNASmayr&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayr |first1=Ernst |year=1997 |title=The objects of selection |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=94 |issue=6 |pages=2091–2094 |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.6.2091 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/94/6/2091.full |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6L9TOiSj0?url=http://www.pnas.org/content/94/6/2091.full |archivedate=November 15, 2013 |pmid=9122151 |pmc=33654 |deadurl=yes |df= |bibcode=1997PNAS...94.2091M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Opinions differ as to how best to apply the concept of memes within a "proper" disciplinary framework. One view sees memes as providing a useful philosophical perspective with which to examine cultural evolution. Proponents of this view (such as [[Susan Blackmore]] and [[Daniel Dennett]]) argue that considering cultural developments from a meme's-eye view—''as if'' memes themselves respond to pressure to maximise their own replication and survival—can lead to useful insights and yield valuable predictions into how culture develops over time. Others such as Bruce Edmonds and Robert Aunger have focused on the need to provide an empirical grounding for memetics to become a useful and respected [[scientific discipline]].&lt;ref&gt;
See {{citation |url=http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/2002/vol6/edmonds_b_letter.html |last=Edmonds |first=Bruce |publication-date=September 2002 |volume=6 |issue=2 |title=Three Challenges for the Survival of Memetics |work=Journal of Memetics - Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission |accessdate=2009-02-03}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Aunger|2000}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A third approach, described by Joseph Poulshock, as "radical memetics" seeks to place memes at the centre of a [[Eliminative materialism|materialistic]] [[theory of mind]] and of [[personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Poulshock|2002}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent researchers in [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[anthropology]], including [[Scott Atran]], [[Dan Sperber]], [[Pascal Boyer]], [[John Tooby]] and others, argue the possibility of incompatibility between [[modularity of mind]] and memetics.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} In their view, minds structure certain communicable aspects of the ideas produced, and these communicable aspects generally trigger or elicit ideas in other minds through inference (to relatively rich structures generated from often low-fidelity input) and not high-fidelity replication or imitation. Atran discusses communication involving religious beliefs as a case in point. In one set of experiments he asked religious people to write down on a piece of paper the meanings of the [[Ten Commandments]]. Despite the subjects' own expectations of consensus, interpretations of the commandments showed wide ranges of variation, with little evidence of consensus. In another experiment, subjects with autism and subjects without autism interpreted ideological and religious sayings (for example, "Let a thousand flowers bloom" or "To everything there is a season"). People with autism showed a significant tendency to closely paraphrase and repeat content from the original statement (for example: "Don't cut flowers before they bloom"). Controls tended to infer a wider range of cultural meanings with little replicated content (for example: "Go with the flow" or "Everyone should have equal opportunity"). Only the subjects with autism—who lack the degree of inferential capacity normally associated with aspects of [[theory of mind]]—came close to functioning as "meme machines".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atran|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Robot's Rebellion'', [[Keith Stanovich|Stanovich]] uses the memes and memeplex concepts to describe a program of cognitive reform that he refers to as a "rebellion". Specifically, Stanovich argues that the use of memes as a descriptor for cultural units is beneficial because it serves to emphasize transmission and acquisition properties that parallel the study of [[epidemiology]]. These properties make salient the sometimes parasitic nature of acquired memes, and as a result individuals should be motivated to reflectively acquire memes using what he calls a "[[Neurathian bootstrap]]" process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanovich|first=Keith E.|date=2004|accessdate=|title=The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin|edition=1st|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-77089-5|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{See also|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}

Although social scientists such as [[Max Weber]] sought to understand and explain [[religion]] in terms of a cultural attribute, Richard Dawkins called for a re-analysis of religion in terms of the evolution of self-replicating ideas ''apart from'' any resulting biological advantages they might bestow.
{{quote|As an enthusiastic Darwinian, I have been dissatisfied with explanations that my fellow-enthusiasts have offered for human behaviour. They have tried to look for 'biological advantages' in various attributes of human civilization. For instance, tribal religion has been seen as a mechanism for solidifying group identity, valuable for a pack-hunting species whose individuals rely on cooperation to catch large and fast prey. Frequently the evolutionary preconception in terms of which such theories are framed is implicitly group-selectionist, but it is possible to rephrase the theories in terms of orthodox gene selection.|[[Richard Dawkins]]|''[[The Selfish Gene]]''}}

He argued that the role of key replicator in cultural evolution belongs not to genes, but to memes replicating thought from person to person by means of imitation. These replicators respond to selective pressures that may or may not affect biological reproduction or survival.&lt;ref name="selfish"/&gt;

In her book ''The Meme Machine'', [[Susan Blackmore]] regards religions as particularly tenacious memes. Many of the features common to the most widely practiced religions provide built-in advantages in an evolutionary context, she writes. For example, religions that preach of the value of [[faith]] over [[evidence]] from everyday experience or [[reason]] inoculate societies against many of the most basic tools people commonly use to evaluate their ideas. By linking [[altruism]] with religious affiliation, religious memes can proliferate more quickly because people perceive that they can reap societal as well as personal rewards. The longevity of religious memes improves with their documentation in revered [[scripture|religious texts]].&lt;ref name="machine"/&gt;

[[Aaron Lynch (writer)|Aaron Lynch]] attributed the robustness of religious memes in human culture to the fact that such memes incorporate multiple modes of meme transmission. Religious memes pass down the generations from parent to child and across a single generation through the meme-exchange of [[proselytism]]. Most people will hold the religion taught them by their parents throughout their life. Many religions feature adversarial elements, punishing [[apostasy]], for instance, or demonizing [[infidels]]. In ''Thought Contagion'' Lynch identifies the memes of transmission in [[Christianity]] as especially powerful in scope. Believers view the conversion of non-believers both as a religious duty and as an act of altruism. The promise of [[heaven]] to believers and threat of [[hell]] to non-believers provide a strong incentive for members to retain their belief. Lynch asserts that belief in the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] in Christianity amplifies each of its other replication advantages through the indebtedness believers have to their [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Savior]] for sacrifice on the cross. The image of the crucifixion recurs in religious [[sacrament]]s, and the proliferation of symbols of the [[Christian cross|cross]] in homes and churches potently reinforces the wide array of Christian memes.&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt;

Although religious memes have proliferated in human cultures, the modern scientific community has been relatively resistant to religious belief. Robertson (2007) &lt;ref name=Robertson2007&gt;{{citation |author = Robertson, Lloyd Hawkeye|year=2007 | title=Reflections on the use of spirituality to privilege religion in scientific discourse: Incorporating considerations of self |journal = Journal of Religion and Health | volume = 46|issue=3 |pages=449–461 |doi = 10.1007/s10943-006-9105-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; reasoned that if evolution is accelerated in conditions of propagative difficulty,&lt;ref name=Dennett1995&gt;{{citation |last = Dennett|first= Daniel C.|year=1995| title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the meanings of life|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; then we would expect to encounter variations of religious memes, established in general populations, addressed to scientific communities. Using a memetic approach, Robertson deconstructed two attempts to privilege religiously held spirituality in scientific discourse. Advantages of a memetic approach as compared to more traditional "modernization" and "supply side" theses in understanding the evolution and propagation of religion were explored.

==Memetic explanations of racism==
In ''Cultural Software: A Theory of Ideology'', [[Jack Balkin]] argued that memetic processes can explain many of the most familiar features of [[ideology|ideological]] thought. His theory of "cultural software" maintained that memes form [[narrative]]s, social networks, metaphoric and [[metonymy|metonymic]] models, and a variety of different mental structures. Balkin maintains that the same structures used to generate ideas about free speech or free markets also serve to generate racistic beliefs. To Balkin, whether memes become harmful or maladaptive depends on the environmental context in which they exist rather than in any special source or manner to their origination. Balkin describes racist beliefs as "fantasy" memes that &lt;!-- may? or must? --&gt;become harmful or unjust "ideologies" when diverse peoples come together, as through trade or competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Balkin|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural memes==
In ''[[A Theory of Architecture]]'', [[Nikos Salingaros]] speaks of memes as "freely propagating clusters of information" which can be beneficial or harmful. He contrasts memes to [[Pattern language|patterns]] and true knowledge, characterizing memes as "greatly simplified versions of patterns" and as "unreasoned matching to some visual or mnemonic prototype".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikos Salingaros]]: ''Theory of Architecture'', chapter 12: ''Architectural memes in a universe of information'', {{ISBN|3-937954-07-4}}, Umbau-Verlag, 2006, 2008, pp. 243, 260&lt;/ref&gt; Taking reference to Dawkins, Salingaros emphasizes that they can be transmitted due to their own communicative properties, that "the simpler they are, the faster they can proliferate", and that the most successful memes "come with a great psychological appeal".&lt;ref&gt;Salingaros, 2008. pp. 243–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural memes, according to Salingaros, can have destructive power. "Images portrayed in architectural magazines representing buildings that could not possibly accommodate everyday uses become fixed in our memory, so we reproduce them unconsciously."&lt;ref name="Sal08"&gt;Salingaros, 2008. p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; He lists various architectural memes that circulated since the 1920s and which, in his view, have led to contemporary architecture becoming quite decoupled from human needs. They lack connection and meaning, thereby preventing "the creation of true connections necessary to our understanding of the world". He sees them as no different from [[antipattern]]s in software design—as solutions that are false but are re-utilized nonetheless.&lt;ref&gt;Salingaros, 2008. p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet culture==
{{Main|Internet meme}}
{{see also|List of Internet phenomena}}

An "Internet meme" is a concept that spreads rapidly from person to person via the [[Internet]], largely through Internet-based [[E-mail]]ing, [[blog]]s, [[Internet forum|forums]], [[imageboard]]s like [[4chan]], [[social networking site]]s like [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], or [[Twitter]], [[instant messaging]], [[social news site]]s or thread sites like [[Reddit]], and [[video hosting service]]s like [[YouTube]] and [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]].&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2003-07-28-ebay-weirdness_x.htm|publisher=USA Today|first=Karen |last=Schubert|title=Bazaar goes bizarre|accessdate=2007-07-05|date=2003-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Richard Dawkins characterized an Internet meme as one deliberately altered by human creativity, distinguished from Dawkins's original idea involving mutation by random change and a form of Darwinian selection.&lt;ref name=Wired20130620&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/20/richard-dawkins-memes |title=Richard Dawkins on the internet's hijacking of the word 'meme' |last=Solon |first=Olivia |date=June 20, 2013 |website=Wired UK |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HzDGE9Go?url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/20/richard-dawkins-memes |archivedate=July 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meme maps==
One technique of meme mapping represents the evolution and transmission of a meme across time and space.&lt;ref name=Paull2009&gt;{{Citation | author = Paull, John | year = 2009 | title = Meme Maps: A Tool for Configuring Memes in Time and Space | url = http://orgprints.org/15752/1/15752.pdf | journal = European Journal of Scientific Research | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 11–18 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a meme map uses a figure-8 diagram (an [[analemma]]) to map the gestation (in the lower loop), birth (at the choke point), and development (in the upper loop) of the selected meme. Such meme maps are nonscalar, with time mapped onto the y-axis and space onto the x-axis [[transect]]. One can read the temporal progression of the mapped meme from south to north on such a meme map. Paull has published a worked example using the "organics meme" (as in [[organic agriculture]]).&lt;ref name=Paull2009/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15504">The term '''middlebrow''' describes easily accessible [[art]], usually [[literature]], and the people who use the arts to acquire culture and "class" ([[Reputation|social prestige]]). First used in the British satire magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1925, the term ''middlebrow'' is the intermediary "brow" descriptor between ''[[highbrow]]'' and ''[[Low culture|lowbrow]]'', which are terms derived from the pseudo-science of [[phrenology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Middlebrow |work=Oxford English Dictionary |date=23 February 2008 |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00309091?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=middlebrow&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term middlebrow became a pejorative usage in the [[Modernism|modernist]] cultural criticism, by [[Dwight Macdonald]], [[Virginia Woolf]], and [[Russell Lynes]], which served the cause of the marginalization of the popular culture in favor of [[high culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Pask, K. ''The Fairy Way of Writing'' (2013) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally, the middlebrow is classed as a forced and ineffective attempt at cultural and intellectual achievement, and as characterizing literature that emphasizes emotional and sentimental connections, rather than intellectual quality and literary innovation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2011/10/12/middlebrow_origins_and_insults.html |title=Is "Middlebrow" Still An Insult? |work=Slate |date=October 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[postmodernism]] more readily perceives the advantages of the middlebrow cultural-position that is aware of high culture, but is able to balance aesthetic claims with the claims of the everyday world.&lt;ref&gt;David Cardiff, ''Mass Middlebrow Laughter' ''Media, Culture and Society'' 10 (1988), 41-60&lt;/ref&gt;

== Virginia Woolf ==
[[Virginia Woolf]] derided the middlebrow in an un-posted letter to the editor of the ''New Statesman &amp; Nation'', concerning a radio broadcast that attacked the Highbrows.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lee, ''Virginia Woolf'' (1996) p. 634&lt;/ref&gt; That letter was posthumously published in the essay collection ''[[The Death of the Moth]]'' (1942).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woolf |first=Virginia |chapter=Middlebrow |title=The Death of the Moth, and Other Essays |location=London |publisher=Hogarth Press |year=1942 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hilobrow.com/2009/03/04/woolf-contra-middlebrow/|title=Woolf contra Middlebrow – HiLobrow|website=hilobrow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woolf criticizes middlebrows as petty purveyors of highbrow cultures for their own shallow benefit. Rather than selecting books for their intrinsic cultural value, middlebrow people select and read what they are told is best. Middlebrows are concerned with ''how'' what they do makes them appear, unlike highbrows, the avant-garde men and women who act according to their indelible commitment to [[beauty]], [[value (ethics)|value]], [[art]], form, and [[integrity]]. Woolf said that, "We highbrows read what we like and do what we like and praise what we like". Likewise, a lowbrow is devoted to a singular interest, a  person "of thoroughbred vitality who rides his body in pursuit of a living at a gallop across life"; and, therefore, the lowbrow are equally worthy of reverence, as they, too, are living for what they intrinsically know as valuable.

Instead of such freedom, the middlebrows are "betwixt and between", which Woolf classifies as "in pursuit of no single object, neither Art itself nor life itself, but both mixed indistinguishably, and rather nastily, with money, fame, power, or prestige." Their value system rewards quick gains through literature already designated as 'Classic' and 'Great', never of their own choosing, because "to buy living art requires living taste." The middlebrow are meretricious—which is much less demanding than [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].

== Russell Lynes: "Highbrow, Lowbrow, Middlebrow" ==
''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' editor [[Russell Lynes]] satirized Virginia Woolf's highbrow scorn in the article "Highbrow, Lowbrow, Middlebrow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lynes |first=Russell |title=The Tastemakers |location=New York |publisher=Harper |year=1954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting her and other highbrow proponents, such as art critic [[Clement Greenberg]], Lynes parodied the highbrow's pompous superiority by noting how the subtle distinctions Woolf found significant among the "brows" were just means of upholding cultural superiority. Specifically, he parodies the highbrow claim that the products a person uses distinguishes his or her level of cultural worth, by satirically identifying the products that would identify a middlebrow person.

Lynes continued distinguishing among "brows", dividing middlebrow into upper-middlebrow and lower-middlebrow. The upper-middlebrow's arts patronage makes highbrow activity possible. Museums, orchestras, operas, and publishing houses are run by upper-middlebrows. The lower middlebrows attempt using the arts for self-enhancement: "hell-bent on improving their minds as well as their fortunes". They also intend to live the simple, easy life outlined in advertisements; "lower middlebrow-ism" was "a world that smells of soap". Caricaturing Woolf, Lynes outlined the perfect world without middlebrows; lowbrows work and highbrows create pure art.

Months later, ''Life'' magazine asked Lynes to specifically distinguish among the right foods, furniture, clothes, and arts for each of the four 'brows'. That began national preoccupation, as people tried to identify their proper social class, based upon their favorite things. Although ''middlebrow'' often has connoted contempt, Lynes lauded the zeal and aspirations of the middlebrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rubin |first=Joan Shelley |title=The Making of Middlebrow Culture |location=Chapel Hill |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=1992 |isbn=0807820105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Priestley's defence==
[[J. B. Priestley]] sought to create a positive cultural space around the concept of middlebrow &amp;ndash; one characterised by earnestness, friendliness and ethical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;B. Driscoll, ''The New literary Middlebrow'' (2014) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; He couched his defense of the middlebrow in terms of radio stations, praising the [[BBC Home Service]] for its cosiness and plainness, midway between the [[Light Programme]] and the [[Third Programme]]: "Between the raucous lowbrows and the lisping highbrows is a fine gap, meant for the middle or broadbrows...our homely fashion".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Richard Hoggart]], ''The Uses of Literacy'' (1957) p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

In a struggle that involved competition for readers as well as for cultural capital, Virginia Woolf responded by renaming the BBC the "Betwixt and Between Company".&lt;ref&gt;M. Cuddy-Keane, ''Virginia Woolf, the Intellectual, and the Public Sphere'' (2014) p. 21-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dwight Macdonald: "Masscult and Midcult"==
[[Dwight Macdonald]]'s critique of middlebrow culture, "Masscult and Midcult" (1960), associated the modern industrial drive, away from specialization and the folk, with creating a mass-market arts, and, therefore, anonymous consumers of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macdonald |first=Dwight |chapter=Masscult and Midcult |title=Essays Against the American Grain |location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=1962 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., highbrow culture is associated with specialization for the connoisseurs, while lowbrow culture entails authentic folk products made for specific communities. Mass culture (masscult) copies and manipulates both traditions, with factory-created products, made without innovation or care, expressly for the market, "to please the crowd by any means", thereby creating an American society in which "a pluralistic culture cannot exist", wherein the rule is cultural homogeneity.

In contrast Midcult (middle culture), came about with middlebrow culture, and dangerously copies and adulterates high culture, by way of "a tepid ooze of Midcult", which threatens high culture, with dramaturgy, literature, and architecture, such as ''[[Our Town]]'' (1938), ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' (1952), and [[Collegiate Gothic in North America|American collegiate gothic architecture]].

The Middlebrow "pretends to respect the standards of High Culture, while, in fact, it waters them down and vulgarizes them." Macdonald recommended a separation of the brows, so that "the few who care about good writing, painting, music, architecture, philosophy, etc. have their High Culture, and don't fuzz up the distinction with the Midcult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collected|title=The Oprah Affect: Critical Essays on Oprah's Book Club|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fisVBiAYCAC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=oprah+winfrey+book+club+middlebrow&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R1mzZA8aBr&amp;sig=54AusU_yUzMbuGFCBad494UJDX8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0EIoU4KWLtOP0gHcnYGADA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=oprah%20winfrey%20book%20club%20middlebrow&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketed middlebrow==
The [[Book-of-the-Month Club]] and [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Oprah's Book Club|Book Club]] have been widely characterized as middlebrow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=Hillary|title=We Don't Need Oprah's Book Club | url=https://newrepublic.com/article/88941/oprah-winfrey-book-club-dickens-karenina |publisher=[[The New Republic]] | date = May 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; marketed to bring classics and 'highbrow' literature to the middle class. This was particularly highlighted when author [[Jonathan Franzen]], after his book ''[[The Corrections]]'' was selected, remarked in several publications that some of Oprah's book club picks were middlebrow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bosman|first=Julie|title=Oprah Picks Franzen for Final Book Club|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/oprah-picks-franzen-for-final-book-club/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her seminal account of the Book-of-the-Month Club (as it was from its inception in 1926 to the 1980s before it transformed to a purely commercial operation), ''A Feeling for Books'', Janice Radway argues that middlebrow culture is not simply a diluted impersonation of highbrow, but instead distinctly defined itself in defiance of avant-garde high culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radway|first=Janice|title=A Feeling for Books: The Book-Of-The-Month Club, Literary Taste, and Middle-Class Desire|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/426514.A_Feeling_for_Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The club provided subscribers with literature selected by expert and 'generalist' judges, but held the personal, emotional experience of reading a good book as paramount, while simultaneously maintaining 'high standards' for literary quality. In this way, the club was in opposition to the general criticism of middlebrow culture in that it is forced high culture. Instead, Radway demonstrates that the middlebrow culture allows readers to simultaneously access the emotional and intellectual challenges that good reading provides. Radway also identifies the conflicting gender messages sent by the selections. While the club was marketed extensively to the female reader, including its emphasis on the emotional pleasure of books, the focus on intellectual, academic literature of the middlebrow trapped the reader into the constrictive masculine standards of value, classifying 'great books' as those that fell in line with male, technical classifications of excellence.

==Contemporary middlebrow==
''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate Magazine]]'' suggests that the late 2000s and early 2010s could potentially be considered the "golden age of middlebrow art"—pointing to television shows ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Mad Men]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'' and ''[[The Wire]]'' and novels ''[[Freedom (Jonathan Franzen novel)|Freedom]]'', ''[[The Marriage Plot]]'' and ''[[A Visit from the Goon Squad]]''. ''Slate'' also defines the films of [[Aaron Sorkin]] as middlebrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_completist/2012/06/the_complete_works_of_aaron_sorkin_from_the_west_wing_to_the_social_network_to_the_newsroom_.html |title=You Can't Handle the Truth About Aaron Sorkin |work=Slate |date=June 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that ''Slate'' itself is middlebrow journalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://declineofgenius.com/media/has-slate-declined-31082010/ Has Slate Declined?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105023911/http://declineofgenius.com/media/has-slate-declined-31082010/ |date=2011-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2012 article for ''[[Jewish Ideas Daily]]'', Peodair Leihy described the work of poet and songwriter [[Leonard Cohen]] as "a kind of pop—upper-middle-brow to lower-high-brow, to be sure, but pop nonetheless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/1086/features/old-new-leonard/ |title=Old-New Leonard |work=Jewish Ideas Daily |date=March 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This aesthetic was further theorized in an essay from November that year for ''[[The American Scholar]]'' that saw [[William Deresiewicz]] propose the addition of "upper middle brow," a culture falling between masscult and midcult. He defined it as, "infinitely subtler than Midcult. It is post- rather than pre-ironic, its sentimentality hidden by a veil of cool. It is edgy, clever, knowing, stylish, and formally inventive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theamericanscholar.org/upper-middle-brow/|title=Upper Middle Brow|first=William|last=Deresiewicz|date=4 November 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Macy Halford characterizes ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' and ''The New Yorker'' itself as "often [being] viewed as prime examples of the middlebrow: both magazines are devoted to the high but also to making it accessible to many; to bringing ideas that might remain trapped in ivory towers and academic books, or in high-art (or film or theatre) scenes, into the pages of a relatively inexpensive periodical that can be bought at bookstores and newsstands across the country (and now on the Internet)." She also notes the internet's effect on the middlebrow debate: "[[Internet]] is forcing us to rethink (again) what "middlebrow" means: in an era when the highest is as accessible as the lowest—accessible in the sense that both are only a click away ... —we actually have to think anew about how to walk that middle line." Halford describes [[Wikipedia]]: "...Wiki is itself a kind of middlebrow product" and links to this middlebrow entry "because it actually provides a smart summary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halford|first=Macy|title=On "Middlebrow"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2011/02/on-middlebrow.html}}''The New Yorker''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Missionary kids''' (or '''MKs''') are the children of [[missionary]] parents, and thus born and/or raised abroad (that is, on the "mission-field"). They form a subset of [[third culture kids]] (TCKs). The term is more specifically applied when these children return to their "home" or passport country (the country of their citizenship), and often experience various difficulties identifying with fellow citizens and integrating "back" into their "home" culture. The resulting feeling is described as "reverse [[culture shock]]".

There is some confusion between the terms MK and TCK. According to the definition developed by [[Ruth Hill Useem]], TCKs are people who have spent a significant part of their developmental years outside their parents' culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Third Culture Kids'', pp. 21–23&lt;/ref&gt; TCK is a broad term that encompasses all children who have grown up abroad (i.e. military kids, diplomats' kids, immigrants). Missionary kids are just one of the many categories of kids who qualify as TCKs. Therefore, while all MKs are TCKs, not all TCKs are MKs.

In the past MKs usually were thought of{{by whom|date=September 2014}} only as American or European, but there is {{as of | 2014 | lc = on}} a growing number of MKs from other countries, especially Protestant Christian MKs from [[South Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.intervarsity.org/ism/article/346 Increase of non-Western missionaries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529025134/http://www.intervarsity.org/ism/article/346 |date=2006-05-29 }}&amp;nbsp;— by InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA. (accessed 2007-04-04).
&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[Latin America]]. Generally, this term applies to [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christians]];{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}; however, it can be applied to any [[Religious denomination|denomination]] of a religion.

==Definition==

===Life overseas===
While MKs often identify more with the culture or country where they were raised (and this could be multiple cities, countries, or continents) than with where their parents were raised, they are not fully at home in any one culture. [[David C. Pollock]] and Van Reken attribute this feeling of displacement, or rootlessness, to a lack of emotional connection to their home culture (where they "should" feel connected).&lt;ref&gt;''Third Culture Kids'', pp. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Many MKs find it difficult to answer questions about where they are from or where home is as they may feel more of an emotional connection to their host culture than to their "home" culture. However, at the same time many MKs are completely aware that they can never fully fit into their host culture. This is especially obvious to MKs growing up in countries where they look different from the local population. Pollock and Van Reken developed the PolVan Cultural Identity Model to explain cultural identity in relationship to the surrounding culture. The Model names four categories into which a person can fall based on how they look and think compared to the culture around them:&lt;ref&gt;''Third Culture Kids'' pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;
;Foreigner : look ''different'', think ''different''
;Adopted : look ''different'', think ''alike''
;Hidden Immigrant : look ''alike'', think ''different''
;Mirror : look ''alike'', think ''alike''

When MKs first transition to their new or "host" culture, they are in the foreigner category. As they continue the transition and begin to acclimate and feel at home in their host culture, MKs move into the adopted category, often to the point where MKs feel more at home in the host culture than in their passport culture. At this point, the host culture becomes the MK's home culture. Upon returning to their passport culture, MKs often find themselves in the hidden immigrant category. Because they look like their peers, their extended family remembers how they were prior to their international move and expect them to hold similar views and to act as a typical citizen of that passport country would act. However, as hidden immigrants, MKs look like their family and friends, but more often than not hold many differing views and opinions. Additionally, MKs may not be aware of many of the pop culture influences within their passport country, yet are aware of world and regional issues, which most citizens of their passport country are unaware of. This cultural disconnect can cause awkwardness when they return to their passport country.&lt;ref&gt;*Klemens &amp; Bikos, p. 721&lt;/ref&gt;

Children in the MKs' passport countries often find it difficult to relate to missionary children, and vice versa. While MKs may find the lives of their peers in their passport countries to be boring, sometimes creating challenging social situations, passport country kids may be intimidated by MKs' experience abroad. Cultural miscommunications are common and interesting. While MKs often find it difficult to relate to people from their home culture or target culture, they get along with other MKs very well, even those who are missionaries to (or from) a completely different country. It is the commonality of differences that draws MKs together.

MKs tend to be open-minded and tolerant of many diverse cultures. They often feel more at home in culturally rich environments and can be "homesick" for their foreign home. Their knowledge of a country and its culture typically exceeds language fluency. Upon returning to their passport country, MKs possess unique skills that can be helpful to academics and governments. Because of their international experience, they often have a much broader worldview than their peers. This broader worldview can also lead to mixed emotions about their passport country and its foreign policies.

===Return to passport country===
Children who immigrate to the United States have similar experience to MKs when it comes to learning a new culture and making cross-cultural transitions. But according to Pollack and Van Reken, what truly distinguishes MKs from children who immigrate to the United States or other countries is "the full expectation that after living for a significant period of their developmental years outside their passport culture, there will  come the day when TCKs make a permanent return to that country and culture."&lt;ref&gt;''Third Culture Kids'' p 225&lt;/ref&gt; MKs return to their passport country for many reasons, including the beginning of their college education, a shift in their parents' career, and even evacuation in more extreme cases. Extended family and friends's excitement at MKs' return does not usually carry over to the MK. The events surrounding an MK's return may be traumatic (such as in the event of an evacuation due to political unrest), but even under normal circumstances MKs' return to their country of citizenship is a cause of stress and grief. Anxiety and depressions are the two emotions most commonly associated with cross-cultural transitions, caused by a sense of vulnerability and loss of control.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Headley, et al. p 187&lt;/ref&gt;

To help MKs cope with the transition back to the United States, many colleges, particularly Christian colleges, have chapters of a student organization called "Mu Kappa International".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mukappa.org Mu Kappa International website]&lt;/ref&gt; Mu Kappa aims to help MKs and other TCKs with the transition to American culture and college life. Mu Kappa was founded in 1985 at [[Taylor University]], and has since spread to more than forty other American colleges and universities.

Another frequently used method of helping MKs cope with transitioning from their foreign home to their passport culture is through transition seminars. These seminars typically take place during the summer before an MK's freshman year of college and teach MKs the basics of everyday life in America, including putting gas in a car, opening a bank account, grocery shopping, and many other every day tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Headley, et al. p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these seminar can help MKs understand how to deal with the grief of permanently transitioning back to their passport country in a healthy way, and how to manage the stress of a new environment and reverse culture shock.

Although Kadhim was born to a [[Shia]] family,&lt;ref name="Al-Waqt 2007"/&gt; he sees it as no more than a historical coincidence which "does not entail anything". In an interview with [[Al-Waqt|''Al-Waqt'' newspaper]], he stated that joining college in 1991 was an important turn in his life which until then had been influenced by the [[Islamic revival]] in the early 1980s. Kadhim recalled that he took part in several religious activities in his childhood. He refused to be classified as Islamist, Shia Islamist or even Shia intellectual,&lt;ref name="Al-Waqt 2007"/&gt; but considered the Islamic faith and culture that he grew up with as a paving factor to his embracing of [[postmodernism]] ideas and distancing him from [[modernism]].&lt;ref name="Al-Waqt 2007"&gt;{{cite news|author=Fadhel Adnan|title=الكاتب نادر كاظم في حوار مطول مع "الوقت": لو وجدت الصحوة الإسلامية في العشرينات أو الثلاثينات لما كان لها صدى كبير في البحرين |trans-title=Author Nader Kadhim in a lengthy interview with "''Al-Waqt''": If the Islamic Revival was present at the Twenties or Thirties, it would not have had made a significant impact in Bahrain|language=Arabic|work=[[Al-Waqt]]|date=12 August 2007|url=http://bahrainonline.org/showthread.php?t=182470|publisher=[[Bahrain Online]]&lt;!--the source is an offline copy of Al-Waqt.

In February 2007, Kadhim was honored by [[Al-Wasat (Bahraini newspaper)|''Al-Wasat'' newspaper]] for his "contributions to the intellectual and cultural" debate in Bahrain. During the event, [[Mansoor al-Jamri]], the editor-in-chief of ''Al-Wasat'' praised Kadhim for his anti-sectarian writings and said he was an exceptional writer. Several other academics and journalists praised him as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=رئيس التحرير منصور الجمري: نعتز بك يا نادر... ونشد على يديك|language=Arabic|trans-title=Editor-in-chief Mansoor al-Jamri: We are proud of you Nader... and we squeeze on your hands|accessdate=2 April 2014|date=15 February 2007|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/1623/news/read/216125/1.html|work=Al-Wasat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Kadhim is author to many literature and cultural criticism articles and studies published in Bahraini and Arabic media. Between 2003 and 2013, he has published nine books, two of them earning the "Bahraini outstanding book" award in 2003 and 2004.&lt;ref name="13 April 2013"/&gt;

The '''Nine Lyric''' or '''Melic Poets''' were a canonical group of [[ancient Greek poetry|ancient Greek]] poets esteemed by the scholars of [[Hellenistic]] [[Alexandria]] as worthy of critical study. In the [[Palatine Anthology]] it is said that they established lyric song. &lt;ref&gt;J. M. Edmonds - [https://books.google.com/books?id=CdLGSRQvDYMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Lyra Graeca (p.3)] Wildside Press LLC, 2007 {{ISBN|1434491307}} [Retrieved 2015-05-06]&lt;/ref&gt;

They were:
*[[Alcman]] of [[Sparta]] (choral lyric, 7th century BC)
*[[Sappho]] of [[Lesbos]] (monodic lyric, {{circa|lk=no|600}} BC)
*[[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] of [[Mytilene]] (monodic lyric, {{circa|lk=no|600}} BC)
*[[Anacreon]] of [[Teos]] (monodic lyric, 6th century BC)
*[[Stesichorus]] of [[Metauros]] (choral lyric, 7th century BC)
*[[Ibycus]] of [[Rhegium]] (choral lyric, 6th century BC)
*[[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]] of [[Ceos]] (choral lyric, 6th century BC)
*[[Bacchylides]] of [[Ceos]] (choral lyric, 5th century BC)
*[[Pindar]] of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] (choral lyric, 5th century BC)

In most Greek sources the word ''melikos'' (from ''melos'', "song") is used to refer to these poets, but the variant ''lyrikos'' (from ''lyra'', "[[lyre]]") became the regular form in both Latin (as ''lyricus'') and in modern languages. The ancient scholars defined the genre on the basis of the musical accompaniment, not the content. Thus, some types of poetry which would be included under the label "[[lyric poetry]]," in modern [[literary criticism|criticism]] are excluded&amp;mdash;namely, the [[elegiac couplet#Greek origins|elegy]] and [[iambus (genre)|iambus]] which were performed with [[aulos|flutes]].

The Nine Lyric Poets are traditionally divided among those who primarily composed [[choral poetry|choral]] verses, and those who composed [[monodic]] verses. This division is contested by some modern scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. esp. M. Davies's "Monody, Choral Lyric, and the Tyranny of the Hand-Book" in ''Classical Quarterly'', NS&amp;nbsp;38 (1988), pp.&amp;nbsp;52&amp;ndash;64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antipater of Thessalonica proposes an alternative canon of nine female poets.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez Robbio, Matías S. (2014) «''Musas y escritoras: el primer canon de la literatura femenina de la Grecia antigua (AP IX 26)''». Praesentia, v. 15, 2014, pp. 1-9. ISSN (en línea): 1316-1857. ([https://www.academia.edu/10269688/Musas_y_escritoras_el_primer_canon_de_la_literatura_femenina_de_la_Grecia_antigua_AP_IX_26_ online])&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1560">'''Opsophagos''' was a type of [[ancient Greek]] person who exhibited a seemingly uncontrollable desire for [[opson]] or 'relishes.'  The vice of the ''opsophagos'' was ''opsophagia'', for which the closest English equivalent is ''gourmandise''.  However, because fish/seafood was considered by far the most desirable ''opson'', an ''opsophagos'' in ancient Greek literature is almost always a man obsessed with fish or seafood.

Tales of infamous ''opsophagoi'' (plural form) focussed on men who took their gourmandise to extreme levels, training their bodies in various ways to be able to consume massive quantities of fish immediately after they had been prepared, ensuring that they would have the fish to themselves, since they would be too hot for others to even touch, let alone eat. These tales of men with heat-resistant throats and padded fingertips were likely fictional, but they served as reminders to all who heard them that letting the pleasure-driven body overcome the rational soul was not the way to become an ideal human. One could enjoy fish, but one had to be careful not to take this enjoyment too far and become an opsophagos.

'''Persecution of people with albinism''' (sometimes abbreviated PWA&lt;ref name="UTSS history" /&gt;) is based on the belief that certain body parts of [[Albinism|albinistic]] people can transmit magical powers. Such [[superstition]] is present especially in some parts of the [[African Great Lakes]] region, it has been promulgated and exploited by [[witch doctor]]s and others who use such body parts as ingredients in rituals, concoctions and [[potions]] with the claim that their [[Witchcraft|magic]] will bring prosperity to the user (''[[muti]]'' or [[medicine murder]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/ethnologie/forschung/arbeitsstellen/medical_anthropology/publikationen/0000-MEDIEN/Schuehle_Medicine-Murder-_-Albinism-Tanzania_CAS-Working-Paper-2-2013.pdf|title=Medicine Murder of People with Albinism in Tanzania – How Casino Capitalism Creates Rumorscapes and Occult Economies (Working Paper No. 2-13)|last=Schühle|first=Judith|date=|website=FU-Berlin.de|publisher=Center for Area Studies, Freie Universität Berlin|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125200414/http://www.fu-berlin.de/sites/cas/forschung/publikationen/working-papers/_CAS-Working-2-13_Schuehle.pdf|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes|access-date=29 October 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, people with albinism have been persecuted, killed and dismembered, and graves of albinos dug up and desecrated. At the same time, people with albinism have also been ostracised and even killed for exactly the opposite reason, because they are presumed to be cursed and bring bad luck. The persecutions of people with albinism take place mostly in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n communities, especially among [[East Africa]]ns.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cruz-Inigo|first1=Andres E. |last2=Ladizinski|first2=Barry |last3=Sethi|first3=Aisha |date=January 2011 |title=Albinism in Africa: Stigma, Slaughter and Awareness Campaigns |work=Dermatologic Clinics |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=79–87 |doi=10.1016/j.det.2010.08.015 |url= http://www.derm.theclinics.com/article/S0733-8635(10)00140-3/fulltext |access-date=18 April 2014}} Also available [http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0733-8635/PIIS0733863510001403.pdf in PDF format].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|81}}

Albinism is a genetically inherited condition which is very rare and, worldwide, affects approximately one in twenty thousand people.&lt;ref&gt;Steiefel, (2014) Hats on for skin health: Albinos in Africa a population at risk {{cite web |url=http://www.stiefel.com/en/community-interest/hatsonforskinhealth.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507033012/http://www.stiefel.com/en/community-interest/hatsonforskinhealth.html |archivedate=7 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Accessed 20 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Although rare in the western world, albinism is quite common in sub-Saharan Africa, likely as a result of [[consanguinity]].&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt; Both parents, who may or may not be albinos themselves, must carry the gene if it is to be passed on to the child. Albinism occurs in both males and females and is not specific to any race or ethnic group. Statistics show that fifty percent of albinistic people in [[Tanzania]] have a known albinistic relative,&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|80}} although very few understand or are educated about the medical and genetic causes of this condition. Many believe it is a punishment from God or bad luck, and that their "disease" could be contagious, which is often the view of even members of the medical and professional community. These misconceptions, coupled with the lack of education, are some of the key reasons that albinism is so heavily persecuted. This lack of knowledge about people with albinism means that folktales and superstition in the name of witchcraft take the place of medical and scientific facts in the minds of many native Africans, with and without albinism, which in turn has major effects on the social integration of albinistic people into African society. Ninety-eight percent of albinos die by the age of forty for reasons which could easily be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Morton |first=T. |date=2014 |title=''Watu Kama Sisi'': Reducing Skin Cancer, Stigma and Violence Against Albinos in the Mara Region |publisher=[[Under the Same Sun]] |location=Canada / Tanzania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current statistics of persecution of albinistic people==

A report was released on 1 April 2014 by the [[Dar es Salaam]], Tanzania, office of the Canadian charity [[Under the Same Sun]]. Titled ''Reported Attacks of Persons with Albinism'', the document reviews 180 countries and lists 129 recent killings and 181 other attacks, all within 23 African countries. These attacks include mutilation, violence, violation of graves, and cases of asylum-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2014 |title=Reported Attacks of Persons with Albinism – Most Recent Attacks Included. |publisher=[[Under the Same Sun]] |location=Canada / Tanzania |url= http://www.underthesamesun.com/sites/default/files/PWA%20Attacks%20in%20Africa.pdf |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tanzania ===
In Tanzania, albinos represent one in every 1429 births, a much higher rate than in any other nation. According to [[Al-Shymaa Kway-Geer]], an albino member of parliament, there are 6977 officially registered albinos in Tanzania.&lt;ref name="IFRC"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[International Federation of Red Cross]] and [[Red Crescent Societies]]. |title=Advocacy Report: Through Albino Eyes – The Plight of Albino People in Africa's Great Lakes Region and a Red Cross Response |date=2009 |work=IFRC.org |url= https://www.ifrc.org/Global/Publications/general/177800-Albinos-Report-EN.pdf |access-date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is believed that there may be up to 17000 undocumented.&lt;ref name="BBC wife"&gt;{{cite news |date=2008 |title=Man 'tried to sell' albino wife  |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7726743.stm |access-date=24 April 2014 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of albinos have migrated to the [[Dar es Salaam]] area, as they feel safer in an urban setting. Tanzania is thought to have the largest population of albinos in Africa.&lt;ref name="Malone"&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Malone |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1215949/The-albino-tribe-butchered-feed-gruesome-trade-magical-body-parts.html |title=The albino tribe butchered to feed a gruesome trade in 'magical' body parts |date=24 September 2009 |access-date=24 September 2009 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albinos are especially persecuted in [[Shinyanga Region|Shinyanga]] and [[Mwanza Region|Mwanza]], where witch doctors have promoted a belief in the potential magical and superstitious properties of albinos' body parts. There are further issues which arise when there is lack of education about albinism. Fathers often suspect the mother of the albino child of infidelity with a white man or that the child is the ghost of a European colonist.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt; This can cause immense strain on families and relationships. An albino child is often seen as a bad omen and treated as unwanted. Many albino babies become victims of infanticide due to these superstitious views.

After 2015 when Tanzania enacted tougher steps against violence against albinos, Malawi has seen a "steep upsurge in killings" with 18 reported killings since November 2014, and the likely toll being higher because of missing persons and unreported murders.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/malawi-albinos-hunted-and-murdered-for-their-limbs/| author=AP| title=Albino people are being hunted for their body parts |publisher=CBS| date=June 7, 2016 |accessdate=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Peter Mutharika]] has formed a committee to study the situation.&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt; Additionally, Malawi has faced an immense amount of graves belonging to Albino people being robbed in more recent history. In 2017, police found at least 39 cases of illegal removals of the bodies of Albino people from their graves or having body parts removed from their corpses&lt;ref&gt;“The Ritual Murders of People with Albinism in Malawi.” Amnesty International UK, 2 Feb. 2017, 6:50pm, www.amnesty.org.uk/ritual-murders-people-albinism-malawi. Accessed 14 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;. Another phenomenon that has also begun to occur is an increase in religious leaders, police, and government officials being charged and convicted of slaying Albino people in Malawi. As of 2018, there has been speculation President Mutharika making moves toward implementing the death penalty to convicted murderers of Albino people as a way to significantly decrease the attacks being perpetrated, putting fear into those who do it for business or religious purposes and making it substantially less acceptable by witch doctors and other people who follow superstitions. There is a death penalty in place, but it has not been put in to use since the government changed to democracy in 1994, and convicts who are given the death penalty have sat in prison for life instead&lt;ref&gt;Masina, Lameck. “Malawi Debates Death Penalty to Halt Attacks on Albinos.” VOA, VOA, 24 Apr. 2018, www.voanews.com/a/malawi-debates-death-penalty-attacks-albinos/4363063.html.“Albinism in Malawi Stop The Killings.” Albinism in Malawi Stop The Killings | Amnesty International, 2016, www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2016/06/albinism-in-malawi-stop-the-killings/. &lt;/ref&gt;. The president sees this as a way to tighten judicial control and work to eradicate the hate crimes committed against Albinos.

==Origins of myths and superstition causing persecution of people with albinism==
African rituals and spiritual ideas about albinism have led to the brutal murder of and attacks on innocent men, women and especially children. These ideas have been around for many generations, but in recent years witch doctors have been teaching misconceived ideas about the promise of wealth, success and power when albino hair or limbs are used in a potion as part of witchcraft practices. This has gained public attention nationally and internationally as these crimes have been reported as crimes against human rights. "Infanticide, kidnapping, amputations, and decapitations, committed for purposes of supplying highly valued body parts used for amulets, which are then sold in underground witchcraft market."&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|79}}  Therefore, this causes great unrest and angst among the albino population, who must be protected and often live in a state of solitude simply to protect their own lives and to prevent being hunted like animals.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|80}}

US congressman [[Gerry Connolly]] in 2010 introduced legislation to protect albinos and urge local governments to protect albinos, stating that "With their help and the passage of this resolution today, maybe we can bring an end to these horrific and heinous crimes."&lt;ref&gt;This Day Reporter, (16 March 2010) US Congress passes new law against albinos torture, killings (http://www.thisday.co.tz/?l=10722. Accessed 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

It is clear that "the main driving forces underlying these profiling crimes are ignorance, myth, and superstition, such as the belief that individuals with albinism possess superpowers or that their body parts bestow fortune and health."&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|79}} It is commonly known that in many communities, predominantly in Tanzania and parts of east Africa, superstitious views derived from ancient spiritual beliefs and reinforced by local witch doctors have been carried through centuries of ritualistic practices and mythical beliefs. This creates a serious risk to the lives of persons with albinism as the people believe it will bring them wealth, power, success or health depending on the variances of interpretation. Senior police officers claim that these body parts may be sold for as much as [[United States dollar|US$]]75,000 on the black market&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt; for a set of arms, legs, ears, and genitals from an individual with albinism.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|79}}&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt; Therefore, there has been an extensive amount of albino murders in the past decade especially in Burundi and Tanzania, where in 2007 more than seventy documented killings took place and one hundred and fifty body parts of albinos were reported to have been chopped off. Now the number of killings is well over one hundred, with low conviction rates, and albinos continue to have limbs severed, leaving many crippled or severely maimed, traumatized and tortured in the process.&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt;

This threat to albinos has the potential to cause extreme trauma and stress in their daily lives, which are already impacted by the stress of their condition, affecting skin and eyesight, placing albinos in a constant state of insecurity and distrust. According to Navi Pillay, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, because of the social and educational exclusion which can often occur there are often very low education levels in albinos, so that they lack social and economic tools to live productive lives.&lt;ref name="Pillay"&gt;Pillay, Navi (13 March 2014) "People with albinism have the right to live without fear or bullying, discrimination, social exclusion, killing and dismemberment". United Nations High Commissioner. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N_w5C8FWE&amp;feature=youtu.be Accessed 4 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It also "is a common belief that albinos have low brain capacity and are unable to function at the same level as 'normal people'.&lt;ref&gt;Kuster R,(2000) White skin, black souls. New African, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, their ability to learn is often deficient due to the fact that one hundred percent of albinos suffer from some form of visual impairment&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt; and there often are not sufficient educational facilities, learning supplies or funding to support children with limited sight. This causes extensive bullying, exclusion from peer groups, low self-esteem and confidence, along with emotional and mental illness stemming from rejection by society and often family members who harbor superstitious myths about albinos. It is clearly revealed that no matter what mythical or spiritual mantra a person may be following or believing about albinos there is a general view in "nearly all cultures in the region of east Africa held and some still hold the view that albinos are less desirable beings who are less than human."&lt;ref name="UTSS history"&gt;{{cite web |work=Under the Same Sun |date=15 July 2013 |title=History of Attacks Against Persons with Albinism (PWA) |url= http://www.underthesamesun.com/sites/default/files/History%20of%20Attacks%20against%20PWA.pdf |access-date=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} Therefore, homes and schools specifically for albinos, such as Buhangija Albino School, have been created as safe environments for learning, growing and permanently residing. Many children fear to ever return to their families, believing that they may be killed by even their closest relatives. Ukerewe Island is a key example of this, displayed in the film home to a large community of people with albinism where 62 albinos reside, most likely to remain in solitude and away from albino hunters.&lt;ref name="ITSOTS"&gt;Freeland, Harry (2014) In the Shadow of the Sun  http://intheshadowofthesun.org/long-synopsis Accessed 29 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN report submitted as part of the Human Rights Council resolution 23/13 of 13 June 2013 states that albinos are often regarded as "ghosts and not human beings, who can be wiped off the global map."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013"&gt;United Nations General Assembly: Human Rights Council, 24th Session (12 September 2013) Persons with Albinism. Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Accessed 24 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} They are often persecuted as devils or people who are a bad omen or suffer from a curse. In some communities it is "believed that contact with them will bring bad luck, sickness or death."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Therefore, this is discrimination and mental and emotional persecution alone, where severe bullying of children, exclusion and abandonment occurs even without brutal physical persecution.

However, the issues which have created a spotlight for the Human Rights Council of the United Nations are the murder of albinos for medicine and dismemberment, and attacks and murder of persons with albinism. Another myth that imposes a risk on people with albinism is the belief that "sexual intercourse with a woman or a girl with albinism can cure HIV/AIDS."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Sacrifice of albinos is believed also to "appease the god of the mountain"&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|5}} when fear of a volcano eruption is possible, and it is believed that pulling the hair of albinos can bring good luck. It has also been reported that "miners use the bones of persons with albinism as amulets or bury them where they are drilling for gold.&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|5}} The attacks which occur usually result in the death or severe mutilation of the albino, which according to the Human rights council can in "some cases involve trade in organs, trafficking in persons and sale of children, infanticide and abandonment of children."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Action against persecution==
With escalating killings, President [[Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete|Kikwete]] publicly and repeatedly condemned [[witch doctor]]s, their helpers and middlemen, and the clients, which include members of the police force, for these murders. Victims include [[child abduction|children snatched or abducted]] from their parents. The killers and their accomplices use hair, arms, legs, skin, eyes, genitals, and blood in rituals or for witch potions.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has published a preliminary report regarding discrimination which has been directed toward people with albinism.&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|5}} This report has been submitted as part of the Human Rights Council resolution 23/13 of 13 June 2013. It reinforced that "states would adopt specific measures to protect and preserve the rights to life and security of persons with albinism, as well as their right not to be subject to torture and ill treatment, and ensure their access to adequate health care, employment, education and justice."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|1}} The discrimination of albinos is often demonstrated by family members and relatives especially at birth, and ill-treatment by general society is widespread where there are severe issues of social exclusion and stigma. The Resolution 23/13 explains the Human Rights council's concerns about "attacks against persons with albinism".&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Therefore, the Council encouraged the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to submit a report. Navi Pillay is the current United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. As the representative, on 11 March 2014 she submitted a message which overviewed the current status of discrimination against persons with albinism and possible pathways for change and development in protection of albinos. "People with albinism have the right to live without fear or bullying, discrimination, social exclusion, killing and dismemberment."&lt;ref name="Pillay" /&gt; This footage was published on 13 March 2014 to overview the current situation surrounding albinos who live in fear of being murdered or captured for the purposes of murder medicine and witch doctors belief in the magical potential of albino hair and limbs.

Also a key issue is the influence of educating the public to encourage the removal of the social stigma associated with albinos in a society which does not completely understand that albinism is not a curse or a spiritual ghost, but simply a skin condition. In Zimbabwe albinos have been given the name ''sope'' which indicated that they are possessed by evil spirits, and in Tanzania they are known as ''nguruwe'' meaning 'pig', or ''zeru'' which means 'ghost'.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt; The Report discusses the "most serious human rights violations faced by persons with albinism, primarily focusing on the ritual killings and attacks to which they are subjected."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|3}} It also includes recommendations to the international community and member states action towards persons with albinism.

Under the Same Sun led by albinism activist Peter Ash is organisation aiming to protect albinos from persecution and he delivered an oral intervention to the Human Rights Council in its 23rd session on 7 June 2013 on behalf of the East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders project (EHAHRDP). His submission stated:

"Today I wish to address a little known but very serious human rights violation being perpetrated against people with albinism in many African nations. My NGO, Under the Same Sun, has evidence of the witchcraft related attacks and killings of 207 people with albinism in 16 African nations. The majority of the victims are children. From Tanzania and Burundi in the East, to Nigeria and Cote d'Ivoire in the West and South Africa and Swaziland in the South, people born with this genetic condition live in fear every day. There exists a lucrative black market in albino body parts used to make what is promoted as powerful ''[[muti]]'' medicine. The hand, arm or any albino organ is combined with other ingredients and then sold for thousands of dollars: $3,000 for a hand or over $100,000 for an entire set of organs. Sometimes body parts are even shipped across borders. We seek a day when people with albinism will take their rightful place in all levels of African society and such days of discrimination will be a faint memory. To this end, we call on this Council to pass a resolution condemning acts of violence and discrimination against persons with albinism and to request the OHCHR or the Advisory Committee to carry out a study on such violations. As Edmund Burke so rightly stated, "all that is necessary for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Peter (7 June 2013) Human Rights Council: 23rd Session Item 5: General Debate.

==Future plans==

International federation Secretary General Bekele Geleta states that "Albinism is one of the most unfortunate vulnerabilities… and needs to be addressed immediately at international level."&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt;{{rp|20}} This is a cry for international exposure and help to ensure that people suffering from albinism can be protected from inhumane killings and to be sheltered from the merciless hunters of albino body parts for their potions and spiritual medicine. "The main issues that should be addressed include skin cancer prevention education, stigma and discrimination denouncement, and swift prosecution of albino hunters and their sponsors."&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|80}} Therefore, it is clear that albinos are facing many issues in their lives, and must be protected on the basis of human rights even if they look different and unlike any other race on earth. It is "imperative to inform the medical community and the general national and international public about the tragedies faced by albinos to protect them from skin cancer and ritualistic murders by individuals seeking wealth through clandestine markets perpetuating witchcraft."&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt;

A number of steps were taken by the government to protect the albino population.  The president ordered a crackdown on witchdoctors in the spring of 2008.&lt;ref name="bbc403"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/africa/7327989.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] |title=Tanzania in witchdoctor crackdown |date=3 April 2008 |access-date=3 January 2010 |work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, an albino woman, [[Al-Shymaa Kway-Geer]], was named to become a member of the parliament, the first albino in such a position in the [[history of Tanzania]]. Police have also been advised to generate lists of albinos and provide special protection for them.&lt;ref name="BBC721"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7518049.stm |first=Karen |last=Allen |title=Living in fear: Tanzania's albinos |date=21 July 2008 |access-date=3 January 2010 |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To foil [[graverobber]]s, graves of the albinistic were to be sealed with concrete.&lt;ref name=bbc727&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7527729.stm|title=Tanzania Albinos Targeted Again |work=[[BBC News]] |date=27 July 2008 |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by October 2008, killings had not abated, and while some suspects had been apprehended, no convictions had taken place.&lt;ref name="kul"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=d9487de6-5eeb-4b6e-b21f-4863db51113c |title=Crackdown vowed after Tanzania albino girl killed, mutilated |first=John |last=Kulekana |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=21 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105100148/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=d9487de6-5eeb-4b6e-b21f-4863db51113c |archivedate=5 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that over 50 murders had taken place since March 2007, many of them in the mining and fishing communities near Lake Victoria, especially at [[Mwanza]], [[Shinyanga]] and [[Mara, Tanzania|Mara]].&lt;ref name="kii"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://allafrica.com/stories/200810200901.html |first=Orton |last=Kiishweko |title=Tanzania: JK Orders Crackdown to Stem Murder of Albinos |date=20 October 2008 |work=The Citizen |location=Dar es Salaam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This issue with witchcraft and its power and influence is that a witch doctor has, as he is almost always "revered by society as ultimate truth."&lt;ref name="UTSS history" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Most tribes in ancient times would have committed infanticide upon an albino child seeing it as a bad omen, practiced by the [[Sukuma people|Sukuma]], the [[Digo people|Digo]] and the [[Maasai people|Maasai]].&lt;ref name="UTSS history" /&gt;{{rp|5}} However, in some tribes the albinos were made the sacrifices of offerings to the gods or for such uses as potions which is what they are still hunted for today in the 21st century. "One of the most dangerous myths and the crux of recent attacks against PWA is that their body parts can be made into potions that give good luck and wealth to its users."&lt;ref name="UTSS history" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

In 2006 some of the first publicly reported killings were spoken about in the media, such as 34-year-old albino woman, Arithi, who was murdered with her arms and legs hacked off and sold. Some cases which have been key in recent years firstly occurred in 2008 when a Tanzanian man tried to sell his albino wife for a price of US$3,000 to Congolese businessmen.&lt;ref name="BBC wife" /&gt; Although the businessmen managed to escape their arrest, Interpol has been assigned to attempt to track these men. this is what led to President Jakaya Kikewere ordering a tightening of police and protection from prosecution, however due to corruption there is still proof that even policeman are being bribed and "bought off" to turn a blind eye to certain crimes if they are receiving pecuniary gain. Although according to BBC News one hundred and seventy witch doctors have been arrested for involvement in inhumane interactions and intentions with albinos.&lt;ref name="BBC wife" /&gt;

Another example which occurred where two mothers who were attacked by gangs with machetes in order to get to their albino children. The men broke into a refugee house known as the Lugufu Camp in Kigoma in search of the children; although the children remained untouched the women received severe injuries.&lt;ref name="Howden" /&gt; A further case uncovered by US congressman Gerry Connolly was the November 2008 in Ruyigi, Burundi where the case of a 6-year old albino girl who was shot dead and her head and limbs where hacked off, leaving only her dismembered torso.&lt;ref&gt;This Day Reporter (16 March 2010) US Congress passes new law against albinos torture, killings (http://www.thisday.co.tz/?l=10722.

==Organizations to prevent persecution==

Many organisations have been set up to help protect and provide for communities with albinism. Films have also been produced to encourage, educate and create an international understanding of the trials which persons with albinism are facing in a modern world still dealing with ancient rituals and practices which encourage murder for medicine. This is against all international human rights legislation and therefore it is important that persons with albinism are collectively protected. Organisations such as National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation (NOAH),&lt;ref&gt;The National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation (NOAH) http://www.albinism.org&lt;/ref&gt; Tanzania Albino Centre (TAC)&lt;ref&gt;Tanzania Albino Center (TAC) http://www.tanzaniaalbino.org/ )&lt;/ref&gt; based in Arusha, Tanzania; aiming to "improve the lives of albinos with educational and medical assistance so that they may live safe, accepted, and prosperous lives in the society of their choice."&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt; Other groups include Assisting Children in Need (ACN);&lt;ref&gt;Assisting Children in Need (ACN) http://www.assistingchildreninneed.com&lt;/ref&gt; and Under the Same Sun&lt;ref name="underthesamesun.com"&gt;Ash, Peter (2014)  {{cite web |url=http://www.underthesamesun.com/home.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209142022/http://www.underthesamesun.com/home.php |archivedate=9 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Under the Same Sun (2014). Accessed 20 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; where Ash, having albinism himself, states his aspirations and purpose for the project: "I have a dream that one day in Africa, people with albinism will take their rightful place throughout every level of society, and that the days of discrimination against persons with albinism will be a faint memory!"&lt;ref name="underthesamesun.com" /&gt;

The International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) is a key part of the albino protection movement who are working to integrate persons with albinism back into society safely in Burundi "striving to minimize their vulnerability to hunters, skin cancer, and educational and social marginalization."&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|84}} The IFRC particularly works with protecting mothers and children who are fearing persecution and they assist them in providing safe homes and protection where children are frightened of attacker's and by providing a special arena for the albinos it ensures safety protection and an environment of love, understanding of one another all with albinism, and unity in the battle against persecution and discrimination. The Red Cross have made it very clear in their publications that the government must also take drastic steps in protection of persons with albinism to stop the persecution.  They have stated that it is imperative that the government strives to "Ensure effective legal protection for people with albinism, use local administrative structures to locate and protect albino people in hiding and conduct public anti-discrimination campaigns and extend medical services to albinos in need."&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt;

Asante Mariamu is another organisation which was created after the survival of Mariamu Staford from an anti-albino attack which is determined to ensure that there is "swift prosecution and convictions of their killers" and therefore encouraging justice.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|84}} This story was presented to the US House of Representatives in March 2010 where US Congressman Gerry Connolly was impacted by this horrific story and "moved me to take action."&lt;ref name="TDR"&gt;This Day Reporter (16 March 2010) US Congress passes new law against albinos torture, killings. http://www.thisday.co.tz/?l=10722.

He spoke to the house in March 2010 urging his colleagues "to join me and Mariamu Stanford in bringing international attention to this horrific abuse of human rights."&lt;ref name="TDR" /&gt; This legislation condemns any injury, murder or mutilation of persons with albinism and specifically urges the local east African government especially in Tanzania and Burundi "to take immediate action to prevent further violence against persons with albinism."&lt;ref name="TDR" /&gt; There are many more which are working on protecting persons with albinism from persecution, and providing adequate health care, sun protection and learning facilities to ensure that persons with albinism are treated fairly and with all human rights, and not hunted as animals in fear of their life. Albino Awareness day has also been created by Dr Aisha Sethi who is an assistant professor of dermatology in the Pritzker School of Medicine which is celebrated on 4th May each year. The President has also appointed Al-Shymaa Kway-Geer, himself a person with albinism, as an MP who seeks to be a voice in the Tanzanian parliament for protection against persecution of persons with albinism in society and encourages facilities and support of their physical, medical, and education protection and enhancement.

===Under the Same Sun (UTSS)===
{{Main|Under the Same Sun}}
[[Under the Same Sun]] is a Canadian-founded organization with support focused on Tanzania and based in Dar es Salam, founded in 2008 by [[Peter Ash (activist)|Peter Ash]] with a vision to "promote via advocacy and education, the wellbeing of persons who are often marginalized or misunderstood. We are driven by the belief that all persons have intrinsic value and since they are created in the image of God."&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Peter (2014) Under the Same Sun:  UTSS Information fact brochure {{cite web |url=http://www.underthesamesun.com/sites/default/files/About%20Us%20Brochure.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507035422/http://www.underthesamesun.com/sites/default/files/About%20Us%20Brochure.pdf |archivedate=7 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they are acting upon the moral and human rights values to support victims to end the discrimination and persecution of innocent persons with albinism.  According to [[Under The Same Sun]], to eradicate attacks against persons with albinism, "it is necessary to focus on eliminating reliance on witchcraft beliefs by strengthening the provision of infrastructure such as schools and hospitals while enhancing the sense of fairness by improving on the system of justice."&lt;ref name="UTSS history" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Therefore, regaining persons with albinism their rights to being treated as human, fairly as functioning members of society who may look different and suffer severe vulnerabilities die to their physical condition, but do not deserve to be murdered or hurt in any way because of ancient myths claiming sacrifice of these people will create future benefit for another person.

=== Amnesty International (AI) ===
[[Amnesty International]] is a human rights organization that was established by Peter Benenson, a British lawyer and human rights activist, in 1961. It has many city-centered offices in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Central, and Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. The goal of the organization is to assist in obtaining freedom and success for everyone globally. It has run several campaigns against the persecution and discrimination of persons with albinism. 'Albinism in Malawi: Stop the Killings' is a campaign run by the organization that was started to “stop ritual murders of people with Albinism” &lt;ref&gt;"Albinism in Malawi Stop The Killings.” Albinism in Malawi Stop The Killings | Amnesty International, 2016, &lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, the organization provides a plethora of information and statistical research on albinism for other organizations that fight for the same cause.

==Films highlighting persecution of albinism==

Films which have been created are also helping to raise awareness and tell the stories of persecuted persons with albinism, beginning with ''[[In My Genes]]'', a 2009 Kenyan [[Documentary film|documentary]] directed by [[Lupita Nyong'o]] (later a key actor from the 2013 film ''[[Twelve Years a Slave]]''). It was followed in 2010 by ''[[White and Black: Crimes of Color]]'', by Canadian filmmaker Jean-François Méan, which tells the story of Vicky Ntetema, a Tanzanian journalist who investigated the trade for albinotic body parts in Tanzania. This film became the cornerstone of a national campaign sponsored by [[Under the Same Sun]] to end the wave of violence. After the film's broadcast, the murder rate, which had been steady for three years, dropped by 90%.&lt;ref&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/201211230077.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2012|12|31|Articles with obsolete information from December 2012|reason=More recent 2013–2015 sources indicate that the numbers have gone up again, significantly.

[[White Shadow (film)|''White Shadow'']], a [[Germany|German]]–[[Italy|Italian]]–[[Tanzania]]n 2013 [[drama film]] written, produced and directed by Noaz Deshe, drew international attention to the issue, screening at various [[film festival]]s, winning the Lion of the Future Award at the Venice festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Noaz Deshe on his Film, White Shadow: A Fight for Survival in East Africa|url=http://www.internationalpolicydigest.org/2014/01/24/noaz-deshe-on-his-film-white-shadow-a-fight-for-survival-in-east-africa/|access-date=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sundance Interview with Noaz Deshe, director of White Shadow|url=http://cltampa.com/artbreaker/archives/2014/01/27/sundance-interview-with-noaz-deshe-director-of-white-shadow|access-date=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=70th Venice Film Festival Award Winners |url= http://collider.com/venice-film-festival-award-winners/ |access-date=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also released in 2013, ''[[In the Shadow of the Sun (documentary)|In the Shadow of the Sun]]'', a documentary filmed in Tanzania over the course of six years by Harry Freeland, featured the struggles of [[Josephat Torner]], a campaigner for de-mystification of the superstitions about albinistic people and their use for witchcraft; and teenaged Vedastus, who hopes to survive the persecution of persons with albinism to adulthood.&lt;ref name="ITSOTS" /&gt; 
And also The Beautiful Ones Are Born, a yet to be released short film by one of the youngest Nigerian Film maker Dami Taiwo.

==Other African countries==
By June 2008 killings had been reported in neighboring [[Kenya]] and possibly also the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref name="kul" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Cite news

In October 2008 [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] reported on the further expansion of killings of albinos to the [[Ruyigi]] region of [[Burundi]].  Body parts of the victims are then smuggled to Tanzania where they are used for witch doctor rituals and potions.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/20081014-burundis-albinos-flee-sorcerers-organ-traders |first=Esdras |last=Ndikumanna |title=Burundi's albinos flee sorcerers and organ traders |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=14 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929003917/http://www.france24.com/20081014-burundis-albinos-flee-sorcerers-organ-traders |archivedate=29 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Albinos have become "a commercial good", commented Nicodeme Gahimbare in Ruyigi, who established a local safe haven in his fortified house.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;

By 2010 cases had also been reported from Swaziland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/africans-albinism-hunted-tanzania/story?id=11446434  |last1=Chung|first1=J. |last2=Diaz|first2=J. |title=Africans with Albinism Hunted: Limbs Sold on Tanzania's Black Market |date=26 August 2010  |access-date=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
====Biology====
Oculocutaneous albinism, OCA2, is the most common gene type of albinism inherited disorders among the indigenous people Southern Africa. It occurs at a frequency of 1:4000. The incidence in [[Sotho people]] in northern South Africa is at its highest, with a ratio of 1:1500 in neonates.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Patricia M. Lund  Retha Gaigher.

https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-8-225 Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics on albinism in [[South Africa]] are largely incomplete however, studies quoted by the [[World Health Organization]] in 2006 reported that 1:4000 were born with albinism, compared to about 1:20 000 worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcapd.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fact-Sheet_albinism.pdf Accessed 3 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

South African [[human geneticist]], [[Trefor Jenkins]] has made vast contributions to assist in understanding the social and cultural milieu of albinism, the medical risks and implications, resolving the molecular basis and aetiology for OCA2 in Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Int J Ophthalmol. 2014; 7(3): 563–573.

====Skin Cancer====
Children with albinism in rural areas are exposed to high levels of ultraviolet light without the adequate protective gear resulting in skin damage. Only 12% of public schools provided SPF15 sunscreen for children with albinism. [[Squamous cell carcinoma]] of the head and neck is the most common type of cutaneous tumours in African patients with albinism. Non melanoma cancers, namely basal and squamos cell carcinoma, which are usually rare in black populations are common among the vulnerable group living with albinism. A South African study of 111 participants with OCA revealed that 23%
of these participants developed skin cancer with the head area being the most commonly affected site.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many people from rural areas like the Eastern Cape with albinism are unaware of the precautionary measures required to protect their skin. Dr Willie Visser, head of the dermatology division at Stellenbosch University and [[Tygerberg Hospital]], said that while white South Africans presented with skin cancer only after the age of 60, most albinos presented with skin cancer as young as 20. The government health facilities are required to provide sunblock lotion to albinos on a monthly basis however this need is not always met due to stock-outs and lack of knowledge on the part of health workers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iol.co.za/weekend-argus/lifestyle/albinos-have-higher-cancer-risk-7632653 Accessed 3 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www0.sun.ac.za/vivus/vivus-1-february-2017/engagement/doctors-reach-out-to-children-at-risk-for-skin-cancer.html Accessed 3 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial classification====
Racial appearance and descent played a key role in the racial classification process during [[Apartheid]]. Additionally, different sociological and psychological give skin colour its many connotations. Skin colour is traditionally an instant indicator of identifying race and racial differences. Traditional definitions of race suggest that race and colour are inseparable however, for people with albinism race and colour are not linked. Though colour and race are used interchangeably, they remain independent grounds for discrimination. Individuals living with albinism should be protected against unfair discrimination on the basis of their race as well as their skin tone. Individuals living with albinism are exposed to discrimination, stigmatisation and prejudice based on their colour as well as their race. Skin tone discrimination may be interracial or it can be intraracial. Intraracial skin colour discrimination occurs when an individual of a particular racial group makes a distinction on the basis of skin colour between persons of the same racial group, while interracial colourism takes place when an individual of a particular racial group makes a distinction on the basis of skin colour between persons of another racial group. Scott argues that because current classifications of race do not afford people living with albinism adequate protection, a new category of colour should be proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Scott S. A new category of colour: Analyzing albinism under Title VII of the Americans with Disabilities Act. J Gender Race &amp; Just 1999;2(2):508.&lt;/ref&gt; Mswela argues that additional divisions and classifications of race will reinforce problems associated with race.&lt;ref&gt;S Afr J BL 2013;6(1):25-27. DOI:10.7196/SAJBL.236 http://www.sajbl.org.za/index.php/sajbl/article/view/236/287 Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Discrimination====
The difference in appearance in the child with albinism creates socialization and adaption problems. The distinctive phenotypical difference of black (African) people with albinism and the rest of the population group leads to barriers in social integration thus ostracism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; South Africans living with albinism are among the most vulnerable in the country and there is hardly a serious attempt to protect these citizens from human rights violations, violent crimes, and threats. The extent of violent crimes for people with albinism is not as high as other African countries however, surges of violent crimes against people with albinism have been noted.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Mswela.  African Human Rights Law Journal, Volume 17 Number 1, Aug 2017, p. 114 - 133. https://journals.co.za/content/journal/10520/EJC-8dc964ce9 Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Their sensitivity to sunlight, which limits the extent to which they can participate in outdoor activities, contributes to the physical and social isolation of children living with albinism.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; There has been an obligation and responsibility placed on the government to protect vulnerable people after the constitutional court decision on the [[Carmichele v Minister of Safety &amp; Security]] case. The litigation in the Carmichele case creates a strategy for bringing a precautionary suit against the state based on the contention that the state has a duty to protect persons with albinism from violent acts.&lt;ref&gt;M Mswela ‘Violent attacks against persons with albinism in South Africa: A human rights perspective ’ (2017) 17 African Human Rights Law Journal 114-133

==== '''Community and Personal Identity''' ====
African people who suffer from Albinism are inherently stuck between two racial identities. One side of the spectrum views Albino people as white, due to the color of their skin.  Another person might view Albinos as members of the black community due to the skin color of their other family members. Another contributor to this identity crisis is the negative stigma that surrounds Albino people within African society. The falsely informed notion that babies are born with Albinism as a result of a curse that was brought on by a member of his/her family is a significant weight that leaves people with Albinism debating their dignity. One thing to recognize is that studies done on Albinistic Africans demonstrate that many have a very deep self-understanding of who they are and where they belong in society &lt;ref&gt;Blankenberg, Ngaire. “That Rare and Random Tribe: Albino Identity in South Africa.”&lt;/ref&gt;. In other words, the two polarizing color identities that Albino people fall under allow them to be very sure of themselves when they do eventually find their place in society. Family and community also play an essential role in Albinistic identity. The way that a community behaves toward an individual can make or break their sense of self. Research shows that social identities enhance members' well‐being through the provision of social support and feelings of collective efficacy as well as by acting as a basis for collective action&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, Niamh, et al. “Community Identity as Resource and Context: A Mixed Method Investigation of Coping and Collective Action in a Disadvantaged Community.” 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. In most cases, the surrounding community and family of Albinos highly mediates their acceptance&lt;ref&gt;Blankenberg, Ngaire. “That Rare and Random Tribe: Albino Identity in South Africa.”&lt;/ref&gt;. Plans for the future, in regards to eliminating persecution and negative stigmas that encompass individuals who have Albinism, appear to incorporate methods that involve focusing on community and family-based acceptance complementary to institutionally-based changes.

====Myths====
Many African communities depend on traditional explanations of albinism rather than the biomedical explanation. This often leads to a negative socialisation of the individual with albinism.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; People living with albinism are often referred to by derogatory names such as 'inkawu', the [[Nguni languages|Nguni]] term for white baboon, 'isishawa' a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] translation of a person who is cursed as well as 'zeru zeru' which means ghost like.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2017/06/05/being-black-in-a-white-skin-students-with-albinism-battle-prejudice Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
The Swahili term 'zeru' is also commonly used in [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/sowetan/archive/2008/09/03/under-skins-of-fear Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Three people were convicted of the murder of 20 year old Thandazile Mpunzi, including her 17 year old boyfriend. The boyfriend lured Mpunzi to an isolated area on the afternoon of August 1, 2015 in the Phelandaba area of Emanguzi in northern [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. She was strangled, murdered and body parts dismembered. They planned to sell the body parts of Thandazile Mpunzi for a fortune. They claimed that a [[traditional healer]] told them they would get rich if they mixed Mpunzi's blood and parts with 'muthi'. Two of the accused pleaded guilty of murder and are sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. Numerous accounts of murdered as well as missing people with albinism are reported. The trading of albino body parts has become a lucrative business.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21700395-superstition-fuelling-grisly-trade-human-body-parts-tanzania-shows-how-it-can-be Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enca.com/south-africa/kzn-teenager-gets-18-year-sentence-albino-girlfriends-muti-murder Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enca.com/south-africa/missing-albino-boys-family-not-suspects-says-police Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reaction==
After events involving murders of albino people by three Tanzanian men had been publicised by the [[BBC News|BBC]] and others, the [[European Parliament]] strongly condemned the killing of albinos in Tanzania on 4 September 2008.&lt;ref name="EU"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2008-0413+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN |title=Resolution on the killing of albinos in Tanzania |publisher=[[European Parliament]] |date=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The U.S. House of Representatives passed H. Resolution 1088, introduced by Rep. Gerry Connolly ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]], [[Virginia|VA]]), by a vote of 418-1 on 22 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-hr1088/show H. Resolution 1088 at opencongress.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202120346/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-hr1088/show |date=2 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution condemns the attacks and killings; categorizes them as human rights violations, and urges the governments of Tanzania and Burundi to vigorously prosecute such cases and to conduct educational campaigns to combat the superstitious beliefs that underlie the violent attacks.

'''Poetics''' is the theory of literary forms and literary [[discourse]]. It may refer specifically to the theory of [[poetry]], although some speakers use the term so broadly as to denote the concept of "theory" itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gérard Genette]] (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CWjjasIjWiYC&amp;pg=PA14 ''Essays In Aesthetics, Volume 4''], p.14: {{quotation|My program then was named "Theory of Literary Forms" — a title that I supposed to be less ambiguous for minds a little distant from this specialty, if it is one, than its (for me) synonym Poetics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "poetics" comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ποιητικός ''poietikos'' "pertaining to poetry," literally "creative, productive," from ποιητός ''poietos'' "made," verbal adjective of ποιεῖν ''poiein'' "to make."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=poetic "poetic"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar T.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;F. Brogan identifies&lt;ref name="Brogan"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brogan | first = T. | title = The New Princeton Handbook of Poetic Terms | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-691-03672-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; three major movements in Western poetics over the past 3,000 years, beginning with the [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]], [[Metaphysical objectivism|objectivist]] [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian tradition]] (see ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''). During the [[romanticism|romantic era]], poetics tended toward [[expressionism]] and emphasized the perceiving [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]. The 20th century witnessed a return to the Aristotelian paradigm, followed by trends toward metacriticality, or the establishment of a theory of poetics.

Eastern poetics developed primarily with reference to the [[lyric poetry|lyric]], as opposed to the [[mimesis|mimetic]].&lt;ref name="Brogan" /&gt;

Poetics is distinguished from [[hermeneutics]] by its focus not on the meaning of a text, but rather its understanding of how a text's different elements come together and produce certain effects on the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Culler |first1=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Culler |year=1997 |title=Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction}}:&lt;/ref&gt; Most literary criticism combines poetics and hermeneutics in a single analysis; however, one or the other may predominate given the text and the aims of the one doing the reading.

'''Robert Neelly Bellah''' (1927–2013) was an American [[sociology|sociologist]] and the Elliott Professor of Sociology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He was internationally known for his work related to the [[sociology of religion]].&lt;ref name="Hartford Institute"&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to the Web Pages Dedicated to the Work of Robert N. Bellah |url=http://www.robertbellah.com |location=Hartford, Connecticut |publisher=Hartford Seminary |access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Bellah graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from [[Harvard College]] in 1950, receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in social relations with a concentration in [[social anthropology]].{{sfn|Wood|2005|p=182}} His undergraduate honors thesis won the Phi Beta Kappa Prize and was later published in 1952 with the title ''Apache Kinship Systems''.{{sfnm |1a1=Bellah |1a2=Tipton |1y=2006 |1p=523 |2a1=Bortolini |2a2=Cossu |2y=2015 |2p=39}}

Bellah graduated from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in a joint sociology and Far East languages program, with [[Talcott Parsons]] and John Pelzel as his advisors,{{sfn|Bortolini|2010|p=7}} respectively.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Bellah first encountered the work of [[Talcott Parsons]] as an undergraduate when his senior honors thesis advisor was [[David Aberle]], a former student of Parsons.{{sfn|Bortolini|2010|p=7}} Parsons was specially interested in Bellah's concept of religious evolution and the concept of "civil religion". They remained intellectual friends until Parsons' death in 1979.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1955.{{sfnm |1a1=Giesen |1a2=Šuber |1y=2005 |1p=49 |2a1=Yamane |2y=1998}} His doctoral dissertation was titled ''Religion and Society in Tokugawa Japan'' and was an extension of Weber's [[Protestant ethic]] thesis to Japan. It was published as ''Tokugawa Religion'' in 1957.

While an undergraduate at Harvard, Bellah was a member of the [[Communist Party USA]] from 1947 to 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Bellah |first=Robert N. |year=2005 |title=McCarthyism at Harvard |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2005/02/10/mccarthyism-at-harvard/ |magazine=The New York Review of Books |volume=52 |issue=2 |issn=0028-7504 |access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a chairman of the [[John Reed Club]], "a recognized student organization concerned with the study of [[Marxism]]".&lt;ref name="ny"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Bellah |first1=Robert N. |last2=Bundy |first2=McGeorge |author2-link=McGeorge Bundy |last3=Kerr |first3=Clark |author3-link=Clark Kerr |last4=Cohen |first4=Marshall |last5=Conway |first5=John |last6=Doty |first6=Paul |display-authors=5 |year=1977 |title='Veritas' at Harvard: Another Exchange |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1977/jul/14/veritas-at-harvard-another-exchange/ |magazine=The New York Review of Books |volume=24 |issue=12 |issn=0028-7504 |access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 1954, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard [[McGeorge Bundy]], who later served as a national security adviser to [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], threatened to withdraw Bellah's graduate student fellowship if he did not provide the names of his former club associates.&lt;ref name="NYT: Obituary"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fox |first=Margalit |author-link=Margalit Fox |date=August 6, 2013 |title=Robert Bellah, Sociologist of Religion Who Mapped the American Soul, Dies at 86 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/us/robert-bellah-sociologist-of-religion-who-mapped-the-american-soul-dies-at-86.html |url-access=limited |work=The New York Times |access-date=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellah was also interrogated by the Boston office of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] with the same purpose. As a result, Bellah and his family spent two years in Canada, where he was awarded a [[post-doctoral fellowship]] at the [[McGill University Institute of Islamic Studies|Islamic Institute in McGill University]] in [[Montreal]]. He returned to Harvard after [[McCarthyism]] declined due to the death of its main instigator senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]. Bellah afterwards wrote,

{{quote|... I know from personal experience that Harvard did some terribly wrong things during the McCarthy period and that those things have never been publicly acknowledged. At its worst it came close to psychological terror against almost defenseless individuals. ...The university and the secret police were in collusion to suppress political dissent and even to persecute dissenters who had changed their minds if they were not willing to become part of the persecution.&lt;ref name="ny" /&gt;}}

==Career==
Bellah's ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''Religion in Human Evolution'' (2011),{{sfnm |1a1=Miles |1y=2013 |1pp=853, 862 |2a1=Stausberg |2y=2014 |2p=281}} traces the biological and cultural origins of religion and the interplay between the two. The sociologist and philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] wrote of the work: "This great book is the intellectual harvest of the rich academic life of a leading social theorist who has assimilated a vast range of biological, anthropological, and historical literature in the pursuit of a breathtaking project&amp;nbsp;... In this field I do not know of an equally ambitious and comprehensive study."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674061439&amp;content=reviews | title=About Religion in Human Evolution | publisher=Harvard University Press | accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book won the Distinguished Book Award of the [[American Sociological Association]]'s Section on Sociology of Religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sociology of Religion Section Award Recipients |url=http://www.asanet.org/asa-communities/asa-sections/current-sections/religion/section-sociology-religion-award-recipients |publisher=American Sociological Association |access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellah is best-known for his 1985 book ''Habits of the Heart'',&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=robert+bellah&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C7&amp;as_sdtp=&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification failed|date=September 2018}}--&gt; which discusses how religion contributes to and detracts from America's common good, and for his studies of religious and moral issues and their connection to society. Bellah was perhaps best known for his work related to [[American civil religion]], a term which he coined in a 1967 article that has since gained widespread attention among scholars.{{sfn|Bellah|1967}}&lt;ref name="Woo 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Woo |first=Elaine |date=August 3, 2013 |title=Robert N.

He served in various positions at Harvard from 1955 to 1967 when he took the position of Ford Professor of Sociology at the [[University of California at Berkeley]]. He spent the remainder of his career at Berkeley.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} His views are often classified as [[communitarian]].{{sfnm |1a1=Bellah |1y=1998 |2a1=Dorrien |2y=1995 |2pp=336–343 |3a1=Eberly |3y=1998 |3p=108}} An academic biography of Robert Bellah, "the world's most widely read sociologist of religion",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bergman |first=Barry |date=October 26, 2006 |title=Of God, Justice, and Disunited States |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2006/10/26_Bellah.shtml |work=The Berkeleyan |location=Berkeley, California |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is currently under way.{{sfnm |1a1=Bortolini |1y=2010 |2a1=Bortolini |2y=2011 |3a1=Bortolini |3y=2012}}

==Personal==
Bellah was born in [[Altus, Oklahoma|Altus]], [[Oklahoma]], on February 23, 1927.{{sfn|Wood|2005|p=182}} His father was a newspaper editor and publisher and died when he was two years old.{{sfn|Horowitz|2005|p=218}} His mother Lillian moved the family to [[Los Angeles]],{{sfn|Horowitz|2005|p=218}} where she had relatives.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Bellah grew up in Los Angeles{{sfn|Giesen|Šuber|2005|p=49}} and attended [[Los Angeles High School]], where he and his future wife, Melanie Hyman, were editors of the student newspaper. They got married in 1948 after she graduated from [[Stanford University]], and he began studying at Harvard University after a service in the [[US Army]]. Bellah's wife died in 2010.

Bellah was briefly a [[communism|communist]] during his student years at Harvard, as he recalled in 1977 in a letter to the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' regarding [[McCarthyism]] at the university:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Harvard's capitulation to McCarthyism is still being defended as a form of resistance to McCarthyism. An account of my experiences will, I believe, support [Sigmund] Diamond's and not [[McGeorge Bundy|[McGeorge] Bundy]]'s interpretation of those years.
I was a member of the [[CPUSA|Communist Party]] as a Harvard undergraduate from 1947 to 1949. During that period I was mainly involved in the [[John Reed Club]], a recognized student organization concerned with the study of [[Marxism]]. In that connection I might recount an incident that indicates that a difference between a public policy and a private policy at Harvard such as Diamond has suggested may already have begun in 1949. According to [[Seymour Martin Lipset|[Seymour Martin] Lipset]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1949, the John Reed Club sponsored a talk by a well-known Communist, [[Gerhart Eisler]], who was on his way to a job in East Germany after having been convicted for contempt of Congress. When the University was attacked for allowing students to be corrupted, [[Wilbur Bender]], then Dean of Harvard College, defended the students' right to hear, stating: "If Harvard students can be corrupted by an Eisler, Harvard College had better shut down as an educational institution...[p. 182]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I was, I believe, chairman of the John Reed Club at the time and was informed shortly after we announced that Eisler would speak that the university was considering forbidding the meeting and that the chairman and executive committee of the Club were asked to meet with an administrative officer. The administrator told us in the strongest terms that the invitation was extremely embarrassing for Harvard and asked us for the good of the school to withdraw the invitation. When we stood fast he told us that quite probably none of us would ever get jobs if we persisted in our course of action. The Harvard administration was attempting to do privately and indirectly what it would not do publicly and brazenly, namely suppress freedom of speech, which was precisely the aim of [[Joseph McCarthy|[Joseph] McCarthy]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bellah was fluent in Japanese and literate in Chinese, French, and German, and later studied [[Arabic language|Arabic]] at [[McGill University]] in Montreal.

Bellah died July 30, 2013, at an [[Oakland, California]], hospital from complications after [[heart surgery]]. He was 86 and is survived by his daughters Jennifer Bellah Maguire and Hally Bellah-Guther; a sister, Hallie Reynolds; and five grandchildren.&lt;ref name="Woo 2013"/&gt; Raised as a [[Presbyterian]], he converted to [[Episcopalianism]].&lt;ref name="NYT: Obituary"/&gt;

{{About-distinguish|Social Practice as a minor psychological theory|Practice Theory}}

{{For|the art medium of Social Practice|Social practice (art)}}

'''Social practice''' is a theory within psychology that seeks to determine the link between practice and context within social situations. Emphasized as a commitment to change, social practice occurs in two forms: activity and inquiry. Most often applied within the context of human development, social practice involves knowledge production and the theorization and analysis of both institutional and intervention practices.&lt;ref&gt;Smolka, A. L. B. (2001). Social practice and social change: activity theory in perspective. Human Development, 44(6), 362-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background in psychology==
Through research, [[Sylvia Scribner]] sought to understand and create a decent life for all people regardless of geographical position, race, gender, and social class.&lt;ref&gt;Hedegaard, M. (1998). A cultural-historical approach to mind. Human Development, 41(3), 205-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Using anthropological field research and psychological experimentation, Scribner tried to dig deeper into human mental functioning and its creation through social practice in different societal and cultural settings. She therefore aimed to enact social reform and community development through an ethical orientation that accounts for the interaction of historical and societal conditions of different institutional settings with human social and mental functioning and development.

==Social practice as activity==
Social practice involves engagement with communities of interest by creating a practitioner-community relationship wherein there remains a focus on the skills, knowledge, and understanding of people in their private, family, community, and working lives.&lt;ref&gt;“What is social practice?” (n.d.). Retrieved April 25, 2013, from http://spiritstorelimerick.weebly.com/what-is-social-practice.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach to social practice, activity is used for social change without the agenda of research. Activity theory suggests the use of a system of participants that work toward an object or goal that brings about some form of change or transformation in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Hung, D., Tan, S. C., &amp; Koh, T. S. (2006). From traditional to constructivist epistemologies: a proposed theoretical framework based on activity theory for learning communities. Journal of Interactive Learning Research, 17(1), 37-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social practice as inquiry==
Within research, social practice aims to integrate the individual with his or her surrounding environment while assessing how context and culture relate to common actions and practices of the individual. Just as social practice is an activity itself, inquiry focuses on how social activity occurs and identifies its main causes and outcomes. It has been argued that research be developed as a specific theory of social practice through which research purposes are defined not by philosophical paradigms but by researchers' commitments to specific forms of social action.&lt;ref&gt;Herndl, C. G., &amp; Nahrwold, C. A. (2000). Research as social practice: a case study of research on technical and professional communication. Written Communication, 17(2), 158-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of interest==
===Education===
In education, social practice refers to the use of adult-child interaction for observation in order to propose intentions and gauge the reactions of others.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, D. W. (2010). Directions for studying early literacy as social practice. Language Arts, 88(2), 134-143.&lt;/ref&gt; Under social practice, [[literacy]] is seen as a key dimension of community regeneration and a part of the wider lifelong learning agenda.  In particular, literacy is considered to be an area of instruction for the introduction of social practice through social language and social identity. According to social practice in education, literacy and [[numeracy]] are complex  capabilities rather than a simple set of basic skills. Furthermore, adult learners are more likely to develop and retain knowledge, skills, and understanding if they see them as relevant to their own problems and challenges. Social practice perspectives focus on local literacies and how literacy practices are affected by settings and groups interacting around print.

===Literature===
As literature is repeatedly studied in education and critiqued in discourse, many believe that it should be a field of social practice as it evokes emotion and discussion of social interactions and social conditions. Those that believe literature may be construed as a form of social practice believe that literature and society are essentially related to each other. As such, they attempt to define specific sociological practices of literature and share expressions of literature as works comprising text, institution, and individual. Overall, literature becomes a realm of social exchange through fiction, poetry, politics, and history.&lt;ref&gt;Desan, P., Ferguson, P. P., &amp; Griswold, W. (Eds.). (1989). Literature and social practice, 1st Ed. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and social practice===

{{Distinguish|social artistry}}
Social practice is also considered a medium for making art. [[Social practice (art)|Social practice art]] came about in response to increasing pressure within art education to work collaboratively through social and participatory formats&lt;ref&gt;Sholette, G.

[[Image:Souvenir Spoon from Fords Theatre, Washington DC.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Souvenir Spoon from [[Ford's Theatre]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
A '''souvenir spoon''' is a decorative [[spoon]] used to signify or hold a memory of a place or event, or to display as a 'trophy' of having been there. The spoons may be made from a number of different materials such as [[sterling silver]], nickel, steel, and in some cases wood. They are often hung on a spoon rack and are typically ornamental, depicting sights, coat of arms, associated characters, etc. The year the spoon was made may be inscribed in the bowl, or on the back. The entire spoon, including the bowl, handle, and [[finial]] may be used to convey the theme.  The first souvenir spoons in the [[United States]] were made in 1890 by Galt &amp; Bros., Inc. of Washington D.C., featuring the profile of [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name="SOUVENIR"/&gt;  One year later, a souvenir [[Salem witch trials|Salem Witch]] spoon was made, and sold seven thousand copies. It was created by Daniel Low, a jeweler in Salem, Massachusetts, after he saw souvenir spoons on vacation in Germany. The Witch Spoon is given credit for starting the souvenir spoon hobby in the U.S.&lt;ref name="SOUVENIR"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091022132150/http://geocities.com/rodeodrive/6232/beginning.html The Beginning of Souvenir Spoons] Accessed May 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Shia Islam|Beliefs and practices}}
'''The Four Companions''', also called '''the Four Pillars of the Sahaba''' is a [[Shi'a|Shiʿah]] term for the four [[Sahaba]] who stayed most loyal to [[Imam Ali]] after the death of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]:
* [[Abu Dhar al-Ghifari|Abū Dharr al-Ghifāri]]
* [[Ammar ibn Yasir|Ammār ibn Yāsir]]
* [[Miqdad ibn Aswad|al-Miqdad ibn Aswād al-Kindi]]
* [[Salman the Persian|Salman al-Fārsī]]

Those among [[sahaba|Muhammad's companions]] who were closest to both [[Muhammad]] and [[Imam Ali]] were called [[Shia etymology|Shiʿah of Ali]] "partisans of Ali" during Muhammad's lifetime, and it was for these primarily that the following hadith was said:{{quote|Glad tidings, [[Ali]]! Verily you and your Shiʿah will be in Paradise.}} These companions are later referred to as "The Real Shiʿah". [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas|Abdullah ibn Abbas]], [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]] and [[Malik al-Ashtar]] were other such partisans. However, it is only The Four Companions that are believed to have attained the rank of "The Real Shiʿah" and remained so.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">'''Useful art''', or '''useful arts''' or '''technics''', is concerned with the skills and methods of practical subjects such as manufacture and craftsmanship. The phrase has now gone out of fashion, but it was used during the [[Victorian era]] and earlier as an antonym to the [[performing art]] and the [[fine art]].&lt;ref&gt; George Washington used the term in a letter to Lafayette (Jan. 29, 1798). Washington distinguished commerce from useful arts by stating, “While our commerce has been considerably curtailed for want of that extensive credit formerly given in Europe, and for default of remittance; the useful arts have been almost imperceptibly pushed to a considerable degree of perfection.”  THE WRITINGS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON FROM THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT SOURCES, 1732-1799 (Fitzpatrick ed.).  Other literary sources are collected in the PTO Supp. Br., ''In re Bilski'', p. 11 n.4 (useful arts are manufacturing processes).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "useful Arts" is used in the [[United States Constitution]], [[Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_8:_Powers_of_Congress|Article One, Section 8, Clause 8]] which is the basis of United States [[patents in the United States|patent]] and [[Copyright in the United States|copyright]] law:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;…"
