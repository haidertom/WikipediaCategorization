In [[futures studies]] and the [[history of technology]], '''accelerating change''' is a perceived increase in the rate of [[technological change]] throughout history, which may suggest faster and more profound change in the future and may or may not be accompanied by equally profound social and cultural change&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Being surprised and surprising ourselves: a geography of personal and social change. Progress in Human Geography, OnlineFirst, pp. 1-20, https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132518810431 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, M., 2018. On the future: prospects for humanity. Princeton: Princeton University Press &lt;/ref&gt;.

== Early observations ==
In 1910 during the town planning conference of London [[Daniel Burnham]] noted that "But it is not merely in the number of facts or sorts of knowledge that progress lies: it is still more in the geometric ratio of sophistication, in the [[geometric growth|geometric widening]] of the sphere of knowledge, which every year is taking in a larger percentage of people as time goes on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/transactions00town|title=Transactions|first1=England)|last1=Town Planning Conference (1910 : London|last2=Royal Institute of British Architects|date=8 July 2018|publisher=London : Royal Institute of British Architects|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later on  "It is the argument with which I began, that a mighty change having come about in fifty years, and our pace of development having immensely accelerated, our sons and grandsons are going to demand and get results that would stagger us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/transactions00town|title=Transactions|first1=England)|last1=Town Planning Conference (1910 : London|last2=Royal Institute of British Architects|date=8 July 2018|publisher=London : Royal Institute of British Architects|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, [[Buckminster Fuller]] introduced the word [[ephemeralization]] to describe the trends of "doing more with less" in chemistry, health and other areas of [[industrial development]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]], ''[[Nine Chains to the Moon]]'', [[Southern Illinois University Press]] [1938] 1963 pp.&amp;nbsp;276–79.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1946, Fuller published a chart of the discoveries of the chemical elements over time to highlight the development of accelerating acceleration in human knowledge acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]], ''[[Synergetics (Fuller)]]'', http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s04/figs/f1903.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Stanislaw Ulam]] wrote in reference to a conversation with [[John von Neumann]]: {{quote|One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.&lt;ref name="mathematical"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-5-JeCa2Z7hbWcxTGsyU09HSTg/edit?pli=1 | last=Ulam|first=Stanislaw |title=Tribute to John von Neumann|publisher=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume= 64, nr 3, part 2|date=May 1958|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Moravec's ''Mind Children''==
In a series of published articles from 1974–1979, and then in his 1988 book ''Mind Children'', computer scientist and futurist [[Hans Moravec]] generalizes [[Moore's law]] to make predictions about the future of artificial life. Moore's law describes an [[exponential growth]] pattern in the complexity of integrated semiconductor circuits. Moravec extends this to include technologies from long before the integrated circuit to future forms of technology. Moravec outlines a timeline and a scenario&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm| journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology| date=1998| volume=1| title=When will computer hardware match the human brain?| first=Hans| last=Moravec| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm| archivedate=15 June 2006| deadurl=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1993/Robot93.html| title= The Age of Robots|date=June 1993| first=Hans| last=Moravec| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060615055406/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1993/Robot93.html| archivedate= 15 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which robots will evolve into a new series of artificial species, starting around 2030–2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2004/Predictions.html| title=Robot Predictions Evolution| first=Hans| last=Moravec|date=April 2004| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060616045535/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2004/Predictions.html| archivedate= 16 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind'', published in 1998, Moravec further considers the implications of evolving [[robot intelligence]], generalizing [[Moore's Law]] to technologies predating the [[integrated circuit]], and also plotting the exponentially increasing computational power of the brains of animals in evolutionary history. Extrapolating these trends, he speculates about a coming "mind fire"  of rapidly expanding [[superintelligence]] similar to the [[intelligence explosion|explosion of intelligence]] predicted by Vinge.

== James Burke's ''Connections'' ==
{{Main|Connections (TV series)}}

In his TV series ''[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]]'' (1978)&amp;mdash;and sequels ''Connections²'' (1994) and ''Connections³'' (1997)&amp;mdash;[[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] explores an "Alternative View of Change" (the subtitle of the series) that rejects the conventional linear and teleological view of historical progress. Burke contends that one cannot consider the development of any particular piece of the modern world in isolation. Rather, the entire gestalt of the modern world is the result of a web of interconnected events, each one consisting of a person or group acting for reasons of their own motivations (e.g., profit, curiosity, religious) with no concept of the final, modern result to which the actions of either them or their contemporaries would lead. The interplay of the results of these isolated events is what drives history and innovation, and is also the main focus of the series and its sequels.

Burke also explores three corollaries to his initial thesis. The first is that, if history is driven by individuals who act only on what they know at the time, and not because of any idea as to where their actions will eventually lead, then predicting the future course of technological progress is merely conjecture. Therefore, if we are astonished by the connections Burke is able to weave among past events, then we will be equally surprised to what the events of today eventually will lead, especially events we weren't even aware of at the time.

The second and third corollaries are explored most in the introductory and concluding episodes, and they represent the downside of an interconnected history. If history progresses because of the synergistic interaction of past events and innovations, then as history does progress, the number of these events and innovations increases. This increase in possible connections causes the process of innovation to not only continue, but to accelerate. Burke poses the question of what happens when this rate of innovation, or more importantly change itself, becomes too much for the average person to handle, and what this means for individual power, liberty, and privacy.

== Gerald Hawkins' ''Mindsteps'' ==

In his book "Mindsteps to the Cosmos" (HarperCollins, August 1983), [[Gerald Hawkins|Gerald S. Hawkins]] elucidated his notion of 'mindsteps', dramatic and irreversible changes to [[paradigms]] or world views. He identified five distinct mindsteps in human history, and the technology that accompanied these "new world views": the invention of imagery, writing, mathematics, printing, the telescope, rocket, radio, TV, computer... "Each one takes the collective mind closer to reality, one stage further along in its understanding of the relation of humans to the cosmos." He noted: "The waiting period between the mindsteps is getting shorter. One can't help noticing the acceleration." Hawkins' empirical 'mindstep equation' quantified this, and gave dates for future mindsteps. The date of the next mindstep (5; the series begins at 0) is given as 2021, with two further, successively closer mindsteps in 2045 and 2051, until the limit of the series in 2053. His speculations ventured beyond the technological:

{{quote|The mindsteps... appear to have certain things in common - a new and unfolding human perspective, related inventions in the area of memes and communications, and a long formulative waiting period before the next mindstep comes along. None of the mindsteps can be said to have been truly anticipated, and most were resisted at the early stages. In looking to the future we may equally be caught unawares. We may have to grapple with the presently inconceivable, with mind-stretching discoveries and concepts.}}

==Vinge's exponentially accelerating change==
The mathematician [[Vernor Vinge]] popularized his ideas about exponentially accelerating technological change in the science fiction novel ''[[Marooned in Realtime]]'' (1986), set in a world of rapidly accelerating progress leading to the emergence of more and more sophisticated technologies separated by shorter and shorter time intervals, until a point beyond human comprehension is reached. His subsequent [[Hugo award]]-winning novel ''[[A Fire Upon the Deep]]'' (1992) starts with an imaginative description of the evolution of a [[superintelligence]] passing through exponentially accelerating developmental stages ending in a [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], almost [[omnipotent]] power unfathomable by mere humans. His already mentioned influential 1993 paper on the [[technological singularity]] compactly summarizes the basic ideas.

==Kurzweil's ''The Law of Accelerating Returns''{{anchor|The Law of Accelerating Returns|Law of Accelerating Returns}}==

In his 1999 book ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'', [[Ray Kurzweil]] proposed "The Law of Accelerating Returns", according to which the rate of change in a wide variety of evolutionary systems (including but not limited to the growth of technologies) tends to increase exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Kurzweil, ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'', Viking, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ldAGcyh0bkUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA630#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 30] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=ldAGcyh0bkUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA632#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; He gave further focus to this issue in a 2001 essay entitled "The Law of Accelerating Returns".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns ''The Law of Accelerating Returns'']. [[Ray Kurzweil]], March 7, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Kurzweil, after Moravec, argued for extending Moore's Law to describe [[exponential growth]] of diverse forms of [[technology|technological]] progress.  Whenever a technology approaches some kind of a barrier, according to Kurzweil, a new technology will be invented to allow us to cross that barrier. He cites numerous past examples of this to substantiate his assertions. He predicts that such [[paradigm shift]]s have and will continue to become increasingly common, leading to "technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history." He believes the Law of Accelerating Returns implies that a [[technological singularity]] will occur before the end of the 21st century, around 2045. The essay begins:

{{quote|An analysis of the history of technology shows that technological change is exponential, contrary to the common-sense 'intuitive linear' view. So we won't experience 100 years of progress in the 21st century—it will be more like 20,000 years of progress (at today's rate). The 'returns,' such as chip speed and cost-effectiveness, also increase exponentially. There's even exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth. Within a few decades, machine intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to the Singularity—technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history. The implications include the merger of biological and nonbiological intelligence, immortal software-based humans, and ultra-high levels of intelligence that expand outward in the universe at the speed of light.}}

[[Image:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Moore's Law expanded to other technologies]]
[[File:Moore's_Law_over_120_Years.png|thumb|right|200px|An updated version of Moore's Law over 120 Years (based on [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil's]] [[c:File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|graph]]). The 7 most recent data points are all [[Nvidia GPUs|NVIDIA GPUs]].]]
The Law of Accelerating Returns has in many ways altered public perception of [[Moore's law]]. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It is a common (but mistaken) belief that Moore's law makes predictions regarding all forms of technology,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} when really it only concerns semiconductor circuits. Many [[futurist]]s still use the term "Moore's law" to describe ideas like those put forth by Moravec, Kurzweil and others.

According to Kurzweil, since the beginning of [[evolution]], more complex life forms have been evolving exponentially faster, with shorter and shorter intervals between the emergence of radically new life forms, such as human beings, who have the capacity to engineer (i.e. intentionally design with efficiency) a new trait which replaces relatively blind evolutionary mechanisms of selection for efficiency. By extension, the rate of technical progress amongst humans has also been exponentially increasing, as we discover more effective ways to do things, we also discover more effective ways to learn, i.e. [[language]], numbers, written language, [[philosophy]], [[scientific method]], instruments of observation, tallying devices, mechanical calculators, computers, each of these major advances in our ability to account for information occur increasingly close together. Already within the past sixty years, life in the industrialized world has changed almost beyond recognition except for living memories from the first half of the 20th century. This pattern will culminate in unimaginable technological progress in the 21st century, leading to a singularity. Kurzweil elaborates on his views in his books ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'' and ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]''.

==Criticisms==
Examples of large human "buy-ins" into technology include the [[computer revolution]], as well as massive government projects like the [[Manhattan Project]] and the [[Human Genome Project]]. The foundation organizing the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]] believes [[aging research]] could be the subject of such a massive project if substantial progress is made in slowing or reversing [[cellular aging]] in mice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Both [[Theodore Modis]] and Jonathan Huebner have argued—each from different perspectives—that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Korotayev A.

In fact, "[[technological singularity]]" is just one of a few singularities detected through the analysis of a number of characteristics of the [[World Systems Theory|World System]] development, for example, with respect to the [[world population]], world GDP, and some other economic indices.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Johansen, A., and D.

&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] pattern of the world demographic, economic, cultural, urbanistic, and technological growth (observed for many centuries, if not millennia prior to the 1970s) could be accounted for by a rather simple mechanism, the nonlinear second-order [[positive feedback]], that was shown long ago to generate precisely the [[hyperbolic growth]], known also as the "blow-up regime" (implying just [[finite-time singularities]]). In our case this nonlinear second order positive feedback looks as follows: more people – more potential inventors – faster technological growth – the [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth grows faster – faster [[population growth]] – more people – more potential inventors  – faster technological growth, and so on. On the other hand, this research has shown that since the 1970s the World System  does not develop hyperbolically any more, its development diverges more and more from the blow-up regime, and at present it is moving "from singularity", rather than "toward singularity".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] calls the Singularity "[[Omega]]", referring to [[Teilhard de Chardin]]'s [[Omega Point]] (1916). For Omega = 2040, he says the series Omega - 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; human lifetimes (n &lt; 10; one lifetime = 80 years) roughly matches the most important events in [[human history]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9230">'''Alternative natural materials''' are [[natural materials]] like [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[adobe]] that are not as commonly in use as materials such as [[wood]] or [[iron]].  Alternative natural materials have many practical uses in areas such as [[sustainable architecture]] and [[engineering]]. The main purpose of using such materials is to minimize the negative effects that our built environment can have on the planet while increasing the efficiency and adaptability of the structures.

== History ==

Alternative natural materials have existed for quite some time but often in very basic forms or only as ingredients to a particular material in the past. For example, earth used as a building material for walls of houses has existed for thousands of years. Much more recently, in the 1920s, the United States government promoted [[rammed earth]] as a fireproof construction method for building farmhouses.&lt;ref name=countrysidemag&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Charmaine R.|title=Building for free with "alternative" natural materials|url=http://www.countrysidemag.com/issues/85/85-3/Charmaine_R_Taylor.html|accessdate=2009-04-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090418032445/http://countrysidemag.com/issues/85/85-3/Charmaine_R_Taylor.html| archivedate= 18 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another more common example is adobe. Adobe homes are prominent in the southwestern U.S. and several Spanish-speaking countries.&lt;ref name= About&gt;{{cite web|last=Craven|first=Jackie|title=Building With Natural Materials|url=http://architecture.about.com/od/naturalmaterials/Build_With_Natural_Materials.htm|accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Straw bale]] construction is a more modern concept, but there even exists evidence that straw was used to make homes in African prairies as far back as the [[Paleolithic]] times.&lt;ref name= About/&gt;
Alternative natural materials, specifically their applications, have only recently made their way into more common use. The ideas of being both green and [[sustainable]] in response to [[global warming]] and [[climate change]] shifted more of a focus onto the materials and methods used to build our [[cityscape]] and homes. As environmentally conscious decisions became commonplace, the use of alternative natural materials instead of typical natural materials or man-made materials that rely heavily on natural resources became prominent.

== Materials ==

=== Rock ===
Rock is a great alternative to conventional materials which contain chemicals that may be harmful to people, pets or the environment. Rocks have two great characteristics: good [[thermal mass]] and [[thermal insulation]]. These characteristics make stone a great idea because the temperature in the house stays rather constant thus requiring less air conditioning and other cooling systems. Types of rocks that can be employed are reject stone (pieces of stone that are not able to be used for another task), [[limestone]], and [[flagstone]].
[[File:Sb-wall-tight-curve.jpg|left|thumb|This article shows a straw bale wall under construction.]]

=== Straw ===
[[Straw-bale construction|Straw bales]] can be used as a basis for walls instead of [[drywall]]. Straw provides excellent insulation and fire resistance in a traditional post-and-beam structure, where a wood frame supports the house.&lt;ref name=howstuffworks&gt;{{cite web|last=Edmonds|first=Molly|title=Top 10 Natural Building Materials|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/energy-efficiency/10-natural-building-materials.htm|accessdate=2009-04-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402094611/http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/energy-efficiency/10-natural-building-materials.htm|archivedate=2009-04-02|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These straw walls are about 75% more energy efficient than standard drywalls and because no oxygen can get through the walls, fire cannot spread and there is no chance of [[combustion]].
[[File:Construction maison bambou.jpg|right|thumb|This picture depicts a cyclone- and earthquake-resistant home made completely of bamboo.]]

=== Bamboo ===
In Asian countries, [[bamboo]] is being used for structures like bridges and homes. Bamboo is surprisingly strong and rather flexible and grows incredibly fast, making it a rather abundant material. Although it can be difficult to join corners together, bamboo is immensely strong and makes up for the hardships that can be encountered while building it.

=== Cordwood ===
[[Cordwood]] is a combination of small remnants of [[firewood]] and other [[lumber]] that usually go to waste. These small blocks of wood can easily be put together to make a structure that, like stone, has great insulation as well as thermal mass. Cordwood provides the rustic look of log cabins without the use of tons of lumber. You can build an entire building with just cordwood or use stones to fill in the walls.

=== Rammed earth ===
[[Rammed earth]] is a very abundant material that can be used in place of [[concrete]] and [[brick]]. [[Soil]] is packed tightly into wall molds where it is rammed together and hardened to form a durable wall packing made of nothing more than dirt, stones, and sticks.&lt;ref name=howstuffworks/&gt; Rammed Earth also provides great thermal mass, which means great energy savings. In addition, it is very weatherproof and durable enough that it was used in the Great Wall of China.

=== Earth-sheltered ===
[[Earth sheltering]] is a unique building technique in which buildings are completely constructed on at least one side by some form of Earth whether it be a grass roof, clay walls, or both. This unique system usually includes plenty of windows because of the difficulty involved with using too much electricity in such a house. This adds to the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of the house by reducing lighting costs.

=== Papercrete ===
[[Papercrete]] is an interesting and very new material that is a good substitute for concrete. Papercrete is shredded paper, sand, and cement mixed together that forms a very durable brick-like material. Buildings utilizing papercrete are very well-insulated as well as being termite- and fire-resistant. Papercrete is very cheap as it usually only costs about $0.35 per square foot.

=== Adobe ===
[[Adobe]] is an age-old technique that is cheap, easy to obtain, and ideal for hot environments. A mixture of [[sand]], [[clay]], and water is poured into a mold and left in the sun to dry. When dried, it is exceptionally strong and heat-resistant. Adobe doesn’t let much heat through to the inside of the structure, thus providing excellent insulation during the summer to reduce energy costs. Although this clay mixture provides excellent insulation from heat, it is not very waterproof and can be dangerous in earth-quake prone areas due to its tendency to crack easily.

=== Sawdust ===
[[Sawdust]] is a good material to combine with clay or cement mixtures and use for walls. These walls turn out surprisingly sturdy and effectively recycle any trees that may need to be excavated from the building area. Depending what type of sawdust used ([[hardwood]] is best) the wood chips in the walls absorb moisture and help prevent cracking during freeze/thaw cycles.&lt;ref name=countrysidemag/&gt; Sawdust may be combined with water and frozen to produce a material commonly known as [[pykrete]], which is strong, and less prone to melting than regular ice.

== Examples ==

Although this is a newer technology there are some buildings that have already employed these materials, as well as other tactics, to make themselves green.
*One such building design is the proposed Dubiotech headquarters in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. This designs call for solar panels and windows, which would let plenty of natural light in while also getting maximum use out of the sunlight. This building (under delayed construction since the 2008 financial crisis would also be built with an alternative kind of steel that is not made by a process that releases tons of harsh chemicals into the atmosphere.
*Another example is the School of Art, Media, and Design located in Singapore. This school has a roof made completely of grass (an example of Earth-sheltering).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kriscenski|first=Ali|title=Amazing Green Roof Art School in Singapore|url=http://www.inhabitat.com/2008/01/23/amazing-green-roof-art-school-in-singapore|accessdate=2009-04-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090331200621/http://www.inhabitat.com/2008/01/23/amazing-green-roof-art-school-in-singapore| archivedate= 31 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the use of less concrete and other materials for the roof, and the building also includes lots of window to utilize natural lighting.

First, the predators approach their potential prey. Predators bite or try to swallow the hagfishes, but the hagfishes have already projected jets of slime (arrows) into the predators' mouths. Choking, the predators release the hagfishes and gag in an attempt to remove slime from their mouths and gill chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zintzen | first1=Vincent | last2=Roberts | first2=Clive D. | last3=Anderson | first3=Marti J. | last4=Stewart | first4=Andrew L. | last5=Struthers | first5=Carl D. | last6=Harvey | first6=Euan S. | title=Hagfish Slime as a Defense Mechanism against Gill-breathing Predators | journal=Scientific Reports | volume=1 | page=2011 | doi=10.1038/srep00131| year=2011 | bibcode=2011NatSR...1E.131Z | pmid=22355648 | pmc=3216612}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Anti-predator adaptations''' are mechanisms developed through [[evolution]] that assist [[prey]] organisms in their constant struggle against [[predator]]s. Throughout the animal kingdom, adaptations have evolved for every stage of this struggle, namely by avoiding detection, warding off attack, fighting back, or escaping when caught.

The first line of defence consists in avoiding detection, through mechanisms such as [[camouflage]], [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerade]], [[apostatic selection]], living underground, or [[nocturnal]]ity. 

Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, whether by advertising the presence of strong defences in [[aposematism]], by [[mimicry|mimicking]] animals which do possess such defences, by [[deimatic behaviour|startling]] the attacker, by [[signalling theory|signalling to the predator]] that pursuit is not worthwhile, by [[distraction display|distraction]], by using defensive structures such as spines, and by [[social animal|living in a group]]. Members of groups are at [[selfish herd theory|reduced risk of predation]], despite the increased conspicuousness of a group, through improved vigilance, predator confusion, and the likelihood that the predator will attack some other individual.

Some prey species are capable of fighting back against predators, whether [[autohaemorrhaging|with chemicals]], through [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|communal defence]], or by ejecting noxious materials. Many animals can escape by fleeing rapidly, outrunning or outmanoeuvring their attacker. 

Finally, some species are able to escape even when caught by [[autotomy|sacrificing certain body parts]]: crabs can shed a claw, while lizards can shed their tails, often distracting predators long enough to permit the prey to escape.

==Avoiding detection==

===Staying out of sight===
{{main article|Nocturnality}}
[[File:Seychelles Fruit Bat - Pteropus seychellensis.jpg|thumb|[[Fruit bat]]s forage [[nocturnality|by night]] to avoid predators.]]

Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether [[Troglobite|in caves]], [[Fossorial|underground]], or by being [[nocturnality|nocturnal]].&lt;ref name=Sherbrooke117/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cott, H.B. |date=1940 |title=Adaptive Coloration in Animals |publisher=Methuen |location=London |pages=330–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duverge, P.L. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duverge | first1=P.L. | last2=Jones | first2=G | last3=Rydell | first3=J. | last4=Ransome | first4=R. | date=2000 | title=Functional significance of emergence timing in bats | journal=Ecography | volume=23 | pages=32–40 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0587.2000.tb00258.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daly M. 1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Daly | first1=M. | last2=Behrends | first2=P.R. | last3=Wilson | first3=M. | last4=Jacobs | first4=L. | date=1992 | title=Behavioural modulation of predation risk: moonlight avoidance and crepuscular compensation in a nocturnal desert rodent, Dipodomys merriami | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=44 | pages=1–9 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80748-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called [[crypsis]] used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating [[bats]]. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from [[bat hawk]]s and [[bat falcon]]s. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.&lt;ref name="Duverge, P.L. 2000"/&gt;
Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in [[kangaroo rat]]s, which avoid moonlight. They forage in relatively open habitats and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.&lt;ref name="Daly M. 1992"/&gt;

[[File:Phrynosoma mcallii.jpg|thumb|right|[[Camouflage]] illustrated by the [[flat-tail horned lizard]], its flattened, fringed and [[disruptively patterned]] body eliminating shadow]]

===Camouflage===
{{main article|Camouflage}}

[[Camouflage]] uses any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, [[disruptive coloration]], shadow elimination by [[countershading]] or [[counter-illumination]], self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and colour.{{sfn|Cott|1940}}{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=35–60}} Animals such as the [[flat-tail horned lizard]] of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and blend in with the ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. In addition, these lizards hide any remaining shadows by pressing their bodies to the ground.&lt;ref name=Sherbrooke117&gt;{{cite book | author=Sherbrooke, W. C. |date=2003 | title=Introduction to horned lizards of North America | publisher=University of California Press |pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masquerade===
[[File:Kallima inachus qtl1.jpg|thumb|''[[Kallima inachus]]'' [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerading]] as a dead leaf]]

Animals can hide in plain sight by [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerading]] as inedible objects. For example, the [[potoo]], a South American bird, habitually perches on a tree, convincingly resembling a broken stump of a branch,{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=53–55}} while a butterfly, ''[[Kallima]]'', looks just like a dead leaf.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=318–320}}

===Apostatic selection===

Another way to remain unattacked in plain sight is to look different from other members of the same species. Predators such as [[Parus|tits]] selectively hunt for abundant types of insect, ignoring less common types that were present, forming [[search image]]s of the desired prey. This creates a mechanism for negative [[frequency-dependent selection]], [[apostatic selection]].{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=61–65}}

==Warding off attack==
[[File:Gottesanbeterin Abwehr.JPG|thumb|A Mediterranean [[mantis]], ''[[Iris oratoria]]'', attempting to startle a predator with [[deimatic behaviour]]]]

Many species make use of behavioral strategies to deter predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper |first1=William E |title=Antipredatory Behavior |url=http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/antipredatory_behavior_1/story.htm |website=IDEA |publisher=University of California, Riverside |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Startling the predator===
{{main article|Deimatic behaviour}}

Many weakly-defended animals, including [[moth]]s, [[butterflies]], [[Mantidae|mantises]], [[Phasmidae|phasmids]], and [[cephalopods]] such as octopuses, make use of patterns of threatening or [[deimatic behaviour|startling behaviour]], such as suddenly displaying conspicuous [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]], so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape. In the absence of toxins or other defences, this is essentially bluffing, in contrast to aposematism which involves honest signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1464793105006810 |author=Stevens, Martin |authorlink=Martin Stevens (biologist) |title=The role of eyespots as anti-predator mechanisms, principally demonstrated in the Lepidoptera |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=80 |issue=4 |date=2005 |pages=573–588 |pmid=16221330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/86053.html | title=Deimatic Behavior | publisher=Springer | date=2012 | accessdate=31 December 2012 | author=Edmunds, Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.conchsoc.org/node/6014 | title=Octopus vulgaris. Dymantic display | publisher=The Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland | date=3 December 2012 | accessdate=1 January 2013 | author=Smith, Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pursuit-deterrent signals===
{{further information|Signalling theory}}
[[File:Stotting gazelle.jpg|thumb|An [[impala]] [[stotting]], [[signalling honestly]] to the predator that the chase will be unprofitable]]

Pursuit-deterrent signals are behavioral signals used by prey that convince predators not to pursue them. For example, [[gazelle]]s [[stotting|stot]], jumping high with stiff legs and an arched back. This is thought to signal to predators that they have a high level of fitness and can outrun the predator. As a result, predators may choose to pursue a different prey that is less likely to outrun them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caro, T. M. |authorlink=Tim Caro |date=1986 |title=The functions of stotting in Thomson's gazelles: Some tests of the predictions |journal=Animal Behaviour |issue=3 |pages=663–684 |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(86)80052-5 |volume=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warning calls given by birds such as the [[Eurasian jay]] are similarly [[honest signal]]s, benefiting both predator and prey: the predator is informed that it has been detected and might as well save time and energy by giving up the chase, while the prey is protected from attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bergstrom |first=C.

===Playing dead===
{{main article|apparent death}}
[[File:Heterodon platirhinos 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eastern hog-nosed snake]] [[Apparent death|playing dead]]]]

Another pursuit-deterrent signal is [[apparent death|thanatosis or playing dead]]. Thanatosis is a form of bluff in which an animal mimics its own dead body, [[deception|feigning]] death to avoid being attacked by predators seeking live prey. Thanatosis can also be used by the predator in order to lure prey into approaching.&lt;ref name=Pasteur&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pasteur | first1=G | date=1982 | title=A classificatory review of mimicry systems | url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=13 | pages=169–199 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of this is seen in white-tailed deer fawns, which experience a drop in heart rate in response to approaching predators. This response, referred to as "alarm bradycardia", causes the fawn's heart rate to drop from 155 to 38 beats per minute within one beat of the heart. This drop in heart rate can last up to two minutes, causing the fawn to experience a depressed breathing rate and decrease in movement, called tonic immobility. Tonic immobility is a reflex response that causes the fawn to enter a low body position that simulates the position of a dead corpse. Upon discovery of the fawn, the predator loses interest in the "dead" prey. Other symptoms of alarm bradycardia, such as salivation, urination, and defecation, can also cause the predator to lose interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Alboni | first1=Paolo | last2=Alboni | first2=Marco | last3=Bertorelle | first3=Giorgio | date=2008 | title=The origin of vasovagal syncope: to protect the heart or to escape predation? | journal=Clinical Autonomic Research | volume=18 | issue=4| pages=170–8 | doi=10.1007/s10286-008-0479-7| pmid=18592129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine [[mollusc]]s such as [[sea hare]]s, [[cuttlefish]], [[squid]] and [[octopus]]es give themselves a last chance to escape by distracting their attackers.

===Mimicry and aposematism===
{{main article|mimicry|aposematism}}
[[File:BatesMimButter.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|left|alt=Viceroy and monarch butterflies illustrate Müllerian mimicry|[[Viceroy butterfly|Viceroy]] and [[monarch butterfly|monarch]] are [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian mimics]], similar in appearance, unpalatable to predators.]]

[[Mimicry]] occurs when an organism (the mimic) simulates signal properties of another organism (the model) to confuse a third organism. This results in the mimic gaining protection, food, and mating advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Endler, J. A. |title=An overview of the relationships between mimicry and crypsis |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |date=1981 |volume=16 |pages=25–31 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1981.tb01840.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and Müllerian.

The idea behind Batesian mimicry is that predators that have tried to eat the unpalatable species learn to associate its colors and markings with an unpleasant taste.

[[File:Erethizon dorsatum du Québec.jpg|thumb|The porcupine ''[[Erethizon dorsatum]]'' combines sharp [[spine (zoology)|spines]] with [[warning coloration]]]]

===Defensive structures===

Many animals are protected against predators with armour in the form of hard shells (such as most [[mollusc]]s), leathery or scaly skin (as in [[reptile]]s), or tough chitinous exoskeletons (as in [[arthropod]]s).{{sfn|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|page=198}}

A [[spine (zoology)|spine]] is a sharp, needle-like structure used to inflict pain on predators. An example of this seen in nature is in the [[Sohal surgeonfish]]. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine on the front of each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Craig. Scott, Susan. (1997). ''All Stings Considered''. University of Hawaii Press. pp. 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish.&lt;ref name="Vincent1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Vincent | first1=J. F.

[[File:Stinging Rose caterpillars, Megan McCarty65.jpg|thumb|upright|Stinging [[Limacodidae]] slug moth [[caterpillar]]s]]

Many species of slug caterpillar, [[Limacodidae]], have numerous protuberances and stinging spines along their dorsal surfaces.

==Safety in numbers==
{{further information|Social animal}}

Group living can decrease the risk of predation to the individual in a variety of ways,{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=202–207}} as described below.

===Dilution effect===

A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group "dilute" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] and [[W.D. Hamilton]] proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in [[Camargue horse]]s in Southern France. The [[horse-fly]] often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently.&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duncan | first1=P. | last2=Vigne | first2=N. | date=1979 | title=The effect of group size in horses on the rate of attacks by blood-sucking flies | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=27 | pages=623–625 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(79)90201-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water striders]] are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Foster | first1=W.A. | last2=Treherne | first2=J.E. | date=1981 | title=Evidence for the dilution effect in the selfish herd from fish predation on a marine insect | journal=Nature | volume=295 | pages=466–467 | doi=10.1038/293466a0| bibcode=1981Natur.293..466F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Domain of Danger Graphic.jpg|thumb|In a group, prey seek central positions in order to reduce their domain of danger. Individuals along the outer edges of the group are more at risk of being targeted by the predator.]]

===Selfish herd===

{{main article|Selfish herd theory}}

The selfish herd theory was proposed by [[W.D. Hamilton]] to explain why animals seek central positions in a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Hamilton | authorlink=W. D. Hamilton | first1=W. | title=Geometry for the selfish herd | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume=31 | issue=2 | pages=295–311 | date=1971 | pmid=5104951 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(71)90189-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory's central idea is to reduce the individual's domain of danger. A domain of danger is the area within the group in which the individual is more likely to be attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain of danger, so animals are predicted to strive constantly to gain this position. Testing Hamilton's selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O'Rainn (2010) studied [[brown fur seal]] predation from [[great white shark]]s. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between the decoys to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had an increased risk of shark attack.&lt;ref name="De Vos ORiain 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last=De Vos | first=A. | last2=O'Riain | first2=M.

===Predator satiation===
[[File:White cicada.jpg|thumb|left|A newly emerged [[Magicicada|periodical cicada]]: millions emerge at once, at long intervals, likely to [[predator satiation|satiate predators]].]]

{{main article|Predator satiation|Periodical cicada}}

A radical strategy for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill a large majority of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the [[periodical cicadas]], which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so [[predator satiation]] is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams, K.S. |author2=C.

[[File:Chlorocebus pygerythrus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chlorocebus pygerythrus|Vervet monkeys]] have different [[alarm signal]]s that warn of attacks by [[eagle]]s, [[leopard]]s and [[snake]]s.]]

===Alarm calls===

{{main article|Alarm signal}}

Animals that live in groups often give [[alarm signal|alarm calls]] that give warning of an attack. For example, [[vervet monkey]]s give different calls depending on the nature of the attack: for an [[eagle]], a disyllabic cough; for a [[leopard]] or other cat, a loud bark; for a [[python (genus)|python]] or other snake, a "chutter". The monkeys hearing these calls respond defensively, but differently in each case: to the eagle call, they look up and run into cover; to the leopard call, they run up into the trees; to the snake call, they stand on two legs and look around for snakes, and on seeing the snake, they sometimes mob it. Similar calls are found in other species of monkey, while birds also give different calls that elicit different responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard Smith|first1=John|author1link=John Maynard Smith|last2=Harper|first2=David|title=Animal Signals|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19852-685-8|pages=113–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improved vigilance===

[[File:Circus hudsonius Recurvirostra americana.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4&lt;!--width for low image--&gt;|A raptor, a [[Circus hudsonius|northern harrier]], chases up an alert flock of [[Recurvirostra americana|American avocets]].]]

In the improved vigilance effect, groups are able to detect predators sooner than solitary individuals.{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=115–149}} For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, [[Common wood pigeon|wood pigeon]] flocks are preyed upon by [[goshawk]]s. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, the more likely it is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(73)90184-7|pmid=4734745|author=Pulliam, H. R.|title=On the advantages of flocking|volume=38|year=1973|journal=J. Theor. Biol.|pages=419–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild [[ostrich]]es in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises its head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1016/S0003-3472(80)80030-3|title=Vigilance and group size in ostriches|journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=28|issue=1|pages=278–286|author=Bertram, Brian C. |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zebras Serengeti.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;|A single [[zebra]] is hard to catch amongst a herd.]]

===Predator confusion===

Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The [[zebra]] has been suggested by the zoologist [[Martin Stevens (biologist)|Martin Stevens]] and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering [[motion dazzle]] effect in the eye of the predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-9-81|title=Motion dazzle and camouflage as distinct anti-predator defenses|pmid=22117898 | volume=9|pmc=3257203|year=2011|journal=BMC Biol.|pages=81 | last1 = Stevens | first1 = M | last2 = Searle | first2 = WT | last3 = Seymour | first3 = JE | last4 = Marshall | first4 = KL | last5 = Ruxton | first5 = GD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fighting back==

Defensive structures such as spines may be used both to ward off attack as already mentioned, and if need be to fight back against a predator.&lt;ref name="Vincent1986"/&gt; Methods of fighting back include chemical defences,{{sfn|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|pages=64–69}} mobbing,&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt; defensive regurgitation,&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"/&gt; and suicidal altruism.&lt;ref name="Davidson, D.W. 2011"/&gt;

===Chemical defences===

Many insects acquire toxins from their food plants; ''Danaus'' caterpillars accumulate toxic [[cardenolides]] from milkweeds ([[Asclepiadaceae]]).{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=189–201}}  

Some prey animals are able to eject noxious materials to deter predators actively. The [[bombardier beetle]] has specialized glands on the tip of its abdomen that allows it to direct a toxic spray towards predators. The spray is generated explosively through oxidation of hydroquinones and is sprayed at a temperature of 100&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Eisner | first1=Thomas | last2=Jones | first2=Tappey H. | last3=Aneshansley | first3=Daniel J. | last4=Tschinkel | first4=Walter R. | last5=Silberglied | first5=Robert E. | last6=Meinwald | first6=Jerrold | date=1977 | title=Chemistry of defensive secretions of bombardier beetles (Brachinini, Metriini, Ozaenini, Paussini) | journal=Journal of Insect Physiology | volume=23 | issue=11–12| pages=1383–1386 | doi=10.1016/0022-1910(77)90162-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armoured cricket]]s similarly release blood at their joints when threatened ([[autohaemorrhaging]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/2009/07/28/see-it-to-believe-it-animals-vomit-and-spurt-blood-to-thwart-predators/ "See It to Believe It: Animals Vomit, Spurt Blood to Thwart Predators"], Allison Bond, ''[[Discover Magazine]]'' blog, 28 July 2009, retrieved 17 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Several species of [[grasshopper]] including ''[[Poecilocerus pictus]]'',&lt;ref name=hing&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hingston | first1=R.

The slime glands along the body of the [[hagfish]] secrete enormous amounts of mucus when it is provoked or stressed. The gelatinous slime has dramatic effects on the flow and viscosity of water, rapidly clogging the gills of any fish that attempt to capture hagfish; predators typically release the hagfish within seconds ''(pictured above)''. Common predators of hagfish include seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans, but few fish, suggesting that predatory fish avoid hagfish as prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lim | first1=Jeanette | last2=Fudge | first2=Douglas F. | last3=Levy | first3=Nimrod | last4=Gosline | first4=John M. | date=2006 | title=Hagfish Slime Ecomechanics: testing the gill-clogging mechanics | journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume=209 |  pages=702–10 | doi=10.1242/jeb.02067 | pmid=16449564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communal defence===
{{further information|Mobbing (animal behavior)}}
[[File:MuskOxen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7&lt;!--size for very low image--&gt;|Group of [[muskox]]en in defensive formation, horns ready, and highly alert]]

In communal defence, prey groups actively defend themselves by grouping together, and sometimes by attacking or mobbing a predator, rather than allowing themselves to be passive victims of predation. [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|Mobbing]] is the harassing of a predator by many prey animals. Mobbing is usually done to protect the young in social colonies. For example, [[red colobus]] monkeys exhibit mobbing when threatened by [[chimpanzees]], a common predator. The male red colobus monkeys group together and place themselves between predators and the group's females and juveniles. The males jump together and actively bite the chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Stanford | first1=Craig B | title=The influence of chimpanzee predation on group size and anti-predator behavior in red colobus monkeys | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=49 | issue=3| pages=577–587 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)90033-0| year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fieldfares]] are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies. Within colonies, fieldfares mob and defecate on approaching predators, shown experimentally to reduce predation levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Andersson | first1=Malte | last2=Wiklund | first2=Christer G. | title=Clumping versus spacing out: Experiments on nest predation in fieldfares (''Turdus pilaris'') | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=26 | issue=4| pages=1207–1212 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(78)90110-0 | year=1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defensive regurgitation===
[[File:Defensive Regurgitation.png|thumb|left|A [[northern fulmar]] chick protects itself with a jet of [[stomach oil]].]]

Some birds and insects use defensive regurgitation to ward off predators. The [[northern fulmar]] vomits a bright orange, oily substance called [[stomach oil]] when threatened.&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Warham | first1 = John | date = 1977|url=http://newzealandecology.org/nzje/2787.pdf | title = The Incidence, Functions and Ecological Significance of Petrel Stomach Oils | journal = New Zealand Ecological Society | volume = 24 | pages = 84–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading to the loss of flying ability and the loss of water repellency.&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"/&gt; This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from [[hypothermia]] when diving for food.&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"/&gt;

[[European roller]] chicks vomit a bright orange, foul smelling liquid when they sense danger. This repels prospective predators and may alert their parents to danger: they respond by delaying their return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Parejo | first1=D | last2=Avilés | first2=JM | last3=Peña | first3=A | last4=Sánchez | first4=L | last5=Ruano | first5=F | display-authors=etal  | date=2013 | title=Armed Rollers: Does Nestling's Vomit Function as a Defence against Predators? | journal=PLoS ONE | volume=8 | issue=7| page=e68862 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0068862 | pmid=23874791 | pmc=3707886| bibcode=2013PLoSO...868862P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous insects utilize defensive regurgitation. The [[eastern tent caterpillar]] regurgitates a droplet of digestive fluid to repel attacking ants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peterson, Steven C., Nelson D. Johnson, and John L. LeGuyader|title=Defensive Regurgitation of Allelochemicals Derived From Host Cyanogenesis By Eastern Tent Caterpillars|jstor=1939211|doi=10.2307/1939211|journal=Ecology|volume= 68|issue=5 |year=1987|pages= 1268–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, larvae of the [[noctuid moth]] regurgitate when disturbed by ants. The vomit of noctuid moths has repellent and irritant properties that help to deter predator attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smedley, Scott R., Elizabeth Ehrhardt, and Thomas Eisner|title=Defensive Regurgitation by a Noctuid Moth Larva (''Litoprosopus futilis'')|journal=Psyche: A Journal of Entomology |volume=100|issue=3–4 |year=1993|pages=209–21|doi=10.1155/1993/67950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicidal altruism===
{{further information|Autothysis}}

An unusual type of predator deterrence is observed in the [[Camponotus saundersi|Malaysian exploding ant]]. Social [[hymenoptera]] rely on [[altruism]] to protect the entire colony, so the self-destructive acts benefit all individuals in the colony.&lt;ref name="Davidson, D.W. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Davidson, D.W. | title=A review on self-destructive defense behaviors in social insects | author2=Salim, K.A. | author3=Billen, J. | date=2011 | journal=Insectes Sociaux | volume=59 | pages=1–10 |doi=10.1007/s00040-011-0210-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a worker ant's leg is grasped, it suicidally expels the contents of its hypertrophied [[submandibular glands]],&lt;ref name="Davidson, D.W. 2011"/&gt; expelling corrosive irritant compounds and adhesives onto the predator. These prevent predation and serve as a signal to other enemy ants to stop predation of the rest of the colony.&lt;ref name=r1479&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jones | first1=T.H. | last2=Clark | first2=D.A. | last3=Edwards | first3=A. | last4=Davidson | first4=D.W. | last5=Spande | first5=T.F. | last6=Snelling | first6=R.R. | date=2004 | title=The chemistry of exploding ants, ''Camponotus'' spp. (''Cylindricus complex'') | journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume=30 | issue=8 | pages=1479–1492 | doi=10.1023/b:joec.0000042063.01424.28 | pmid=15537154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autotomy===
{{main article|Autotomy}}
[[File:Lizard tail autotomy.JPG|thumb|[[Lizard]] tail [[autotomy]] can distract predators, continuing to writhe while the lizard makes its escape.]]

Some animals are capable of [[autotomy]] (self-amputation), shedding one of their own [[appendage]]s in a last-ditch attempt to elude a predator's grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. The lost body part may be [[regeneration (biology)|regenerated]] later. Certain [[sea slug]]s discard stinging papillae; arthropods such as [[crab]]s can sacrifice a claw, which can be regrown over several successive moults; among [[vertebrate]]s, many [[gecko]]s and other [[lizard]]s shed their tails when attacked: the tail goes on writhing for a while, distracting the predator, and giving the lizard time to escape; a smaller tail slowly regrows.{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=179–181}}

==History of observations==

[[Aristotle]] recorded observations (around 350 BC) of the antipredator behaviour of [[cephalopod]]s in his ''[[History of Animals]]'', including the use of ink as a distraction, camouflage, and signalling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |authorlink=Aristotle |title=The History of Animals |date=1910 |origyear=350 BC |volume=IX |pages=621b-622a |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/history_anim.9.ix.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, [[Hugh Cott]] wrote a compendious study of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism, ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]''.{{sfn|Cott|1940}}

A '''biogenic substance''' is a product made by or of life forms. The term encompasses constituents, secretions, and metabolites of [[plants]] or [[animal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biomedical Applications of Polymeric Materials and Composites|last1=Raju Francis|first1= D. |last2=Sakthi |first2=Kumar|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In context of [[molecular biology]], biogenic substances are referred to as [[biomolecule|biomolecules]]. 

==Examples==
*[[Coal]] and [[Petroleum|oil]] are possible examples of constituents which may have undergone changes over [[geologic time]] periods.
*[[Chalk]] and [[limestone]] are examples of secretions (marine [[animal shell]]s) which are of geologic age.
*[[grass]] and [[wood]] are biogenic constituents of contemporary origin.
*[[Pearls]], [[silk]] and [[ambergris]] are examples of secretions of contemporary origin.
*Biogenic [[neurotransmitters]].

== Abiogenic (opposite) ==
An '''abiogenic''' substance or process does not result from the present or past activity of living [[organism]]s. Abiogenic products may, e.g., be [[mineral]]s, other [[inorganic compound]]s, as well as simple [[organic compound]]s (e.g. [[Methane#Extraterrestrial_methane|extraterrestrial methane]], see also [[abiogenesis]]).

[[File:Shimmering bees drive hornet away.ogv|thumb|A population of bees shimmers in response to a predator.]]

'''Biological organization''' is the [[hierarchy]] of [[complex systems|complex]] [[biology|biological]] [[structures]] and [[systems]] that define [[life]] using a [[Reductionism|reductionistic]] approach.&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|Berg|Martin|2002|pp=9&amp;ndash;10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional hierarchy, as detailed below, extends from [[atom]]s to [[biosphere]]s. The higher levels of this scheme are often referred to as an '''ecological organization''' concept, or as the [[Branches of science|field]],  [[#Fundamentals|hierarchical ecology]].

Each level in the hierarchy represents an increase in organizational [[wikt:complexity|complexity]], with each "object" being primarily composed of the previous level's basic unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle behind the organization is the concept of ''[[emergence]]''—the properties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and irrelevant at the lower levels.

The biological organization of life is a fundamental premise for numerous areas of [[scientific research]], particularly in the [[Medicine|medical sciences]]. Without this necessary degree of organization, it would be much more difficult—and likely impossible—to apply the study of the effects of various [[physical phenomenon|physical]] and [[chemical phenomenon|chemical]] phenomena to [[diseases]] and [[physiology]] (body function). For example, fields such as [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive]] and [[behavioral neuroscience]] could not exist if the brain was not composed of specific types of cells, and the basic concepts of [[pharmacology]] could not exist if it was not known that a change at the cellular level can affect an entire organism. These applications extend into the [[ecological]] levels as well. For example, [[DDT]]'s direct [[insecticide|insecticidal]] effect occurs at the [[subcellular]] level, but affects higher levels up to and including multiple [[ecosystem]]s. Theoretically, a change in one [[atom]] could change the entire [[biosphere]].

==Levels==
[[File:Levels of Organization.svg|thumb|The simplest unit of life is the atom, like oxygen. Two or more atoms is a molecule, like a dioxide. Many small molecules may combine in a chemical reaction to make up a macromolecule, such as a phospholipid. Multiple macromolecules form a cell, like a club cell. A group of cells functioning together as a tissue, for example, Epithelial tissue. Different tissues make up an organ, like a lung. Organs work together to form an organ system, such as the Respiratory System. All of the organ systems make a living organism, like a lion. A group of the same organism living together in an area is a population, such as a pride of lions. Two or more populations interacting with each other form a community, for example, lion and zebra populations interacting with each other.  Communities interacting not only with each other but also with the physical environment encompass an ecosystem, such as the Savanna ecosystem. All of the ecosystems make up the biosphere, the area of life on Earth.]]

For example, a molecule can be viewed as a grouping of [[chemical element|elements]], and an atom can be further divided into [[subatomic particle]]s (these levels are outside the scope of biological organization). Each level can also be broken down into its own hierarchy, and specific types of these biological objects can have their own hierarchical scheme. For example, [[genome]]s can be further subdivided into a hierarchy of [[gene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each level in the hierarchy can be described by its lower levels. For example, the organism may be described at any of its component levels, including the atomic, molecular, cellular, histological (tissue), organ and organ system levels. Furthermore, at every level of the hierarchy, new functions necessary for the control of life appear. These new roles are not functions that the lower level components are capable of and are thus referred to as ''[[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent properties]]''.

Every organism is organised, though not necessarily to the same degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postlethwait|Hopson|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism can not be organised at the [[histological]] (tissue) level if it is not composed of tissues in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Witzany | first1 = G | year = 2014 | title = Biological Self-organization | url = | journal = International Journal of Signs and Semiotic Systems | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==
Empirically, a large proportion of the (complex) biological systems we observe in nature exhibit hierarchic structure. On theoretical grounds we could expect complex systems to be hierarchies in a world in which complexity had to evolve from simplicity. [[Systems theory|System]] hierarchies analysis performed in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the empirical foundations for a [[Branches of science|field]] that would be, from the 1980s, '''hierarchical ecology'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Margalef|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wicken|Ulanowicz|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pumain|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|Jørgensen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical foundations are summarized by thermodynamics.
When [[biological systems]] are modeled as [[physical system]]s, in its most general abstraction, they are [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|thermodynamic open systems]] that exhibit [[self-organization|self-organised]] behavior, and the [[Set theory|set/subset]] relations between [[dissipative structures]] can be characterized in a hierarchy.

A simpler and more direct way to explain the fundamentals of the "hierarchical organization of life", was introduced in [[Ecology]] by [[Howard T. Odum|Odum]] and others as the "[[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]]'s hierarchical principle";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|1969|pp=192–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon&lt;ref&gt;Simon's texts at {{doi|10.1207/S15327809JLS1203_4}}, [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705161014/http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html |date=July 5, 2015 }} or [http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ johncarlosbaez/2011/08/29 transcriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531145800/https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ |date=2015-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized that hierarchy "''emerges almost inevitably through a wide variety of evolutionary processes, for the simple reason that &lt;u&gt;hierarchical structures are stable&lt;/u&gt;''".

To motivate this deep idea, he offered his "parable" about imaginary watchmakers.

:{|
!Parable of the Watchmakers
|-
|
There once were two watchmakers, named Hora and Tempus, who made very fine watches. The phones in their workshops rang frequently; new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered while Tempus became poorer and poorer. In the end, Tempus lost his shop. What was the reason behind this?

The watches consisted of about 1000 parts each. The watches that Tempus made were designed such that, when he had to put down a partly assembled watch (for instance, to answer the phone), it immediately fell into pieces and had to be reassembled from the basic elements.

Hora had designed his watches so that he could put together subassemblies of about ten components each. Ten of these subassemblies could be put together to make a larger sub-assembly. Finally, ten of the larger subassemblies constituted the whole watch. Each subassembly could be put down without falling apart.

'''Bubble fusion''' is the non-technical name for a [[nuclear fusion]] reaction hypothesized to occur inside extraordinarily large collapsing gas bubbles created in a liquid during [[Sonic cavitation|acoustic cavitation]]. The more technical name is '''sonofusion'''.&lt;ref name="Chang-practical"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined in 2002 with the release of a report by [[Rusi Taleyarkhan]] and collaborators that claimed to have observed evidence of sonofusion. The claim was quickly surrounded by controversy, including allegations ranging from experimental error to academic fraud. Subsequent publications claiming independent verification of sonofusion were also highly controversial.

Eventually, an investigation by [[Purdue University]] found that Taleyarkhan had engaged in falsification of independent verification, and had included a student as an author on a paper when he had not participated in the research. He was subsequently stripped of his professorship. One of his funders, the [[Office of Naval Research]] reviewed the report by Purdue and barred him from federal funding for 28 months.&lt;ref name=reich /&gt;

In the March 8, 2002 issue of the peer-reviewed journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', [[Rusi Taleyarkhan|Rusi P. Taleyarkhan]] and colleagues at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)]] reported that acoustic cavitation experiments conducted with [[Deuterium|deuterated]] [[acetone]] ({{carbon|3}}{{deuterium|6}}{{oxygen}}) showed measurements of [[tritium]] and [[neutron]] output consistent with the occurrence of fusion. The neutron emission was also reported to be coincident with the [[sonoluminescence]] pulse, a key indicator that its source was fusion caused by the heat and pressure inside the collapsing bubbles.&lt;ref name="Taleyarkhan-2002-03-08"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taleyarkhan|first=R.

== Oak Ridge failed replication ==
The results were so startling, that the Oak Ridge National Laboratory asked two independent researchers, D. Shapira and M. J. Saltmarsh, to repeat the experiment using more sophisticated [[neutron detection]] equipment. They reported that the neutron release was consistent with random coincidence.&lt;ref name="Shapira-2002-08-19"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rebuttal by Taleyarkhan and the other authors of the original report argued that the Shapira and Saltmarsh report failed to account for significant differences in experimental setup, including over an inch of shielding between the neutron detector and the sonoluminescing acetone. According to Taleyarkhan ''et al.'', when properly considering those differences, the results were consistent with fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bubble Fusion takes next hurdle|author=Haiko Lietz|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/20/20542/1.html|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 2002, while experimental work was still in progress, Aaron Galonsky of Michigan State University, in a letter to the journal ''Science''&lt;ref name="Galonsky-2002-09-06"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
expressed doubts about the claim made by the Taleyarkhan team. In Galonsky's opinion, the observed neutrons were too high in energy to be from a [[deuterium]]-deuterium (d-d) fusion reaction. In their response (published on the same page), the Taleyarkhan team provided detailed  counter-arguments and concluded that the energy was "reasonably close" to that which was expected from a fusion reaction.

In February 2005 the documentary series ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' commissioned two leading sonoluminescence researchers, Seth Putterman&lt;ref name="Putterman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://personnel.physics.ucla.edu/directory/faculty/putterman |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006174400/http://personnel.physics.ucla.edu/directory/faculty/putterman |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}, Seth Putterman personal page.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kenneth S. Suslick]], to reproduce Taleyarkhan's work.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results differed from the original results in that fusion was claimed to occur over longer times than previously reported. The original report only claimed neutron emission from the initial bubble collapse following bubble nucleation, whereas this report claimed neutron emission many acoustic cycles later.

In July 2005, two of Taleyarkhan's students at [[Purdue University]] published evidence confirming the previous result. They used the same acoustic chamber, the same deuterated acetone fluid and a similar bubble nucleation system. In this report, no neutron-sonoluminescence coincidence was attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, in the midst of accusations concerning Taleyarkhan's research standards, two different scientists visited the meta-stable fluids research lab at Purdue University to measure neutrons, using Taleyarkhan's equipment. Dr. Edward R. Forringer and undergraduates David Robbins and Jonathan Martin of [[LeTourneau University]] presented two papers at the [[American Nuclear Society]] Winter Meeting that reported replication of neutron emission. Their experimental setup was similar to previous experiments in that it used a mixture of deuterated acetone, [[deuterated benzene]], [[tetrachloroethylene]] and [[uranyl nitrate]]. Notably, however, it operated without an external neutron source and used two types of [[Neutron detection|neutron detectors]]. They claimed a liquid [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] detector measured neutron levels at 8 [[standard deviation]]s above the background level, while plastic detectors measured levels at 3.8 standard deviations above the background. When the same experiment was performed with non-deuterated [[Experimental control|control]] liquid, the measurements were within one standard deviation of background, indicating that the neutron production had only occurred during cavitation of the deuterated liquid.&lt;ref name="LeTourneau-2006-11-17"&gt;"Bubble Fusion Confirmed by LETU Research" LeTourneau University News (www.letu.edu/opencms/opencms/events/Bubble_Fusion_Confirmed_by_LETU_Research.html) link inactive as of 2008-05-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANS-pgm"&gt;{{cite web

In March 2006, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published a special report that called into question the validity of the results of the Purdue experiments.&lt;ref name="silencing"&gt;{{cite journal

Tsoukalas, head of the School of Nuclear Engineering at Purdue, and several of his colleagues at Purdue, had convinced Taleyarkhan to move to Purdue and attempt a joint replication. In the 2006 ''Nature'' report they detail several troubling issues when trying to collaborate with Taleyarkhan. He reported positive results from certain set of raw data, but his colleagues had also examined that set and it only contained negative results. He never showed his colleagues the raw data corresponding to the positive results, despite several requests. He moved the equipment from a shared laboratory to his own laboratory, thus impeding review by his colleagues, and he didn't give any advance warning or explanation for the move. Taleyarkhan convinced his colleagues that they shouldn't publish a paper with their negative results. Taleyarkhan then insisted that the university's press release present his experiment as "peer-reviewed" and "independent", when the co-authors were working in his laboratory under his supervision, and his peers in the faculty were not allowed to review the data. In summary, Taleyarkhan's colleagues at Purdue said he placed obstacles to peer review of his experiments, and they had serious doubts about the validity of the research.&lt;ref name="silencing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hot air"&gt;{{cite journal
  |date    = 8 March 2006
  |title   = Is bubble fusion simply hot air?
  |journal = Nature News
  |doi     = 10.1038/news060306-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nature'' also revealed that the process of anonymous peer-review had not been followed, and that the journal ''Nuclear Engineering and Design'' was not independent from the authors. Taleyarkhan was co-editor of the journal, and the paper was only peer-reviewed by his co-editor, with Taleyarkhan's knowledge.&lt;ref name="hot air"/&gt;

In 2002 Taleyarkhan  filed a patent application on behalf of the United States Department of Energy, while working in Oak Ridge. ''Nature'' reported that the patent had been rejected in 2005 by the US Patent Office. The examiner called the experiment a variation of discredited [[cold fusion]], found that there was "no reputable evidence of record to support any allegations or claims that the invention is capable of operating as indicated", and found that there was not enough detail for others to replicate the invention. The field of fusion suffered from many flawed claims, thus the examiner asked for additional proof that the radiation was generated from fusion and not from other sources. An appeal was not filed because the Department of Energy had dropped the claim in December 2005.&lt;ref name="hot air_2"&gt;{{cite journal

== Doubts prompt investigation ==
Doubts among Purdue University's Nuclear Engineering faculty as to whether the positive results reported from sonofusion experiments conducted there were truthful prompted the university to initiate a review of the research, conducted by Purdue's Office of the Vice President for Research. In a March 9, 2006 article entitled "Evidence for bubble fusion called into question", ''Nature'' interviewed several of Taleyarkhan's colleagues who suspected something was amiss.&lt;ref name="Reich-2006-03-09"&gt;{{cite journal

On February 7, 2007, the Purdue University administration determined that "the evidence does not support the allegations of research misconduct and that no further investigation of the allegations is warranted". Their report also stated that "vigorous, open debate of the scientific merits of this new technology is the most appropriate focus going forward."&lt;ref name="Purdue-2007-02-07"&gt;{{cite news

On July 18, 2008, Purdue University announced that a committee with members from five institutions had investigated 12 allegations of research misconduct against Rusi Taleyarkhan.  It concluded that two allegations were founded—that Taleyarkhan had claimed independent confirmation of his work when in reality the apparent confirmations were done by Taleyarkhan's former students and was not as "independent" as Taleyarkhan implied, and that Taleyarkhan had included a colleague's name on one of his papers who had not actually been involved in the research ("the sole apparent motivation for the addition of Mr. Butt was a desire to overcome a reviewer's criticism", the report concluded).&lt;ref name="report2008"&gt;{{cite web

Taleyarkhan's appeal of the report's conclusions was rejected.  He said the two allegations of misconduct were trivial administrative issues and had nothing to do with the discovery of bubble nuclear fusion or the underlying science, and that "all allegations of fraud and fabrication have been dismissed as invalid and without merit — thereby supporting the underlying science and experimental data as being on solid ground".&lt;ref name="Nature_India_2008"&gt;{{cite journal

Maugh II&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 2008 he was stripped of his named Arden Bement Jr. Professorship, and forbidden to be a thesis advisor for graduate students for at least the next 3 years.&lt;ref name="Nature_India_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SFC"&gt;{{cite news

Despite the findings against him, Taleyarkhan received a $185,000 grant from the [[National Science Foundation]]  between September 2008 and August 2009 to investigate bubble fusion. In 2009 the Office of Naval Research debarred him for 28 months, until September 2011, from receiving U.S. Federal Funding. During that period his name was listed in the 'Excluded Parties List' to prevent him from receiving further grants from any government agency.&lt;ref name=reich&gt;{{cite magazine |author= Reich, Eugenie Samuel |title= Bubble-fusion scientist debarred from federal funding |magazine=[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]] |date= 23 November 2009 |doi= 10.1038/news.2009.1103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burned area emergency response''' (BAER) is an emergency [[risk management]] reaction to post [[wildfire]] conditions that pose [[risks]] to human life and property or could further destabilize or degrade the burned lands. Even though [[wildfires]] are natural events, the presence of people and man-made structures in and adjacent to the burned area frequently requires continued emergency risk management actions.  High severity wildfires pose a continuing [[flood]], [[debris flow]] and [[mudflow]] risk to people living within and downstream from a burned watershed as well as a potential loss of desirable watershed values.{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;DeBano, L.F., D.G. Neary and P.F. Ffolliott. 1998. ''Fire’s Effects on Ecosystems''. John Willey &amp; Sons, Inc. New York. 331p {{ISBN|0-471-16356-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The burned area emergency response [[risk management]] process begins during or shortly after wildfire containment with risk assessments evaluating the effects of the wildfire against values{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}} needing protection.  These risk assessments can range from simple to complex. An organized interdisciplinary team of subject matter experts (e.g.,  hydrologists, soil scientists, botanists, cultural resource specialists, engineers, etc.) used among other assessment tools [https://web.archive.org/web/20060924041322/http://www.tucson.ars.ag.gov/agwa/docs/pubs/Goodrich-ASCE-05-AGWA.pdf hydrological modeling] and [http://fire.r9.fws.gov/ifcc/esr/Remote%20Sensing/soil_burnsev_summary_guide042203.pdf soil burn severity mapping] to assess potential flooding and vegetation recovery after the [[Cerro Grande Fire]] in 2000.

A BAER plan is developed based on the risk assessments and burned area land management objectives.  The BAER Plan identifies the most effective treatments to address the identified risks.  Plan implementation timeframes are dictated primarily by anticipated future events (e.g., next significant rainstorm) which also influence treatment options.

== Strategies and treatments ==

Burned area emergency response has mostly concentrated on risk reduction treatments with varying degrees of success.&lt;ref&gt;Robichaud, P.R.; Beyers, J.L.; Neary D.G. 2000. Evaluating the Effectiveness of Postfire Rehabilitation Treatments. Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-63. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, [[Rocky Mountain Research Station]]. 85 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Risk avoidance, transfer and retention treatments are integral in the burned area emergency response risk management process.

=== Risk reduction ===

[[Disaster Risk Reduction|Risk reduction]] treatments are designed to protect human life and safety and reduce flood severity, soil erosion and prevent the establishment of non-native plants.  On 10 wildfires studied in Colorado, rainfall amount and intensity followed by bare mineral soil explained 63% of soil erosion variation.&lt;ref&gt;Pietraszek, J.H. 2006. Controls on post-fire erosion at the hillslope scale, Colorado, M.S. Thesis. Colorado State Univ. Ft. Collins Co. 124p.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that the risk of flooding, debris flows and mudflows are significantly increased with increasing rainfall intensities and burn severity and that some risk reduction treatments help for low but not high intensity rainfall events.&lt;ref name="Robichaud, P.R. 2006"&gt;Robichaud, P.R.; Elliot, W.J. 2006. Protection from erosion following wildfire. Written for presentation at the 2006 ASABE Annual International Meeting. Sponsored by ASABE, Portland Convention Center, Portland, OR. 9–12 July 2006. ASABE Paper No. 068009. American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J.A. and D.A. Martin. 2001a. Hydrologic and Sedimentologic Response of Two Burned Watersheds in Colorado. U. S. Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 01-4122.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mulch]]es, erosion cloth and seeding retard overland flow and protect soil from rain drop impact and increase soil moisture holding capacity. [[Landscape]] structures (e.g., log erosion barriers, contour trenches, straw [[wikt:wattle|wattles]]) trap sediment and prevent slope rilling. Strip tillage and chemicals break up or reduce [[hydrophobic soils]] and improve infiltration.  Wood and straw mulch reduced erosion rates by 60 to 80%, contour-felled log erosion barriers 50 to 70%, [[hydromulch]] 19% and [[post fire seeding]] had little effect the first year when rainfall events were small and intensities low.&lt;ref name="Robichaud, P.R. 2006" /&gt;

In stream flood control treatments slow, delay, redistribute, or redirect water, mud and debris. Straw bale check [[dams]], silt screens and debris [[retention basin]]s slow water flow and trap sediment. Riparian vegetation stabilizes streambanks. Roads and culverts are armored and debris removed as needed. Water diversion implements protect facilities and property.

The chance of introducing new invasive plants to the burned area is reduced by restricting access or thoroughly cleaning all equipment, people and animals of seeds before entering a burned area. Research has shown that non-native plant cover is positively associated with post-wildfire seeded grass cover. Even though post-wildfire seeding operations require seed mix purity standards and the number of contaminated seeds may be small on a percentage based, that the application of very large amounts of seed (thousands of pounds) ensures that a significant number of non-native plant seeds will be distributed.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter M.E., P.N. Omi, E.J. Martinson and G.W. Chong. 2006. Establishment of non-native plant species after wildfires: effects of fuel treatment, abiotic and biotic factors, and post-fire grass seeding treatments. International journal of Wildland Fire 15:771-281.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk avoidance ===

Avoidance treatments remove values{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}} at risk from risk prone areas. Frequently homes and other values{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}} are located on [[alluvial fan]]s at the base of watersheds. The presence of the alluvial fans indicates a history of significant flooding, debris flows and mudflows with potential personal and property damage potential. Mobile property is temporally or permanently relocated. [[emergency evacuation|Evacuation]] planning and [[early warning system]]s are frequently used to protect people at risk.  Flood peaks increase more rapidly with increases in rainfall intensity above a threshold value for the maximum 30 min intensity of approximately 10&amp;nbsp;mm per hour.  That this rainfall intensity could be used to set threshold limits in rain gauges that are part of an early warning flood system after wildfire.&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J.A. and D.A. Martin. 2001b. Post-fire, rainfall intensity-peak discharge relations for three mountainous watersheds in the western USA. Hydrological Processes, 15(15):2981-2993.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk transfer ===

Often it is not feasible to avoid or reduce risks. [[Flood insurance]] is a means of transferring risk to another party for values{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}} with insurable value.

=== Risk retention ===

Accepting the risk is an option when values{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}} at risk are small and inevitable or when the risks cannot be reduced, avoided or transferred (i.e., infrequent catastrophic events).

In [[chaos theory]], the '''butterfly effect''' is the sensitive dependence on [[initial condition]]s in which a small change in one state of a [[deterministic]] [[nonlinear system]] can result in large differences in a later state.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203123841/http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|archivedate=2016-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term, coined by [[Edward Lorenz]], is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as the flapping of the wings of a distant [[butterfly]] several weeks earlier. Lorenz discovered the effect when he observed that runs of his [[Numerical weather prediction|weather model]] with initial condition data that was rounded in a seemingly inconsequential manner would fail to reproduce the results of runs with the unrounded initial condition data. A very small change in initial conditions had created a significantly different outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Edward N.|title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|date=March 1963|volume=20|issue=2|pages=130–141|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:dnf&gt;2.0.co;2|bibcode=1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Lorenz gave a name to the phenomenon, the idea that small causes may have large effects in general and in weather specifically was earlier recognized by French mathematician and engineer [[Henri Poincaré]] and American mathematician and philosopher [[Norbert Wiener]]. [[Edward Norton Lorenz|Edward Lorenz]]'s work placed the concept of ''instability'' of the earth's [[atmosphere]] onto a quantitative base and linked the concept of instability to the properties of large classes of dynamic systems which are undergoing [[nonlinear dynamics]] and [[Chaos theory|deterministic chaos]].&lt;ref name="scholarpedia"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Butterfly effect - Scholarpedia|url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Butterfly_effect|website = www.scholarpedia.org|accessdate = 2016-01-02|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160102214427/http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Butterfly_effect|archivedate = 2016-01-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The butterfly effect can also be demonstrated by very simple systems.

==History==
In ''[[The Vocation of Man]]'' (1800), [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] says that "you could not remove a single grain of sand from its place without thereby ... changing something throughout all parts of the immeasurable whole".

[[Chaos theory]] and the sensitive dependence on initial conditions were described in the literature in a particular case of the [[three-body problem]] by [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1890.&lt;ref name="wolframscience.com"&gt;[http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/971c Some Historical Notes: History of Chaos Theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719234031/http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/971c |date=2006-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later proposed that such phenomena could be common, for example, in meteorology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steves |first1=Bonnie |last2=Maciejewski | first2=AJ |date=September 2001 |title=The Restless Universe Applications of Gravitational N-Body Dynamics to Planetary Stellar and Galactic Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-wa120qRW5wC |location=USA |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0750308222 |accessdate=January 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, [[Jacques Hadamard]] noted general divergence of trajectories in spaces of negative curvature. [[Pierre Duhem]] discussed the possible general significance of this in 1908.&lt;ref name="wolframscience.com"/&gt;

The idea that one [[butterfly]] could eventually have a far-reaching [[ripple effect]] on subsequent historic events made its earliest known appearance in "[[A Sound of Thunder]]", a 1952 short story by [[Ray Bradbury]] about time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/evolution/Time-and-The-Physics-of-Ray-Bradbury--.html | title = The Physics of Ray Bradbury's "A Sound of Thunder" | work = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | date = 2012-06-15 | accessdate = 2015-09-02 | first = Faye | last = Flam | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924130717/http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/evolution/Time-and-The-Physics-of-Ray-Bradbury--.html | archivedate = 2015-09-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Lorenz was running a numerical computer model to redo a weather prediction from the middle of the previous run as a shortcut. He entered the initial condition 0.506 from the printout instead of entering the full precision 0.506127 value. The result was a completely different weather scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Gleick |title=Chaos: Making a New Science |location= |publisher=Viking |year=1987 |isbn=0-8133-4085-3 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorenz wrote:
{{blockquote|
"At one point I decided to repeat some of the computations in order to examine what was happening in greater detail. I stopped the computer, typed in a line of numbers that it had printed out a while earlier, and set it running again. I went down the hall for a cup of coffee and returned after about an hour, during which time the computer had simulated about two months of weather. The numbers being printed were nothing like the old ones. I immediately suspected a weak vacuum tube or some other computer trouble, which was not uncommon, but before calling for service I decided to see just where the mistake had occurred, knowing that this could speed up the servicing process. Instead of a sudden break, I found that the new values at first repeated the old ones, but soon afterward differed by one and then several units in the last decimal place, and then began to differ in the next to the last place and then in the place before that. In fact, the differences more or less steadily doubled in size every four days or so, until all resemblance with the original output disappeared somewhere in the second month. This was enough to tell me what had happened: the numbers that I had typed in were not the exact original numbers, but were the rounded-off values that had appeared in the original printout. The initial round-off errors were the culprits; they were steadily amplifying until they dominated the solution." (E. N. Lorenz, ''The Essence of Chaos'', U.

In 1963 Lorenz published a theoretical study of this effect in a highly cited, seminal paper called ''Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Edward N.|title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|date=March 1963|volume=20|issue=2|pages=130–141|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=3 June 2010|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1963JAtS...20..130L|issn=1520-0469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Deterministic+non-periodic+flow&amp;author=E.+N.+Lorenz&amp;publication_year=1963 Google Scholar citation record]&lt;/ref&gt; (the calculations were performed on a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]] computer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~smillie/ComputerAndMe/Part19.html |title=Part19 |publisher=Cs.ualberta.ca |date=1960-11-22 |accessdate=2014-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717061640/http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~smillie/ComputerAndMe/Part19.html |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lorenz1963" /&gt; Elsewhere he stated:{{quote| text=One meteorologist remarked that if the theory were correct, one flap of a [[Gull|sea gull]]'s wings would be enough to alter the course of the weather forever.

According to Lorenz, when he failed to provide a title for a talk he was to present at the 139th meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1972, Philip Merilees concocted ''Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?'' as a title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Butterfly_1972.pdf Lorenz: "Predictability", AAAS 139th meeting, 1972] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612164541/http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Butterfly_1972.pdf |date=2013-06-12 }} Retrieved May 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Although a butterfly flapping its wings has remained constant in the expression of this concept, the location of the butterfly, the consequences, and the location of the consequences have varied widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ap42.com/2011/08/03/the-butterfly-effect-variations-on-a-meme/|title=The Butterfly Effects: Variations on a Meme|accessdate=3 August 2011|work=AP42 ...and everything|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111132249/http://blog.ap42.com/2011/08/03/the-butterfly-effect-variations-on-a-meme/|archivedate=11 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase refers to the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that may ultimately alter the path of a [[tornado]] or delay, accelerate or even prevent the occurrence of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power or directly create the tornado, but the term is intended to imply that the flap of the butterfly's wings can ''cause'' the tornado: in the sense that the flap of the wings is a part of the initial conditions; one set of conditions leads to a tornado while the other set of conditions doesn't. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which cascades to large-scale alterations of events (compare: [[domino effect]]). Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different—but it's also equally possible that the set of conditions without the butterfly flapping its wings is the set that leads to a tornado.

The butterfly effect presents an obvious challenge to prediction, since initial conditions for a system such as the weather can never be known to complete accuracy. This problem motivated the development of [[ensemble forecasting]], in which a number of forecasts are made from perturbed initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Woods|first=Austin|title=Medium-range weather prediction: The European approach; The story of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts |page=118 |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=2005 |isbn=978-0387269283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists have since argued that the weather system is not as sensitive to initial conditions as previously believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| last2=Smith | first2 = Leonard | last3=Barkmeijer | first3 = Jan | last4 = Palmer | first4 = Tim | title=Model error in weather forecasting|journal=Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics | year=2001| volume=9 | pages=357–371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Orrell]] argues that the major contributor to weather forecast error is model error, with sensitivity to initial conditions playing a relatively small role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| title=Role of the metric in forecast error growth: How chaotic is the weather?|journal=Tellus | year=2002| volume=54A | pages=350–362| doi=10.3402/tellusa.v54i4.12159| bibcode=2002TellA..54..350O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Orrell |first=David |title=Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order |page=208 |location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0300186611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Wolfram]] also notes that the Lorenz equations are highly simplified and do not contain terms that represent viscous effects; he believes that these terms would tend to damp out small perturbations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wolfram|first=Stephen |title=A New Kind of Science |page=998 |location= |publisher=Wolfram Media |year=2002 |isbn=978-1579550080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and mathematical definition==
[[Poincaré recurrence theorem|Recurrence]], the approximate return of a system towards its initial conditions, together with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, are the two main ingredients for chaotic motion. They have the practical consequence of making [[complex system]]s, such as the [[weather]], difficult to predict past a certain time range (approximately a week in the case of weather) since it is impossible to measure the starting atmospheric conditions completely accurately.

A [[dynamical system]] displays sensitive dependence on initial conditions if points arbitrarily close together separate over time at an exponential rate.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems" /&gt; The definition is not topological, but essentially metrical.

If ''M'' is the [[State space (dynamical system)|state space]] for the map &lt;math&gt;f^t&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f^t&lt;/math&gt; displays sensitive dependence to initial conditions if for any x in ''M'' and any δ&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there are y in ''M'', with distance ''d''(. , .) such that &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; d(x, y) &lt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; and such that

:&lt;math&gt;d(f^\tau(x), f^\tau(y)) &gt; \mathrm{e}^{a\tau} \, d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

for some positive parameter ''a''. The definition does not require that all points from a neighborhood separate from the base point ''x'', but it requires one positive [[Lyapunov exponent]].

The simplest mathematical framework exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions is provided by a particular parametrization of the [[logistic map]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = 4 x_n (1-x_n) , \quad 0\leq x_0\leq 1,&lt;/math&gt;

which, unlike most chaotic maps, has a [[closed-form solution]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n}=\sin^{2}(2^{n} \theta \pi)&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[initial condition]] parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\theta = \tfrac{1}{\pi}\sin^{-1}(x_0^{1/2})&lt;/math&gt;. For rational &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, after a finite number of [[iterated function|iterations]] &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; maps into a [[periodic point|periodic sequence]]. But [[almost all]] &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; are irrational, and, for irrational &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; never repeats itself – it is non-periodic. This solution equation clearly demonstrates the two key features of chaos – stretching and folding: the factor 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; shows the exponential growth of stretching, which results in sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect), while the squared sine function keeps &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; folded within the range&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1].

==In physical systems==

===In weather===

The butterfly effect is most familiar in terms of [[weather]]; it can easily be demonstrated in standard weather prediction models, for example. The climate scientists James Annan and William Connolley explain that chaos is important in the development of weather prediction methods; models are sensitive to initial conditions. They add the caveat: "Of course the existence of an unknown butterfly flapping its wings has no direct bearing on weather forecasts, since it will take far too long for such a small perturbation to grow to a significant size, and we have many more immediate uncertainties to worry about. So the direct impact of this phenomenon on weather prediction is often somewhat overstated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/ |title=Chaos and Climate |publisher=RealClimate |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702105624/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/ |archivedate=2014-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{main|Butterfly effect in popular culture}}

The journalist Peter Dizikes, writing in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' in 2008, notes that popular culture likes the idea of the butterfly effect, but gets it wrong. Whereas Lorenz suggested correctly with his butterfly metaphor that predictability "is inherently limited", popular culture supposes that each event can be explained by finding the small reasons that caused it. Dizikes explains: "It speaks to our larger expectation that the world should be comprehensible – that everything happens for a reason, and that we can pinpoint all those reasons, however small they may be. But nature itself defies this expectation."&lt;ref name="Globe"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dizikes |first1=Petyer |title=The meaning of the butterfly |url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/06/08/the_meaning_of_the_butterfly/?page=full |accessdate=8 June 2016 |agency=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=8 June 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418154015/http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/06/08/the_meaning_of_the_butterfly/?page=full |archivedate=18 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chemical vapor deposition''' ('''CVD''') is a deposition method used to produce high quality, high-performance, solid materials, typically under [[Vacuum deposition|vacuum]]. The process is often used in the [[semiconductor industry]] to produce [[thin film]]s.

In typical CVD, the [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] (substrate) is exposed to one or more [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[wikt:precursor|precursors]], which [[chemical reaction|react]] and/or [[chemical decomposition|decompose]] on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposit. Frequently, volatile [[by-product]]s are also produced, which are removed by gas flow through the reaction chamber.

[[Microfabrication]] processes widely use CVD to deposit materials in various forms, including: [[Single crystal|monocrystalline]], [[polycrystalline]], [[amorphous]], and [[Epitaxy|epitaxial]]. These materials include: [[silicon]] ([[Silicon dioxide|dioxide]], [[silicon carbide|carbide]], [[silicon nitride|nitride]], [[silicon oxynitride|oxynitride]]), carbon ([[carbon (fiber)|fiber]], [[carbon nanofibers|nanofibers]], [[carbon nanotube|nanotubes]], [[Synthetic diamond|diamond]] and [[graphene]]), [[fluorocarbon]]s, [[Electrical filament|filaments]], [[tungsten]], [[titanium nitride]] and various [[high-k dielectric]]s.

== Types ==
[[File:ThermalCVD.PNG|thumb|Hot-wall thermal CVD (batch operation type)]]
[[File:PlasmaCVD.PNG|thumb|Plasma assisted CVD]]

CVD is practiced in a variety of formats. These processes generally differ in the means by which chemical reactions are initiated.
* Classified by operating conditions:
** ''Atmospheric pressure CVD'' (APCVD) – CVD at atmospheric pressure.
** ''Low-pressure CVD'' (LPCVD) – CVD at sub-atmospheric pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crystec.com/klllpcvde.htm|title=Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition – Technology and Equipment|publisher=Crystec Technology Trading GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced pressures tend to reduce unwanted gas-phase reactions and improve film uniformity across the wafer.
** ''Ultrahigh vacuum CVD'' (UHVCVD) – CVD at very low pressure, typically below 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (~10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]]). Note that in other fields, a lower division between high and [[ultra-high vacuum]] is common, often 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; Pa.

Most modern CVD is either LPCVD or UHVCVD.
* Classified by physical characteristics of vapor:
** ''Aerosol assisted CVD'' (AACVD) – CVD in which the precursors are transported to the substrate by means of a liquid/gas aerosol, which can be generated ultrasonically. This technique is suitable for use with non-volatile precursors.
** ''Direct liquid injection CVD'' (DLICVD) – CVD in which the precursors are in liquid form (liquid or solid dissolved in a convenient solvent). Liquid solutions are injected in a vaporization chamber towards injectors (typically car injectors). The precursor vapors are then transported to the substrate as in classical CVD. This technique is suitable for use on liquid or solid precursors. High growth rates can be reached using this technique.
* Classified by type of substrate heating:
** Hot wall CVD – CVD in which the chamber is heated by an external power source and the substrate is heated by radiation from the heated chamber walls.
** Cold wall CVD – CVD in which only the substrate is directly heated either by induction or by passing current through the substrate itself or a heater in contact with the substrate. The chamber walls are at room temperature.
* Plasma methods (see also [[Plasma processing]]):
** ''Microwave plasma-assisted CVD'' (MPCVD)
** ''[[Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition|Plasma-Enhanced CVD]]'' (PECVD) – CVD that utilizes [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] to enhance chemical reaction rates of the precursors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.crystec.com/tridepe.htm|title=Crystec Technology Trading GmbH, Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition – Technology and Equipment}}&lt;/ref&gt; PECVD processing allows deposition at lower temperatures, which is often critical in the manufacture of semiconductors. The lower temperatures also allow for the deposition of organic coatings, such as plasma polymers, that have been used for nanoparticle surface functionalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tavares|first=Jason|author2=Swanson, E.J. |author3=Coulombe, S. |title=Plasma Synthesis of Coated Metal Nanoparticles with Surface Properties Tailored for Dispersion|journal=Plasma Processes and Polymers|year=2008|volume=5|issue=8|page=759|doi=10.1002/ppap.200800074}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''Remote plasma-enhanced CVD'' (RPECVD) – Similar to PECVD except that the wafer substrate is not directly in the plasma discharge region. Removing the wafer from the plasma region allows processing temperatures down to room temperature.
* ''Atomic-layer CVD'' ([[ALCVD]]) – Deposits successive layers of different substances to produce layered, [[crystal]]line films. See [[Atomic layer epitaxy]].
* ''[[Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition]]'' (CCVD) – Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition or flame pyrolysis is an open-atmosphere, flame-based technique for depositing high-quality thin films and nanomaterials.
* ''Hot filament CVD'' (HFCVD) – also known as catalytic CVD (Cat-CVD) or more commonly, initiated CVD (iCVD), this process uses a hot filament to chemically decompose the source gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first=R.E.I. | last=Schropp |author2=B.

* ''[[Hybrid Physical-Chemical Vapor Deposition]]'' (HPCVD) – This process involves both chemical decomposition of precursor gas and [[vaporization]] of a solid source.
* ''[[Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition]]'' (MOCVD) – This CVD process is based on [[metalorganic]] precursors.
* ''Rapid thermal CVD'' (RTCVD) – This CVD process uses heating lamps or other methods to rapidly heat the wafer substrate. Heating only the substrate rather than the gas or chamber walls helps reduce unwanted gas-phase reactions that can lead to [[particle (ecology)|particle]] formation.
* ''Vapor-phase epitaxy'' (VPE)
* ''Photo-initiated CVD'' (PICVD) – This process uses UV light to stimulate chemical reactions. It is similar to plasma processing, given that plasmas are strong emitters of UV radiation. Under certain conditions, PICVD can be operated at or near atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dorval Dion|first=C.A.|author2=Tavares, J.R.|title=Photo-Initiated Chemical Vapour Deposition as a Scalable Particle Functionalization Technology (A Practical Review)|journal=Powder Technology|volume=239|pages=484–491|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.powtec.2013.02.024|url=https://zenodo.org/record/968600}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Laser Chemical vapor deposition]] (LCVD)'' - This CVD process uses lasers to heat spots or lines on a substrate in semiconductor applications. In MEMS and in fiber production the lasers are used rapidly to break down the precursor gas-process temperature can exceed 2000oC-to build up a solid structure in much the same way as laser sintering based 3-D printers build up solids from powders.

== Uses ==
CVD is commonly used to deposit conformal films and augment substrate surfaces in ways  that more traditional surface modification techniques are not capable of. CVD is extremely useful in the process of [[atomic layer deposition]] at depositing extremely thin layers of material. A variety of applications for such films exist.  [[Gallium arsenide]] is used in some [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) and  photovoltaic devices. Amorphous polysilicon is used in photovoltaic devices.  Certain [[carbide]]s and [[nitride]]s confer wear-resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Wahl, Georg ''et al.''

==Commercially important materials prepared by CVD==

=== Polysilicon ===
[[Polycrystalline silicon]] is deposited from [[trichlorosilane]] (SiHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[silane]] (SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), using the following reactions:&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{ Ullmann | author = Simmler, W. | title = Silicon Compounds, Inorganic | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a24_001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:SiHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  HCl
:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Si + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

This reaction is usually performed in LPCVD systems, with either pure silane feedstock, or a solution of silane with 70–80% [[nitrogen]]. Temperatures between 600 and 650&amp;nbsp;°C and pressures between 25 and 150 Pa yield a growth rate between 10 and 20 [[nanometre|nm]] per minute. An alternative process uses a [[hydrogen]]-based solution. The hydrogen reduces the growth rate, but the temperature is raised to 850 or even 1050&amp;nbsp;°C to compensate. Polysilicon may be grown directly with doping, if gases such as [[phosphine]], [[arsine]] or [[diborane]] are added to the CVD chamber. Diborane increases the growth rate, but arsine and phosphine decrease it.

=== Silicon dioxide ===
Silicon dioxide (usually called simply "oxide" in the semiconductor industry) may be deposited by several different processes. Common source gases include [[silane]] and [[oxygen]], [[dichlorosilane]] (SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitrous oxide]]&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Third World Congress of Chemical Engineering, Tokyo, p. 290 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), or [[tetraethylorthosilicate]] (TEOS; Si(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The reactions are as follows:&lt;ref name="cao:2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cao|first1=Guozhong|last2=Wang|first2=Ying|title=Nanostructures and Nanomaterials -- Synthesis, Properties and Applications|date=2011|publisher=World Scientific Publishing|isbn=978-981-4322-50-8|page=248|doi=10.1142/7885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HCl

:Si(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + byproducts

The choice of source gas depends on the thermal stability of the substrate; for instance, [[aluminium]] is sensitive to high temperature. Silane deposits between 300 and 500&amp;nbsp;°C, dichlorosilane at around 900&amp;nbsp;°C, and TEOS between 650 and 750&amp;nbsp;°C, resulting in a layer of ''low- temperature oxide'' (LTO). However, silane produces a lower-quality oxide than the other methods (lower [[dielectric strength]], for instance), and it deposits non[[conformal film|conformally]]. Any of these reactions may be used in LPCVD, but the silane reaction is also done in APCVD. CVD oxide invariably has lower quality than [[thermal oxidation|thermal oxide]], but thermal oxidation can only be used in the earliest stages of IC manufacturing.

Oxide may also be grown with impurities ([[alloy]]ing or "[[doping (semiconductor)|doping]]"). This may have two purposes. During further process steps that occur at high temperature, the impurities may [[atomic diffusion|diffuse]] from the oxide into adjacent layers (most notably silicon) and dope them. Oxides containing 5–15% impurities by mass are often used for this purpose. In addition, silicon dioxide alloyed with [[phosphorus pentoxide]] ("P-glass") can be used to smooth out uneven surfaces. P-glass softens and reflows at temperatures above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. This process requires a phosphorus concentration of at least 6%, but concentrations above 8% can corrode aluminium. Phosphorus is deposited from phosphine gas and oxygen:

:4 PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Glass]]es containing both boron and phosphorus (borophosphosilicate glass, BPSG) undergo viscous flow at lower temperatures; around 850&amp;nbsp;°C is achievable with glasses containing around 5 weight % of both constituents, but stability in air can be difficult to achieve. Phosphorus oxide in high concentrations interacts with ambient moisture to produce phosphoric acid. Crystals of BPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can also precipitate from the flowing glass on cooling; these crystals are not readily etched in the standard reactive plasmas used to pattern oxides, and will result in circuit defects in integrated circuit manufacturing.

Besides these intentional impurities, CVD oxide may contain byproducts of the deposition. TEOS produces a relatively pure oxide, whereas silane introduces hydrogen impurities, and dichlorosilane introduces [[chlorine]].

Lower temperature deposition of silicon dioxide and doped glasses from TEOS using ozone rather than oxygen has also been explored (350 to 500&amp;nbsp;°C). Ozone glasses have excellent conformality but tend to be hygroscopic – that is, they absorb water from the air due to the incorporation of silanol (Si-OH) in the glass. Infrared spectroscopy and mechanical strain as a function of temperature are valuable diagnostic tools for diagnosing such problems.

==== Silicon nitride ====
Silicon nitride is often used as an insulator and chemical barrier in manufacturing ICs. The following two reactions deposit silicon nitride from the gas phase:

:3 SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 12 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:3 SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HCl + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Silicon nitride deposited by LPCVD contains up to 8% hydrogen. It also experiences strong tensile [[stress (physics)|stress]], which may crack films thicker than 200&amp;nbsp;nm. However, it has higher [[resistivity]] and dielectric strength than most insulators commonly available in microfabrication (10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; [[ohm|Ω]]·cm and 10 M[[volt|V]]/cm, respectively).

Another two reactions may be used in plasma to deposit SiNH:

:2 SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 SiNH + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → SiNH + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

These films have much less tensile stress, but worse electrical properties (resistivity 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Ω·cm, and dielectric strength 1 to 5 MV/cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page = 384| title = Semiconductor devices: physics and technology|author = Sze, S.M. | publisher = Wiley-India| year = 2008|isbn =978-81-265-1681-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metals ===
CVD for [[tungsten]] is achieved from [[tungsten hexafluoride]] (WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), which may be deposited in two ways:

:WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → W + 3 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → W + 6 HF

Other metals, notably aluminium and [[copper]], can be deposited by CVD. {{As of|2010}}, commercially cost-effective CVD for copper did not exist, although volatile sources exist, such as Cu([[hexafluoroacetylacetone|hfac]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Copper is typically deposited by [[electroplating]]. Aluminum can be deposited from [[triisobutylaluminium]] (TIBAL) and related [[organoaluminium compound]]s.

CVD for [[molybdenum]], [[tantalum]], [[titanium]], nickel is widely used.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} These metals can form useful [[silicide]]s when deposited onto silicon. Mo, Ta and Ti are deposited by LPCVD, from their pentachlorides. Nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten can be deposited at low temperatures from their carbonyl precursors. In general, for an arbitrary metal ''M'', the chloride deposition reaction is as follows:

:2 MCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 M + 10 HCl

whereas the carbonyl decomposition reaction can happen spontaneously under thermal treatment or acoustic cavitation and is as follows:

:M(CO)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; → M + n CO

the decomposition of metal carbonyls is often violently precipitated by moisture or air, where oxygen reacts with the metal precursor to form metal or metal oxide along with carbon dioxide.

[[Niobium(V) oxide]] layers can be produced by the thermal decomposition of [[niobium(V) ethoxide]] with the loss of [[diethyl ether]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =  10.1149/1.2059247 | title =  Electrochromic Properties of Niobium Oxide Thin Films Prepared by Chemical Vapor Deposition | year =  1994 | last1 =  Maruyama | first1 =  Toshiro | journal =  Journal of the Electrochemical Society | volume =  141 | issue =  10 | pages =  2868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | title = Atomic Layer Deposition of High Permittivity Oxides: Film Growth and In Situ Studies |  author = Rahtu, Antti | publisher = University of Helsinki | url = http://hdl.handle.net/10138/21065 | year = 2002 | isbn = 952-10-0646-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the equation:

:2 Nb(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

=== Graphene ===
Many variations of CVD can be utilized to synthesize graphene. Although many advancements have been made, the processes listed below are not commercially viable yet.
* Carbon source
The most popular carbon source used to produce graphene is methane gas. Less popular choices include petroleum asphalt, notable for being inexpensive but more difficult to work with.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthesis of three-dimensional graphene from petroleum asphalt by chemical vapor deposition|journal = Materials Letters|date = 2014-05-01|pages = 285–288|volume = 122|doi = 10.1016/j.matlet.2014.02.077|first = Zhuchen|last = Liu|first2 = Zhiqiang|last2 = Tu|first3 = Yongfeng|last3 = Li|first4 = Fan|last4 = Yang|first5 = Shuang|last5 = Han|first6 = Wang|last6 = Yang|first7 = Liqiang|last7 = Zhang|first8 = Gang|last8 = Wang|first9 = Chunming|last9 = Xu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of catalyst
The use of catalyst is viable in changing the physical process of graphene production. Notable examples include iron nanoparticles, nickel foam, and gallium vapor. These catalysts can either be used in situ during graphene buildup,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Novel synthesis route to graphene using iron nanoparticles|journal = Journal of Materials Research|date = 2014|pages = 1522–1527|volume = 29|issue = 14|doi = 10.1557/jmr.2014.165|first = Rajen B.|last = Patel|first2 = Chi|last2 = Yu|first3 = Tsengming|last3 = Chou|first4 = Zafar|last4 = Iqbal|bibcode = 2014JMatR..29.1522P}}&lt;/ref&gt; or situated at some distance away at the deposition area.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Direct synthesis of large area graphene on insulating substrate by gallium vapor-assisted chemical vapor deposition|journal = Applied Physics Letters|date = 2015|pages = 093112|volume = 106|issue = 9|doi = 10.1063/1.4914114|first = Katsuhisa|last = Murakami|first2 = Shunsuke|last2 = Tanaka|first3 = Ayaka|last3 = Hirukawa|first4 = Takaki|last4 = Hiyama|first5 = Tomoya|last5 = Kuwajima|first6 = Emi|last6 = Kano|first7 = Masaki|last7 = Takeguchi|first8 = Jun-ichi|last8 = Fujita|bibcode = 2015ApPhL.106i3112M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some catalysts require another step to remove them from the sample material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The direct growth of high-quality, large single-crystalline domains of graphene on a dielectric substrate is of vital importance for applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Combining the advantages of both catalytic CVD and the ultra-flat dielectric substrate, gaseous catalyst-assisted CVD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Silane-catalysed fast growth of large single-crystalline graphene on hexagonal boron nitride |journal=Nature Communications  |volume=6  |year=2015|page=6499|doi=10.1038/ncomms7499 |pmid=25757864  |pmc=4382696  |last1=Tang |first1=Shujie |last2=Wang |first2=Haomin|last3=Wang |first3=Huishan |arxiv=1503.02806|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E6499T}}&lt;/ref&gt; paves the way for synthesizing high-quality graphene for device applications while avoiding the transfer process.
* Physical conditions
Physical conditions such as surrounding pressure, temperature, carrier gas, and chamber material play a big role in production of graphene.

Most systems use LPCVD with pressures ranging from 1 to 1500 Pa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = CVD synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene using urea|journal = Science China Physics, Mechanics &amp; Astronomy|date = 2015-09-05|pages = 1–6|volume = 58|issue = 10|doi = 10.1007/s11433-015-5717-0|first = CanKun|last = Zhang|first2 = WeiYi|last2 = Lin|first3 = ZhiJuan|last3 = Zhao|first4 = PingPing|last4 = Zhuang|first5 = LinJie|last5 = Zhan|first6 = YingHui|last6 = Zhou|first7 = WeiWei|last7 = Cai|bibcode = 2015SCPMA..58.7801Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthesis of CVD-graphene on rapidly heated copper foils|url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c3nr06434d|journal = Nanoscale|volume = 6|issue = 9|pages = 4728–34|doi = 10.1039/c3nr06434d|pmid = 24658264|first = Sang-Min|last = Kim|first2 = Jae-Hyun|last2 = Kim|first3 = Kwang-Seop|last3 = Kim|first4 = Yun|last4 = Hwangbo|first5 = Jong-Hyuk|last5 = Yoon|first6 = Eun-Kyu|last6 = Lee|first7 = Jaechul|last7 = Ryu|first8 = Hak-Joo|last8 = Lee|first9 = Seungmin|last9 = Cho|bibcode = 2014Nanos...6.4728K|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some still use APCVD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Low pressures are used more commonly as they help prevent unwanted reactions and produce more uniform thickness of deposition on the substrate.

On the other hand, temperatures used range from 800–1050&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; High temperatures translate to an increase of the rate of reaction. Caution has to be exercised as high temperatures do pose higher danger levels in addition to greater energy costs.
* Carrier gas
Hydrogen gas and inert gases such as argon are flowed into the system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These gases act as a carrier, enhancing surface reaction and improving reaction rate, thereby increasing deposition of graphene onto the substrate.
* Chamber material
Standard quartz tubing and chambers are used in CVD of graphene.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Quartz is chosen because it has a very high melting point and is chemically inert. In other words, quartz does not interfere with any physical or chemical reactions regardless of the conditions.
* Methods of analysis of results
Raman spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used to examine and characterize the graphene samples.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Raman spectroscopy is used to characterize and identify the graphene particles; X-ray spectroscopy is used to characterize chemical states; TEM is used to provide fine details regarding the internal composition of graphene; SEM is used to examine the surface and topography.

Sometimes, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to measure local properties such as friction and magnetism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Cold wall CVD technique can be used to study the underlying surface science involved in graphene nucleation and growth as it allows unprecedented control of process parameters like gas flow rates, temperature and pressure as demonstrated in a recent study. The study was carried out in a home-built vertical cold wall system utilizing resistive heating by passing direct current through the substrate. It provided conclusive insight into a typical surface-mediated nucleation and growth mechanism involved in two-dimensional materials grown using catalytic CVD under conditions sought out in the semiconductor industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=Shantanu|last2=Drucker|first2=Jeff|title=Nucleation and growth of single layer graphene on electrodeposited Cu by cold wall chemical vapor deposition|journal=Nanotechnology|volume=28|issue=10|pages=105601|doi=10.1088/1361-6528/aa593b|pmid=28084218|bibcode=2017Nanot..28j5601D|year=2017|url=https://zenodo.org/record/895408/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=Shantanu|last2=Drucker|first2=Jeff|title=Pre-coalescence scaling of graphene island sizes|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=28 May 2018|volume=123|issue=20|pages=205306|doi=10.1063/1.5021341|bibcode=2018JAP...123t5306D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphene nanoribbon===
In spite of graphene's exciting electronic and thermal properties, it is unsuitable as a transistor for future digital devices, due to the absence of a bandgap between the conduction and valence bands. This makes it impossible to switch between on and off states with respect to electron flow. Scaling things down, graphene nanoribbons of less than 10 nm in width do exhibit electronic bandgaps and are therefore potential candidates for digital devices. Precise control over their dimensions, and hence electronic properties, however, represents a challenging goal, and the ribbons typically possess rough edges that are detrimental to their performance.

=== Diamond ===

{{See also|Synthetic diamond#Chemical vapor deposition}}
CVD can be used to produce a [[synthetic diamond]] by creating the circumstances necessary for carbon atoms in a gas to settle on a substrate in crystalline form. CVD of diamonds has received much attention in the materials sciences because it allows many new applications that had previously been considered too expensive. CVD diamond growth typically occurs under low pressure (1–27 [[pascal (unit)|kPa]]; 0.145–3.926 [[pounds per square inch|psi]]; 7.5–203 [[Torr]])  and involves feeding varying amounts of gases into a chamber, energizing them and providing conditions for diamond growth on the substrate. The gases always include a carbon source, and typically include hydrogen as well, though the amounts used vary greatly depending on the type of diamond being grown. Energy sources include [[hot filament]], [[microwave]] power, and [[Electric arc|arc discharges]], among others. The energy source is intended to generate a plasma in which the gases are broken down and more complex chemistries occur. The actual chemical process for diamond growth is still under study and is complicated by the very wide variety of diamond growth processes used.

Using CVD, films of diamond can be grown over large areas of substrate with control over the properties of the diamond produced. In the past, when high pressure high temperature (HPHT) techniques were used to produce a diamond, the result was typically very small free standing diamonds of varying sizes. With CVD diamond growth areas of greater than fifteen centimeters (six inches) diameter have been achieved and much larger areas are likely to be successfully coated with diamond in the future. Improving this process is key to enabling several important applications.

The growth of diamond directly on a substrate allows the addition of many of diamond's important qualities to other materials. Since diamond has the highest [[thermal conductivity]] of any bulk material, layering diamond onto high heat producing electronics (such as optics and transistors) allows the diamond to be used as a heat sink.&lt;ref name="poly1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0925-9635(94)90108-2|title=Diamond protective coatings for optical components|year=1994|last1=Costello|first1=M|last2=Tossell|first2=D|last3=Reece|first3=D|last4=Brierley|first4=C|last5=Savage|first5=J|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=3|issue=8|pages=1137–1141|bibcode = 1994DRM.....3.1137C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heat2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.diamond.2005.05.008|title=Comparative study of thermally conductive fillers in underfill for the electronic components|year=2005|last1=Sun Lee|first1=Woong|last2=Yu|first2=Jin|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=14|issue=10|pages=1647–1653|bibcode = 2005DRM....14.1647S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond films are being grown on valve rings, cutting tools, and other objects that benefit from diamond's hardness and exceedingly low wear rate. In each case the diamond growth must be carefully done to achieve the necessary adhesion onto the substrate.  Diamond's very high scratch resistance and thermal conductivity, combined with a lower [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] than [[Pyrex]] glass, a [[coefficient of friction]] close to that of Teflon ([[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) and strong [[lipophilicity]] would make it a nearly ideal non-stick coating for cookware if large substrate areas could be coated economically.

CVD growth allows one to control the properties of the diamond produced. In the area of diamond growth, the word "diamond" is used as a description of any material primarily made up of [[Orbital hybridisation#sp3|sp3-bonded]] carbon, and there are many different types of diamond included in this. By regulating the processing parameters—especially the gases introduced, but also including the pressure the system is operated under, the temperature of the diamond, and the method of generating plasma—many different materials that can be considered diamond can be made. Single crystal diamond can be made containing various [[dopant]]s.&lt;ref name="single"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.diamond.2003.10.017|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223368741|title=Single crystal diamond for electronic applications|year=2004|last1=Isberg|first1=J|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=13|issue=2|pages=320–324|bibcode = 2004DRM....13..320I }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synthetic diamond#Crystallinity|Polycrystalline diamond]] consisting of grain sizes from several [[nanometer]]s to several [[micrometre|micrometers]] can be grown.&lt;ref name="poly1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poly2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0925-9635(01)00385-5|title=Ultrananocrystalline diamond thin films for MEMS and moving mechanical assembly devices|year=2001|last1=Krauss|first1=A|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=10|issue=11|pages=1952–1961|bibcode = 2001DRM....10.1952K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some polycrystalline diamond grains are surrounded by thin, non-diamond carbon, while others are not. These different factors affect the diamond's hardness, smoothness, conductivity, optical properties and more.

'''Climate risk''' means a risk resulting from [[climate change]] and affecting natural and human systems and regions.

In the course of increasing global temperature and extreme weather phenomena
the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) has been founded by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) for a better understanding of [[climate change]] and meeting concerns of these observations. Its main aim is evaluating climate risks and exploring strategies for the prevention of these risks.

==Climate risks==
As per current projections of [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] the following future effects have to be expected:
* Continuous increase of temperature
* Cumulation of [[extreme weather]] phenomena
* [[Bumper crops]] and [[crop failure]]
* [[Polar_ice_cap#Earth|Polar cap melting]]
* Changes of the planet’s ecology
* [[Epidemic|Spreading diseases]]
* Attenuation of the [[North Atlantic Drift]]

While affecting all economic sectors, the effect on single continents will differ. Beside these direct physical climate risks there are also indirect derived ones:
* Physical risks
* [[Regulation]]al risks
* [[Litigation]]al risks
* [[Competition]] risks
* [[Production (economics)|Production]] risks
* [[Reputation]] risks

===Physical risks===
Direct risks of climate change are expected especially for branches, which strongly depend on natural resources like [[agriculture]], [[fishing]], [[forestry]], [[health care]], [[real estate]] and [[tourism]]. For example, storms and flooding damage buildings and infrastructure, whereas hot summers with less precipitation cause crop failure.
===Regulational risks===
The governmental endeavours to reduce climate costs have direct effects on economy. For example, the targets regarding emissions within the [[Kyoto-Protocol]] shall be realised by implementing [[emissions trading]]. By this instrument the value of emissions can be quantified monetarily, approximating the value of avoiding hazardous substances. This value shall be internalized by companies and considered in investment decisions. By considering emission costs the prices for i.e. energy and transport can increase and therefore change consumer demand. The insecurity of legislation leads to indefinite adjournation of projects and investments.

===Litigational risks===
Similar to the [[tobacco industry]], industries producing excessive greenhouse gases are exposed to the risk of an increasing number of lawsuits, if damages can be traced back to emissions, i.e. for floodings, crop failure, etc.

===Competition risks===
If companies do not take measures to reduce climate risks they are competitively disadvantaged. This might lead to increasing production costs caused by obsolete technologies and therefore to decreasing profits.

===Production risks===
Production shortfalls can result from direct or indirect climate risks. I.e. [[hurricane]]s damaging oil production facilities can lead to a scarcity of oil and increasing prices. Also the price for energy will rise, because [[heatwave]]s cause [[water scarcity]] and therefore the supply for [[cooling water]] of [[power plant]]s becomes short.

===Reputation risks===
Companies who are publicly criticized for their environmental policy or high emission rates, might lose customers, because of negative reputation. This risk is currently subordinate.

==Climate opportunities==
Besides climate risks also opportunities can derive from climate change for some branches and innovative companies, i.e. for the automobile and renewable energy sectors. Especially energy-intensive sectors can reduce energy costs by using more efficient technologies, which necessarily have to be developed in near future.

'''Crushed stone''' or '''angular rock''' is a form of [[construction aggregate]], typically produced by mining a suitable rock deposit and breaking the removed rock down to the desired size using [[crusher]]s. It is distinct from [[gravel]] which is produced by natural processes of weathering and erosion, and typically has a more rounded shape.

==Uses==
Angular crushed stone is the key material for [[macadam]] road construction which depends on the interlocking of the individual stones' angular faces for its strength.&lt;ref name="isbn90-5699-159-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Max Lay |title=Handbook of Road Technology (Transportation Studies) |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |location=Washington, DC |year= 1998|pages= 28|isbn=90-5699-159-0 | quote = The strength and stiffness of the course of compacted angular stone came from the mechanical interlock which developed between individual pieces of stone. The principle is still used in modem road construction and since 1820 McAdam's name has been remembered by the term macadam used to describe the courses of unbound angular stone which he introduced.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crushed natural stone is also used similarly without a binder for [[riprap]], railroad [[track ballast]], and [[filter stone]]. It may be used with a binder in a [[composite material]] such as concrete, [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]], or [[asphalt concrete]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-8247-2605-7"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cunningham, William D. |author2=McKetta, John J. |title=Encyclopedia of chemical processing and design |publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]] |location=New York, N.Y |year=1976 |pages= 284 |isbn=0-8247-2605-7 | quote = Crushed stone can be used without binder for a variety of construction or industrial applications, or it may be mixed with a matrix binding material, such as bituminous or portland  cement.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hanson Aggregates Bellefonte PA.jpg|thumb|right|Crushed [[limestone]] [[quarry]] near [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania]].]]

==Background==
Crushed stone is one of the most accessible [[natural resource]]s, and is a major basic [[raw material]] used by [[construction]], agriculture, and other industries. Despite the low value of its basic products, the crushed stone industry is a major contributor to and an indicator of the [[Measures of national income and output|economic well-being of a nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/stone_crushed/ |title=USGS Minerals Information: Crushed Stone |accessdate=2007-11-11 |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The demand for crushed stone is determined mostly by the level of construction activity, and, therefore, the demand for construction materials.&lt;ref name=Tepordei&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/stone_crushed/stat/ |title= Statistical Compendium - Crushed Stone|accessdate=2007-11-11 | date=1997-11-04 | first = Valentin V. | last = Tepordei |publisher = U.S. Geological Survey |work= Minerals Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone resources of the world are very large. High-purity [[limestone]] and [[dolomite]] suitable for specialty uses are limited in many geographic areas. Crushed stone substitutes for [[roadbuilding]] include [[sand]] and [[gravel]], and [[slag]]. Substitutes for crushed stone used as construction aggregates include sand and gravel, iron and steel slag, [[sintered]] or expanded [[clay]] or [[shale]], and [[perlite]] or [[vermiculite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/stone_crushed/stcrumcs07.pdf |title= Stone (Crushed)|accessdate=2007-11-11 |date = January 2007 | first = Jason Christopher | last = Willett |publisher = U.S. Geological Survey |work= Mineral Commodity Summaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:2d Av subway crush stone 72 jeh.jpg|thumb|Crushed stone being laid to underlie a road surface]]

Crushed stone is a high-volume, low-value [[commodity]]. The industry is highly competitive and is characterized by many operations serving local or regional markets. Production costs are determined mainly by the cost of labor, equipment, energy, and water, in addition to the costs of compliance with [[Environmental law|environmental]] and [[Occupational safety and health|safety]] regulations. These costs vary depending on geographic location, the nature of the deposit, and the number and type of products produced. Crushed stone has one of the lowest average by weight values of all mineral commodities. The average unit price increased from US$1.58 per metric ton, f.o.b. plant, in 1970 to US$4.39 in 1990. However, the unit price in constant 1982 dollars fluctuated between US$3.48 and US$3.91 per metric ton for the same period. Increased [[productivity]] achieved through increased use of [[automation]] and more efficient equipment was mainly responsible for maintaining the prices at this level.&lt;ref name=Tepordei/&gt;

Transportation is a major factor in the delivered price of crushed stone. The cost of moving crushed stone from the plant to the market often equals or exceeds the sale price of the product at the plant. Because of the high cost of transportation and the large quantities of bulk material that have to be shipped, crushed stone is usually marketed locally. The high cost of transportation is responsible for the wide dispersion of quarries, usually located near highly populated areas. However, increasing land values combined with local environmental concerns are moving crushed stone quarries farther from the end-use locations, increasing the price of delivered material. [[Economies of scale]], which might be realized if fewer, larger operations served larger marketing areas, would probably not offset the increased transportation costs.&lt;ref name=Tepordei/&gt;

==United States statistical data==
According to the [[United States Geological Survey]], 1.72&amp;nbsp;billion tonnes of crushed stone worth $13.8&amp;nbsp;billion was sold or used in 2006, of which 1.44&amp;nbsp;billion tonnes was used as [[construction aggregate]], 74.9&amp;nbsp;million tonnes used for cement manufacture, and 18.1&amp;nbsp;million tonnes used to make [[lime (material)|lime]]. Crushed [[marble]] sold or used totaled 11.8&amp;nbsp;million tonnes, the majority of which was ground very fine and used as [[calcium carbonate]].

In 2006, 9.40&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of crushed stone (almost all [[limestone]] or [[dolomite]]) was used for [[soil]] treatment, primarily to reduce [[soil acidity]]. Soils tend to become acidic from heavy use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers, unless a [[soil conditioner]] is used. Using aglime  or [[agricultural lime]], a finely-ground limestone or dolomite, to change the soil from acidic to nearly neutral particularly benefits crops by maximizing availability of plant nutrients, and also by reducing aluminum or [[manganese]] toxicity, promoting soil microbe activity, and improving the soil structure.

In 2006, 5.29&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of crushed stone (mostly limestone or dolomite) was used as a flux in [[blast furnaces]] and in certain steel furnaces to react with [[gangue]] minerals (i.e. [[silica]] and silicate impurities) to produce liquid [[slag]] that floats and can be poured off from the much denser molten metal (i.e., iron). The slag cools to become a stone-like material that is commonly crushed and recycled as [[construction aggregate]].

In addition, 4.53&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of crushed stone was used for fillers and extenders (including asphalt fillers or extenders), 2.71&amp;nbsp;million tonnes for sulfur oxide removal-mine dusting-acid water treatment, and 1.45&amp;nbsp;million tonnes sold or used for poultry grit or mineral food.

Crushed stone is recycled primarily as [[construction aggregate]] or concrete.

==Landscape use==
Crushed stone or '[[road metal]]' is used in [[landscape design]] and gardening for gardens, parks, and municipal and private projects as a [[mulch]], [[walkway]], path, and [[driveway]] pavement, and cell infill for modular [[permeable paving]] units. As a mineral mulch its benefits include erosion control, water conservation, weed suppression, and aesthetic qualities. It is often seen used in [[rock garden]]s and [[cactus garden]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardening.cornell.edu/factsheets/mulch/mulchland.html#stone Cornell University: Gardening Resources - mulches]. accessed 5.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://landscaping.about.com/od/drivewaysandwalkways1/f/gravel_driveway.htm AboutGardens: Crushed stone driveways]. accessed 5.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earth Rotation (Nepal, Himalayas).jpg|thumb|This [[long-exposure photography|long-exposure photo]] of the [[Northern celestial hemisphere|northern]] [[night sky]] over the [[Nepal]]i [[Himalayas]] shows the [[star trail|apparent paths]] of the stars as Earth rotates.]]

'''Earth's rotation''' is the [[rotation]] of [[Earth|Planet Earth]] around its own [[axial tilt|axis]]. Earth rotates [[east]]ward, in [[retrograde and prograde motion|prograde motion]]. As viewed from the north [[pole star]] [[Polaris]], Earth turns [[clockwise|counter clockwise]].

The [[North Pole]], also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole, is the point in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] where Earth's axis of rotation meets its surface. This point is distinct from Earth's [[North Magnetic Pole]]. The [[South Pole]] is the other point where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface, in [[Antarctica]].

Earth rotates once in about 24 hours with respect to the [[Sun]], but once every 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds with respect to the stars ([[#Stellar and sidereal day|see below]]). Earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time; thus, a day was shorter in the past. This is due to the [[tidal acceleration|tidal effects]] the [[Moon]] has on Earth's rotation. [[Atomic clock]]s show that a modern day is longer by about 1.7 [[millisecond]]s than a century ago,&lt;ref name="McCarthySeidelmann2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dennis D. McCarthy|author2=Kenneth P. Seidelmann|title=Time: From Earth Rotation to Atomic Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjFVW3-LGigC|date=18 September 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-3-527-62795-0|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; slowly increasing the rate at which [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] is adjusted by [[leap second]]s. Analysis of historical astronomical records shows a slowing trend of about 2.3 milliseconds per century since the [[8th century BC|8th century BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Stephenson |first=F. Richard |title=Historical eclipses and Earth's rotation |journal=Astronomy &amp; Geophysics |year=2003 |volume=44 |number=2 |pages=2.22–2.27 |doi=10.1046/j.1468-4004.2003.44222.x |url=http://astrogeo.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/2/2.22.full|bibcode=2003A&amp;G....44b..22S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Among the ancient Greeks, several of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] school believed in the rotation of the earth rather than the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens. Perhaps the first was [[Philolaus]] (470–385 BCE), though his system was complicated, including a [[Counter-Earth|counter-earth]] rotating daily about a central fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=George Bosworth|last=Burch|title=The Counter-Earth|journal=Osiris|volume=11|year=1954|pages=267–294|jstor=301675|doi=10.1086/368583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more conventional picture was that supported by [[Hicetas]], [[Heraclides Ponticus|Heraclides]] and [[Ecphantus]] in the fourth century BCE who assumed that the earth rotated but did not suggest that the earth revolved about the sun. In the third century BCE, [[Aristarchus of Samos]] suggested the [[Heliocentrism|sun's central place]].

However, [[Aristotle]] in the fourth century BCE criticized the ideas of Philolaus as being based on theory rather than observation. He established the idea of a sphere of fixed stars that rotated about the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aristotle|title=Of the Heavens|at=Book II, Ch 13. 1.|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/heavens.2.ii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was accepted by most of those who came after, in particular [[Claudius Ptolemy]] (2nd century CE), who thought the earth would be devastated by gales if it rotated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Almagest Book I, Chapter 8|author=Ptolemy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 499 CE, the [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomer]] [[Aryabhata]] wrote that the spherical earth rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the Earth. He provided the following analogy: "Just as a man in a boat going in one direction sees the stationary things on the bank as moving in the opposite direction, in the same way to a man at [[Lanka]] the fixed stars appear to be going westward."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/data1/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b61_51.pdf] {{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kim Plofker|title=Mathematics in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHvThPNp9yMC&amp;pg=PA71|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-12067-6|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, some [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Muslim astronomers]] accepted that the Earth rotates around its axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 108| issue = 67| pages = 762| author = Alessandro Bausani| title = Cosmology and Religion in Islam| journal = Scientia/Rivista di Scienza| date = 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[al-Biruni]], [[Abu Sa'id al-Sijzi]] (d. circa 1020) invented an [[astrolabe]] called ''al-zūraqī'' based on the idea believed by some of his contemporaries "that the motion we see is due to the Earth's movement and not to that of the sky."&lt;ref name=young /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = SUNY Press| isbn = 9781438414195| last = Nasr| first = Seyyed Hossein| title = An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines| date = 1 January 1993|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of this view is further confirmed by a reference from the 13th century which states: "According to the geometers [or engineers] (''muhandisīn''), the earth is in constant circular motion, and what appears to be the motion of the heavens is actually due to the motion of the earth and not the stars."&lt;ref name=young&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 9780521028875| editor-last1 = Young| editor-first1 = M.

Not until [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in 1543 adopted a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] world system did the contemporary understanding of earth's rotation begin to be established. Copernicus pointed out that if the movement of the earth is violent, then the movement of the stars must be very much more so. He acknowledged the contribution of the Pythagoreans and pointed to examples of relative motion. For Copernicus this was the first step in establishing the simpler pattern of planets circling a central sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nicolas|last=Copernicus|title=On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres|at=Book I, Chap 5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tycho Brahe]], who produced accurate observations on which [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] based his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws]], used Copernicus's work as the basis of a [[Tychonic system|system]] assuming a stationary earth. In 1600, [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] strongly supported the earth's rotation in his treatise on the earth's magnetism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=Gilbert|title=De Magnete, On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on the Great Magnet the Earth|pages=313–347|url=https://archive.org/stream/williamgilbertof00gilb#page/316 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby influenced many of his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reception of Copernicus' Heliocentric Theory|editor= J.

However, the contributions of Kepler, [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] gathered support for the theory of the rotation of the Earth.

===Empirical tests===
Earth's rotation implies that the [[equatorial bulge|Equator bulges]] and the [[geographical pole]]s are flattened. In his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', Newton predicted this [[flattening]] would occur in the ratio of 1:230, and pointed to the [[pendulum]] measurements taken by [[Jean Richer|Richer]] in 1673 as corroboration of the change in [[gravity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Isaac |last=Newton |title=Newton's Principia |page=412 |year=1846 |translator=A. Motte |url=https://archive.org/stream/100878576#page/412}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[History of Geodesy#Europe|initial measurements]] of [[meridian arc|meridian lengths]] by [[Jean Picard|Picard]] and [[Jacques Cassini|Cassini]] at the end of the 17th century suggested the opposite. However, measurements by [[Maupertuis]] and the [[French Geodesic Mission]] in the 1730s established the [[figure of the Earth|oblateness of Earth]], thus confirming the positions of both Newton and [[Copernicus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Newton Wars and the Beginning of the French Enlightenment |first=J. B. |last=Shank |year=2008 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |pages=324, 355 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBusxgu8-AAC&amp;pg=PA234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Earth's rotating frame of reference, a freely moving body follows an apparent path that deviates from the one it would follow in a fixed frame of reference. Because of the [[Coriolis effect]], falling bodies veer slightly eastward from the vertical plumb line below their point of release, and projectiles veer right in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] (and left in the [[Southern Hemisphere|Southern]]) from the direction in which they are shot. The Coriolis effect is mainly observable at a meteorological scale, where it is responsible for the opposite directions of [[cyclone]] rotation in the Northern and Southern hemispheres (anticlockwise and [[clockwise]], respectively).

Hooke, following a suggestion from Newton in 1679, tried unsuccessfully to verify the predicted eastward deviation of a body dropped from a height of {{nowrap|8.2 meters}}, but definitive results were obtained later, in the late 18th and early 19th century, by [[Giovanni Battista Guglielmini]] in [[Bologna]], [[Johann Friedrich Benzenberg]] in [[Hamburg]] and [[Ferdinand Reich]] in [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]], using taller towers and carefully released weights.&lt;ref group=n&gt;See [[:de:Fallexperimente zum Nachweis der Erdrotation|Fallexperimente zum Nachweis der Erdrotation]] (German Wikipedia article).&lt;/ref&gt; A ball dropped from a height of {{convert|158.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} departed by {{convert|27.4|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} from the vertical compared with a calculated value of {{convert|28.1|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.

The most celebrated test of Earth's rotation is the [[Foucault pendulum]] first built by physicist [[Léon Foucault]] in 1851, which consisted of a lead-filled brass sphere suspended {{nowrap|67 m}} from the top of the [[Panthéon (Paris)|Panthéon]] in Paris. Because of the Earth's rotation under the swinging pendulum, the pendulum's plane of oscillation appears to rotate at a rate depending on latitude. At the latitude of Paris the predicted and observed shift was about {{nowrap|11 degrees}} [[clockwise]] per hour. Foucault pendulums now swing in [[List of Foucault pendulums|museums around the world]].

===True solar day===
{{Main article|Solar time}}
Earth's [[rotation period]] relative to the Sun ([[solar noon]] to solar noon) is its ''true solar day'' or ''apparent solar day''. It depends on the Earth's orbital motion and is thus affected by changes in the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and [[inclination]] of Earth's orbit. Both vary over thousands of years, so the annual variation of the true solar day also varies. Generally, it is longer than the mean solar day during two periods of the year and shorter during another two.{{refn|When Earth's eccentricity exceeds 0.047 and perihelion is at an appropriate equinox or solstice, only one period with one peak balances another period that has two peaks.&lt;ref name=Meeus/&gt;|group=n}} The true solar day tends to be longer near [[apsis|perihelion]] when the Sun apparently moves along the [[ecliptic]] through a greater angle than usual, taking about {{nowrap|10 seconds}} longer to do so. Conversely, it is about {{nowrap|10 seconds}} shorter near [[apsis|aphelion]]. It is about {{nowrap|20 seconds}} longer near a [[solstice]] when the projection of the Sun's apparent motion along the ecliptic onto the [[celestial equator]] causes the Sun to move through a greater angle than usual. Conversely, near an [[equinox]] the projection onto the equator is shorter by about {{nowrap|20 seconds}}. Currently, the perihelion and solstice effects combine to lengthen the true solar day near {{nowrap|22 December}} by {{nowrap|30 mean}} solar seconds, but the solstice effect is partially cancelled by the aphelion effect near {{nowrap|19 June}} when it is only {{nowrap|13 seconds}} longer. The effects of the equinoxes shorten it near {{nowrap|26 March}} and {{nowrap|16 September}} by {{nowrap|18 seconds}} and {{nowrap|21 seconds}}, respectively.&lt;ref name="Meeus"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean Meeus|author2=J.

=== {{anchor|ephemeris}} Mean solar day===
{{main|Solar time#Mean solar time}}
The average of the true solar day during the course of an entire year is the ''mean solar day'', which contains {{nowrap|86,400 mean}} solar seconds. Currently, each of these seconds is slightly longer than an [[SI]] second because Earth's mean solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to [[tidal friction]]. The average length of the mean solar day since the introduction of the leap second in 1972 has been about 0 to 2 ms longer than 86,400 SI seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eoppc/eop/eopc04_05/eopc04.62-now|title= INTERNATIONAL EARTH ROTATION AND REFERENCE SYSTEMS SERVICE : EARTH ORIENTATION PARAMETERS : EOP (IERS) 05 C04|website=Hpiers.obspm.fr|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/136/5/1906/pdf/1538-3881_136_5_1906.pdf |format=PDF|title=Physical basis of leap seconds|website=Iopscience.iop.org|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html Leap seconds] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312000000/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html |date=12 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Random fluctuations due to core-mantle coupling have an amplitude of about 5 ms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ien.it/luc/cesio/itu/gambis.pdf|title=Prediction of Universal Time and LOD Variations|website=Ien.it|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.

These tables were used to calculate the world's [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] between 1900 and 1983, so this second became known as the [[ephemeris second]]. In 1967 the SI second was made equal to the ephemeris second.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html Leap seconds by USNO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312000000/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html |date=12 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's rotation period relative to the [[fixed star]]s, called its ''stellar day'' by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS), is {{nowrap|86,164.098 903 691}} seconds of mean solar time (UT1) {{nowrap|(23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.098 903 691{{smallsup|s}}}}, {{nowrap|0.997 269 663 237 16}} mean solar days).&lt;ref name=IERS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/models/constants.html|title=USEFUL CONSTANTS|website=Hpiers.obspm.fr|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Aoki, the ultimate source of these figures, uses the term "seconds of UT1" instead of "seconds of mean solar time".&lt;ref&gt;Aoki, ''et al.'', "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982A&amp;A...105..359A The new definition of Universal Time]", ''Astronomy and Astrophysics'' '''105''' (1982) 359–361.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} Earth's rotation period relative to the [[axial precession|precessing]] mean vernal [[equinox (celestial coordinates)|equinox]], named ''[[sidereal time|sidereal day]]'', is {{nowrap|86,164.090 530 832 88}} seconds of mean solar time (UT1) {{nowrap|(23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.090 530 832 88{{smallsup|s}}}}, {{nowrap|0.997 269 566 329 08}} mean solar days).&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt; Thus, the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about {{nowrap|8.4 ms}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |editor=P.

Recently (1999–2010) the average annual length of the mean solar day in excess of 86,400 SI seconds has varied between {{nowrap|0.25 ms}} and {{nowrap|1 ms}}, which must be added to both the stellar and sidereal days given in mean solar time above to obtain their lengths in SI seconds (see [[Fluctuations in the length of day]]).

===Angular speed===
[[File:Earth_rotation_tangential_speed.svg|thumb|Plot of latitude vs tangential speed. The dashed line shows the [[Kennedy Space Center]] example. The dot-dash line denotes typical airliner [[cruise speed]].]]

The angular speed of Earth's rotation in inertial space is {{nowrap|(7.2921150 ± 0.0000001){{E|−5}}}} [[radian]]s per SI second (mean solar second).&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt; Multiplying by (180°/π radians) × (86,400 seconds/mean solar day) yields 360.9856°/mean solar day, indicating that Earth rotates more than 360° relative to the fixed stars in one solar day. Earth's movement along its nearly circular orbit while it is rotating once around its axis requires that Earth rotate slightly more than once relative to the fixed stars before the mean Sun can pass overhead again, even though it rotates only once (360°) relative to the mean Sun.&lt;ref group=n&gt;In astronomy, unlike geometry, 360° means returning to the same point in some cyclical time scale, either one mean solar day or one sidereal day for rotation on Earth's axis, or one sidereal year or one mean tropical year or even one mean [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] containing exactly {{nowrap|365.25 days}} for revolution around the Sun.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiplying the value in rad/s by Earth's equatorial radius of {{nowrap|6,378,137 m}} ([[WGS84]] ellipsoid) (factors of 2π radians needed by both cancel) yields an '''equatorial speed of {{cvt|465.1|m/s|ft/s}}''', or {{cvt|1,674.4|km/h|mi/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur N. Cox, ed., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=w8PK2XFLLH8C&amp;pg=PA244 Allen's Astrophysical Quantities]'' p.244.&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources state that Earth's equatorial speed is slightly less, or {{nowrap|1,669.8 km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Bakich, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PE99nOKjbXAC&amp;pg=PA50 The Cambridge planetary handbook]'', p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; This is obtained by dividing Earth's equatorial circumference by {{nowrap|24 hours}}. However, the use of only one circumference unwittingly implies only one rotation in inertial space, so the corresponding time unit must be a sidereal hour. This is confirmed by multiplying by the number of sidereal days in one mean solar day, {{nowrap|1.002 737 909 350 795}},&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt; which yields the equatorial speed in mean solar hours given above of {{nowrap|1,674.4 km/h}}.

The tangential speed of Earth's rotation at a point on Earth can be approximated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Butterworth|author2=Palmer|last-author-amp=yes|title=Speed of the turning of the Earth|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970401c.html|work=Ask an Astrophysicist|publisher=NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Kennedy Space Center]] is located at latitude 28.59° N, which yields a speed of: cos 28.59&amp;deg; &amp;times; {{convert|1674.4|km/h|mph m/s|abbr=on}} = {{convert|1470.23|km/h|mph m/s|abbr=on}}

=== In rotational axis ===
The Earth's rotation axis moves with respect to the fixed stars ([[inertial space]]); the components of this motion are [[precession]] and [[nutation]]. It also moves with respect to the Earth's crust; this is called [[polar motion]].

Precession is a rotation of the Earth's rotation axis, caused primarily by external torques from the gravity of the [[Sun]], Moon and other bodies. The polar motion is primarily due to [[Nutation|free core nutation]] and the [[Chandler wobble]].

=== In rotational velocity ===

==== Tidal interactions ====
Over millions of years, the Earth's rotation slowed significantly by [[tidal acceleration]] through gravitational interactions with the Moon. In this process, [[angular momentum]] is slowly transferred to the Moon at a rate proportional to &lt;math&gt;r^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the orbital radius of the Moon. This process gradually increased the length of day to its current value and resulted in the Moon being [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] with the Earth.

This gradual rotational deceleration is empirically documented with estimates of day lengths obtained from observations of [[tidal rhythmites]] and [[stromatolite]]s; a compilation of these measurements&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=George E.|date=1 February 2000|title=Geological constraints on the Precambrian history of Earth's rotation and the Moon's orbit|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/1999RG900016/abstract|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|language=en|volume=38|issue=1|pages=37–59|doi=10.1029/1999RG900016|issn=1944-9208|bibcode=2000RvGeo..38...37W}}&lt;/ref&gt; found the length of day to increase steadily from about 21 hours at 600Myr ago&lt;ref name=Zahnle/&gt; to the current 24 hour value. By counting the microscopic lamina that form at higher tides, tidal frequencies (and thus day lengths) can be estimated, much like counting tree rings, though these estimates can be increasingly unreliable at older ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-67097-8_12|title=Periodic Growth Features in Fossil Organisms and the Length of the Day and Month|last=Scrutton|first=C.

C.|date=1 January 1987|title=A constant daylength during the Precambrian era?|journal=Precambrian Research|volume=37|pages=95–105|issn=0301-9268|pmid=11542096|doi=10.1016/0301-9268(87)90073-8|bibcode=1987PreR...37...95Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; This day length corresponds to the semidiurnal [[Resonance frequency|resonant period]] of the thermally-driven [[atmospheric tide]]; at this day length, the decelerative lunar torque could have been canceled by an accelerative torque from the atmospheric tide, resulting in no net torque and a constant rotational period. This stabilizing effect could have been broken by a sudden change in global temperature. Recent computational simulations support this hypothesis and suggest the [[Marinoan glaciation|Marinoan]] or [[Sturtian glaciation]]s broke this stable configuration about 600Myr ago, citing the resemblance of simulated results and existing paleorotational data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartlett|first=Benjamin C.|last2=Stevenson|first2=David J.|date=1 January 2016|title=Analysis of a Precambrian resonance-stabilized day length|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL068912/abstract|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|pages=2016GL068912|doi=10.1002/2016GL068912|issn=1944-8007|arxiv=1502.01421|bibcode=2016GeoRL..43.5716B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global events ====

[[File:Deviation of day length from SI day.svg|thumb|Deviation of day length from SI based day]]

Additionally, some large-scale events, such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], have caused the length of a day to shorten by 3 microseconds by affecting the Earth's moment of inertia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2004/041229/full/news041229-6.html Sumatran earthquake sped up Earth's rotation], Nature, 30 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Post-glacial rebound]], ongoing since the last [[Ice age]], is also changing the distribution of the Earth's mass thus affecting the [[moment of inertia]] of the Earth and, by the [[conservation of angular momentum]], the Earth's rotation period.&lt;ref name="wu-peltier-1984"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wu |first=P. |author2=W.R.Peltier |year=1984 |title=Pleistocene deglaciation and the earth's rotation: a new analysis |journal=Geophysical Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=76 |pages=753–792 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.1984.tb01920.x |issue=3|bibcode = 1984GeoJ...76..753W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measurement===
The primary monitoring of the Earth's rotation is performed with [[very-long-baseline interferometry]] coordinated with the [[Global Positioning System]], [[satellite laser ranging]], and other [[satellite]] techniques. This provides an absolute [[reference]] for the determination of [[universal time]], precession, and nutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/techniques/techniques.html|title=Permanent monitoring|website=Hpiers.obspm.fr|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient observations===
There are recorded observations of [[solar eclipse|solar]] and [[lunar eclipse]]s by [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian]] and [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomers]] beginning in the 8th century BCE, as well as from [[astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|the medieval Islamic world]] and elsewhere. These observations can be used to determine changes in the Earth's rotation over the last 27 centuries, since the length of the day is a critical parameter in the calculation of the place and time of eclipses. A change in day length of milliseconds per century shows up as a change of hours and thousands of kilometers in eclipse observations. The ancient data are consistent with a shorter day, meaning the Earth was turning faster throughout the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sid Perkins|date=6 December 2016|title=Ancient eclipses show Earth’s rotation is slowing|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.aa10469|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/12/ancient-eclipses-show-earth-s-rotation-slowing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=FR Stephenson |author2=LV Morrison |author3=CY Hohonkerk |title= Measurement of the Earth’s rotation: 720 BC to AD 2015 |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society A |date=7 December 2016 |doi= 10.1098/rspa.2016.0404 |volume= 472 |issue= 2196 |url= http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/472/2196/20160404 |bibcode=2016RSPSA.47260404S |pmc=5247521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|right|thumb|An artist's rendering of the [[protoplanetary disk]].]]
The Earth's original rotation was a vestige of the original [[angular momentum]] of the cloud of [[dust]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], and [[gas]] that coalesced to form the [[Solar System]]. This primordial cloud was composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] produced in the [[Big Bang]], as well as heavier [[chemical element|elements]] ejected by [[supernova]]s. As this [[interstellar dust]] is heterogeneous, any asymmetry during gravitational accretion resulted in the angular momentum of the eventual planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/56-our-solar-system/planets-and-dwarf-planets/general-questions/218-why-do-planets-rotate-intermediate| title = Why do planets rotate?| work = Ask an Astronomer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if the [[giant-impact hypothesis]] for the origin of the Moon is correct, this primordial rotation rate would have been reset by the [[Theia (planet)|Theia]] impact 4.5 billion years ago. Regardless of the speed and tilt of the Earth's rotation before the impact, it would have experienced a day some five hours long after the impact.&lt;ref name=areps15&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stevenson | first=D. J. | title=Origin of the moon–The collision hypothesis | journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences | date=1987 | volume=15 | issue=1 | pages=271–315 | bibcode=1987AREPS..15..271S | doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.15.050187.001415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tidal effects would then have slowed this rate to its modern value.

Energy resources bring with them great social and economic promise, providing financial growth for communities and energy services for local economies. However, the infrastructure which delivers energy services can break down in an '''energy accident''', sometimes causing much damage, and '''energy fatalities''' can occur, and with many systems often deaths will happen even when the systems are working as intended.

Historically, [[coal mining]] has been the most dangerous energy activity and the list of historical [[coal]] [[Mining accident|mining disasters]] is a long one. [[Underground mining]] hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse and [[gas]] explosions. [[Open cut mining]] hazards are principally mine wall failures and vehicle collisions. In the US alone, more than 100,000 coal miners have been killed in accidents over the past century,&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125676950 "Former Miner Explains Culture Of Mining.]" NPR: National Public Radio. April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; with more than 3,200 dying in 1907 alone.&lt;ref name="Coal Mining Steeped in History"&gt;"[http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Mine/story?id=1475697 Coal Mining Steeped in History]". ABC News. January 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], 279 ''major'' energy accidents occurred from 1907 to 2007 and they caused 182,156 deaths with $41 billion in property damages, with these figures not including deaths from smaller accidents.&lt;ref name=bksenpol&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]]. A preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, 1907–2007, ''[[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]'' 36 (2008), pp. 1802–1820.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by far the greatest energy fatalities that result from energy generation by humanity, is the creation of [[air pollution]]. The most lethal of which, [[particulate matter]], which is primarily generated from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s and [[biomass]] is (counting outdoor air pollution effects only) estimated to cause 2.1 million deaths annually.&lt;ref name="spaceref.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceref.com/earth/fine-particulate-matter-map-shows-premature-mortality-due-to-air-polution.html |title=

According to [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], while responsible for less than 1 percent of the total number of energy accidents, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] facilities claimed 94 percent of reported immediate fatalities. Results on immediate fatalities are dominated by one disaster in which  Typhoon Nina in 1975 washed out the [[Shimantan Dam]] (Henan Province, China) and 171,000 people perished.&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; While the other major accident that involved greater than 1000 immediate deaths followed the rupture of the [[1998 Jesse pipeline explosion|NNPC petroleum pipeline]] in 1998 and the resulting explosion.&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; The other singular accident described by Sovacool is the ''predicted'' latent death toll of greater than 1000, as a result of the 1986 [[steam explosion]] at the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear reactor]] in the Ukraine. With approximately 4000 deaths in total, to eventually result in the decades ahead due to the [[radio-isotope]] pollution released.

In the oil and gas industry, the need for improved [[safety culture]] and training within companies is evidenced by the finding that workers new to a company are more likely to be involved in fatalities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Coal mining accidents resulted in 5,938 immediate deaths in 2005, and 4746 immediate deaths in 2006 in China alone according to the [[World Wildlife Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pozon|first=Ina|author2=Puanani Mench|title=Coming Clean: The future of coal in the Asia-Pacific region|journal=WWF|year=2006|url=http://wwf.panda.org/index.cfm?uNewsID=112520|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mining is the most dangerous occupation in China, the death rate for every 100 tons of coal mined is 100 times that of the death rate in the US and 30 times that achieved in South Africa. Moreover, 600,000 Chinese coal miners, as of 2004, were suffering from [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis]] (known as "black lung") a disease of the lungs caused by long-continued inhalation of coal dust. And the figure increases by 70,000 miners every year in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-11/13/content_391242.htm|title= Coal mining: Most deadly job in China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, coal mining has been a very dangerous activity and the list of historical [[coal]] [[mining disasters]] is a long one. In the US alone, more than 100,000 coal miners were killed in accidents over the past century,&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; with more than 3,200 dying in 1907 alone.&lt;ref name="Coal Mining Steeped in History"/&gt; In the decades following this peak, an annual death toll of 1,500 miner fatalities occurred every year in the US until approximately the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/FactSheets/MSHAFCT2.HTM|title= Injury Trends in Mining }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mining fatalities in the US between 1990 and 2012 have continued to decline, with fewer than 100 each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/FactSheets/MSHAFCT10.HTM|title= Mine Safety and Health at a Glance}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See more [[Coal mining disasters in the United States]])

In the United States, in the 2000s, after three decades of regulation on the [[Environmental impact of the coal industry]], including regulations in the 1970s and 1990s from the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], an act created to cut down on pollution related deaths from fossil fuel usage, US [[coal]] fired power plants were estimated, in the 2000s, to continue to cause between 10,000 and 30,000 latent, or air pollution related deaths per year, due to the emissions of [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]] and directly emitted [[particulate matter]] that result when coal is burnt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/rpp/RFF-DP-12-25.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Health Organization]] in 2012, urban outdoor air pollution, from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s and [[biomass]] is estimated to cause 3 million deaths worldwide per year and indoor air pollution from biomass and fossil fuel burning is estimated to cause approximately 4.3 million premature deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/|title= Air quality and health}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 a team of researchers estimated the number of premature deaths caused by particulate matter in outdoor air pollution as 2.1 million, occurring annually.&lt;ref name="spaceref.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iopscience.iop.org"/&gt;

==Economic costs==
Benjamin Sovacool says that while hydroelectric plants were responsible for the most fatalities,{{Contradict-inline|reason=The table in the Fatalities section above attributes a far higher number of fatalities to fossil fuels|date=June 2017}} [[nuclear power]] plants rank first in terms of their economic cost, accounting for 41 percent of all property damage. Oil and hydroelectric follow at around 25 percent each, followed by natural gas at 9 percent and coal at 2 percent.&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; Excluding Chernobyl and the Shimantan Dam, the three other most expensive accidents involved the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] (Alaska), The [[Prestige oil spill]] (Spain), and the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]] (Pennsylvania).&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; However analysis presented in the international Journal, ''Human and Ecological Risk Assessment'' found that coal, oil, [[Liquid petroleum gas]] and hydro accidents have cost more than nuclear power accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10807030802387556|title=A Comparative Analysis of Accident Risks in Fossil, Hydro, and Nuclear Energy Chains|journal=Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: an International Journal|volume=14|issue=5|pages=947|year=2008|last1=Burgherr|first1=Peter|last2=Hirschberg|first2=Stefan}} See also [http://gabe.web.psi.ch/pdfs/_2012_LEA_Audit/TA01.pdf], p. 968 onwards.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern-day U.S. regulatory agencies frequently implement regulations on conventional pollution if one life or more is predicted saved per $6 million to $8 million of economic costs incurred.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times.

'''Erminio Sipari''' (1 December 1879 &amp;ndash; 28 January 1968) was an Italian [[politician]] and [[naturalist]], author of studies on the preservation of nature and founder of [[Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo]], which he chaired from 1922 to 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rivista.ssef.it/site.php?page=20040929130258263 Lorenzo Arnone Sipari, ''Il Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo liberato dall'allagamento.

==Biography==
Sipari was born in [[Alvito, Lazio|Alvito]], [[Lazio]]. His family, well known in [[southern Italy]], had many properties in [[Terra di Lavoro]], [[Abruzzo]] and [[Apulia]]. His father was the brother of Luisa Sipari, the mother of [[Benedetto Croce]], and his mother, Cristina Cappelli, came from a noble family. Erminio studied in Rome and graduated in civil engineering at the [[University of Turin]], after which he specialized in [[electrical engineering]] in [[Liège]]. Back in Italy in 1905, he established his own engineering firm, based in Rome and [[Pescasseroli]].

In 1913, when Sipari was first elected in the [[Italian Parliament]], he took the opportunity to draw attention to the real threat of extinction of important species, such as the [[Pyrenean chamois|Abruzzo chamois]] and the [[Marsican brown bear]], and proposed the creation of a [[national park]] in the area of [[Marsica]]. In 1921 he was appointed as [[Undersecretary]] [[secretary of state|of State]] to the [[Italian Navy]]. In the same year, he founded the "Ente Autonomo of the Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo", who leased 5 square kilometres of land to be protected in the district of [[Opi, Abruzzo|Opi]]. In September 1922 Sipari opened the Park in Pescasseroli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''The history of the Abruzzo National Park''|url=http://www.parcoabruzzo.it/pagina.php?id=45|publisher=parcoabruzzo.it|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After, the park was recognized by Italian law (January 1923).

As its president, Sipari argued that the [[Abruzzo National Park]] must protect [[fauna]] and [[flora]], but also allow the birth of [[tourism]]. He was able to create and manage a park based on [[sustainable development]]. He wrote numerous articles on the birth of the National Park and also a comprehensive report, called ''Relazione Sipari'' (1926), which at the time was considered the main promoter of nature conservation in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;L.

{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}
The '''Evolutionary Principle''' is a largely psychological doctrine which roughly states that when a [[species]] is removed from the [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] in which it [[evolution|evolved]], or that habitat changes significantly within a brief period (evolutionarily speaking), the species will develop maladaptive or outright [[wiktionary:pathological|pathological]] behavior. The Evolutionary Principle is important in [[Neo-Tribalism|neo-tribalist]] and [[anarcho-primitivist]] thinking.

'''Exertion''' is the [[Action (physics)|physical]] or perceived use of [[energy]].&lt;ref name=":07"&gt;Newton's Third Law, Elert, Glenn. “Forces.” ''Viscosity – The Physics Hypertextbook'', physics.info/newton-first/.&lt;/ref&gt; Exertion traditionally connotes a strenuous or costly ''effort,''resulting in generation of force, initiation of motion,&lt;ref name=":07" /&gt; or in the performance of [[Mechanical work|work]].&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; It often relates to [[Exercise physiology|muscular]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;activity and can be quantified, empirically and by measurable metabolic response.

==Physical==
In [[physics]], ''exertion'' is the expenditure of [[energy]] against, or inductive of, [[inertia]] as described by [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s third law|third law of motion]]. In physics, '''force''' exerted equivocates '''work''' done.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Perceived Exertion, Barry, A. J. (1967). Physical activity and psychic stress/strain. ''Canadian Medical Association Journal'', ''96''(12), 848–853.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to do work can be either positive or negative depending on the direction of exertion relative to gravity. For example, a force exerted upwards, like lifting an object, creates positive work done on that object.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physics.bu.edu/~duffy/py105/Energy.html|title=Work and energy|website=physics.bu.edu|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exertion often results in force generated, a contributing dynamic of general motion.&lt;ref name=":07" /&gt; In [[mechanics]] it describes the use of [[force]] against a [[Physical body|body]] in the direction of its [[Motion (physics)|motion]] (see [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]).

==Physiological==
Exertion, physiologically, can be described by the initiation of exercise, or, intensive and exhaustive physical activity that causes cardiovascular stress or a sympathetic nervous response. This can be continuous or intermittent exertion.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Exertion requires, of the body, modified oxygen uptake, increased heart rate, and autonomic monitoring of blood [[Lactate dehydrogenase|lactate]] concentrations. Mediators of physical exertion include cardio-respiratory and [[Human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal]] strength, as well as metabolic capability.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Kumar, Shrawan. “Theories of Occupational Musculoskeletal Injury Causation.” ''Biomechanics in Ergonomics, Second Edition'', July 2007, doi:10.1201/9780849379093.sec1.&lt;/ref&gt; This often correlates to an output of force followed by a [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] of recovery. Exertion is limited by cumulative load and repetitive motions.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Muscular energy reserves, or stores for [[Biomechanics|biomechanical]] exertion, stem from metabolic, immediate production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and increased O2 consumption.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Muscular exertion generated depends on the muscle length and the velocity at which it is able to shorten, or contract.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;“Golgi Tendon Organ.” ''Egyptian Journal of Medical Human Genetics'', Elsevier, www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/golgi-tendon-organ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perceived exertion can be explained as subjective, perceived experience that mediates response to somatic sensations and mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A [[rating of perceived exertion]], as measured by the ''RPE-scale'', or [[Borg scale]], is a quantitative measure of physical exertion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borg|first=Gunnar A.V|date=|title=Psychophysical bases of perceived exertion|url=http://fcesoftware.com/images/15_Perceived_Exertion.pdf|journal=Symposium|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often in health, exertion of oneself resulting in cardiovascular stress showed reduced physiological responses, like cortisol levels and mood, to stressors. Therefore, biological exertion is effective in mediating psychological exertion, responsive to environmental stress.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Gröpel, Peter, et al. “Endurance- and Resistance-Trained Men Exhibit Lower Cardiovascular Responses to Psychosocial Stress Than Untrained Men.” ''Frontiers in Psychology'', vol. 9, Jan. 2018, doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00852.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overexertion causes more than 3.5 million injuries a year.{{Clarify|reason=when, where|date=November 2018}} An overexertion injury can include sprains or strains, the stretching and tear of ligaments, tendons, or muscles caused by a load that exceeds the human ability to perform the work.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;“Indications Of Physical Overexertion.” ''JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association'', vol. 71, no. 18, Feb. 1918, p. 1488., doi:10.1001/jama.1918.02600440040013.&lt;/ref&gt; Overexertion, besides causing acute injury, implies physical exertion beyond the person's capacity which leads to symptoms such as dizziness, irregular breathing and heart rate, and fatigue.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; Preventative measures can be taken based on biomechanical knowledge to limit possible overexertion injuries.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;“The Understated Injury: Overexertion.” ''Healthline'', Healthline Media, www.healthline.com/health/understated-injury-overexertion.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gaia philosophy''' (named after [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[goddess]] of the [[Earth]]) is a broadly inclusive term for related concepts that living organisms on a [[planet]] will affect the nature of their environment in order to make the environment more suitable for [[life]]. This set of [[Gaia hypothesis|theories]] holds that all organisms on a life-giving planet regulate the [[biosphere]] in such a way as to promote its habitability. Gaia concept draws a connection between the survivability of a species (hence its [[evolutionary]] course) and its usefulness to the survival of other species.

While there were a number of precursors to Gaia theory, the first scientific form of this idea was proposed as the [[Gaia hypothesis]] by [[James Lovelock]], a UK chemist, in 1970. The Gaia hypothesis deals with the concept of biological [[homeostasis]], and claims the resident life forms of a host planet coupled with their environment have acted and act like a single, self-regulating system. This system includes the near-surface rocks, the soil, and the atmosphere. Today many scientists consider such ideas to be unsupported by, or at odds with, the available evidence (see [[Gaia hypothesis#Recent criticism|recent criticism]]). These theories are however significant in [[green politics]].

== Predecessors to the Gaia theory ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gaia hypothesis]] --&gt;
There are some mystical, scientific and religious predecessors to the Gaia philosophy, which had a Gaia-like conceptual basis.  Many religious mythologies had a view of Earth as being a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts (e.g. some Native American religions and various forms of [[shamanism]]).

[[Lewis Thomas]] believed that Earth should be viewed as a single cell; he derived this view from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s view of Earth as a single round organism.

[[Isaac Newton]] wrote of the earth, "Thus this Earth resembles a great animall or rather inanimate vegetable, draws in [[Aether (classical element)|æthereall]] breath for its dayly refreshment &amp; vitall ferment &amp; transpires again with gross exhalations, And according to the condition of all other things living ought to have its times of beginning youth old age &amp; perishing."&lt;ref&gt;Of Natures obvious laws &amp; processes in vegetation, [http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/mss/norm/ALCH00081 Dibner MS 1031]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], a [[paleontologist]] and [[geologist]], believed that evolution unfolded from cell to organism to planet to solar system and ultimately the whole universe, as we humans see it from our limited perspective.  Teilhard later influenced [[Thomas Berry]] and many Catholic humanist thinkers of the 20th century.

[[Buckminster Fuller]] is generally credited with making the idea respectable in Western scientific circles in the 20th century.  Building to some degree on his observations and artifacts, e.g. the [[Dymaxion map]] of the Earth he created, others began to ask if there was a way to make the Gaia theory scientifically sound.

[[Oberon Zell-Ravenheart]] in 1970 in an article in ''[[Green Egg]]'' Magazine, independently articulated the Gaia Thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://original.caw.org/articles/theagenesis.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617000211/http://original.caw.org/articles/theagenesis.html |archivedate=2010-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of these ideas are considered scientific hypotheses; by definition a scientific hypothesis must make testable predictions.  As the above claims are not testable, they are outside the bounds of current science.

These are conjectures and perhaps can only be considered as social and maybe political philosophy; they may have implications for [[theology]], or ''[[thealogy]]'' as Zell-Ravenheart and [[Isaac Bonewits]] put it.

== Range of views ==

According to [[James Kirchner]] there is a spectrum of Gaia hypotheses, ranging from the undeniable to radical. At one end is the undeniable statement that the organisms on the Earth have radically altered its composition. A stronger position is that the Earth's biosphere effectively acts as if it is a self-organizing system which works in such a way as to keep its systems in some kind of equilibrium that is conducive to life.  Today many scientists consider that such a view (and any stronger views) are unlikely to be correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waltham |first=David |authorlink=David Waltham |date=2014|title=Lucky Planet: Why Earth is Exceptional – and What that Means for Life in the Universe |url=http://www.iconbooks.com/blog/title/lucky-planet/ |location= |publisher=Icon Books |page= |isbn=9781848316560 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beerling |first=David |authorlink=David Beerling|date=2007 |title=The Emerald Planet: How plants changed Earth's history |url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780192806024.do |location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page= |isbn= 978-0-19-280602-4 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Cockell |last2=Corfield |first2=Richard |last3=Dise |first3= Nancy  |last4=Edwards |first4=Neil  |last5=Harris |first5=Nigel  |date=2008 |title= An Introduction to the Earth-Life System |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/palaeontology-and-life-history/introduction-earth-life-system |location=Cambridge (UK) |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |page= |isbn= 9780521729536 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Tyrrell |first = Toby |title =Gaia: the verdict is… |journal = New Scientist |volume = 220 |pages = 30–31 |date= 26 October 2013 |doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(13)62532-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tyrrell209"&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |page=209 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An even stronger claim is that all lifeforms are part of a single planetary being, called Gaia. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas, the terrestrial crust would be the result of interventions carried out by Gaia, through the [[coevolution|coevolving]] diversity of living organisms.

The most extreme form of Gaia theory is that the entire Earth is a single unified organism with a highly intelligent mind that arose as an [[emergent property]] of the whole biosphere. In this view, the Earth's biosphere is ''consciously'' manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence at all to support this last point of view, and it has come about because many people do not understand the concept of [[homeostasis]]. Many non-scientists instinctively and incorrectly see homeostasis as a process that requires conscious control {{dubious|date=October 2014}} {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}.

The more speculative versions of Gaia, including versions in which it is believed that the Earth is actually conscious, sentient, and highly intelligent, are usually considered outside the bounds of what is usually considered science.

== Gaia in biology and science ==
{{Main|Gaia hypothesis}}

[[Buckminster Fuller]] has been credited as the first to incorporate scientific ideas into a Gaia theory, which he did with his [[Dymaxion map]] of the Earth.

The first scientifically rigorous theory was the [[Gaia hypothesis]] by [[James Lovelock]], a UK chemist.

A variant of this hypothesis was developed by [[Lynn Margulis]], a microbiologist, in 1979.
Her version is sometimes called the "Gaia Theory" (note uppercase-T). Her model is more limited in scope than the one that Lovelock proposed.

Whether this sort of system is present on Earth is still open to debate. Some relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms are generally accepted. For example, when [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[carbon dioxide]] levels rise, plants are able to grow better and thus remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Other biological effects and feedbacks exist,&lt;ref name="tyrrell209"/&gt; but the extent to which these mechanisms have stabilized and modified the Earth's overall climate is largely not known.

The Gaia hypothesis is sometimes viewed from significantly different philosophical perspectives. Some environmentalists view it as an almost conscious process, in which the Earth's [[ecosystem]] is literally viewed as a single unified organism. Some evolutionary biologists, on the other hand, view it as an undirected [[emergent property]] of the ecosystem: as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, their combined actions tend to have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Proponents of this view sometimes point to examples of life's actions in the past that have resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a reducing environment to an oxygen-rich one.

Depending on how strongly the case is stated, the hypothesis conflicts with mainstream [[neo-Darwinism]]. Most biologists would accept Daisyworld-style homeostasis as possible, but would certainly not accept the idea that this equates to the whole biosphere acting as one organism.

A very small number of scientists, and a much larger number of environmental activists, claim that Earth's biosphere is ''consciously'' manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence to support this belief.

== Gaia in the social sciences ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

A [[social science]] view of Gaia theory is the role of humans as a [[keystone species]] who may be able to accomplish global [[homeostasis]]. Whilst a few social scientists who draw inspiration from 'organic' views of society have embraced Gaia philosophy as a way to explain the human-nature interconnections, most professional social scientists are more involved in reflecting upon the way Gaia philosophy is used and engaged with within sub-sections of society. Alan Marshall, in the Department of Social Sciences at Mahidol University, for example, reflects upon the way Gaia philosophy has been used and advocated by environmentalists, spiritualists, managers, economists, and scientists and engineers (see The Unity of Nature, 2002, Imperial College Press: London and Singapore). Social Scientists themselves in the 1960s gave up on systems ideas of society since they were interpreted as supporting conservatism and traditionalism.

== Gaia in politics ==

Some radical political environmentalists who accept some form of the Gaia theory call themselves [[Gaian Greens|Gaians]]. They actively seek to restore the Earth's homeostasis — whenever they see it out of balance, e.g. to prevent manmade [[climate change]], [[primate]] extinction, or [[deforestation|rainforest loss]]. In effect, they seek to cooperate to become the "system consciously manipulating to make conditions more conducive to life". Such activity defines the homeostasis, but for leverage it relies on deep investigation of the homeorhetic balances, if only to find [[places to intervene in a system]] which is changing in undesirable ways.

Tony Bondhus brings up the point in his book, ''Society of Conceivia'', that if Gaia is alive, then societies are living things as well. This suggests that our understanding of Gaia can be used to create a better society and to design a better political system.

Other intellectuals in the environmental movement, like [[Edward Goldsmith]], have used Gaia in the completely opposite way; to stake a claim about how Gaia's focus on natural balance and resistance and resilience, should be emulated to design a conservative political system (as explored in Alan Marshall's 2002 book ''The Unity of Nature'', (Imperial College Press: London).

Gaians do not passively ask "what is going on", but rather, "what to do next", e.g. in [[terraforming]] or [[climate engineering]] or even on a small scale, such as [[gardening]]. Changes can be planned, agreed upon by many people, being very deliberate, as in [[urban ecology]] and especially [[industrial ecology]]. ''See [[arcology]] for more on this 'active' view.''

Gaians argue that it is a human [[duty]] to act as such - committing themselves in particular to the [[Precautionary Principle]]. Such views began to influence the [[Green Parties]], [[Greenpeace]], and a few more radical wings of the [[environmental movement]] such as the Gaia Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front. These views dominate some such groups, e.g. the [[Bioneers]]. Some refer to this political activity as a separate and radical branch of the [[ecology movement]], one that takes the axioms of the science of ecology in general, and Gaia theory in particular, and raises them to a kind of theory of [[personal conduct]] or [[moral code]].

== Gaia in religion ==

The ecologist and theologian Anne Primavesi is the author of two books dealing with the Gaia hypothesis and theology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westarinstitute.org/membership/westar-fellows/fellows-directory/anne-primavesi/ Anne Primavesi - Westar Institute Westar Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosemary Radford Ruether]], the American feminist scholar and theologian, wrote a book called "Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing".

A book edited by Allan Hunt Badiner called Dharma Gaia explores the ground where Buddhism and ecology meet through writings by the [[Dalai Lama]], [[Gary Snyder]], [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Joanna Macy]], [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]], and 25 other Buddhists and ecologists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parallax.org/cgi-bin/shopper.cgi?preadd=action&amp;key=BOOKDG] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315015100/http://www.parallax.org/cgi-bin/shopper.cgi?preadd=action&amp;key=BOOKDG |date=March 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many new age authors have written books which mix [[New Age]] teachings with Gaia philosophy. This is known as [[New Age Gaian]]. Often referred to as Gaianism, or the Gaian Religion, this spiritual aspect of the philosophy is very broad and inclusive, making it adaptable to other religions: Taoism, Neo-Paganism, Pantheism, Judeo-Christian Religions, and many others.

== Semantic debate ==

The question of "what is an [[organism]]", and at what scale is it rational to speak about organisms vs. biospheres, gives rise to a semantic debate. We are all ecologies in the sense that our (human) bodies contain [[gut bacteria]], [[parasite]] species, etc., and to them our body is not organism but rather more of a [[microclimate]] or [[biome]]. Applying that thinking to whole planets:

The argument is that these symbiotic organisms, being unable to survive apart from each other and their climate and local conditions, form an organism in their own right, under a wider conception of the term organism than is conventionally used. It is a matter for often heated debate whether this is a valid usage of the term, but ultimately it appears to be a [[semantic dispute]]. In this sense of the word organism, it is argued under the theory that the entire biomass of the Earth is a single organism (as [[Johannes Kepler]] thought).

Unfortunately, many supporters of the various Gaia theories do not state exactly where they sit on this spectrum; this makes discussion and criticism difficult.

Much effort on behalf of those analyzing the theory currently is an attempt to clarify what these different hypotheses are, and whether they are proposals to 'test' or 'manipulate' outcomes. Both Lovelock's and Margulis's understanding of Gaia are considered scientific hypotheses, and like all scientific theories are constantly put to the test.

More speculative versions of Gaia, including all versions in which it is held that the Earth is actually conscious, are currently held to be outside the bounds of science, and are not supported by either Lovelock or Margulis.

=== Gaian reproduction ===

One of the most problematic issues with referring to Gaia as an organism is its apparent failure to meet the [[biological]] criterion of being able to [[reproduce]]. [[Richard Dawkins]] has asserted that the planet is not the offspring of any parents and is unable to reproduce.&lt;ref name="Harding2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Harding, Stephan |title=Animate Earth |publisher=[[Chelsea Green Publishing]] |date=2006 |pages=65 |isbn=1-933392-29-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George-ericksenite''' is a mineral with the chemical formula Na&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;CaMg(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. It is vitreous, pale yellow to bright lemon yellow, brittle, and features a prismatic to acicular [[crystal habit]] along [001] and somewhat flattened crystal habit on {110}. It was first encountered in 1984 at the Pinch Mineralogical Museum. One specimen of dietzeite from Oficina Chacabuco, [[Chile]] had bright lemon-yellow micronodules on it. These crystals produced an [[X-Ray Powder Diffraction|X-ray powder diffraction]] pattern that did not match any XRD data listed for inorganic compounds. The X-ray diffraction pattern and powder mount were set aside until 1994. By then, the entire mineral collection from the Pinch Mineralogical Museum had been purchased by the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]]. The specimen was then retrieved and studied further. This study was successful and the new mineral george-ericksenite was discovered. The mineral was named for George E. Ericksen who was a research [[Economic geology|economic geologist]] with the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]] for fifty years. The mineral and name have been approved by Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names (IMA).  The specimen, polished thin section, and the actual crystal used for the structure determination are kept in the Display Series of the National Mineral Collection of Canada at the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]], [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]].

== Description ==

=== Occurrence and paragenesis ===
George-ericksonite is commonly found as isolated bright lemon-yellow micronodules of crystals that are concentrated on the surface of one part of the mineral specimen. However, in some cases the micronodules occur as groupings instead of isolated occurrences. The average size of these micronodules is approximately 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm and each consists of numerous individual crystals in random orientation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.minsocam.org/msa/ammin/TOC/Articles_Free/1998/Cooper_p390-399_98.pdf|title = Georgeericksenite, Na&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;CaMg(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;|last = Cooper|first = Mark A.|date = 1998|journal = American Mineralogist|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 15, 2015|last2 = Hawthorne|first2 = Frank C.|last3 = Roberts|first3 = Andrew C.|last4 = Grice|first4 = Joel D.|last5 = Stirling|first5 = John A.R.|last6 = Moffatt|first6 = Elizabeth A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electron microprobe examination ===
This examination was carried out by attaching two [[Acicular (crystal habit)|acicular]] crystals to the surface of a disk with [[epoxy]] and then examining them with a CAMECA SX-50 [[electron microprobe]]. One of the crystals had the (100) surface facing up, and the other crystal had a growth face of the form (110) facing up. The microprobe was operating in wavelength-dispersive mode at 15 kV and ran various currents from 20 nA to 0.5 nA. The CAMECA SX-50 has three [[Optical spectrometer|spectrometers]] and the samples were examined in the sequence ([[Sodium|Na]], [[Chlorine|Cl]], [[Iodine|I]]), then ([[Magnesium|Mg]], [[Sulfur|S]], [[Calcium|Ca]]). When the [[crystal]] was exposed to the electron beam for the first 200 seconds, the counts per second on each element varied greatly which indicates that the crystals are extremely unstable in the electron beam. The counts per second for each element were also dependent on the surface of the crystal [(100) or (110)] analyzed. Over shorter counting times (&lt;10 s) at 15 kV and 5 nA, there is a gain in I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and a drop in Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O relative to ideal values. However, a significant orientation effect exists for SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CaO values for the (100) and (110) surfaces on either side of the ideal values. With increasing exposure to the electron beam, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O increases and all other oxides decrease. This behavior is also more rapid on the (100) surface than on the (110) crystal face. The (100) surface is overall more reactive to the electron beam than the (110) surface, but both surfaces seem to approach equilibrium with the beam and give similar oxides weight percentages after 200 seconds.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Even at low currents and short counting times george-ericksenite is extremely unstable under the electron beam. After examination, the crystal faces are stained brown from the reaction with I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the decrease in analyzed I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with increasing time. The crystallographic orientation of the material analyzed has a large impact on the analytical values at any given time. The overall quantitative behavior of george-ericksenite in the electron beam is consistent with the chemical composition derived (ideally I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; 59.13, CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; 9.92. SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; 1.51, MgO 2.38, CaO 3.31, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O 10.98, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O 12.77 weight %).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Crystal structure ==

=== Data collection ===
A 0.046 X 0.059 X 0.060&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; crystal was mounted on a Siemans ''P''4 four-circle diffractometer. The crystal was aligned using 42 reflections automatically centered following measurement from a rotation photograph. The orientation matrix and unit-cell dimensions were determined from the setting angles of least-squares refinement. 3872 reflections were recorded out to 60&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; 2θ with a fixed scan speed of 1.33° 2θ/min. Corrections for absorption by [[Gaussian quadrature]] integration were applied. Corrections for Lorentz, [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], and background effects were also applied as well as reduction of intensities to structure factors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Structure solution and refinement ===
The SHELXTL PC Plus system of programs were used for the calculations. The ''R'' and ''Rw'' indices are of the conventional form. The structure was solved by direct methods. The structure is centrosymmetric as indicated by the E statistics. Systematic absences also indicate the presence of a ''c'' glide for the C-centered cell. The result was placing george-ericksenite in the C2/c space group. The structure was refined by a combination of least-squares refinement and difference-Fourier synthesis to an ''R'' index of 3.5% and ''Rw'' equal to 3.5%. Site occupancies were determined by the basis of site-scattering refinement and crystal-chemical criteria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Description of the structure ==

=== Cation coordination ===
There is one [[Chromium|chromium (Cr)]] site that is symmetrically distinct and is tetrahedrally coordinated by four [[Oxygen|oxygen (O)]] atoms. The average length of the bonds is 1.61 Å which indicates that the Cr [[cation]] is [[Valence (chemistry)|hexavalent]]. The average bond length at the Cr site is less than would be expected for complete occupancy by Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;. This difference can be accounted for by partial substitution of [[Sulfur|sulfur (S)]] atoms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are three [[Iodine|iodine (I)]] sites that are coordinated by three [[Oxygen|oxygen (O)]] atoms arranged in a triangle to one side of the cation. The distances of the bonds between the I and O atoms is 1.81 Å. This results in the IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group forming a [[Pyramid (geometry)|triangular pyramid]] with the I site at the top of the pyramid. At each I sites there are also three additional [[ligand]]s that causes the iodine atoms to have a distorted octahedral coordination. This also causes the I atom to occupy off centered positions within each [[octahedron]]. The long bonds between the atoms at the I sites contributes significant bond valence to the bonded [[anions]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are three [[Sodium|sodium (Na)]] sites that are each unique. Each site has a different type of coordination. The Na1 site is encompassed by two [[Oxygen|O]] atoms and four [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] groups in a distorted [[Octahedral symmetry|octahedral]] arrangement with a Na1-Φ distance (where Φ=unspecified ligand) of 2.41 Å. The Na2 site is surrounded by five O atoms and 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O groups in an augmented octahedral arrangement with a Na2-Φ distance of 2.54 Å. The Na3 site is surrounded by five O atoms and three H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O atoms in a triangular [[Dodecahedron|dodecahedral]] arrangement with a Na3-Φ distance of 2.64 Å.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is only one [[Magnesium|magnesium (Mg)]] site which is coordinated by six O atoms in an octahedral arrangement with a Mg-O distance of 2.09 Å. This bond length is in accord with this site being entirely occupied by Mg with not substitution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The one [[Calcium|calcium (Ca)]] site is coordinated by six O atoms and two H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O groups in a square-antiprismatic arrangement with a Ca-Φ distance of 2.50 Å. This bond length is in accord with this site being entirely occupied by Ca with not substitution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Structure topology ===
George-ericksenite features a structural arrangement that is composed of slabs of polyhedra orthogonal to [100]. These slabs feature the same composition as the mineral itself and are a half of a unit thick in the [100] direction. These are connected to adjacent slabs solely by [[hydrogen bond]]ing. The edges of each slab are bounded by near-planar layers of anions. The slabs themselves are composed of three planar layers of cations. There are also three planar layers of cations parallel to the edges of the slabs. This indicates that each slab consists of three layers of polyhedra. The ''c''-glide symmetry relates the top and bottom of the slab which means the slab may be broken into two unique sheets of polyhedra.

There is a prominent [[zigzag]] pattern of chains of Na polyhedra extending in the ''c'' direction on the outer layer of the slab. The Na1 octahedron shares an edge with the Na2 augmented octahedron which shares a face with the Na3 triangular dodecahedron. This forms a linear [[Trimer (chemistry)|trimer]] that extends in the [011] direction. This [[Trimer (chemistry)|trimer]] is then links by edge-sharing between the Na3 and a1 polyhedra to another trimer extending in the [0-11] direction. This [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] continues to form a [Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Φ&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;] [[zigzag]] chain extending in the ''c'' direction. In each embayment of this chain the polyhedra are accented by two (IO&lt;sub&gt;3+3&lt;/sub&gt;) groups. Identical chains run parallel to the ''c'' axis that are linked only by one weak I-O bond.

The inner layer of the slab is composed of one Mg octahedron that shares corners with two Cr tetrahedra. This forms a [MT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Φ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;] cluster. The other two anions of the Mg octahedron link by corner-sharing to two (IO&lt;sub&gt;3+3&lt;/sub&gt;) groups. These [Mg(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(IO&lt;sub&gt;3+3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] clusters link together two (CaΦ&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) polyhedra. This forms chains parallel to the ''b'' axis. Weak I-O bonds link these chains to form the central layer of the slab.

=== Relation to other minerals ===
The only other chromate-iodate mineral is dietzeite, Ca(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Dietzeite and george-ericksenite have no structural relationship.  Fuenzalidaite and carlosruizite are sulphate-iodate minerals found in the Chilean nitrate fields and contain small amounts of Cr substituting for S. They are also sheet structures, but the sheets are vastly different in terms of connectivity than in george-ericksenite.

'''Liquid slugging''' is the phenomenon of liquid entering the cylinder of a [[reciprocating compressor]], a common cause of failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2815&amp;context=icec |date=2006 |title=The Detection of Liquid Slugging Phenomena in Reciprocating Compressors via Power Measurements |author1=Christopher R. Laughman |author2=Peter R. Armstrong |author3=Leslie K. Norford |website=Docs.lib.purdue.edu |accessdate=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under normal conditions, the intake and output of a compressor cylinder is entirely vapor or gas, when a liquid accumulates at the suction port liquid slugging can occur. As more of the practically incompressible liquid enters, strain is placed upon the system leading to a variety of failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rses.org/assets/rses_journal/0515_Compressors.pdf|title=Why Compressors Fail|last=|first=|date=|website=RSES Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[glacier]]''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|ɡ|l|eɪ|ʃ|ər}} {{respell|GLAY|shər}}) or ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|ɡ|l|æ|s|i|ə}}) is a persistent body of dense [[ice]] that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of [[snow]] exceeds its [[ablation]] (melting and [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]) over many years, often [[centuries]]. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating [[crevasse]]s, [[serac]]s, and other distinguishing features. Because glacial mass is affected by long-term [[climate]] changes, e.g., [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[temperature|mean temperature]], and [[cloud cover]], [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacial mass change]]s are considered among the most sensitive indicators of [[climate change]].

===Antarctica===
[[File:Fryxellsee Opt.jpg|right|thumb|[[Canada Glacier]] in Antarctica]]
{{main|List of glaciers in the Antarctic}}

There are many glaciers in the Antarctic. This set of lists does not include [[ice sheet]]s, [[ice cap]]s or [[ice field]]s, such as the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], but includes [[Glacier|glacial]] features that are defined by their flow, rather than general bodies of ice. The lists include [[Glacier morphology#Outlet glaciers|outlet glaciers]], [[Glacier morphology#Valley glaciers|valley glaciers]], [[Glacier morphology#Cirque glaciers|cirque glaciers]], [[Glacier#Types of glaciers|tidewater glaciers]] and [[ice stream]]s. Ice streams are a type of glacier&lt;ref name="NSIDC" /&gt; and many of them have "glacier" in their name, e.g. [[Pine Island Glacier]]. [[Ice shelf|Ice shelves]] are listed separately in the [[List of Antarctic ice shelves]]. For the purposes of these lists, the [[Antarctic]] is defined as any [[latitude]] further south than 60° (the continental limit according to the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]).&lt;ref name="nbTreatyText" /&gt;

There are also glaciers in the subantarctic. This includes one [[snow field]] ([[Murray Snowfield]]). Snow fields are not glaciers in the strict sense of the word, but they are commonly found at the [[accumulation zone]] or head of a glacier.&lt;ref name=nsidc&gt;{{cite web

===Europe===
{{main|List of glaciers in Europe}}

The majority of Europe's glaciers are found in the Alps, Caucasus and the Scandinavian Mountains (mostly Norway) as well as in Iceland. Iceland has the largest glacier in Europe, [[Vatnajökull]] glacier, that covers between 8,100-8,300&amp;nbsp;km² in area and 3,100&amp;nbsp;km³ in volume. Norway alone has more than 2500 glaciers (including very small ones) covering an estimated 1% of mainland Norway's surface area. Several of mainland Europe's biggest glaciers are found here including; [[Jostedal Glacier|Jostedalsbreen]](the largest in mainland Europe at 487&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[Svartisen|Vestre Svartisen]](221&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[Søndre Folgefonna]](168&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[Svartisen|Østre Svartisen]](148&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The two Svartisen glaciers used to be one connected entity during the Little Ice Age but has since separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nve.no/hydrologi/bre/|title=Bre - NVE|author=|date=|website=www.nve.no|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622213011/https://www.nve.no/hydrologi/bre/|archivedate=22 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturperler.com/default.asp?pageid=5906|title=Saltfjellet-Svartisen - Norske Naturperler|author=|date=|website=naturperler.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422025120/http://naturperler.com/default.asp?pageid=5906|archivedate=22 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{maincat|Glaciers of North America}}
There are a number of glaciers existing in North America, currently or in recent centuries. In the United States, these [[glacier]]s are located in nine states, all in the Rocky Mountains or further west. The southernmost named glacier among them is the [[Lilliput Glacier]] in [[Tulare County, California|Tulare County]], east of the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] of California.

[[Mexico]] has about two dozen glaciers, all of which are located on [[Pico de Orizaba]] (Citlaltépetl), [[Popocatépetl]] and [[Iztaccíhuatl]], the three tallest mountains in the country.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Sidney E.|title=Glaciers of Mexico|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1386j/mexico/mexico-lores.pdf|work=Glaciers of North America|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=July 8, 2012|format=pdf|date=2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017213832/http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1386j/mexico/mexico-lores.pdf|archivedate=October 17, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
{{main|List of glaciers in South America}}
[[File:Chimborazo.jpg|thumb|[[Chimborazo]]]]
Glaciers in South America develop exclusively on the [[Andes]] and are subject of the Andes various climatic regimes namely the [[Tropical Andes]], [[Dry Andes]] and the [[Wet Andes]]. Apart from this there is a wide range of latitudes on which glaciers develop from 5000 m in the [[Altiplano]] [[mountains]] and [[volcanoes]] to reaching sealevel as tidewater glaciers from [[San Rafael Lagoon]] (45° S) and southwards. South America hosts two large [[ice field]]s, the [[Northern Patagonian Ice Field|Northern]] and [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]]s, of which the second is the largest contiguous body of glaciers in extrapolar regions.

The '''glaciers of Chile''' cover 2.7% (20,188&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conama.cl/portal/1301/articles-43721_recurso_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210108/http://www.conama.cl/portal/1301/articles-43721_recurso_1.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) of the land area of the country, excluding [[Antártica Chilena]], and have a considerable impact on its landscape and water supply. By surface 80% of South America’s glaciers lie in Chile. Glaciers develop in the [[Andes]] of Chile from 27˚S southwards and in a very few places north of 18°30'S in the extreme north of the country:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geography.osu.edu/faculty/bmark/2008%20ESR%20Vuille_etal.pdf Climate change and tropical Andean glaciers: Past, present and future] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106032056/http://www.geography.osu.edu/faculty/bmark/2008%20ESR%20Vuille_etal.pdf |date=2012-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in between they are absent because of extreme aridity, though [[rock glacier]]s formed from [[permafrost]] are common. The largest glaciers of Chile are the [[Northern Patagonian Ice Field|Northern]] and [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]]s. From a latitude of 47° S and south some glaciers reach sea level.

Apart from height and latitude, the settings of Chilean glaciers depend on precipitation patterns; in this sense two different regions exist: the [[Dry Andes]] and the [[Wet Andes]].

[[File:Puncak Jaya glaciers 1850-2003 evolution map-fr.gif|thumb|right|Animated map of the extent of the glaciers of the [[Carstensz Glacier|Carstens Range]] from 1850 to 2003]]
No glaciers remain on the [[Australia]] mainland or [[Tasmania]]. A few, like the [[Heard Island glaciers]] are located in the territory of [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]] in the southern [[Indian Ocean]].

[[New Guinea]] has the  [[Puncak Jaya#Glaciers|Puncak Jaya]] glacier.

[[New Zealand]] contains many [[glaciers]], mostly located near the Main Divide of the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]] in the [[South Island]]. They are classed as mid-latitude mountain glaciers. There are eighteen small glaciers in the [[North Island]] on [[Mount Ruapehu]].&lt;ref&gt;Chinn, Trevor J.H., (1988),[http://pubs.usgs.gov/prof/p1386h/nzealand/nzealand.html Glaciers of New Zealand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706135734/http://pubs.usgs.gov/prof/p1386h/nzealand/nzealand.html |date=2008-07-06 }}, in ''Satellite image atlas of glaciers of the world'', U.S. Geological Survey professional paper; 1386, {{ISBN|0-607-71457-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{see also|Glaciers of New Zealand}}
An inventory of South Island glaciers compiled in the 1980s indicated there were about 3,155 glaciers with an area of at least one hectare (2.5 acres).&lt;ref&gt;Chinn, Trevor J.H., (1988), [http://pubs.usgs.gov/prof/p1386h/nzealand/nzealand.html Glaciers of New Zealand], in ''Satellite image atlas of glaciers of the world'', U.S. Geological Survey professional paper; 1386, {{ISBN|0-607-71457-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately one sixth of these glaciers covered more than 10 hectares. These include:
*[[Fox Glacier]]
*[[Franz Josef Glacier]]
*[[Hooker Glacier (New Zealand)|Hooker Glacier]]
*[[Mueller Glacier]]
*[[Murchison Glacier]]
*[[Tasman Glacier]]
*[[Volta Glacier]]

{{See also|Invasive species in the British Isles|List of invasive species in Portugal}}

This is a '''list of [[invasive species]] in [[Europe]]'''. A species is regarded as invasive if it has become introduced to a location, area, or region where it did not previously occur naturally (i.e., is not a [[native species]]) and becomes capable of establishing a breeding population in the new location. An invasive species will be one that thrives in its new environment and negatively influences the ecology and biodiversity of that ecosystem.

The term '''invasive species''' refers to a subset of those species defined as [[introduced species]]. If a species has been introduced but remains local, and is not problematic to agriculture or to the local biodiversity, then it cannot be considered to be invasive, and does not belong on this list.

'''Living systems''' are open self-organizing life forms that interact with their environment. These systems are maintained by flows of information, [[energy flow (ecology)|energy]] and matter.

Some scientists have proposed in the last few decades that a general living systems theory is required to explain the nature of [[life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Woodruff | first = T.

Cleland and Chyba wrote a chapter in Planets and Life: "In the absence of such a theory, we are in a position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define 'water' in the absence of molecular theory." [...] "Without access to living things having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of living systems".&lt;/ref&gt; Such a general theory, arising out of the [[Ecology|ecological]] and [[Biology|biological sciences]], attempts to map general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break things down into components, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patterns, Flows, and Interrelationship |url=http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |accessdate=2009-06-27 |first=Molly Young |last=Brown |date=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108122526/http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Living systems theory is a general theory about the existence of all living systems, their [[structure]], [[interaction]], [[behavior]] and [[developmental biology|development]]. This work is created by [[James Grier Miller]], which was intended to formalize the concept of life. According to Miller's original conception as spelled out in his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''Living Systems'', a "living system" must contain each of twenty "critical subsystems", which are defined by their functions and visible in numerous systems, from simple cells to organisms, countries, and societies. In ''Living Systems'' Miller provides a detailed look at a number of systems in order of increasing size, and identifies his subsystems in each. 
Miller considers living systems as a subset of all [[system]]s. Below the level of living systems, he defines [[space]] and [[time]], [[matter]] and [[energy]], [[information]] and [[entropy]], levels of [[organization]], and physical and conceptual factors, and above living systems ecological, planetary and solar systems, galaxies, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Seppänen, 1998, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Living systems according to Parent (1996) are by definition "open self-organizing [[system]]s that have the special characteristics of life and interact with their [[social environment|environment]]. This takes place by means of information and material-energy exchanges. Living systems can be as simple as a single [[cell (biology)|cell]] or as complex as a supranational [[organization]] such as the European Union. Regardless of their [[complexity]], they each depend upon the same essential twenty subsystems (or processes) in order to survive and to continue the propagation of their species or types beyond a single generation".&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Parent, [http://projects.isss.org/the_living_systems_theory_of_james_grier_miller ''The Living Systems Theory of James Grier Miller''], Primer project ISSS, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller said that systems exist at eight "nested" hierarchical levels: cell, organ, organism, group, organization, community, society, and supranational system. At each level, a system invariably comprises twenty critical subsystems, which process matter–energy or information except for the first two, which process both matter–energy and information: reproducer and boundary.

The processors of matter–energy are: 
* ingestor, distributor, converter, producer, storage, extruder, motor, supporter

The processors of information are:
* input transducer, internal transducer, channel and net, timer (added later), decoder, associator, memory, decider, encoder, output transducer.

==Miller's living systems theory==
James Grier Miller in 1978 wrote a 1,102-page volume to present his living systems theory. He constructed a general theory of living [[system]]s by focusing on concrete systems—nonrandom accumulations of matter–energy in physical space–time organized into interacting, interrelated [[subsystem]]s or components. Slightly revising the original model a dozen years later, he distinguished eight "nested" hierarchical levels in such complex structures. Each level is "nested" in the sense that each higher level contains the next lower level in a nested fashion.

His central thesis is that the systems in existence at all eight levels are [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]] composed of twenty critical subsystems that process inputs, throughputs, and outputs of various forms of matter–energy and information. Two of these subsystems—reproducer and boundary—process both matter–energy and information. Eight of them process only matter–energy. The other ten process information only. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;All nature is a continuum. The endless complexity of life is organized into patterns which repeat themselves—theme and variations—at each level of system. These similarities and differences are proper concerns for science. From the ceaseless streaming of protoplasm to the many-vectored activities of supranational systems, there are continuous flows through living systems as they maintain their highly organized steady states.&lt;ref&gt;(Miller, 1978, p. 1025)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Seppänen (1998) says that Miller applied [[general systems theory]] on a broad scale to describe all aspects of living systems.&lt;ref&gt;Seppänen 1998, pp. 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topics in living systems theory===
Miller's theory posits that the mutual interrelationship of the components of a system extends across the hierarchical levels. Examples: Cells and organs of a living system thrive on the food the organism obtains from its suprasystem; the member countries of a supranational system reap the benefits accrued from the communal activities to which each one contributes. Miller says that his eclectic theory "ties together past discoveries from many disciplines and provides an outline into which new findings can be fitted".&lt;ref&gt;(Miller, 1978, p. 1025)&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller says the concepts of space, time, matter, energy, and information are essential to his theory because the living systems exist in space and are made of matter and energy organized by information. Miller's theory of living systems employs two sorts of spaces: physical or geographical space, and conceptual or abstracted spaces. Time is the fundamental "fourth dimension" of the physical space–time continuum/spiral. Matter is anything that has mass and occupies physical space. Mass and energy are equivalent as one can be converted into the other. Information refers to the degrees of freedom that exist in a given situation to choose among signals, symbols, messages, or patterns to be transmitted.

Other relevant concepts are system, structure, process, type, level, echelon, suprasystem, subsystem, transmissions, and steady state. A system can be conceptual, concrete or abstracted. The structure of a system is the arrangement of the subsystems and their components in three-dimensional space at any point of time. Process, which can be reversible or irreversible, refers to change over time of matter–energy or information in a system. Type defines living systems with similar characteristics. Level is the position in a hierarchy of systems. Many complex living systems, at various levels, are organized into two or more echelons. The suprasystem of any living system is the next higher system in which it is a subsystem or component. The totality of all the structures in a system which carry out a particular process is a subsystem. Transmissions are inputs and outputs in concrete systems. Because living systems are open systems, with continually altering fluxes of matter–energy and information, many of their equilibria are dynamic—situations identified as steady states or flux equilibria.

Miller identifies the comparable matter–energy and information processing critical subsystems. Elaborating on the eight hierarchical levels, he defines society, which constitutes the seventh hierarchy, as "a large, living, concrete system with [community] and lower am levels of living systems as subsystems and components".&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1978, p. 747.&lt;/ref&gt; Society may include small, primitive, totipotential communities; ancient city–states, and kingdoms; as well as modern nation–states and empires that are not supranational systems. Miller provides general descriptions of each of the subsystems that fit all eight levels.

A supranational system, in Miller's view, "is composed of two or more societies, some or all of whose processes are under the control of a decider that is superordinate to their highest echelons".&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1978, p. 903&lt;/ref&gt; However, he contends that no supranational system with all its twenty subsystems under control of its decider exists today. The absence of a supranational decider precludes the existence of a concrete supranational system. Miller says that studying a supranational system is problematical because its subsystems
&lt;blockquote&gt;...tend to consist of few components besides the decoder. These systems do little matter-energy processing. The power of component societies [nations] today is almost always greater than the power of supranational deciders. Traditionally, theory at this level has been based upon intuition and study of history rather than data collection. Some quantitative research is now being done, and construction of global-system models and simulations is currently burgeoning.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1978, p. 1043.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the supranational system level, Miller's emphasis is on international organizations, associations, and groups comprising representatives of societies (nation–states). Miller identifies the subsystems at this level to suit this emphasis. Thus, for example, the reproducer is "any multipurpose supranational system which creates a single purpose supranational organization" (p.&amp;nbsp;914); and the boundary is the "supranational forces, usually located on or near supranational borders, which defend, guard, or police them" (p.&amp;nbsp;914).

===Strengths of Miller's theory===
Not just those specialized in international communication, but all communication science scholars could pay particular attention to the major contributions of living systems theory (LST) to social systems approaches that [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Kenneth D. Bailey]], (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out:
* The specification of the twenty critical subsystems in any living system.
* The specification of the eight hierarchical levels of living systems.
* The emphasis on cross-level analysis and the production of numerous cross-level hypotheses.
* Cross-subsystem research (e.g., formulation and testing of hypotheses in two or more subsystems at a time).
* Cross-level, cross-subsystem research.

[[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]] says that LST, perhaps the "most integrative" social systems theory, has made many more contributions that may be easily overlooked, such as: providing a detailed analysis of types of systems; making a distinction between concrete and abstracted systems; discussion of physical space and time; placing emphasis on information processing; providing an analysis of entropy;  recognition of totipotential systems, and partipotential systems; providing an innovative approach to the structure–process issue; and introducing the concept of joint subsystem—a subsystem that belongs to two systems simultaneously; of dispersal—lateral, outward, upward, and downward; of inclusion—inclusion of something from the environment that is not part of the system; of artifact—an animal-made or human-made inclusion; of adjustment process, which combats stress in a system; and of critical subsystems, which carry out processes that all living systems need to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth D. Bailey 2006, pp.292–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

LST's analysis of the twenty interacting subsystems, [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]] adds, clearly distinguishing between matter–energy-processing and information-processing, as well as LST's analysis of the eight interrelated system levels, enables us to understand how social systems are linked to biological systems. LST also analyzes the irregularities or "organizational pathologies" of systems functioning (e.g., system stress and strain, feedback irregularities, information–input overload). It explicates the role of entropy in social research while it equates [[negentropy]] with information and order. It emphasizes both structure and process, as well as their interrelations.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth D. bailey, 1994, pp. 209–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
It omits the analysis of subjective phenomena, and it overemphasizes concrete Q-analysis (correlation of objects) to the virtual exclusion of R-analysis (correlation of variables). By asserting that societies (ranging from [[Totipotent#Totipotency|totipotential]] communities to nation-states and non-supranational systems) have greater control over their subsystem components than supranational systems have, it dodges the issue of transnational power over the contemporary social systems. Miller's supranational system bears no resemblance to the modern world-system that [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] (1974) described, although both of them were looking at the same living (dissipative) structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3868">'''Magmatic water''' or '''juvenile water''' is water that exists within, and in equilibrium with, a [[magma]] or water-rich [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatile]] fluids that are derived from a magma. This magmatic water is released to the atmosphere during a [[volcanic]] eruption. Magmatic water may also be released as [[hydrothermal]] fluids during the late stages of magmatic crystallization or solidification within the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. The crystallization of [[hydroxyl]] bearing [[amphibole]] and [[mica]] minerals acts to contain part of the magmatic water within a solidified [[igneous rock]]. Ultimate sources of this magmatic water includes water and hydrous minerals in rocks melted during [[subduction]] as well as [[Water_distribution_on_Earth#Water_in_Earth.27s_mantle|primordial water]] brought up from the deep [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]].

==Water in silicate melts==
Water has limited [[solubility]] in silicate melts ranging from almost 0% at surface pressure to 10% at 1100&amp;nbsp;°C and 5 kbar of pressure for a [[granitic]] melt.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, Anthony, ''Igneous Petrology'', Longman, 1987, pp. 253-260 {{ISBN|0-582-30174-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solubility is lower for more [[mafic]] magmas. As the temperature and pressure drop during emplacement and cooling of the magma a separate [[aqueous]] phase will [[Solid_solution#Exsolution|exsolve]].&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guilbert&gt;John M. Guilbert and Charles F Park, Jr., ''THe Geology of Ore Deposits'', Freeman, 1986, pp. 32-45 {{ISBN|0-7167-1456-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aqueous phase will be enriched in other volatile and silicate incompatible species such as the metals: [[copper]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[silver]] and [[gold]]; [[alkali]]s and [[alkaline earth]]s and others, including: [[lithium]], [[beryllium]], [[boron]], [[rubidium]]; and volatiles: [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]] and [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name=Guilbert/&gt;

Water in silicate melts at the high temperature and pressure conditions within the crust exists as a [[supercritical fluid]] rather than in a gaseous state (the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] for water is at 374&amp;nbsp;°C and 218 bar).&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;

==Stable isotope data==
[[Stable isotope]] studies of oxygen and hydrogen in igneous rocks indicate that the [[oxygen-18]], δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, content is approximately 6 - 8 ‰ higher than standard mean ocean water ([[SMOW]]) while the [[deuterium]], δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H, content is 40 to 80 ‰ lower than SMOW. Water in equilibrium with [[igneous]] melts should bear the same isotopic signature for oxygen-18 and deuterium. Isotope data on hydrothermal solutions spatially associated with [[igneous intrusion]]s should reflect this isotopic signature. However, isotopic studies of hydrothermal waters indicate that most bear the isotopic signature of [[meteoric water]].&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt; Any magmatic waters in these [[hydrothermal]] solutions must have been swamped by the circulating meteoric groundwaters of the environment.

[[Fluid inclusions]] are microscopic bubbles of aqueous solutions which were trapped within crystals during crystallization and are considered as relic samples of the mineralizing waters. Analyses of the isotopic content of these trapped bubbles show a wide range of δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H content.&lt;ref name=Guilbert/&gt; All examined show an enrichment in &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and depletion in &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H relative to SMOW and meteoric waters. Fluid inclusion data from a number of ore deposits plot directly on the magmatic water ''region'' of an δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O vs δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H plot.&lt;ref name=Guilbert/&gt;

A '''material''' is a [[chemical substance]] or [[mixture]] of substances that constitute an object. Materials can be pure or impure, a singular composite or a complex mix, living or non-living matter, whether natural or man-made, either concrete or abstract. Materials can be classified based on different properties such as [[physical property|physical]] and [[chemical property|chemical properties]] (see [[List of materials properties]]), [[geological]], [[biological]], choreographical, or [[property (philosophy)|philosophical properties]]. In the physical sense, materials are studied in the field of [[materials science]].

In [[industry]], materials are inputs to [[wiktionary:production|production]] or [[list of manufacturing processes|manufacturing processes]]. They may either be [[raw material]], that is, unprocessed, or processed before being used in more advanced production processes, either by [[distillation]] or [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] (synthetic materials).

Types of materials include:
*[[Biomaterial]], of biological origin
*[[Composite material]], composed of multiple materials with differing physical properties
*[[Textile]]s, sometimes referred to as "material"
*[[Genetic material]]

==Classification of materials==
Materials are classified according to many different criteria including their physical and chemical characteristics as well as their intended applications whether it is thermal, optical, electrical, magnetic, or combined. As their methods of usage dictate their physical appearance, they can be designed, tailored, and/or prepared in many forms such as powders, thin or thick films, and plates and could be introduced/studied in a single or multi layers. End products could be pure materials or doped ones with most useful compounds are those with controlled added impurities.The dopants could be added chemically or mixed and implanted physically. In case the impurities were added chemically, the dopants/co-dopants on substitutional/interstitial sites should be optimized and investigated thoroughly as well as any stresses instigated by their presence within the structure; whereas in the case of the physical mixing, the influence of the degree of heterogeneity of the prepared hybrid composites ought to be studied.The different physical and chemical preparation techniques can be used solely or combined including solid state synthesis, hydrothermal, sol-gel, precipitations and coprecipitations, spin coating, physical vapor deposition, and spray pyrolysis. Types of impurities along with their amounts are usually dictated by types of matrices to be added to, and their ability to maximize the desired products’ usefulness. Among the most commonly used characterization techniques are X-ray diffraction (XRD) either single crystal or powder, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), UV-Vis absorption Spectroscopy, Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), and Photoluminescence spectrometry. In addition, it is usually considered of extreme importance to find theoretical models that can confirm and/or predict the experimental findings and assist in discussion, assignment, and the explanation of results and outcomes. Also, vision and room for future modification and development should always be pinpointed. Hence, one can classify the material as a smart one if its presence can serve multi purposes within the final product.

'''Moisture expansion''' is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in moisture content. The macroscopic effect is similar to that of [[thermal expansion]] but the microscopic causes are very different. Moisture expansion is caused by [[hygroscopy]].

A '''molecule''' is an [[electrically]] neutral group of two or more [[atom]]s held together by [[chemical bond]]s.&lt;ref name="iupac"&gt;{{GoldBookRef| title=Molecule|file=M04002|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Ebbin, Darrell D.| title= General Chemistry |edition=3rd| date= 1990| publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin Co.]]| location= Boston| isbn= 0-395-43302-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Brown, T.L. |author2=Kenneth C.

However, in [[quantum physics]], [[organic chemistry]], and [[biochemistry]], the term ''molecule'' is often used less strictly, also being applied to [[polyatomic ion]]s.

In the [[kinetic theory of gases]], the term ''molecule'' is often used for any gaseous [[particle]] regardless of its composition. According to this definition, [[noble gas]] atoms are considered molecules as they are monatomic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Chandra| first= Sulekh| title= Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry| date= 2005| publisher= New Age Publishers| isbn= 81-224-1512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A molecule may be [[homonuclear]], that is, it consists of atoms of one [[chemical element]], as with [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); or it may be [[heteronuclear]], a [[chemical compound]] composed of more than one element, as with [[water (molecule)|water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Atoms and complexes connected by [[non-covalent interactions]], such as [[hydrogen bond]]s or [[ionic bond]]s, are generally not considered single molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Molecule|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date =22 January 2016|url=http://global.britannica.com/science/molecule|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecules as components of matter are common in organic substances (and therefore biochemistry). They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. However, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth, including most of the minerals that make up the [[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], and [[Earth core|core of the Earth]], contain many chemical bonds, but are ''not'' made of identifiable molecules. Also, no typical molecule can be defined for [[ionic crystal]]s ([[salt (chemistry)|salts]]) and covalent crystals ([[network solid]]s), although these are often composed of repeating [[unit cell]]s that extend either in a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] (such as in [[graphene]]) or three-dimensionally (such as in [[diamond]], [[quartz]], or [[sodium chloride]]). The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most condensed phases with [[metallic bond]]ing, which means that solid metals are also not made of molecules. In [[glass]]es (solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state), atoms may also be held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule, nor any of the regularity of repeating units that characterizes crystals.

== Molecular science ==

The science of molecules is called ''molecular chemistry'' or ''[[molecular physics]]'', depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics. Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of [[chemical bond]]s, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system ([[bound state]]) composed of two or more [[atom]]s. [[Polyatomic ion]]s may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term ''unstable molecule'' is used for very [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] species, i.e., short-lived assemblies ([[Resonance (chemistry)|resonances]]) of electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], molecular [[ion]]s, [[Rydberg molecule]]s, [[transition state]]s, [[van der Waals bonding|van der Waals complexes]], or systems of colliding atoms as in [[Bose–Einstein condensate]].

== History and etymology ==
{{Main|History of molecular theory}}

According to [[Merriam-Webster]] and the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]], the word "molecule" derives from the [[Latin]] "[[Mole (unit)|moles]]" or small unit of mass.
* '''Molecule''' (1794)&amp;nbsp;– "extremely minute particle", from French ''{{linktext|molécule}}'' (1678), from [[New Latin]] ''{{linktext|molecula}}'', diminutive of Latin ''{{linktext|moles}}'' "mass, barrier". A vague meaning at first; the vogue for the word (used until the late 18th century only in Latin form) can be traced to the philosophy of [[René Descartes|Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|molecule|accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=molecule|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/molecule|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased. Earlier definitions were less precise, defining molecules as the smallest [[list of particles#Molecules|particles]] of pure [[chemical substance]]s that still retain their [[chemical compound|composition]] and chemical properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/glossary/m.shtml#molecule Molecule Definition] ([[Frostburg State University]])&lt;/ref&gt; This definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience, such as [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], and [[metal]]s, are composed of large crystalline networks of [[chemical bond|chemically bonded]] atoms or [[ion]]s, but are not made of discrete molecules.

== Bonding ==

Molecules are held together by either [[covalent bonding]] or [[ionic bonding]]. Several types of non-metal elements exist only as molecules in the environment. For example, hydrogen only exists as hydrogen molecule. A molecule of a compound is made out of two or more elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hutchinson unabridged encyclopedia with atlas and weather guide|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/hutchinson-unabridged-encyclopedia-with-atlas-and-weather-guide/oclc/696918830|website=worldcat.org|publisher=Oxford, England|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Covalent ===
{{main|Covalent bonding}}
[[File:Covalent bond hydrogen.svg|thumb|right|A covalent bond forming H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (right) where two [[hydrogen atom]]s share the two electrons]]
A covalent bond is a [[chemical bond]] that involves the sharing of [[electron pair]]s between [[atom]]s. These electron pairs are termed ''shared pairs'' or ''bonding pairs'', and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is termed ''covalent bonding''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author2= Brad Williamson; Robin J. Heyden| last= Campbell| first= Neil A.| title= Biology: Exploring Life| url= http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html| accessdate= 2012-02-05| year= 2006| publisher= [[Pearson Prentice Hall]]| location= Boston, Massachusetts| isbn= 0-13-250882-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ionic ===
{{main|Ionic bonding}} [[File:NaF.gif|thumb|left|[[Sodium]] and [[fluorine]] undergoing a redox reaction to form [[sodium fluoride]]. Sodium loses its outer [[electron]]  to give it a stable [[electron configuration]], and this electron enters the fluorine atom [[exothermic]]ally.]]

Ionic bonding is a type of [[chemical bond]] that involves the [[electrostatic]] attraction between oppositely charged [[ion]]s, and is the primary interaction occurring in [[ionic compound]]s. The ions are atoms that have lost one or more [[electron]]s (termed [[cation]]s) and atoms that have gained one or more electrons (termed [[anion]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VdROgeQ5M8C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=ionic+bonding+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi34bOG_6nTAhVnl1QKHRLZBeoQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=ionic%20bonding%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false|title=Elements of Metallurgy and Engineering Alloys|last=Campbell|first=Flake C.|date=2008-01-01|publisher=[[ASM International]]|isbn=9781615030583|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transfer of electrons is termed ''electrovalence'' in contrast to [[covalent bond|covalence]]. In the simplest case, the cation is a [[metal]] atom and the anion is a [[nonmetal]] atom, but these ions can be of a more complicated nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. Basically, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal for both atoms to obtain a full valence shell.

== Molecular size ==

Most molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye, but there are exceptions. [[DNA]], a [[macromolecule]], can reach [[macroscopic]] sizes, as can molecules of many [[polymer]]s. Molecules commonly used as building blocks for organic synthesis have a dimension of a few [[angstrom]]s (Å) to several dozen Å, or around one billionth of a meter. Single molecules cannot usually be observed by [[light]] (as noted above), but small molecules and even the outlines of individual atoms may be traced in some circumstances by use of an [[atomic force microscope]]. Some of the largest molecules are [[macromolecule]]s or [[supermolecule]]s.

The smallest molecule is the [[diatomic]] [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with a bond length of 0.74 Å.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Roger L. DeKock |author2=Harry B.

== Molecular formulas ==

=== Chemical formula types ===
{{Main|Chemical formula}}

The [[chemical formula]] for a molecule uses one line of [[chemical element]] symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, and ''plus'' (+) and ''minus'' (−) signs. These are limited to one typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts.

A compound's [[empirical formula]] is a very simple type of chemical formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wUmteTIc18C&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=empirical+formula&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv64bBh6rTAhUSwmMKHb3vB0IQ6AEIOjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=empirical%20formula&amp;f=false|title=The Practice of Chemistry|last=Wink|first=Donald J.|last2=Fetzer-Gislason|first2=Sharon|last3=McNicholas|first3=Sheila|date=2003-03-01|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780716748717|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the simplest [[integer]] [[ratio]] of the [[chemical element]]s that constitute it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chemteam.info/Mole/EmpiricalFormula.html|title=ChemTeam: Empirical Formula|website=www.chemteam.info|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, water is always composed of a 2:1 ratio of [[hydrogen]] to [[oxygen]] atoms, and ethyl [[alcohol]] or [[ethanol]] is always composed of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]] in a 2:6:1 ratio. However, this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely&amp;nbsp;– [[dimethyl ether]] has the same ratios as ethanol, for instance. Molecules with the same [[atom]]s in different arrangements are called [[isomer]]s. Also carbohydrates, for example, have the same ratio (carbon:hydrogen:oxygen= 1:2:1) (and thus the same empirical formula) but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule.

The [[molecular formula]] reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules. However different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules.

The empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always. For example, the molecule [[acetylene]] has molecular formula C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but the simplest integer ratio of elements is CH.

The [[molecular mass]] can be calculated from the [[chemical formula]] and is expressed in conventional [[atomic mass unit]]s equal to 1/12 of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;[[carbon|C]] [[isotope]]) atom. For [[network solid]]s, the term [[formula unit]] is used in [[stoichiometric]] calculations.

[[File:Atisane3.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|[[Three-dimensional space|3D]] (left and center) and [[2D geometric model|2D]] (right) representations of the [[terpenoid]] molecule atisane]]

For molecules with a complicated 3-dimensional structure, especially involving atoms bonded to four different substituents, a simple molecular formula or even semi-structural [[chemical formula]] may not be enough to completely specify the molecule. In this case, a graphical type of formula called a [[structural formula]] may be needed. Structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one-dimensional chemical name, but such [[chemical nomenclature]] requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas.

== Molecular geometry ==
{{Main|Molecular geometry}}

Molecules have fixed [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] geometries—bond lengths and angles— about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions. A pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure. The chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties, particularly its [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]. [[Isomers]] share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures. [[Stereoisomer]]s, a particular type of isomer, may have very similar physico-chemical properties and at the same time different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] activities.

== Molecular spectroscopy ==
{{Main|Spectroscopy}}

[[File:Dehydrogenation of H2TPP by STM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Hydrogen can be removed from individual [[Tetraphenylporphyrin|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP]] molecules by applying excess voltage to the tip of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM, a); this removal alters the current-voltage (I-V) curves of TPP molecules, measured using the same STM tip, from [[diode]] like (red curve in b) to [[resistor]] like (green curve). Image (c) shows a row of TPP, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP and TPP molecules. While scanning image (d), excess voltage was applied to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP at the black dot, which instantly removed hydrogen, as shown in the bottom part of (d) and in the rescan image (e). Such manipulations can be used in [[single-molecule electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep08350|pmid=25666850|pmc=4322354|title=N and p type character of single molecule diodes|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|page=8350|year=2015|bibcode= 2015NatSR...5E8350Z|author1=Zoldan|first1=V.

'''Molecular spectroscopy''' deals with the response ([[frequency spectrum|spectrum]]) of molecules interacting with probing signals of known [[energy]] (or [[frequency]], according to [[Planck's constant|Planck's formula]]). Molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule's energy exchange through [[absorbance]] or [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]].&lt;ref name="iupac2"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Spectroscopy|file=S05848|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Spectroscopy does not generally refer to [[diffraction]] studies where particles such as [[neutron]]s, [[electron]]s, or high energy [[X-ray]]s interact with a regular arrangement of molecules (as in a crystal).

[[Microwave spectroscopy]] commonly measures changes in the rotation of molecules, and can be used to identify molecules in outer space. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] measures changes in vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or [[functional group]]s in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or [[near infrared]] light, and result in colour. Nuclear resonance spectroscopy actually measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.

== Theoretical aspects ==

The study of molecules by [[molecular physics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]] is largely based on [[quantum mechanic]]s and is essential for the understanding of the [[chemical bond]]. The simplest of molecules is the [[hydrogen molecule-ion]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the [[one-electron bond]]. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is composed of two positively charged [[proton]]s and one negatively charged [[electron]], which means that the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron–electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of [[computational chemistry]].

When trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it "must correspond to a depression on the [[potential energy surface]] that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state".&lt;ref name="iupac" /&gt; This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the [[helium]] [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[helium dimer|He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], which has one vibrational [[bound state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson JB |title=Comment on "An exact quantum Monte Carlo calculation of the helium-helium intermolecular potential" [J. Chem. Phys. 115, 4546 (2001)] |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=120 |issue=20 |pages=9886–7 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15268005 |doi=10.1063/1.1704638 |bibcode= 2004JChPh.120.9886A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is so loosely bound that it is only likely to be observed at very low temperatures.

Whether or not an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule is inherently an operational definition. Philosophically, therefore, a molecule is not a fundamental entity (in contrast, for instance, to an [[elementary particle]]); rather, the concept of a molecule is the chemist's way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic-scale interactions in the world that we observe.

The '''Mpemba effect''' is a process in which hot [[water]] can [[freezing|freeze]] faster than cold water. The phenomenon is temperature-dependent. There is disagreement about the parameters required to produce the effect and about its theoretical basis.&lt;ref name="Burridge"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/srep37665| pmid = 27883034| pmc = 5121640| title = Questioning the Mpemba effect: Hot water does not cool more quickly than cold| journal = Scientific Reports| volume = 6| pages = 37665| year = 2016| last1 = Burridge| first1 = Henry C.| last2 = Linden| first2 = Paul F.| bibcode = 2016NatSR...637665B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tao"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00735| pmid = 27996255| title = Different Ways of Hydrogen Bonding in Water - Why Does Warm Water Freeze Faster than Cold Water?| journal = Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation| volume = 13| issue = 1| pages = 55–76| year = 2017| last1 = Tao| first1 = Yunwen| last2 = Zou| first2 = Wenli| last3 = Jia| first3 = Junteng| last4 = Li| first4 = Wei| last5 = Cremer| first5 = Dieter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mpemba-two-water-probes.svg|thumb|440x440px]]

The Mpemba effect is named after [[Erasto B. Mpemba|Erasto Batholomeo Mpemba]] (b.1950) who discovered it in 1963. There were preceding [[ancient]] accounts of similar phenomena, but lacking sufficient detail to attempt verification.

== Definition ==
The phenomenon, when taken to mean "hot water freezes faster than cold", is difficult to reproduce or confirm because this statement is ill-defined.&lt;ref name="ball" /&gt; Monwhea Jeng proposes as a more precise wording:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There exists a set of initial parameters, and a pair of temperatures, such that given two bodies of water identical in these parameters, and differing only in initial uniform temperatures, the hot one will freeze sooner.&lt;ref name="Jeng"&gt;{{Cite journal
| title=Hot water can freeze faster than cold?!?
| journal=American Journal of Physics
| year=2006
| first=Monwhea
| last=Jeng
| volume=74
| issue=6
| pages=514–522
| arxiv=physics/0512262
| doi=10.1119/1.2186331|bibcode = 2006AmJPh..74..514J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, even with this definition it is not clear whether "freezing" refers to the point at which water forms a visible surface layer of ice; the point at which the entire volume of water becomes a solid block of ice; or when the water reaches {{convert|0|C}}.&lt;ref name="ball" /&gt; A quantity of water can be at {{convert|0|C}} and not be ice; after enough heat has been removed to reach {{convert|0|C}} more heat must be removed before the water changes to solid state (ice), so water can be liquid or solid at {{convert|0|C}}.

With the above definition there are simple ways in which the effect might be observed: For example, if the hotter temperature melts the frost on a cooling surface and thus increases the thermal conductivity between the cooling surface and the water container.&lt;ref name="ball" /&gt; On the other hand, there may be many circumstances in which the effect is not observed.&lt;ref name="ball" /&gt;

=== Historical context ===
Various effects of heat on the freezing of water were described by ancient scientists such as [[Aristotle]]: "The fact that the water has previously been warmed contributes to its freezing quickly: for so it cools sooner. Hence many people, when they want to cool water quickly, begin by putting it in the sun. So the inhabitants of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] when they encamp on the ice to fish (they cut a hole in the ice and then fish) pour warm water round their reeds that it may freeze the quicker, for they use the ice like lead to fix the reeds."&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.1.i.html Meteorology] I.12 348b31–349a4&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's explanation involved ''[[antiperistasis]]'', "the supposed increase in the intensity of a quality as a result of being surrounded by its contrary quality."

[[Early modern]] scientists such as [[Francis Bacon]] noted that, "slightly tepid water freezes more easily than that which is utterly cold."&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon|Bacon, Francis]]; ''Novum Organum''de, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bacon/bacon.liber2.shtml Lib. II], L&lt;/ref&gt; In the original [[Latin]], "aqua parum tepida facilius conglacietur quam omnino frigida."

[[René Descartes]] wrote in his ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'', "One can see by experience that water that has been kept on a fire for a long time freezes faster than other, the reason being that those of its particles that are least able to stop bending evaporate while the water is being heated."&lt;ref&gt;[[René Descartes|Descartes, René]]; [http://posner.library.cmu.edu/Posner/books/pages.cgi?call=423_D44D_1637&amp;layout=vol0/part0/copy0&amp;file=0247 Les Météores]&lt;/ref&gt; This relates to [[Descartes' vortex theory]].

The Scottish scientist [[Joseph Black]] investigated a special case of this phenomenon comparing previously-boiled with unboiled water;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Black |first1=Joseph |title=The Supposed Effect of Boiling upon Water, in Disposing It to Freeze More Readily, Ascertained by Experiments. By Joseph Black, M. D. Professor of Chemistry at Edinburgh, in a Letter to Sir John Pringle, Bart. P. R. S. |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1 January 1775 |volume=65 |pages=124–128 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1775.0014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the previously-boiled water froze more quickly. Evaporation was controlled for. He discussed the influence of stirring on the results of the experiment, noting that stirring the unboiled water led to it freezing at the same time as the previously-boiled water, and also noted that stirring the very-cold unboiled water led to immediate freezing. Joseph Black then discussed [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit|Fahrenheit's]] description of [[supercooling]] of water (although the term supercooling had not then been coined), arguing, in modern terms, that the previously-boiled water could not be as readily supercooled.

=== Mpemba's observation ===
The effect is named after [[Tanzania]]n [[Erasto B. Mpemba|Erasto Mpemba]]. He described it in 1963 in Form 3 of Magamba Secondary School, [[Tanganyika]], when freezing ice cream mix that was hot in cookery classes and noticing that it froze before the cold mix. He later became a student at Mkwawa Secondary (formerly High) School in [[Iringa]]. The headmaster invited [[Denis Osborne|Dr. Denis G. Osborne]] from the University College in [[Dar es Salaam]] to give a lecture on physics. After the lecture, [[Erasto B. Mpemba|Erasto Mpemba]] asked him the question, "If you take two similar containers with equal volumes of water, one at {{convert|35|C}} and the other at {{convert|100|C}}, and put them into a freezer, the one that started at {{convert|100|C}} freezes first. Why?", only to be ridiculed by his classmates and teacher. After initial consternation, Osborne experimented on the issue back at his workplace and confirmed Mpemba's finding. They published the results together in 1969, while Mpemba was studying at the [[College of African Wildlife Management]].&lt;ref name="Mpemba"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Modern context ===
Mpemba and Osborne describe placing {{convert|70|ml|abbr=on}} samples of water in {{convert|100|ml|abbr=on}} beakers in the ice box of a domestic refrigerator on a sheet of polystyrene foam. They showed the time for ''freezing to start'' was longest with an initial temperature of {{convert|25|C}} and that it was much less at around {{convert|90|C}}. They ruled out loss of liquid volume by evaporation as a significant factor and the effect of dissolved air. In their setup most heat loss was found to be from the liquid surface.&lt;ref name="Mpemba" /&gt;
 
David Auerbach describes an effect that he observed in samples in glass beakers placed into a liquid cooling bath. In all cases the water supercooled, reaching a temperature of typically {{convert|-6|to|-18|C}} before spontaneously freezing. Considerable random variation was observed in the time required for spontaneous freezing to start and in some cases this resulted in the water which started off hotter (partially) freezing first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

James Brownridge, a radiation safety officer at the [[State University of New York]], has said that he believes that supercooling is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chown |first1=Marcus |title=Revealed: why hot water freezes faster than cold |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527535.200-revealed-why-hot-water-freezes-faster-than-cold/ |work=New Scientist |date=24 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[molecular dynamics]] simulations have also supported that changes in hydrogen bonding during supercooling takes a major role in the process.&lt;ref name="Jin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2016, Burridge and Linden defined the criterion as the time to reach {{convert|0|°C|°F}}, carried out experiments and reviewed published work to date. They noted that the large difference originally claimed had not been replicated, and that studies showing a small effect could be influenced by variations in the positioning of thermometers. They say, "We conclude, somewhat sadly, that there is no evidence to support meaningful observations of the Mpemba effect".&lt;ref name="Burridge" /&gt;

However, in 2017, two research groups independently and simultaneously found theoretical evidence of the Mpemba effect and also predicted a new "inverse" Mpemba effect in which heating a cooled, far-from-equilibrium system takes less time than another system that is initially closer to equilibrium. Lu and Raz&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lu |first=Zhiyue |last2=Raz |first2=Oren |date=2017-05-16 |title=Nonequilibrium thermodynamics of the Markovian Mpemba effect and its inverse |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/20/5083 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |language=en |volume=114 |issue=20 |pages=5083–5088 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1701264114 |issn=0027-8424 |pmid=28461467 |arxiv=1609.05271 |bibcode=2017PNAS..114.5083L |pmc=5441807}}&lt;/ref&gt; yield a general criterion based on Markovian statistical mechanics, predicting the appearance of the inverse Mpemba effect in the [[Ising model]] and diffusion dynamics.

In this last work, it is suggested that a very generic mechanism leading to both Mpemba effects is due to a particle velocity [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] that significantly deviates from the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution]].

== Suggested explanations ==
The following explanations have been proposed:

* ''[[Evaporation]]'': The evaporation of the warmer water reduces the mass of the water to be frozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

| title = The freezing of hot and cold water

| bibcode = 1969AmJPh..37..564K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evaporation is [[endothermic]], meaning that the water mass is cooled by vapor carrying away the heat, but this alone probably does not account for the entirety of the effect.&lt;ref name="Jeng" /&gt;
* ''[[Convection]]'': Accelerating [[heat transfer]]s. Reduction of water density below {{convert|4|°C|°F}} tends to suppress the convection currents that cool the lower part of the liquid mass; the lower density of hot water would reduce this effect, perhaps sustaining the more rapid initial cooling. Higher convection in the warmer water may also spread ice crystals around faster.&lt;ref&gt;[[CITV]] ''[[Prove It!]]'' [http://www.proveit.tv/series-1/fs.html?p=13&amp;s=3 Series 1 Programme 13]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Frost]]'': Has [[Thermal insulation|insulating]] effects. The lower temperature water will tend to freeze from the top, reducing further heat loss by radiation and air convection, while the warmer water will tend to freeze from the bottom and sides because of water convection. This is disputed as there are experiments that account for this factor.&lt;ref name="Jeng" /&gt;
* ''[[Solution|Solutes]]'': The effects of [[calcium carbonate]], [[magnesium carbonate]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=physics/0604224
| title=When hot water freezes before cold
| journal=American Journal of Physics

| doi=10.1119/1.2996187
| bibcode=2009AmJPh..77...27K
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Thermal conductivity]]'': The container of hotter liquid may melt through a layer of frost that is acting as an insulator under the container (frost is an insulator, as mentioned above), allowing the container to come into direct contact with a much colder lower layer that the frost formed on (ice, refrigeration coils, etc.) The container now rests on a much colder surface (or one better at removing heat, such as refrigeration coils) than the originally colder water, and so cools far faster from this point on.
*''[[Dissolution (chemistry)|Dissolved gases]]'': Cold water can contain more dissolved gases than hot water, which may somehow change the properties of the water with respect to convection currents, a proposition that has some experimental support but no theoretical explanation.&lt;ref name="Jeng" /&gt;
* ''[[Hydrogen bonding]]'': In warm water, hydrogen bonding is weaker.&lt;ref name="Tao" /&gt;
* ''[[Crystallization]]'': Another explanation suggests that the relatively higher population of water hexamer states in warm water might be responsible for the faster crystallization.&lt;ref name="Jin"&gt;{{Cite journal

A reviewer for ''[[Physics World]]'' writes, "Even if the Mpemba effect is real &amp;mdash; if hot water can sometimes freeze more quickly than cold &amp;mdash; it is not clear whether the explanation would be trivial or illuminating." He pointed out that investigations of the phenomenon need to control a large number of initial parameters (including type and initial temperature of the water, dissolved gas and other impurities, and size, shape and material of the container, and temperature of the refrigerator) and need to settle on a particular method of establishing the time of freezing, all of which might affect the presence or absence of the Mpemba effect. The required vast multidimensional array of experiments might explain why the effect is not yet understood.&lt;ref name="ball"&gt;Ball, Philip (April 2006). [http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/2006/mar/29/does-hot-water-freeze-first Does hot water freeze first?]. ''Physics World'', pp. 19-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New Scientist]]'' recommends starting the experiment with containers at {{convert|35|and|5|C}} to maximize the effect.&lt;ref&gt;''How to Fossilize Your Hamster: And Other Amazing Experiments for the Armchair Scientist'', {{ISBN|1-84668-044-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a related study, it was found that freezer temperature also affects the probability of observing the Mpemba phenomenon as well as container temperature.

In 2012, the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] held a competition calling for papers offering explanations to the Mpemba effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/mpemba-competition/ ''Mpemba Competition''], Royal Society of Chemistry, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; More than 22,000 people entered and [[Erasto B. Mpemba|Erasto Mpemba]] himself announced Nikola Bregović as the winner. Bregović suggests two reasons for the effect — a colder sample gets supercooled rather than frozen, and enhanced convection in the warmer sample speeds up cooling by maintaining the heat gradient on the container walls.&lt;ref&gt;Bregović, Nikola; [http://www.rsc.org/images/nikola-bregovic-entry_tcm18-225169.pdf ''Mpemba effect from a viewpoint of an experimental physical chemist''], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Tao and co-workers proposed yet another possible explanation in 2016. On the basis of results from vibrational spectroscopy and modeling with [[density functional theory]]-optimized water clusters, they suggest that the reason might lie in the vast diversity and peculiar occurrence of different [[hydrogen bond]]s. Their key argument is that the number of strong hydrogen bonds increases as [[temperature]] is elevated.  The existence of the small strongly-bonded clusters facilitates in turn the [[nucleation]] of [[Ice Ih|hexagonal ice]] when warm water is rapidly cooled down.&lt;ref name="Tao" /&gt;

== Similar effects ==
Other phenomena in which large effects may be achieved faster than small effects are
* [[Latent heat]]: turning {{convert|0|C}} ice to {{convert|0|C}} water takes the same amount of energy as heating water from {{convert|0|C}} to {{convert|80|C}} 
* [[Leidenfrost effect]]: lower temperature boilers can sometimes vaporize water faster than higher temperature boilers

'''Natural rubber''', also called '''India rubber''' or '''''caoutchouc''''', as initially produced, consists of [[polymer]]s of the [[organic compound]] [[isoprene]], with minor impurities of other organic compounds, plus water. [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] are two of the leading rubber producers. Forms of [[polyisoprene]] that are used as natural rubbers are classified as [[elastomer]]s.

Currently, rubber is harvested mainly in the form of the [[latex]] from the [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber tree]] or others. The latex is a sticky, milky [[colloid]] drawn off by making incisions in the bark and collecting the fluid in vessels in a process called "tapping". The latex then is refined into rubber ready for commercial processing.  In major areas, latex is allowed to coagulate in the collection cup. The coagulated lumps are collected and processed into dry forms for marketing.

Natural rubber is used extensively in many applications and products, either alone or in combination with other materials. In most of its useful forms, it has a large [[stretch ratio]] and high [[Resilience (materials science)|resilience]], and is extremely waterproof.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;Heinz-Hermann Greve "Rubber, 2. Natural" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a23_225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Varieties ==

=== ''Hevea brasiliensis'' ===
The major commercial source of natural rubber latex is the Pará rubber tree (''[[Hevea brasiliensis]]''), a member of the [[spurge]] [[Family (biology)|family]], ''[[Euphorbiaceae]]''. This species is preferred because it grows well under cultivation. A properly managed tree responds to wounding by producing more latex for several years.

[[Congo rubber]], formerly a major source of rubber, came from vines in the genus ''[[Landolphia]]'' (''[[Landolphia kirkii|L. kirkii]]'', ''L. heudelotis'', and ''L. owariensis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~legneref/botany/rubber.htm|title=Rubber and Other Latex Products|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dandelion ===
[[Dandelion]] milk contains latex. The latex exhibits the same quality as the natural rubber from [[rubber trees]]. In the wild types of dandelion, latex content is low and varies greatly. In [[Nazi Germany]], research projects tried to use dandelions as a base for rubber production, but failed.&lt;ref name="Heim2002"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=1DqS5a5A8JkC}}|title=Autarkie und Ostexpansion: Pflanzenzucht und Agrarforschung im Nationalsozialismus|last=Heim|first=Susanne|publisher=Wallstein Verlag|year=2002|isbn=978-3892444961|authorlink=Susanne Heim}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, by inhibiting one key enzyme and using modern cultivation methods and optimization techniques, scientists in the [[Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology]] (IME) in [[Germany]] developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131028114547.htm|title=Making Rubber from Dandelion Juice|date=28 October 2013|work=[[Science Daily]]|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with [[Continental Tire]]s, IME began a pilot facility.

=== Other ===
Many other plants produce forms of latex rich in isoprene polymers, though not all produce usable forms of polymer as easily as the Pará. Some of them require more elaborate processing to produce anything like usable rubber, and most are more difficult to tap. Some produce other desirable materials, for example [[gutta-percha]] (''[[Palaquium gutta]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Article/GuttaPercha/ |title=The Gutta Percha Company |first=Bill |last=Burns |work=History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Undersea Communications |accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[chicle]] from ''[[Manilkara]]'' species. Others that have been commercially exploited, or at least showed promise as rubber sources, include the rubber fig (''[[Ficus elastica]]''), Panama rubber tree (''[[Castilla elastica]]''), various spurges (''[[Euphorbia]]'' spp.), [[lettuce]] (''[[Lactuca]]'' species), the related ''[[Scorzonera tau-saghyz]]'', various ''[[Taraxacum]]'' species, including common dandelion (''[[Taraxacum officinale]]'') and Russian dandelion (''[[Taraxacum kok-saghyz]]''), and perhaps most importantly for its hypoallergenic properties, [[guayule]] (''Parthenium argentatum''). The term '''gum rubber''' is sometimes applied to the tree-obtained version of natural rubber in order to distinguish it from the synthetic version.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

== History ==
The first use of rubber was by the indigenous cultures of [[Mesoamerica]]. The earliest archeological evidence of the use of natural latex from the [[Hevea tree|''Hevea'' tree]] comes from the [[Olmec]] culture, in which rubber was first used for making balls for the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]]. Rubber was later used by the  [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Aztec]] cultures – in addition to making balls Aztecs used rubber for other purposes such as making containers and to make textiles waterproof by impregnating them with the latex sap.&lt;ref&gt;Emory Dean Keoke, Kay Marie Porterfield. 2009.

The Devil's Milk: A Social History of Rubber. NYU Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pará rubber tree is [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] to [[South America]]. [[Charles Marie de La Condamine]] is credited with introducing samples of rubber to the ''[[Académie Royale des Sciences]]'' of France in 1736.&lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{cite web |title= Charles Marie de la Condamine |website= bouncing-balls.com |url= http://www.bouncing-balls.com/timeline/people/nr_condamine.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1751, he presented a paper by [[François Fresneau]] to the Académie (published in 1755) that described many of rubber's properties. This has been referred to as the first scientific paper on rubber.&lt;ref name="b" /&gt; In England, [[Joseph Priestley]], in 1770, observed that a piece of the material was extremely good for rubbing off [[pencil]] marks on paper, hence the name "rubber". It slowly made its way around England. In 1764 François Fresnau discovered that [[turpentine]] was a rubber solvent. [[Giovanni Fabbroni]] is credited with the discovery of [[naphtha]] as a rubber solvent in 1779.

South America remained the main source of the limited amounts of latex rubber used during much of the 19th century. The trade was heavily protected and exporting seeds from Brazil was a [[Capital punishment|capital offense]], although no law prohibited it. Nevertheless, in 1876, [[Henry Wickham (explorer)|Henry Wickham]] smuggled 70,000 Pará rubber tree seeds from Brazil and delivered them to [[Kew Gardens]], England. Only 2,400 of these germinated. Seedlings were then sent to [[India]], [[British Ceylon]] ([[Sri Lanka]]), [[Dutch East Indies]] ([[Indonesia]]), [[Singapore]], and [[British Malaya]]. Malaya (now [[Peninsular Malaysia]]) was later to become the biggest producer of rubber.

In the early 1900s, the [[Congo Free State]] in Africa was also a significant source of natural rubber latex, mostly gathered by [[forced labor]]. King Leopold II's colonial state brutally enforced production quotas. Tactics to enforce the rubber quotas included removing the hands of victims to prove they had been killed. Soldiers often came back from raids with baskets full of chopped-off hands. Villages that resisted were razed to encourage better compliance locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-25|title=Atrocities in the Congo Free State|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atrocities_in_the_Congo_Free_State&amp;oldid=842894462|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State]] for more information on the rubber trade in the Congo Free State in the late 1800s and early 1900s. [[Liberia]] and [[Nigeria]] started production.

In [[India]], commercial cultivation was introduced by British planters, although the experimental efforts to grow rubber on a commercial scale were initiated as early as 1873 at the [[Calcutta]] Botanical Gardens. The first commercial ''Hevea'' plantations were established at Thattekadu in [[Kerala]] in 1902. In later years the plantation expanded to [[Karnataka]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] of India. India today is the world's 3rd largest producer and 4th largest consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsir.gov.in/reports/ExpTechTNKL/Abs%20new/Rubber.htm|title=Natural rubber in India|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001100758/http://www.dsir.gov.in/reports/ExpTechTNKL/Abs%20new/Rubber.htm|archivedate=1 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Singapore and Malaya, commercial production was heavily promoted by [[Henry Nicholas Ridley|Sir Henry Nicholas Ridley]], who served as the first Scientific Director of the [[Singapore Botanic Gardens]] from 1888 to 1911. He distributed rubber seeds to many planters and developed the first technique for tapping trees for latex without causing serious harm to the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_518_2004-12-28.html |title=Sir Henry Nicholas Ridley |last=Cornelius-Takahama |first=Vernon |date=2001 |work=Singapore Infopedia |accessdate=9 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504095356/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_518_2004-12-28.html |archivedate=4 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his fervent promotion of this crop, he is popularly remembered by the nickname "Mad Ridley".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malaysiahistory.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56:mad-ridley-and-the-rubber-boom&amp;catid=47:economic-history |title=Mad Ridley and the rubber boom |first1=Dr Loh Wei |last1=Leng |first2=Khor Jin |last2=Keong |date=19 September 2011 |work=Malaysia History |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-World War II ===
[[Charles Goodyear]] developed [[sulfur vulcanization|vulcanization]] in 1839, although [[Mesoamerican]]s used stabilized rubber for balls and other objects as early as 1600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hosler | first1 = D. | last2 = Burkett | first2 = S.L. | last3 = Tarkanian | first3 = M.J. | year = 1999 | title = Prehistoric polymers: Rubber processing in ancient Mesoamerica | url = | journal = Science | volume = 284 | issue = 5422| pages = 1988–1991 | doi=10.1126/science.284.5422.1988 | pmid=10373117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slack2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles |last=Slack|title=Noble obsession: Charles Goodyear, Thomas Hancock, and the race to unlock the greatest industrial secret of the nineteenth century|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=CWzeAAAAMAAJ}}|date=7 August 2002|publisher=Hyperion|isbn=978-0786867899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before World War II significant uses included door and window profiles, hoses, belts, gaskets, [[Rubber mat|matting]], flooring and dampeners (antivibration mounts) for the [[automotive]] industry. The use of rubber in car [[tire]]s (initially solid rather than pneumatic) in particular consumed a significant amount of rubber.  [[Gloves]] (medical, household and industrial) and toy [[balloon]]s were large consumers of rubber, although the type of rubber used is concentrated latex. Significant tonnage of rubber was used as [[adhesive]]s in many manufacturing industries and products, although the two most noticeable were the paper and the carpet industries. Rubber was commonly used to make [[rubber band]]s and pencil [[eraser]]s.

Rubber produced as a fiber, sometimes called 'elastic', had significant value to the textile industry because of its excellent elongation and recovery properties. For these purposes, manufactured rubber fiber was made as either an extruded round fiber or rectangular fibers cut into strips from extruded film. Because of its low dye acceptance, feel and appearance, the rubber fiber was either covered by yarn of another fiber or directly woven with other yarns into the fabric. Rubber yarns were used in foundation garments. While rubber is still used in textile manufacturing, its low tenacity limits its use in lightweight garments because latex lacks resistance to oxidizing agents and is damaged by aging, sunlight, oil and perspiration. The textile industry turned to [[neoprene]] (polymer of [[chloroprene]]), a type of synthetic rubber, as well as another more commonly used elastomer fiber, [[spandex]] (also known as elastane), because of their superiority to rubber in both strength and durability.

==Properties==
[[File:Latex being collected from a tapped rubber tree.jpg|thumb|Rubber latex]]
Rubber exhibits unique physical and chemical properties. Rubber's stress–strain behavior exhibits the [[Mullins effect]] and the [[Payne effect]] and is often modeled as [[Hyperelastic material|hyperelastic]]. Rubber [[Strain crystallization|strain crystallizes]].

Due to the presence of weakened [[allyl]]ic C-H bonds in each [[repeat unit]], natural rubber is susceptible to [[vulcanisation]] as well as being sensitive to [[ozone cracking]].

The two main [[solvents]] for rubber are [[turpentine]] and [[naphtha]] (petroleum). Because rubber does not dissolve easily, the material is finely divided by shredding prior to its immersion.

An [[ammonia]] solution can be used to prevent the [[flocculation|coagulation]] of raw latex.

Rubber begins to melt at approximately {{Convert|180|C}}.

===Elasticity===
{{main|Rubber elasticity}}
{{refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
On a microscopic scale, relaxed rubber is a disorganized cluster of erratically changing wrinkled chains. In stretched rubber, the chains are almost linear. The restoring force is due to the preponderance of wrinkled conformations over more linear ones. For the quantitative treatment see [[ideal chain]], for more examples see [[entropic force]].

Cooling below the [[glass transition temperature]] permits local conformational changes but a reordering is practically impossible because of the larger energy barrier for the concerted movement of longer chains. "Frozen" rubber's elasticity is low and [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] results from small changes of [[Chemical bond|bond]] lengths and angles: this caused the [[Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]], when the American [[Space Shuttle]]'s flattened [[o-ring]]s failed to relax to fill a widening gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title = Casing Joint Design | work =  Report - Investigation of the Challenger Accident| publisher = US Government Printing Office| date =| url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CRPT-99hrpt1016/pdf/CHRG-101shrg1087-2.pdf| format = PDF| doi = | accessdate = 29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The glass transition is fast and reversible: the force resumes on heating.

The parallel chains of stretched rubber are susceptible to crystallization. This takes some time because turns of twisted chains have to move out of the way of the growing crystallites. Crystallization has occurred, for example, when, after days, an inflated toy balloon is found withered at a relatively large remaining volume. Where it is touched, it shrinks because the temperature of the hand is enough to melt the crystals.

[[Vulcanization]] of rubber creates di- and [[polysulfide bonds]] between chains, which limits the [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] and results in chains that tighten more quickly for a given strain, thereby increasing the elastic force constant and making the rubber harder and less extensible.

===Malodour===
Raw rubber storage depots and rubber processing can produce malodour that is serious enough to become a source of complaints and protest to those living in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b74a/c9bfbe91a9cc5625c7dd980bc1de3ec8a0de.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215053437/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b74a/c9bfbe91a9cc5625c7dd980bc1de3ec8a0de.pdf |archive-date=15 December 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microbial impurities originate during the processing of block rubber. These impurities break down during storage or thermal degradation and produce volatile organic compounds. Examination of these compounds using [[gas chromatography]]/[[mass spectrometry]] (GC/MS) and gas chromatography (GC) indicates that they contain sulphur, ammonia, [[alkene]]s, [[ketone]]s, [[ester]]s, hydrogen sulphite, nitrogen, and low molecular weight fatty acids (C2-C5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Determination of Chemical Components that Cause Mal-Odor from Natural Rubber|first1=Vipavee P.|last1=Hoven|first2=Kesinee|last2=Rattanakaran|first3=Yasuyuki|last3=Tanaka|date=1 November 2003|journal=Rubber Chemistry and Technology|volume=76|issue=5|pages=1128–1144|doi=10.5254/1.3547792}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aidic.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidic.it/cet/12/30/021.pdf |title=Info |website=www.aidic.it |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When latex concentrate is produced from rubber, sulphuric acid is used for coagulation. This produces malodourous hydrogen sulphide.&lt;ref name="aidic.it"/&gt;

The industry can mitigate these bad odours with [[scrubber|scrubber systems]].&lt;ref name="aidic.it"/&gt;

== Chemical makeup ==
[[File:NatVsSynPolyisoprene.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Chemical structure of cis-polyisoprene, the main constituent of natural rubber. Synthetic cis-polyisoprene and natural cis-polyisoprene are derived from different precursors, [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] and [[isoprene]].]]

Latex is the polymer cis-1,4-polyisoprene – with a [[molecular weight]] of 100,000 to 1,000,000 [[Dalton (unit)|daltons]]. Typically, a small percentage (up to 5% of dry mass) of other materials, such as [[proteins]], [[fatty acids]], [[resins]], and inorganic materials (salts) are found in natural rubber. Polyisoprene can also be created synthetically, producing what is sometimes referred to as "synthetic natural rubber", but the synthetic and natural routes are different.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; Some natural rubber sources, such as [[gutta-percha]], are composed of trans-1,4-polyisoprene, a [[structural isomer]] that has similar properties.

Natural rubber is an elastomer and a [[thermoplastic]]. Once the rubber is vulcanized, it is a [[thermoset]]. Most rubber in everyday use is vulcanized to a point where it shares properties of both; i.e., if it is heated and cooled, it is degraded but not destroyed.

The final properties of a rubber item depend not just on the polymer, but also on modifiers and fillers, such as [[carbon black]], [[factice]], whiting and others.

===Biosynthesis===
Rubber particles are formed in the [[cytoplasm]] of specialized latex-producing cells called [[laticifer]]s within rubber plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Koyama |editor-first= Tanetoshi |editor2-last= Steinbüchel |editor2-first= Alexander |chapter= Biosynthesis of Natural Rubber and Other Natural Polyisoprenoids |title= Polyisoprenoids |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=1a_wAAAAMAAJ|page=73}}|series= Biopolymers |volume= 2 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |date= June 2011 |pages= 73–81 |isbn= 978-3527302215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubber particles are surrounded by a single [[phospholipid]] membrane with [[hydrophobic]] tails pointed inward. The membrane allows biosynthetic proteins to be sequestered at the surface of the growing rubber particle, which allows new monomeric units to be added from outside the biomembrane, but within the lacticifer. The rubber particle is an enzymatically active entity that contains three layers of material, the rubber particle, a biomembrane and free monomeric units. The biomembrane is held tightly to the rubber core due to the high negative charge along the double bonds of the rubber polymer backbone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Paterson-Jones |first1= J.C. |last2= Gilliland |first2= M.G. |last3= Van Staden |first3= J. |title= The Biosynthesis of Natural Rubber |journal= Journal of Plant Physiology |volume= 136 |issue= 3 |pages= 257–263 |date= June 1990 |doi= 10.1016/S0176-1617(11)80047-7 |issn= 0176-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free monomeric units and conjugated proteins make up the outer layer. The rubber precursor is [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] (an [[Allyl group|allylic]] compound), which elongates by Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent condensation by the action of rubber transferase. The monomer adds to the pyrophosphate end of the growing polymer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Christian |last1=Schulze Gronover |first2=Daniela |last2=Wahler |first3=Dirk |last3=Prufer |editor-last= Magdy |editor-first= Elnashar |date=5 Jul 2011 |title=Biotechnology of Biopolymers |chapter=4.

The reaction produces a cis polymer. The initiation step is catalyzed by [[prenyltransferase]], which converts three monomers of isopentenyl pyrophosphate into [[farnesyl pyrophosphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Xie |first1= W. |display-authors= 3 |last2= McMahan |first2= C.M. |last3= Distefano |first3= A.J.

The required isopentenyl pyrophosphate is obtained from the [[mevalonate]] pathway, which derives from [[acetyl-CoA]] in the [[cytosol]].

==Production==
[[File:Rubber trees in Kerala, India.jpg|thumb|Rubber is generally cultivated in large plantations. The image shows a coconut shell used in collecting latex, in plantations in [[Kerala]], India.]]
Close to 28 million tons of rubber were produced in 2013, of which approximately 44% was natural. Since the bulk is synthetic, which is derived from petroleum, the price of natural rubber is determined, to a large extent, by the prevailing global price of crude oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.wlxrubber.com/news_detail/newsId=daa867c8-3134-477a-a1aa-4db921ff538f&amp;comp_stats=comp-FrontNews_ranking01-1264986203356.html |title=Overview of the Causes of Natural Rubber Price Volatility |language= |publisher=En.wlxrubber.com |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2013-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526213107/http://en.wlxrubber.com/news_detail/newsId%3Ddaa867c8-3134-477a-a1aa-4db921ff538f%26comp_stats%3Dcomp-FrontNews_ranking01-1264986203356.html |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rubberstudy.com/documents/WebSiteData_3.0c.pdf |title=STATISTICAL SUMMARY OF WORLD RUBBER SITUATION |publisher=International Rubber Study Group |date=Nov 2014 |accessdate=2015-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412003724/http://www.rubberstudy.com/documents/WebSiteData_3.0c.pdf |archivedate=12 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/2880010|title=The Impact of the Changes of the World Crude Oil Prices on the Natural Rubber Industry in Malaysia|journal=World Applied Sciences Journal|author=Dr. Aye Aye Khin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asia was the main source of natural rubber, accounting for about 94% of output in 2005. The three largest producers, [[Thailand]], Indonesia (2.4 million tons)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Listiyorini |first=Eko |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-16/rubber-exports-from-indonesia-may-grow-6-8-next-year-update1-.html |title=Rubber Exports From Indonesia May Grow 6%–8% Next Year |publisher=bloomberg.com |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2013-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104074312/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-16/rubber-exports-from-indonesia-may-grow-6-8-next-year-update1-.html |archivedate=4 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Malaysia, together account for around 72% of all natural rubber production. Natural rubber is not cultivated widely in its native continent of South America due to the existence of South American leaf [[blight]], and other natural predators.

=== Cultivation ===
Rubber latex is extracted from rubber trees. The economic life period of rubber trees in plantations is around 32 years&amp;nbsp;— up to 7 years of immature phase and about 25 years of productive phase.

The soil requirement is well-drained, weathered soil consisting of [[laterite]], lateritic types, sedimentary types, nonlateritic red or [[Alluvium|alluvial]] soils.

The climatic conditions for optimum growth of rubber trees are:
* Rainfall of around {{Convert|250|cm}} evenly distributed without any marked dry season and with at least 100 rainy days per year
* Temperature range of about 20 to 34&amp;nbsp;°C, with a monthly mean of 25 to 28&amp;nbsp;°C
* Atmospheric humidity of around 80%
* About 2000 hours sunshine per year at the rate of six hours per day throughout the year
* Absence of strong winds

Many high-yielding clones have been developed for commercial planting. These clones yield more than 2,000&amp;nbsp;kg of dry rubber per hectare per year, under ideal conditions.

=== Collection ===
[[File:Ceylon rubber.jpg|thumb|A woman in [[Sri Lanka]] harvesting rubber, circa 1920]]
In places such as Kerala and Sri Lanka where coconuts are in abundance, the half shell of coconut was used as the latex collection container. Glazed pottery or aluminium or plastic cups became  more common in Kerala and other countries. The cups are supported by a wire that encircles the tree. This wire incorporates a spring so it can stretch as the tree grows. The latex is led into the cup by a galvanised "spout" knocked into the bark. Tapping normally takes place early in the morning, when the internal pressure of the tree is highest. A good tapper can tap a tree every 20 seconds on a standard half-spiral system, and a common daily "task" size is between 450 and 650 trees. Trees are usually tapped on alternate or third days, although many variations in timing, length and number of cuts are used. "Tappers would make a slash in the bark with a small hatchet. These slanting cuts allowed latex to flow from ducts located on the exterior or the inner layer of bark (cambium) of the tree. Since the cambium controls the growth of the tree, growth stops if it is cut. Thus, rubber tapping demanded accuracy, so that the incisions would not be too many given the size of the tree, or too deep, which could stunt its growth or kill it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of American Indian contributions to the world 15,000 years of inventions and innovations|last=Keoke|first=Emory|publisher=Checkmark Books|year=2003|isbn=|location=|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is usual to tap a pannel at least twice, sometimes three times, during the tree's life. The economic life of the tree depends on how well the tapping is carried out, as the critical factor is bark consumption. A standard in Malaysia for alternate daily tapping is 25&amp;nbsp;cm (vertical) bark consumption per year. The latex-containing tubes in the bark ascend in a spiral to the right. For this reason, tapping cuts usually ascend to the left to cut more tubes.

The trees drip latex for about four hours, stopping as latex coagulates naturally on the tapping cut, thus blocking the latex tubes in the bark. Tappers usually rest and have a meal after finishing their tapping work, then start collecting the liquid "field latex" at about midday.

====Field coagula====
[[File:MixedFieldCoagula.jpg|thumb|Mixed field coagula.]]

The four types of field coagula are "cuplump", "treelace", "smallholders' lump" and "earth scrap". Each has significantly different properties.&lt;ref&gt;This section has been copied almost verbatim from the [[public domain]] UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), ecoport.com article: {{cite web |url= http://ecoport.org/ep?SearchType=earticleView&amp;earticleId=644&amp;page=4363 |title=Processing of Natural Rubber, Manufacture of Latex-Grade Crepe Rubber |first1=John |last1=Cecil |first2=Peter |last2=Mitchell |first3=Per |last3=Diemer |first4=Peter |last4=Griffee |publisher=FAO, Agricultural and Food Engineering Technologies Service |work=ecoport.org |date=2013 |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trees continue to drip after the collection leading to a small amount of "cup lump" that is collected at the next tapping. The latex that coagulates on the cut is also collected as "tree lace". Tree lace and cup lump together account for 10–20% of the dry rubber produced. Latex that drips onto the ground, "earth scrap", is also collected periodically for processing of low-grade product.

===== Cup lump =====
Cup lump is the coagulated material found in the collection cup when the tapper next visits the tree to tap it again. It arises from latex clinging to the walls of the cup after the latex was last poured into the bucket, and from late-dripping latex exuded before the latex-carrying vessels of the tree become blocked. It is of higher purity and of greater value than the other three types.

===== Tree lace =====
Tree lace is the coagulum strip that the tapper peels off the previous cut before making a new cut. It usually has higher copper and manganese contents than cup lump. Both copper and manganese are pro-oxidants and can damage the physical properties of the dry rubber.

===== Smallholders' lump =====
Smallholders' lump is produced by smallholders who collect rubber from trees far from the nearest factory. Many Indonesian smallholders, who farm paddies in remote areas, tap dispersed trees on their way to work in the paddy fields and collect the latex (or the coagulated latex) on their way home. As it is often impossible to preserve the latex sufficiently to get it to a factory that processes latex in time for it to be used to make high quality products, and as the latex would anyway have coagulated by the time it reached the factory, the smallholder will coagulate it by any means available, in any container available. Some smallholders use small containers, buckets etc., but often the latex is coagulated in holes in the ground, which are usually lined with plastic sheeting. Acidic materials and fermented fruit juices are used to coagulate the latex&amp;nbsp;— a form of assisted biological coagulation. Little care is taken to exclude twigs, leaves, and even bark from the lumps that are formed, which may also include tree lace.

===== Earth scrap =====
Earth scrap is material that gathers around the base of the tree. It arises from latex overflowing from the cut and running down the bark, from rain flooding a collection cup containing latex, and from spillage from tappers' buckets during collection. It contains soil and other contaminants, and has variable rubber content, depending on the amount of contaminants. Earth scrap is collected by field workers two or three times a year and may be cleaned in a scrap-washer to recover the rubber, or sold to a contractor who cleans it and recovers the rubber. It is of low quality.

=== Processing ===
[[File:RemovingCoagulumFromCoagulatingTroughs.jpg|thumb|Removing coagulum from coagulating troughs.]]
Latex coagulates in the cups if kept for long and must be collected before this happens. The collected latex, "field latex", is transferred into coagulation tanks for the preparation of dry rubber or transferred into air-tight containers with sieving for ammoniation. Ammoniation preserves the latex in a colloidal state for longer periods of time.

Latex is generally processed into either latex concentrate for manufacture of dipped goods or coagulated under controlled, clean conditions using formic acid. The coagulated latex can then be processed into the higher-grade, technically specified block rubbers such as SVR 3L or SVR CV or used to produce Ribbed Smoke Sheet grades.

Naturally coagulated rubber (cup lump) is used in the manufacture of TSR10 and TSR20 grade rubbers. Processing for these grades is a size reduction and cleaning process to remove contamination and prepare the material for the final stage of drying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basic Rubber Testing|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=VQVAHZyHyPAC|page=6}}|publisher=ASTM International|pages=6–|id=GGKEY:8BT2U3TQN7G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dried material is then baled and palletized for storage and shipment.

=== Vulcanized rubber ===

{{Main|Sulfur vulcanization}}
[[File:Torn latex rubber dry suit wrist seal P8180011.jpg|thumb|Torn latex rubber dry suit wrist seal]]
Natural rubber is often vulcanized, a process by which the rubber is heated and [[sulfur]], [[peroxide]] or [[bisphenol]] are added to improve resistance and [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and to prevent it from perishing. Before World War II, carbon black was often used as an additive to rubber to improve its strength, especially in vehicle tires.

=== Transportation ===
Natural rubber latex is shipped from factories in south-west Asia, South America, and West and Center Africa to destinations around the world. As the cost of natural rubber has risen significantly and rubber products are dense, the shipping methods offering the lowest cost per unit weight are preferred. Depending on destination, warehouse availability, and transportation conditions, some methods are preferred by certain buyers. In international trade, latex rubber is mostly shipped in 20-foot ocean containers. Inside the container, smaller containers are used to store the latex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090404081944/http://www.aalatex.com/content/comments.asp?id=193 Transportation of Natural Rubber] - Industry Source&lt;/ref&gt;

Uncured rubber is used for cements;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lgduDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=Uncured+rubber+is+used+for+cements#v=onepage&amp;q=Uncured%20rubber%20is%20used%20for%20cements&amp;f=false|title=Fundamentals of Materials Science for Technologists: Properties, Testing, and Laboratory Exercises, Second Edition|last=Horath|first=Larry|year=2017|publisher=Waveland Press|isbn=978-1478635185|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for adhesive, insulating, and friction tapes; and for crepe rubber used in insulating blankets and footwear. [[Vulcanization|Vulcanized rubber]] has many more applications. Resistance to abrasion makes softer kinds of rubber valuable for the treads of vehicle tires and conveyor belts, and makes hard rubber valuable for pump housings and piping used in the handling of abrasive sludge.

The flexibility of rubber is appealing in hoses, tires and rollers for devices ranging from domestic clothes wringers to printing presses; its elasticity makes it suitable for various kinds of shock absorbers and for specialized machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration. Its relative gas impermeability makes it useful in the manufacture of articles such as air hoses, balloons, balls and cushions. The resistance of rubber to water and to the action of most fluid chemicals has led to its use in rainwear, diving gear, and chemical and medicinal tubing, and as a lining for storage tanks, processing equipment and railroad tank cars. Because of their electrical resistance, soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves, shoes and blankets; hard rubber is used for articles such as telephone housings, parts for radio sets, meters and other electrical instruments. The coefficient of friction of rubber, which is high on dry surfaces and low on wet surfaces, leads to its use for power-transmission belting and for water-lubricated bearings in deep-well pumps. Indian rubber balls or [[lacrosse]] balls are made of rubber.

Around 25 million tonnes of rubber are produced each year, of which 30 percent is natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rma.org/about-rma/rubber-faqs|title=Rubber Faqs|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913145725/https://rma.org/about-rma/rubber-faqs|archivedate=13 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder is synthetic rubber derived from petrochemical sources. The top end of latex production results in latex products such as surgeons' gloves, condoms, balloons and other relatively high-value products. The mid-range which comes from the technically specified natural rubber materials ends up largely in tires but also in conveyor belts, marine products, windshield wipers and miscellaneous goods. Natural rubber offers good elasticity, while synthetic materials tend to offer better resistance to environmental factors such as oils, temperature, chemicals and ultraviolet light. "Cured rubber" is rubber that has been compounded and subjected to the vulcanisation process to create cross-links within the rubber matrix.

==Allergic reactions==
{{Main|Latex allergy}}

Some people have a serious [[latex allergy]], and exposure to natural latex rubber products such as [[latex glove]]s can cause [[anaphylactic shock]]. The [[antibody generator|antigenic proteins]] found in ''Hevea'' latex may be deliberately reduced (though not eliminated)&lt;ref name=510k&gt;{{cite web|title=Premarket Notification [510(k)] Submissions for Testing for Skin Sensitization To Chemicals In Natural Rubber Products|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm073793.pdf|publisher=FDA|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; through processing.

Latex from non-''[[Hevea]]'' sources, such as [[Guayule]], can be used without allergic reaction by persons with an allergy to ''Hevea'' latex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/consumerupdates/ucm048052.htm|title=New Type of Latex Glove Cleared|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some allergic reactions are not to the latex itself, but from residues of chemicals used to accelerate the cross-linking process. Although this may be confused with an allergy to latex, it is distinct from it, typically taking the form of [[Type IV hypersensitivity]] in the presence of traces of specific processing chemicals.&lt;ref name=510k /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Latex Allergy Association|title=Allergy Fact Sheet|url=http://www.latexallergyresources.org/allergy-fact-sheet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nature''', in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or [[universe]]. "Nature" can refer to the [[phenomenon|phenomena]] of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of [[science]]. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

The word ''nature'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''natura'', or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".&lt;ref name="etymonline-nature"&gt;{{OEtymD|nature|accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natura'' is a Latin translation of the Greek word ''[[physis]]'' (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.&lt;ref&gt;An account of the pre-Socratic use of the concept of φύσις may be found in Naddaf, Gerard (2006) ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press. The word φύσις, while first used in connection with a plant in Homer, occurs very early in Greek philosophy, and in several senses. Generally, these senses match rather well the current senses in which the English word ''nature'' is used, as confirmed by Guthrie, W.K.C. ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first known use of ''physis'' was by [[Homer]] in reference to the intrinsic qualities of a plant: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302–3 (ed. A.T. Murray). (The word is dealt with thoroughly in Liddell and Scott's ''[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/pollux Greek Lexicon]''.) For later but still very early Greek uses of the term, see earlier note.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nature as a whole, the physical [[universe]], is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage continued during the advent of modern [[scientific method]] in the last several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton's [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), for example, is translated "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", and reflects the then-current use of the words "[[natural philosophy]]", akin to "systematic study of nature"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The etymology of the word "physical" shows its use as a synonym for "natural" in about the mid-15th century: {{OEtymD|physical|accessdate=September 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and [[wildlife]]. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the [[Earth]]. It is often taken to mean the "[[natural environment]]" or [[wilderness]]—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human [[consciousness]] or a human [[mind]]. Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the [[Wikt:unnatural|unnatural]] or the [[supernatural]].

Earth is the only [[planet]] known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the [[solar system]], it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest [[terrestrial planet]] and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow [[temperate]] zones, and a wide [[equator]]ial tropical to [[subtropical]] region.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The [[Crust (geology)|outer surface]] is divided into several gradually migrating [[tectonic plate]]s. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and an iron-filled core that generates a [[magnetic field]]. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.

The [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = September 11, 2005|url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/09/050911103921.htm|title = Calculations favor reducing atmosphere for early Earth|work=[[Science Daily]]|accessdate = January 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions.

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology}}
Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the [[Earth]]. The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, [[structural geology|structure]], [[Physical property|physical properties]], dynamics, and [[History of the Earth|history]] of [[Earth materials]], and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major [[academic discipline]], and is also important for [[mining|mineral]] and [[petroleum geology|hydrocarbon]] extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of [[natural hazard]]s, some [[Geotechnical engineering]] fields, and understanding [[Paleoclimatology|past climates]] and environments.

====Geological evolution====
[[File:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Three types of geological [[plate tectonic]] boundaries.]]
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.

Rock units are first emplaced either by [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] onto the surface or intrude into the [[Country rock (geology)|overlying rock]]. Deposition can occur when [[sediment]]s settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [[lithification|lithify]] into [[sedimentary rock]], or when as [[volcanic rock|volcanic material]] such as [[volcanic ash]] or [[lava]] flows, blanket the surface. Igneous [[intrusion]]s such as [[batholith]]s, [[laccolith]]s, [[dike (geology)|dikes]], and [[sill (geology)|sills]], push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.

After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [[deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] and/or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [[extension (geology)|horizontal extension]], or side-to-side ([[strike-slip]]) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], and [[transform boundary|transform boundaries]], respectively, between [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]].

Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a [[supercontinent]]. Roughly 750&amp;nbsp;million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]] which broke apart about 540&amp;nbsp;million years ago, then finally [[Pangaea]], which broke apart about 180&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.B. |last=Murphy |author2=R.D.

During the [[Neoproterozoic]] era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in [[glacier]]s and ice sheets. This hypothesis has been termed the "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the [[Cambrian explosion]] in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.L. |last=Kirschvink |date=1992 |chapter=Late Proterozoic Low-Latitude Global Glaciation: The Snowball Earth |chapterurl=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~jkirschvink/pdfs/firstsnowball.pdf |title=The Proterozoic Biosphere |editor=J.W.

Several million years ago, a species of small African [[ape]] gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="Margulis1995" /&gt; The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further [[civilization]] allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. By comparison, the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], produced by the proliferation of [[algae]] during the [[Siderian]] period, required about 300&amp;nbsp;million years to culminate.

==Atmosphere, climate, and weather==
[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|[[Rayleigh scattering|Blue light is scattered more]] than other wavelengths by the gases in the [[atmosphere]], giving the Earth a blue [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] when seen from space]]
{{Main|Atmosphere of Earth|Climate|Weather}}
The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the [[Nature#Ecosystems|ecosystem]]. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[water vapor]], with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The [[ozone layer]] plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the [[troposphere|lower part of the atmosphere]], and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AJ4SnHbb-ZcC&amp;pg=PA42|title=Environmental Science: Problems, Connections and Solutions|last=Miller|first=G.|last2=Spoolman|first2=Scott|date=September 28, 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495383376}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater [[thermohaline circulation]] which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the [[polar region]]s much colder.
[[File:Lightnings sequence 2 animation-wcag.gif|thumb|left|[[Lightning]]]]
Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as [[tornado]]es or [[hurricane]]s and [[cyclone]]s, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.

Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to [[Climate change|influence the climate]], including ocean currents, surface [[albedo]], [[greenhouse gas]]es, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including [[ice age]]s.
[[File:Dszpics1.jpg|thumb|A tornado in central [[Oklahoma]]]]
The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially [[latitude]]. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the [[tropical climate]] at the equator to the [[polar climate]] in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the [[Earth]]'s [[axis of rotation|axis]] being [[axial tilt|tilted]] relative to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the [[sun]]. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the [[northern hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere|southern]] hemispheres experience opposite seasons.

Weather is a [[Chaos theory|chaotic system]] that is readily modified by small changes to the [[Natural environment|environment]], so accurate [[Meteorology|weather forecasting]] is limited to only a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=Harvey|last2=Davidson|first2=Noel|date=May 25, 2015|title=Trends in the skill of weather prediction at lead times of 1–14 days|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|volume=141|issue=692|pages=2726–36|via=Wiley|doi=10.1002/qj.2559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tropical Ocean Warming Drives Recent Northern Hemisphere Climate Change|publisher=Science Daily|date=April 6, 2001|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/04/010406073554.htm|accessdate=May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water on Earth==
[[File:44 - Iguazu - Décembre 2007.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Iguazu Falls]] on the border between [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]]]
{{Main|Water}}
'''Water''' is a [[chemical substance]] that is composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] and is vital for all known forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/background.html |title=Water for Life |publisher=Un.org |date=March 22, 2005 |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In typical usage, ''water'' refers only to its liquid form or [[States of matter|state]], but the substance also has a solid state, [[ice]], and a [[gas]]eous state, [[water vapor]], or [[steam]]. &lt;!--About 1.460 [[Tonne#Multiples|petatonnes]]&amp;nbsp;(Pt) (10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of water--&gt;Water covers 71% of the [[Earth]]'s surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo|title=World|work=CIA – World Fact Book|accessdate=December 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in [[aquifer]]s and 0.001% in the [[atmosphere|air]] as [[vapor]], clouds, and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070320034158/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html Water Vapor in the Climate System], Special Report, American Geophysical Union, December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080220070111/http://www.unep.org/dewa/assessments/ecosystems/water/vitalwater/ Vital Water]. [[UNEP]].&lt;/ref&gt; Oceans hold 97% of surface water, [[glacier]]s, and polar [[ice cap]]s 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.

===Oceans===
[[File:Ocean from Leblon.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the Atlantic Ocean from [[Leblon]], Rio de Janeiro.]]
{{Main|Ocean}}
An ocean is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/Ocean#Encyclopedia Ocean]". ''The Columbia Encyclopedia.'' 2002. New York: Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAoO"&gt;"[http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html Distribution of land and water on the planet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103749/http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}". [http://www.oceansatlas.com/ UN Atlas of the Oceans]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to [[oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spilhaus | first1 = Athelstan F | year = 1942 | title = Maps of the whole world ocean | url = | journal = Geographical Review | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 431–35 | doi=10.2307/210385| jstor = 210385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [[continent]]s, various [[archipelago]]s, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the [[Southern Ocean]], and the Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, [[Headlands and bays|gulfs]], [[bay]]s and other names. There are also [[salt lake]]s, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the [[Aral Sea]] and the [[Great Salt Lake]].

===Lakes===
[[File:Lake mapourika NZ.jpeg|thumb|[[Lake Mapourika]], New Zealand]]
{{Main|Lake}}
A lake (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]] (or [[physical feature]]), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]] (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/328083/lake

|title=Lake (physical feature)
|quote=[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not well established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Definition|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/lake|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of [[ethane]], most likely mixed with [[methane]]. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

====Ponds====
[[File:Mill Pond Sunset.jpg|thumb|The Westborough Reservoir (Mill Pond) in [[Westborough, Massachusetts]].]]
{{Main|Pond}}
A '''pond''' is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via [[current (stream)|current]] speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.

===Rivers===
[[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nile]] river in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]'s capital city]]
{{Main|River}}
A river is a natural [[watercourse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/river River {definition}] from Merriam-Webster. Accessed February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; usually [[freshwater]], flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is ''Burn'' in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm USGS – U.S. Geological Survey – FAQs], No. 17 What is the difference between mountain, hill, and [[Summit (topography)|peak]]; lake and pond; or river and [[stream|creek]]?&lt;/ref&gt; A river is part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater]] recharge, [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from [[glacier]]s).

===Streams===
[[File:Hawaii Creek.jpg|thumb|A rocky stream in [[Hawaii]]]]
{{Main|Stream}}
A stream is a flowing body of water with a [[Current (stream)|current]], confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s. In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide. Streams are important as conduits in the [[water cycle]], instruments in [[groundwater recharge]], and they serve as corridors for fish and [[wildlife]] migration. The biological [[habitat]] in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a [[riparian zone]]. Given the status of the ongoing [[Holocene extinction]], streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]]. The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology|fluvial geomorphology]], [[aquatic ecology]], [[Freshwater fish|fish biology]], [[riparian|riparian ecology]], and others.

Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: [[soil]], atmosphere, radiation from the [[sun]], water, and living organisms.
[[File:PenasBlancas, part of the Bosawas Reserve, Jinotega Department, Nicaragua.jpg|thumb|left|Peñas Blancas, part of the [[Bosawás Biosphere Reserve]]. Located northeast of the city of [[Jinotega]] in Northeastern Nicaragua.]]
Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [[living organism]]s interact with every other element in their local [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;Odum, EP (1971) ''Fundamentals of ecology'', 3rd edition, Saunders New York&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the [[food chain]], and exchange energy and [[matter]] between themselves as well as with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Organization of Life |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9d.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature [[dichotomy]] and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s5oRDUuMSIC&amp;pg=PA237|title=Biotechnology Fundamentals|last=Khan|first=Firdos Alam|date=2011-09-20|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1439820094|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A smaller unit of size is called a [[microecosystem]]. For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A ''macroecosystem'' might involve a whole [[ecoregion]], with its [[drainage basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey |first=Robert G. |date=April 2004 |title=Identifying Ecoregion Boundaries |journal=Environmental Management |volume=34 |pmid=15883869 |issue=Supplement 1 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1007/s00267-003-0163-6 |pages=S14–26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lleZy8MU?url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |archivedate=December 4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilderness===
[[File:Biogradska suma.jpg|thumb|[[Old-growth forest|Old growth]] [[European Beech]] forest in [[Biogradska Gora]] National Park, [[Montenegro]].]]
{{Main|Wilderness}}
'''Wilderness''' is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, [[:Category:national forests|national forests]], [[national park]]s, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], and solitude. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,&lt;ref name="Man p155-157"&gt;Botkin, Daniel B. (2000) ''No Man's Garden'', Island Press, pp. 155–57, {{ISBN|1559634650}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural [[ecosystem]] (the [[biosphere]]). They may also preserve historic [[genetics|genetic]] traits and that they provide [[habitat]] for wild [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in [[zoo]]s, [[arboretum]]s, or [[laboratory|laboratories]].

==Life==
{{Life timeline}}
[[File:Malards in Golden Gate Park.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Female mallard and ducklings – [[reproduction]] is essential for continuing life]]
{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}
Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2006 |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |title=Definition of Life |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=January 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208220940/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s.

Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made [[Artificial life|analogs of life]] may also be considered to be life.

The [[biosphere]] is the part of Earth's outer shell&amp;nbsp;– including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere&amp;nbsp;– within which life occurs, and which [[Biology|biotic]] processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest [[Geophysiology|geophysiological]] point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the [[lithosphere]] (rocks), [[hydrosphere]] (water), and [[atmosphere]] (air). The entire Earth contains over 75&amp;nbsp;billion tons (150 ''trillion'' pounds or about 6.8×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;The figure "about one-half of one percent" takes into account the following (See, e.g., {{cite book |last=Leckie |first=Stephen |date=1999 |chapter=How Meat-centred Eating Patterns Affect Food Security and the Environment |chapterurl=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=For hunger-proof cities: sustainable urban food systems |publisher=International Development Research Centre |location=Ottawa |isbn=978-0889368828 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113020336/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html }}, which takes global average weight as 60&amp;nbsp;kg.), the total human biomass is the average weight multiplied by the current human population of approximately 6.5&amp;nbsp;billion (see, ''e.g.'', {{cite web |title=World Population Information |url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/world.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}): Assuming 60–70&amp;nbsp;kg to be the average human mass (approximately 130–150&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]] on the average), an approximation of total global human mass of between 390&amp;nbsp;billion (390×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) and 455&amp;nbsp;billion kg (between 845&amp;nbsp;billion and 975&amp;nbsp;billion lb, or about 423&amp;nbsp;million–488&amp;nbsp;million [[short ton]]s). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg (75&amp;nbsp;billion short tons).

Once life had appeared, the process of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.

Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the [[fossil]] record retains evidence of many of these older species. Current fossil and [[DNA]] evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.&lt;ref name=Line/&gt;

However, some microorganisms are [[pathogenic]] and can post health risk to other organisms.

===Plants and animals===
{{Main|Plant|Animal}}
[[File:Diversity of plants image version 5.png|thumb|left|A selection of diverse [[plant species]]]]
[[File:Animal diversity.png|thumb|A selection of diverse [[animal species]]]]
Originally [[Aristotle]] divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' system, these became the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] [[Vegetabilia]] (later [[Plantae]]) and [[Animal]]ia. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the [[fungus|fungi]] and several groups of [[alga]]e were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=flora |url=http://webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=flora |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1998 |title=Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources |chapter=Glossary |chapterurl=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |publisher=Department of the Interior, Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |id=SuDocs No. I 19.202:ST 1/V.1-2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715060359/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some classifications use the term ''bacterial flora'' separately from ''plant flora''.

Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional [[flora]]s, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include ''fossil flora'', remnants&lt;br&gt; of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and [[terrain]].

Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as ''native flora'' and ''agricultural and garden flora'', the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated. Some types of "native flora" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.

Another category of plant has historically been carved out for ''weeds''. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among [[botanist]]s as a formal way to categorize "useless" plants, the informal use of the word "weeds" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as ''domestic'', ''farm animals'', ''wild animals'', ''pests'', etc. according to their relationship to human life.

Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and usually [[multicellular]] (although see [[Myxozoa]]), which separates them from bacteria, [[archaea]], and most [[protist]]s. They are [[heterotroph]]ic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and [[alga]]e. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and [[fungus|fungi]] by lacking [[cell wall]]s.

With a few exceptions—most notably the two [[Phylum|phyla]] consisting of [[sponge]]s and [[placozoa]]ns—animals have bodies that are differentiated into [[biological tissue|tissues]]. These include [[muscle]]s, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a [[nervous system]], which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of [[collagen]] and elastic [[glycoprotein]]s. This may be calcified to form structures like [[Animal shell|shells]], [[bone]]s, and [[spicule (sponge)|spicules]], a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.

==Human interrelationship==

Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and "made environments" is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.

The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human [[civilization]] remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feedback Loops in Global Climate Change Point to a Very Hot 21st Century|publisher=Science Daily|date=May 22, 2006|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/ESD-feedback-loops.html|accessdate=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, [[deforestation]], and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the [[extinction]] of many plants and animals.

Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities. The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|title=Natural Resources contribution to GDP|date=November 2014|website=World Development Indicators (WDI)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223080408/https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|archive-date=December 23, 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2012.html|title=GDP – Composition by Sector|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|work=[[The World Factbook]]|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. [[Agriculture#History|Agriculture]] was first adopted around the [[9th millennium BCE]]. Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.

Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nps.gov/plants/medicinal/plants.htm|title = Plant Conservation Alliance – Medicinal Plant Working Groups Green Medicine|publisher = US National Park Services |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Oosthoek|first = Jan|date = 1999|url = http://www.eh-resources.org/philosophy.html|title = Environmental History: Between Science &amp; Philosophy|publisher = Environmental History Resources|accessdate = December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and beauty===
[[File:504px-Pinguiculagrandiflora1web.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Pinguicula grandiflora]]'', commonly known as a [[Butterwort]]]]
Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called [[aesthetics]]. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |title=On the Beauty of Nature |publisher=The Wilderness Society |accessdate=September 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909220214/http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |archivedate=September 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of [[landscape art]] began in China during the [[Tang Dynasty art|Tang Dynasty]] (618–907). The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of [[Chinese painting]] and was a significant influence in Asian art.

Although natural wonders are celebrated in the [[Psalms]] and the [[Book of Job]], [[wilderness]] portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the [[Romantic movement]]. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [[William Wordsworth]]'s poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] BC Spaces for Nature. Accessed: May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This artistic movement also coincided with the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist movement]] in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word [[mimesis]], the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical [[Substantial form|forms]] and more generally by [[patterns in nature]]. As David Rothenburg writes, "The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Rothenberg, David |isbn=978-1608192168| date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|281}}

==Matter and energy==
[[File:Hydrogen Density Plots.png|thumb|The first few [[hydrogen atom]] [[Atomic orbital|electron orbitals]] shown as cross-sections with color-coded probability density]]
{{Main|Matter|Energy}}
Some fields of science see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand. For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be "[[physics]]"&amp;nbsp;– the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the study of nature.

Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the [[observable universe]]. The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent [[cold dark matter]] and 68.3 percent [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name="planck_overview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planck 2013 results. I.

The behavior of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined [[physical law]]s. These laws have been employed to produce [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty [[physical constant]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Taylor|first = Barry N.|date = 1971|url = http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/introduction.html|title = Introduction to the constants for nonexperts|publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate = January 7, 2007

{{Main|Outer space|Universe|Extraterrestrial life}}
Outer space, also simply called ''space'', refers to the relatively empty regions of the [[universe]] outside the [[atmosphere]]s of celestial bodies. ''Outer'' space is used to distinguish it from [[airspace]] (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the [[Solar System]] is called [[interplanetary space]], which passes over into [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]] at what is known as the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]].

Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s discovered to date by [[rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy]], [[cosmic microwave background radiation|blackbody radiation]] left over from the [[big bang]] and the origin of the universe, and [[cosmic ray]]s, which include [[ion]]ized [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and various [[subatomic particle]]s. There is also some gas, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[dust]], and small [[meteor]]s. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [[space debris|debris]] re-enters the atmosphere periodically.

Although the Earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet [[Mars]] possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Bibring, J |display-authors=etal|title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars Express data|journal = Science|volume = 312|issue = 5772|pages = 400–04|date = 2006|pmid = 16627738|doi = 10.1126/science.1122659|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..400B}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.
If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Tariq|last = Malik|date = March 8, 2005|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7129347/|title = Hunt for Mars life should go underground|publisher = Space.com via msnbc.msn.com |accessdate=September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it. But it has been conjectured that [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], the fourth-largest moon of [[Jupiter]], may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Turner, Scott |date = March 2, 1998|url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/news8.html|title = Detailed Images From Europa Point To Slush Below Surface|publisher = NASA |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomers have started to discover extrasolar [[Earth analog]]s – planets that lie in the [[habitable zone]] of space surrounding a [[star]], and therefore could possibly host life as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles Q.

He is regarded as one of the founders of modern [[ethology]], the study of animal behavior.

In 1951, he published ''The Study of Instinct'', an influential book on animal behaviour.
In the 1960s, he collaborated with filmmaker [[Hugh Falkus]] on a series of wildlife films, including ''The Riddle of the [[Rook (bird)|Rook]]'' (1972) and ''Signals for Survival'' (1969), which won the Italia prize in that year and the American blue ribbon in 1971.

== Education and early life ==
Born in [[The Hague]], Netherlands, he was one of five children of Dirk Cornelis Tinbergen and his wife Jeannette van Eek. His brother, [[Jan Tinbergen]], won the first [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1969/press.html | title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1969 | publisher=Nobelprize.org | year=1969 | accessdate=27 January 2014 | author=Lundberg, Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the only siblings to each win a Nobel Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/|title=Nobel Prize Facts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another brother, [[Luuk Tinbergen]] was also a noted biologist.

Tinbergen's interest in nature manifested itself when he was young. He studied [[biology]] at [[Leiden University]] and was a prisoner of war during [[World War II]]. Tinbergen's experience as a prisoner of the Nazis led to some friction with longtime intellectual collaborator [[Konrad Lorenz]], and it was several years before the two reconciled.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Nikolaas_Tinbergen.aspx | title=Encyclopedia.com Nikolaas Tinbergen | publisher=Encyclopedia.com | accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Tinbergen moved to England, where he taught at the [[University of Oxford]] and was a fellow first at [[Merton College, Oxford]] and later at [[Wolfson College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia.com"/&gt; Several of his graduate students went on to become prominent biologists including [[Richard Dawkins]],&lt;ref name=dawkinsphd/&gt; [[Marian Dawkins]],&lt;ref name=stamphd/&gt; [[Desmond Morris]],&lt;ref name=Beale/&gt; [[Iain Douglas-Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daston|first1=Lorraine|last2=Mitman|first2=Gregg|title=Thinking with Animals: New Perspectives on Anthropomorphism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CaX_7w_gZwsC&amp;pg=PT193|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-50377-8|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tony Sinclair (biologist)|Tony Sinclair]].&lt;ref name=serengeti&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinclair |first=Anthony |date=2012 |title=Serengeti Story: Life and Science in the World's Greatest Wildlife Region |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=33 |isbn=9780199645527 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and career==

=== The Study of Instinct ===
[[File:Tinbergen good figure wiki2.jpg|thumb|350px|Figure 1. Tinbergen's hierarchical model. Modified from ''The Study of Instinct'' (1951).]]

In 1951 Tinbergen's ''The Study of Instinct'' was published. Behavioural ecologists and evolutionary biologists still recognise the contribution this book offered the field of [[behavioural science]] studies. ''The Study of Instinct'' summarises Tinbergen's ideas on innate behavioural reactions in animals and the adaptiveness and evolutionary aspects of these behaviours. By behaviour, he means the total movements made by the intact animal; innate behaviour is that which is not changed by the learning process. The major question of the book is the role of internal and external stimuli in controlling the expression of behaviour.&lt;ref name="Hinde, R. A. 1956"&gt;Hinde, R. A. ''Ethological Models and the Concept of 'Drive'''. British Journal of the Philosophy of Science, 6, 321–331 (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, he was interested in explaining 'spontaneous' behaviours: those that occurred in their complete form the first time they were performed and that seemed resistant to the effects of learning.  He explains how behaviour can be considered a combination of these spontaneous behaviour patterns and as set series of reactions to particular stimuli. Behaviour is a reaction in that to a certain extent it is reliant on external stimuli, however it is also spontaneous since it is also dependent upon internal causal factors.&lt;ref name="Hinde, R. A. 1956"/&gt;

His model for how certain behavioural reactions are provoked was based on work by [[Konrad Lorenz]]. Lorenz postulated that for each instinctive act there is a specific energy which builds up in a reservoir in the brain.  In this model, Lorenz envisioned a reservoir with a spring valve at its base that an appropriate [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] could act on, much like a weight on a scale pan pulling against a spring and releasing the reservoir of energy, an action which would lead an animal to express the desired behaviour.&lt;ref name="Hinde, R. A. 1956"/&gt;

Tinbergen added complexity to this model, a model now known as Tinbergen's hierarchical model. He suggested that motivational impulses build up in nervous centres in the brain which are held in check by blocks. The blocks are removed by an innate releasing mechanism that allows the energy to flow to the next centre (each centre containing a block that needs to be removed) in a cascade until the behaviour is expressed. Tinbergen's model shows multiple levels of complexity and that related behaviours are grouped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Tinbergen, Nikolaas | year=1951 | title=The Study of Instinct | publisher=Oxford University Press | pages=nnn–mmm}}{{page needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is in his experiments with foraging [[honey bees]]. He showed that honey bees show curiosity for yellow and blue paper models of flowers, and suggested that these were visual stimuli causing the buildup of energy in one specific centre. However, the bees rarely landed on the model flowers unless the proper odour was also applied. In this case, the chemical stimuli of the odour allowed the next link in the chain to be released, encouraging the bee to land. The final step was for the bee to insert its mouthparts into the flower and initiate suckling. Tinbergen envisioned this as concluding the reaction set for honey bee feeding behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Tinbergen, Nikolaas | year=1951 | title=The Study of Instinct | publisher=Oxford University Press | pages=nnn–mmm}}{{page needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nobel Prize ===
In 1973 Tinbergen, along with [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Karl von Frisch]], were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] "for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/&lt;/ref&gt; The award recognised their studies on genetically programmed behaviour patterns, their origins, maturation and their elicitation by key stimuli. In his Nobel Lecture, Tinbergen addressed the somewhat unconventional decision of the Nobel Foundation to award the prize for Physiology or Medicine to three men who had until recently been regarded as "mere animal watchers". Tinbergen stated that their revival of the "watching and wondering" approach to studying behaviour could indeed contribute to the relief of human suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, N. Ethology and stress diseases. Physiology Or Medicine: 1971–1980 19711980, 113 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The studies performed by the trio on fish, insects and birds laid the foundation for further studies on the importance of specific experiences during critical periods of normal development, as well as the effects of abnormal psychosocial situations in mammals. At the time, these discoveries were stated to have caused "a breakthrough in the understanding of the mechanisms behind various symptoms of psychiatric disease, such as anguish, compulsive obsession, stereotypic behaviour and catatonic posture".&lt;ref&gt;Zetterström, R. The Nobel Prize for the introduction of ethology, or animal behaviour, as a new research field: possible implications for child development and behaviour: Nobel prizes of importance to Paediatrics. Acta Paediatrica 96, 1105–1108 (2007).

&lt;/ref&gt; Tinbergen’s contribution to these studies included the testing of the hypotheses of Lorenz/von Frisch by means of "comprehensive, careful, and ingenious experiments"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/presentation-speech.html |date=1973  |first=Börje |last=Cronholm |title=Award Ceremony Speech |publisher=Nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his work on supernormal stimuli. The work of Tinbergen during this time was also regarded as having possible implications for further research in child development and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Zetterström, R. The Nobel Prize for the introduction of ethology, or animal behaviour, as a new research field: possible implications for child development and behaviour: Nobel prizes of importance to Paediatrics. Acta Paediatrica 96, 1105–1108 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

He also caused some intrigue by dedicating a large part of his acceptance speech to [[F. Matthias Alexander|FM Alexander]], originator of the [[Alexander technique]], a method which investigates postural reflexes and responses in human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/tinbergen-lecture.pdf|title = Nikolaas Tinbergen Nobel Lecture Ethology and Stress Diseases|date = 12 December 1973|access-date = |publisher = NobelPrize.org|last = Tinbergen|first = Nikolaas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other awards and honours===
In 1950 Tinbergen became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00003350 |title=Niko Tinbergen (1907–1988) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1962|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1962]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; He was also awarded the Godman-Salvin Medal in 1969 by the British Ornithologists' Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bou.org.uk/about-the-bou/administration-and-people/medals-and-awards/|title=Medals and awards "  British Ornithologists' Union|publisher=bou.org.uk|access-date=27 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331172205/https://www.bou.org.uk/about-the-bou/administration-and-people/medals-and-awards/|archivedate=31 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973 received the Swammderdam Medal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gngh.uva.nl/onderscheidingen/swammerdam-medaille/swammerdam-medaille.html|title=Swammerdam medaille – GNGH – Universiteit van Amsterdam|last=Amsterdam|first=Universiteit van|website=gngh.uva.nl|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wilhelm Bölsche Medal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life of David Lack: Father of Evolutionary Ecology|last=Anderson|first=Ted|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=0199922659|location=Oxford|pages=185|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from the Genootschap ter bervordering van Natuur-, Genees- en Heelkunde of the University of Amsterdam and the Kosmos-Gesellschaft der Naturfreunde respectively).

=== Approach to animal behaviour ===
{{main article|Tinbergen's four questions}}

Tinbergen described four questions he believed should be asked of any animal behaviour,&lt;ref&gt;Diagram on [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nesse/Nesse-Tinbergen4Q.PDF The Four Areas of Biology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further Diagrams on [http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c720126/humanethologie/ws/medicus/block1/inhalt.html The Four Areas of Biology (Documents No. 5, 6 and 7 in English)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lorenz | first1 = K. | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1937.tb01401.x | title = Biologische Fragestellung in der Tierpsychologie | journal = Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume = 1 | pages = 24–32 | year = 1937}} (in English: Biological Questions in Animal Psychology).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tinbergen | first1 = N. | authorlink = Nikolaas Tinbergen| title = On aims and methods of Ethology | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1963.tb01161.x | journal = Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 410–433 | year = 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were:

# [[Causality|Causation]] (mechanism): what are the stimuli that elicit the response, and how has it been modified by recent [[learning]]? How do behaviour and psyche "function" on the molecular, physiological, neuro-ethological, cognitive and social level, and what do the relations between the levels look like? (compare: [[Nicolai Hartmann]]: "The laws about the levels of complexity")
# [[Developmental biology|Development]] ([[ontogeny]]): how does the behaviour change with age, and what early experiences are necessary for the behaviour to be shown? Which developmental steps (the ontogenesis follows an "inner plan") ''and'' which environmental factors play when / which role? (compare: [[Recapitulation theory]])
# Function ([[adaptation]]): how does the [[behaviour]] impact on the animal's chances of survival and reproduction?
# [[Evolution]] ([[phylogeny]]): how does the behaviour compare with similar behaviour in related [[species]], and how might it have arisen through the process of phylogeny? Why did structural associations (behaviour can be seen as a "time space structure") evolve in this manner and not otherwise?*

In [[ethology]] and [[sociobiology]], causation and ontogeny are summarised as the "proximate mechanisms", while [[adaptation (biology)|adaptation]] and [[phylogeny]] are the "ultimate mechanisms". They are still considered as the cornerstone of modern ethology, sociobiology and [[transdisciplinarity]] in Human Sciences.

=== Supernormal stimulus ===
A major body of Tinbergen's research focused on what he termed the [[supernormal stimulus]]. This was the concept that one could build an artificial object which was a stronger stimulus or releaser for an instinct than the object for which the instinct originally evolved.  He constructed plaster eggs to see which a bird preferred to sit on, finding that they would select those that were larger, had more defined markings, or more saturated colour—and a dayglo-bright one with black polka dots would be selected over the bird's own pale, dappled eggs.

Tinbergen found that territorial male [[three-spined stickleback]] (a small freshwater fish) would attack a wooden fish model more vigorously than a real male if its underside was redder. He constructed cardboard dummy butterflies with more defined markings that male butterflies would try to mate with in preference to real females. The superstimulus, by its exaggerations, clearly delineated what characteristics were eliciting the instinctual response.

Among the modern works calling attention to Tinbergen's classic work is [[Deirdre Barrett]]'s 2010 book, ''[[Supernormal Stimuli]]''.

=== Autism ===
Tinbergen applied his observational methods to the problems of [[autism spectrum|autistic]] children. He recommended a "[[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]]" in which parents hold their autistic children for long periods of time while attempting to establish eye contact, even when a child resists the embrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Tinbergen N, Tinbergen EA |title= Autistic Children: New Hope for a Cure |publisher= [[Routledge]] |year=1986 |edition= new |isbn=0-04-157011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his interpretations of autistic behaviour, and the holding therapy that he recommended, lacked scientific support&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bishop | first1 = D.

== Personal life ==
Tinbergen was a member of the advisory committee to the [[Anti-Concorde Project]]{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} and was also an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supernormal Stimuli: How Primal Urges Overran Their Evolutionary Purpose|year=2010|publisher=W.

Tinbergen married Elisabeth Rutten and they had five children. Later in life he suffered [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and feared he might, like his brother Luuk, commit suicide. He was treated by his friend, whose ideas he had greatly influenced, [[John Bowlby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Der Horst | first1 = F. C.

[[File:BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg|thumb|300px|Water covers about 71% of Earth's surface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo|title=The World Factbook|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''origin of water on Earth''', or the reason that there is clearly more liquid [[water]] on [[Earth]] than on the other [[terrestrial planet|rocky planets]] of the [[Solar System]], is not completely understood. There exist numerous more or less mutually compatible hypotheses as to how water may have accumulated on Earth's surface over [[history of Earth|the past 4.5 billion years]] in sufficient quantity to form [[ocean]]s.

==Possible sources==

===Extraplanetary sources===
[[Comet]]s, [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, or water-rich [[meteoroid]]s ([[protoplanet]]s) from the outer reaches of the [[asteroid belt]] colliding with Earth may have brought water to the world's oceans. [[Asteroid]]s&lt;ref name="SA-20180425"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Daly |first1=R.

S. et al. |title=Organic matter in extraterrestrial water-bearing salt crystals |url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/1/eaao3521 |date=10 January 2018 |journal=[[Science Advances]] |volume=4 |number=1, eaao3521 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.aao3521 |accessdate=11 January 2018 |bibcode=2018SciA....4O3521C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large-enough [[planetesimal]]s were heated by the decay of [[aluminium-26]]. This could cause water to rise to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2014-02-earth.html|title=How Earth was watered|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies suggest that water with similar deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio was already available at the time of Earth's formation, as evidenced in ancient [[eucrite]] meteorites originating from the asteroid Vesta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarafian|first=Adam R.|last2=Nielsen|first2=Sune G.|last3=Marschall|first3=Horst R.|last4=McCubbin|first4=Francis M.|last5=Monteleone|first5=Brian D.|date=2014-10-31|title=Early accretion of water in the inner solar system from a carbonaceous chondrite–like source|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/623|journal=Science|language=en|volume=346|issue=6209|pages=623–626|doi=10.1126/science.1256717|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25359971|bibcode=2014Sci...346..623S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That Earth's water originated purely from comets is implausible, since a result of measurements of the isotope ratios of [[deuterium]] to [[hydrogen-1|protium]] (D/H ratio) in the four comets [[Halley's Comet|Halley]], [[Comet Hyakutake|Hyakutake]], [[Comet Hale–Bopp|Hale–Bopp]], and [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]], by researchers such as [[David Jewitt]], is approximately double that of oceanic water. What is, however, unclear is whether these comets are representative of those from the [[Kuiper belt]]. According to Alessandro Morbidelli,&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Morbidelli et al. [[Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science]] 35, 2000, S. 1309–1329&lt;/ref&gt; the largest part of today's water comes from protoplanets formed in the outer asteroid belt that plunged towards Earth, as indicated by the D/H proportions in carbon-rich chondrites. The water in carbon-rich chondrites point to a similar D/H ratio as oceanic water. Nevertheless, mechanisms have been proposed&lt;ref&gt;H. Genda, M. Ikoma, Origin of the Ocean on the Earth: Early Evolution of Water D/H in a Hydrogen-rich Atmosphere. Accessible at https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.2025&lt;/ref&gt; to suggest that the D/H-ratio of oceanic water may have increased significantly throughout Earth's history. Such a proposal is consistent with the possibility that a significant amount of the water on Earth was already present during the planet's early evolution.

Recent measurements of the chemical composition of Moon rocks suggest that Earth was born with its water already present. Investigating lunar samples carried to Earth by the Apollo 15 and 17 missions found a deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio that matched the isotopic ratio in carbonaceous chondrites. The ratio is also similar to that found in water on Earth. The findings suggest a common source of water for both objects. This supports a theory that Jupiter temporarily migrated into the inner Solar System, destabilizing the orbits of water-rich carbonaceous chondrites. As a result, some of the bodies could have fallen inwards and become part of the raw material for making Earth and its neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowen|first=Ron|title=Common source for Earth and Moon water|journal=Nature|date=9 May 2013|url=https://www.nature.com/news/common-source-for-earth-and-moon-water-1.12963 |doi= 10.1038/nature.2013.12963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of water vapor out-gassing from Ceres provides related information on water-ice content of the asteroid belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herschel discovers water vapour around dwarf planet Ceres|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Herschel/Herschel_discovers_water_vapour_around_dwarf_planet_Ceres|work=European Space Agency|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water in the development of Earth==
{{Life timeline}}
{{See also|Planetary differentiation}}
A sizeable quantity of water would have been in the material that formed Earth.&lt;ref name="source_mrk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="source_mrk2"/&gt; Water molecules would have escaped Earth's gravity more easily when it was less [[mass]]ive during its formation. Hydrogen and helium are expected to leak from the atmosphere continually, but the lack of denser [[noble gas]]es in the modern atmosphere suggests that something disastrous happened to the early atmosphere.

Part of the young planet is theorized to have been disrupted by the [[giant impact hypothesis|impact which created the Moon]], which should have caused melting of one or two large areas. Present composition does not match complete melting and it is hard to melt and mix huge rock masses completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=446 |title=Solar System Exploration: Science &amp; Technology: Science Features: View Feature |publisher=Solarsystem.nasa.gov |date=2004-04-26 |accessdate=2009-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69kxiqRQz?url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=446 |archivedate=2012-08-08 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a fair fraction of material should have been vaporized by this impact, creating a rock-vapor atmosphere around the young planet. The rock vapor would have condensed within two thousand years, leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a heavy [[carbon dioxide]] atmosphere with hydrogen and [[water vapor]]. Liquid water oceans existed despite the surface temperature of {{Convert|230|C|}} because of the atmospheric pressure of the heavy CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere. As cooling continued, [[subduction]] and dissolving in ocean water removed most CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere but levels oscillated wildly as new surface and [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] cycles appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=N.

The [[Cool early Earth]] theory covers a range from about 4.4 Ga to 4.0 Ga.

In fact, recent studies of zircons (in the fall of 2008) found in Australian Hadean rock hold minerals that point to the existence of [[plate tectonics]] as early as 4 billion years ago. If this holds true, the previous beliefs about the [[Hadean|Hadean period]] are far from correct. That is, rather than a hot, molten surface and atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, Earth's surface would be very much like it is today. The action of plate tectonics traps vast amounts of carbon dioxide, thereby reducing [[greenhouse effect]]s, and leading to a much cooler surface temperature, and the formation of solid rock, and possibly even life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/science/02eart.html?8dpc |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=A New Picture of the Early Earth |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=2008-12-02 |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of organisms==
Some terrestrial water may have had a biochemical origin, during the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], via [[redox|redox reactions]] and [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans"&gt;{{citation|title=The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1470/903.full.pdf|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |date=29 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, [[C. B. van Niel|Cornelis van Niel]] discovered that sulfide-dependent chemoautotrophic bacteria ([[purple sulfur bacteria]]) fix carbon and synthesize water as a byproduct of a photosynthetic pathway using [[hydrogen sulfide]] and carbon dioxide:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Niel|first=C.B.|title=Photosynthesis of bacteria|journal=Arch. Mikrobiol.|date=1931|volume=3|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2S

Few modern organisms use this method of photosynthesis, making their water contribution negligible. But on the hydrogen-sulfide-rich and oxygen-poor early Earth, a small but significant portion of Earth's water may have been synthesized biochemically through this pathway.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The following [[outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to natural science:

'''[[Natural science]]''' &amp;ndash; a major branch of [[science]] that tries to explain, and predict, nature's phenomena based on [[empirical evidence]]. In natural science, [[hypothesis]] must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory.  Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into 2 main branches: [[life science]], and [[physical science]]. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences.

== What type of thing is natural science? ==

Natural science can be described as all of the following:

* Branch of [[Outline of science|science]] &amp;ndash; systematic enterprise that builds and organizes [[knowledge]] in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the [[universe]].&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Wilson |first1 = Edward O. |title = Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge |edition=1st |publisher = Vintage Books |location = New York, NY |year = 1998 |isbn = 0-679-45077-7 |pages=49–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heilbron&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by [[mathematics]]; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions."&amp;nbsp;—p.vii, [[J. L. Heilbron]], (2003, editor-in-chief). ''The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science''.

* [[List of academic disciplines and sub-disciplines#Natural sciences|Major category]] of [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]] &amp;ndash; an academic discipline is focused study in one academic field or profession. A discipline incorporates expertise, people, projects, communities, challenges, studies, inquiry, and research areas that are strongly associated with academic areas of study or areas of professional practice. For example, the branches of science are commonly referred to as the scientific disciplines. For instance, Gravitation is strongly associated with the discipline of physics, and is considered to be part of that disciplinary knowledge.

'''Physis''' (Greek: {{lang|grc|φύσις|italic=yes}} ''phusis'') is a Greek [[theology|theological]], [[philosophy|philosophical]], and [[science|scientific]] term usually translated into English as "[[nature (philosophy)|nature]]".

The term is central to [[Greek philosophy]], and as a consequence to [[Western philosophy]] as a whole.
In [[pre-Socratic]] usage, ''phusis'' contrasted with {{lang|grc|νόμος}} ''nomos'' "law, human convention"
Since  [[Aristotle]], however, the ''physical'' (the subject matter of ''[[physics]]'', properly  {{lang|grc|τὰ φυσικά}} "natural things") has more typically  been juxtaposed to the ''[[metaphysics|metaphysical]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in Aristotle's works so titled, ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' "Physis, translated since the Third Century B.C. usually as "nature" and less frequently as "essence", means one thing for the presocratic philosophers and quite another thing for Plato." Welch, Kathleen Ethel. "Keywords from Classical Rhetoric: The Example of Physis." Rhetoric Society Quarterly 17.2 (1987): 193-204. Print.
The Pontifical Academy of Sciences. ''Evolving Concepts of Nature''. Proceedings of the Plenary Session, 24–28 October 2014, Acta 23, Vatican City, 2015. [http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en/publications/acta/acta23.html link].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-socratic usage ==
The word φύσις is a verbal noun based on [[:wikt:φύω|φύω]] "to grow, to appear" ([[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/bʰuH-|cognate]] with English "to be"). In [[Homeric Greek]] it is used quite literally, of the manner of growth of a particular species of plant.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302-3:  {{lang|grc|ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε}}. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]''  (ed. A.T. Murray).&lt;/ref&gt;  

In [[pre-Socratic philosophers|pre-Socratic]] philosophy, beginning with [[Heraclitus]], ''phusis'' in keeping with its etymology of "growing, becoming" is always used in the sense of the "natural" ''development'', although the focus might lie either with the origin, or the process, or the end result of the process. There is some evidence that by the 6th century BC, beginning with the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School]], the word could also be used 
in the comprehensive sense, as referring to "''all'' things", as it were "Nature" in the sense of "[[Universe]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Naddaf, ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press, 2005, p. 3.
Guthrie, W. K. C., ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.{{page needed|date=December 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sophist]] tradition, the term stood in opposition to ''[[:wikt:nomos|nomos]]'' ({{lang|grc|νόμος}}), "[[law]]" or "[[convention (norm)|custom]]", in the debate on which parts of human existence are natural, and which are due to convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunkie |first1=Roger |title=The Classical Origins of Western Culture: The Core Studies 1 Study Guide |url=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/studygde.htm |accessdate=30 January 2012 |series=Brooklyn College Core Curriculum Series |date=1986 |publisher=[[Brooklyn College]] |location=[[Brooklyn, NY]]  |chapter=Philosophical background of the 5th Century B.C. |chapterurl=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/sophists.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The contrast of ''phisis'' vs. ''[[:wikt:nomos|nomos]]'' could be applied to any subject, much like the modern contrast of "[[nature vs. nurture]]".

== In Plato's Laws ==
In book 10 of ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', Plato criticizes those who write works ''peri phuseōs''. The criticism is that such authors tend to focus on a purely "naturalistic" explanation of the world, ignoring the role of "intention" or ''technē'', and thus becoming prone to the error of naive [[History_of_atheism#Classical_Greece_and_Rome|atheism]]. Plato accuses even [[Theogony|Hesiod]] of this, for the reason that the gods in Hesiod "grow" out of primordial entities after the physical universe had been established.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Naddaf, ''The Greek Concept of Nature'' (2005), 1f.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Because those who use the term mean to say that nature is the first creative power; but if the soul turns out to be the primeval element, and not fire or air, then in the truest sense and beyond other things the soul may be said to exist ''by'' nature; and this would be true if you proved that the soul is older than the body, but not otherwise."
::— Plato's Laws, Book 10(892c) – ''translation by Benjamin Jowett''

== Aristotle ==
Aristotle sought out the definition of "physis" to prove that there was more than one definition of "physis", and more than one way to interpret nature. "Though Aristotle retains the ancient sense of "physis" as growth, he insists that an adequate definition of "physis" requires the different perspectives of the [[four causes]] (aitia): material, efficient, formal, and final."&lt;ref name="Rhetoric Reclaimed"&gt;Atwill, Janet. "The Interstices of Nature, Spontaneity, and Chance." Rhetoric Reclaimed: Aristotle and the Liberal Arts Tradition. Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1998. N. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that nature itself contained its own source of matter (material), power/motion (efficiency), form, and end (final). A unique feature about Aristotle's definition of "physis" was his relationship between art and nature. Aristotle said that "physis" (nature) is dependent on [[techne]] (art). "The critical distinction between art and nature concerns their different efficient causes: nature is its own source of motion, whereas techne always requires a source of motion outside itself."&lt;ref name="Rhetoric Reclaimed" /&gt; What Aristotle was trying to bring to light, was that art does not contain within itself its form or source of motion. Consider the process of an acorn becoming an oak tree. This is a natural process that has its own driving force behind it. There is no external force pushing this acorn to its final state, rather it is progressively developing towards one specific end ([[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]).


==Biblical usage==
Though φύσις was often used in Hellenistic philosophy, it is used only 14 times in the New Testament (10 of those in the writings of Paul).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balz|first1=Horst Robert|title=Exegetical dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=[[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company]]|location=Michigan1994|isbn=9780802828033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its meaning varies throughout Paul's writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verbrugge|first1=Verlyn D.|title=New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology|date=2000|publisher=[[Zondervan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One usage refers to the established or natural order of things, as in ''Romans 2:14'' where Paul writes "For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by ''nature'' do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Romans|2:14|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danker|first1=Frederick W.|title=A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature|date=2014|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another use of φύσις in the sense of "natural order" is ''Romans 1:26'' where he writes "the men likewise gave up ''natural'' relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Romans|1:26-1:27|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danker|first1=Frederick W.|title=A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature|date=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''1 Corinthians 11:14'', Paul asks "Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|11:13|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balz|first1=Horst Robert|title=Exegetical dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|location=Michigan1994|isbn=9780802828033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of φύσις as referring to a "natural order" in ''Romans 1:26'' and ''1 Corinthians 11:14''  may have been influenced by [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Greek philosophers, including [[Aristotle]] and the Stoics are credited with distinguishing between man-made laws and a [[natural law]] of universal validity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World|date=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192801463.001.0001/acref-9780192801463-e-1250.|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Gerhard Kittel]] states that the Stoic philosophers were not able to combine the concepts of νόμος (law) and φύσις (nature) to produce the concept of "natural law" in the sense that was made possible by [[Judeo-Christian]] theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kittel|first1=Gerhard|title=Theological Dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=Eerdman's Publishing Company|location=Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline theology]] of [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] by [[Grace in Christianity|grace]], Paul writes in ''Ephesians 2:3'' that "we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by ''nature'' children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. In the next verse he writes, "by grace you have been saved." &lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Ephesians|2:3-2:4|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verbrugge|first1=Verlyn D.|title=New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology|date=2000|publisher=Zondervan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage in patristic theology ==
Theologians of the early Christian period differed in the usage of this term. In [[School of Antioch|Antiochene]] circles, it connoted the humanity or divinity of Christ conceived as a concrete set of characteristics or attributes. In [[Alexandrian School|Alexandrine]] thinking, it meant a concrete individual or independent existent and approximated to [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]] without being a synonym.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J.N.D. ''Early Christian Doctrines'' A&amp;C Black(1965) p.318&lt;/ref&gt;  While it refers to much the same thing as [[ousia]] it is more empirical and descriptive focussing on function while ousia is metaphysical and focuses more on reality.&lt;ref name="GiPT"&gt;Prestige, G.L. ''God in Patristic Thought'', SPCK (1964), p.234&lt;/ref&gt; Although found in the context of the [[Trinity|Trinitarian debate]], it is chiefly important in the [[Christology]] of [[Cyril of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="GiPT"/&gt;

== Modern usage ==
The Greek adjective ''phusikos'' is represented  in various forms in modern English:
As ''[[physics]]'' "the study of nature", as ''[[:wikt:physical|physical]]'' (via Middle Latin ''physicalis'') referring both to physics (the study of nature, the material universe) and to the [[human body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=physical |title=Physical |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessdate=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[physiology]] (''physiologia'') is of 16th-century coinage ([[Jean Fernel]]). The term ''physique'', for "the bodily constitution of a person", is a 19th-century loan from French. 

In medicine the suffix ''-physis'' occurs in such compounds as ''[[symphysis]]'', ''[[epiphysis]]'', and a few others, in the sense of "a growth". The physis also refers to the "[[Epiphyseal plate|growth plate]]", or site of growth at the end of long bones.

{{Paranormal}}
The '''''preternatural''''' or '''''praeternatural''''' is that which appears outside or beside (Latin ''[[:Wikt:preter-|præter]]'') the [[nature|natural]]. It is "suspended between the mundane and the miraculous".&lt;ref&gt;Allchin, Douglas, "Monsters &amp; Marvels: How Do We Interpret the "Preternatural"?", ''The American Biology Teacher'', November 2007. p.565.&lt;/ref&gt;

In theology, the term is often used to distinguish marvels or deceptive trickery, often attributed to [[witchcraft]] or [[demon]]s, from the purely [[divinity|divine]] power of the genuinely supernatural to violate the laws of nature. In the [[early modern period]] the term was used by scientists to refer to abnormalities and strange phenomena of various kinds that seemed to depart from the norms of nature.

==Theology==
Medieval theologians made a clear distinction between the natural, the preternatural and the supernatural. [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that the supernatural consists in "God’s unmediated actions"; the natural is "what happens always or most of the time"; and the preternatural is "what happens rarely, but nonetheless by the agency of created beings...Marvels belong, properly speaking, to the realm of the preternatural."&lt;ref&gt;Israel Burshatin, "Elena Alias Elewno: Genders, sexualities, and 'race' in the mirror of natural history in sixteenth-century Spain" in Sabrina Petra Ramet, ''Gender Reversals and Gender Cultures: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives'', Routledge, New York, 1996, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians, following Aquinas, argued that only God had the power to disregard the laws of nature that he has created, but that demons could manipulate the laws of nature by a form of trickery, to deceive the unwary into believing they had experienced real miracles. According to historian Lorraine Daston,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although demons, astral intelligences, and other spirits might manipulate natural causes with superhuman dexterity and thereby work marvels, as mere creatures they could never transcend from the preternatural to the supernatural and work genuine miracles.&lt;ref name = "Lor"&gt;Lorraine Daston, "Marvelous Facts and Miraculous Evidence in Early Modern Europe", Peter G. Platt, ''Wonders, Marvels, and Monsters in Early Modern Culture'', University of Delaware Press, Newark, 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;76–105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the 16th century, the term "preternatural" was increasingly used to refer to demonic activity comparable to the use of magic by human adepts: The Devil, "being a natural Magician … may perform many acts in ways above our knowledge, though not transcending our natural power."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; According to the philosophy of the time, preternatural phenomena were not contrary to divine law, but used hidden, or [[occult]] powers that violated the ''normal'' pattern of natural phenomena.&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt;

==Science==
With the emergence of early modern science, the concept of the preternatural increasingly came to be used to refer to strange or abnormal phenomena that seemed to violate the normal working of nature, but which were not associated with magic and witchcraft. This was a development of the idea that preternatural phenomena were fake miracles. As Daston puts it, "To simplify the historical sequence somewhat: first, preternatural phenomena were demonized and thereby incidentally naturalized; then the demons were deleted, leaving only the natural causes."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; The use of the term was especially common in medicine, for example in John Brown's ''A Compleat Treatise of Preternatural Tumours'' (1678), or [[William Smellie (obstetrician)|William Smellie]]'s ''A Collection of Preternatural Cases and Observations in Midwifery'' (1754).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel J. Rogal, ''Medicine in Great Britain from the Restoration to the Nineteenth Century, 1660–1800: An Annotated Bibliography'', Greenwood Press, New York, 1992, p.203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century the term was appropriated in anthropology to refer to folk beliefs about fairies, trolls and other such creatures which were not thought of as demonic, but which were perceived to affect the natural world in unpredictable ways. According to [[Thorstein Veblen]], such preternatural agents were often thought of as forces somewhere between supernatural beings and material processes. "The preternatural agency is not necessarily conceived to be a personal agent in the full sense, but it is an agency which partakes of the attributes of personality to the extent of somewhat arbitrarily influencing the outcome of any enterprise, and especially of any contest."&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, T., ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions'', Macmillan, New York, 1915, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguistic association between individual agents and unexplained or unfortunate circumstances remains. Many people attribute occurrences that are known to be material processes, such as "gremlins in the engine", a "ghost in the machine", or [[pathetic fallacy|attributing motives to objects]]: "the clouds are threatening". The anthropomorphism in our daily life is a combination of the above cultural stems, as well as the manifestation of our pattern-projecting minds.{{or|date=June 2015}}

==Scholarship==
In 2011, Penn State Press began publishing a learned journal entitled ''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural''. Edited by Kirsten Uszkalo and Richard Raiswell, the journal is dedicated to publishing articles, reviews and short editions of original texts that deal with conceptions and perceptions of the preternatural in any culture and in any historical period. The journal covers "magics, witchcraft, spiritualism, occultism, prophecy, monstrophy, demonology, and folklore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psupress.org/journals/jnls_Preternature.html |title=''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural'' |publisher=Penn State University Press |access-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scandiobabingtonite''' was first discovered in the Montecatini granite quarry near [[Baveno]], Italy in a [[pegmatite]] cavity. Though found in pegmatites, the crystals of scandiobabingtonite are sub-millimeter sized, and are tabular shaped. Scandiobabingtonite was the sixth naturally occurring mineral discovered with the rare earth element [[scandium]], and grows around [[babingtonite]], with which it is [[isostructural]], hence the namesake. It is also referred to as scandian babingtonite. The ideal chemical formula for scandiobabingtonite is Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;,Mn)ScSi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(OH).&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

==Occurrence==
Scandiobabingtonite is found in association with [[orthoclase]], [[quartz]], light blue [[albite]], [[stilbite]], [[fluorite]], and [[mica]]. When found with these minerals, the scandiobabingtonite crystals are emplanted on the surface of the other minerals. It also occurs as growth around green-black prismatic crystals of babingtonite. The samples of scandiobabingtonite that have been discovered have shown that they start out growing from a seed of babingtonite crystal. This is how scandiobabingtonite gets its chemical structure. The starting seed of babingtonite is still present in the center of the resulting crystal and can be detected with optical and chemical studies.&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt; Scandiobabingtonite is a uniquely rare mineral, as it occurs in very small amounts in few locations around the world.&lt;ref name=mindat /&gt; It is one of thirteen naturally occurring minerals where scandium is a dominant member. The other scandium minerals are [[bazzite]], [[cascandite]], [[hetftetjernite]], [[jervisite]], [[juonniite]], [[kolbeckite]], [[kristiansenite]], [[magbasite]], [[oftedalite]], [[pretulite]], [[thortveitite]], and [[titanowodginite]].&lt;ref name=scandium /&gt;&lt;ref name=webmineral&gt;webmineral.com, 2015, Mineral species Containing Scandium (Sc): http://webmineral.com/chem/Chem-Sc.shtml#.VmCC6s6przL (accessed December 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Scandium can also concentrate in other minerals, such as in [[Mafic|ferromagnesian]] minerals, [[aluminum phosphate]] minerals, [[meteor]]ic minerals, and other minerals containing rare earth elements, but it occurs in trace amounts.&lt;ref name=handbook /&gt;

==Physical properties==
Scandiobabingtonite is a colorless or lightly gray-green colored transparent mineral with a glassy or [[Lustre (mineralogy)#Vitreous lustre|vitreous luster]]. It exhibits a hardness of 6 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness scale]]. Scandiobabingtonite occurs as short, prismatic crystals that are slightly elongated on the [001] [[Miller index|axis]] which gives it a tabular or platy shape. Its crystals are characterized by the {010}, {001}, {110}, {1-10}, and {101} [[Miller Index|faces]].  Scandiobabingtonite is brittle and shows perfect cleavage along the {001} and {1-10} planes. The measured density is 3.24 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

==Optical properties==
Scandiobabingtonite is [[optic axis of a crystal|biaxial positive]], which means it will refract light along two axes. It exhibits a 2V&lt;sub&gt;(measured)&lt;/sub&gt;=64(2)°, strong dispersion with r&gt;v, and displays strong [[pleochroism]] with colors ranging from pink (γ') to green(α'). The extinction angle along the (110) is 6°. Z:Φ=-250°, ρ=47°; Y:Φ=146°, ρ=75°; X:Φ=42°, ρ=47°.&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

==Chemical properties==
Scandiobabingtonite is [[isostructural]] with babingtonite, and has the same chemical properties as well. It is an [[inosilicate]] with 5-periodic single chains.&lt;ref name=mindat /&gt; Scandium replaces the [[Iron|Fe]]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in babingtonite in six-fold coordination. The empirical chemical formula for scandiobabingtonite is (Ca&lt;sub&gt;1.71&lt;/sub&gt;,Na&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;Σ0.97&lt;/sub&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0.65&lt;/sub&gt;,Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.32&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;Σ0.97&lt;/sub&gt;(Sc&lt;sub&gt;0.91&lt;/sub&gt;,Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;,Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0.03&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;Σ0.98&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;5.09&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;14.00&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;1.00&lt;/sub&gt;. Simplified, the formula is Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;,Mn)ScSi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

==X-ray crystallography==
Scandiobabingtonite is in the triclinic crystal system, with space group P1. The unit cell dimensions are a=7.536(2) Å, b=11.734(2) Å, c=6.748(2) Å, α=91.70(2)°, β=93.86(2)°, γ=104.53(2)°. These dimensions are almost identical to those of babingtonite. The difference in dimensions is caused by the replacement of iron with scandium in the Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-centered octahedra. The Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-O distance measures as 2.048 Å, while the Sc-O distance is 2.092 Å. This equates to a slightly larger octahedra in scandiobabingtonite than babingtonite.&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

'''Spaceship Earth''' or '''Spacecraft Earth''' is a [[world view]] encouraging everyone on [[Earth]] to act as a harmonious crew working toward the greater good.

The earliest known use&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalen|first1=San|title=ECOLOGY COMES OF AGE: NEPA'S LOST MANDATE|journal=DUKE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW &amp; POLICY FORUM|date=2010|volume=21:113|issue=Fall|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&amp;context=delpf|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a passage in [[Henry George]]'s best known work, ''[[Progress and Poverty]]''&lt;ref&gt;The text on wikisource differs from versions available [http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPP20.html#Book%20IV,%20Chapter%202 here] and [http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp042.html here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050909042705/http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp042.html |date=2005-09-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; (1879).
From book IV, chapter 2: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a well-provisioned ship, this on which we sail through space. If the bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but open a hatch and there is a new supply, of which before we never dreamed. And very great command over the services of others comes to those who as the hatches are opened are permitted to say, "This is mine!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[George Orwell]] later paraphrases Henry George in ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The world is a raft sailing through space with, potentially, plenty of provisions for everybody; the idea that we must all cooperate and see to it that everyone does his fair share of the work and gets his fair share of the provisions seems so blatantly obvious that one would say that no one could possibly fail to accept it unless he had some corrupt motive for clinging to the present system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1965 [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] made a famous speech to the UN in which he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil; all committed for our safety to its security and peace; preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work, and, I will say, the love we give our fragile craft. We cannot maintain it half fortunate, half miserable, half confident, half despairing, half slave—to the ancient enemies of man—half free in a liberation of resources undreamed of until this day. No craft, no crew can travel safely with such vast contradictions. On their resolution depends the survival of us all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/73/477.html Speech to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, Geneva, Switzerland, July 9, 1965]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following year, ''Spaceship Earth'' became the title of a book by a friend of Stevenson's, the internationally influential economist [[Barbara Ward]].

Also in 1966, [[Kenneth E. Boulding]], who was influenced by reading [[Henry George]],&lt;ref&gt;King, J. E. "Economic Exiles". Palgrave Macmillan, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; used the phrase in the title of an essay, ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dieoff.org/page160.htm|title=The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth|first=Kenneth E.|last=Boulding|authorlink=Kenneth E. Boulding|date=1966|accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boulding described the past open [[economy]] of apparently illimitable resources, which he said he was tempted to call the "cowboy economy", and continued: "The closed economy of the future might similarly be called the 'spaceman' economy, in which the earth has become a single spaceship, without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution, and in which, therefore, man must find his place in a cyclical ecological system".
([[David Korten]] would take up the "cowboys in a spaceship" theme in his 1995 book ''[[When Corporations Rule the World]]''.)

The phrase was also popularized by [[Buckminster Fuller]], who published a book in 1968 under the title of ''[[Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Buckminster|last=Fuller|authorlink=Buckminster Fuller|publisher=E.P. Dutton &amp; Co.|location=New York|date=1963|isbn=0-525-47433-1|url=http://www.bfi.org/about-bucky/resources/books/operating-manual-spaceship-earth|title=Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717141812/http://bfi.org/about-bucky/resources/books/operating-manual-spaceship-earth|archivedate=2010-07-17|df=}}  The quotation is from [http://www.bfi.org/about-bucky/resources/books/operating-manual-spaceship-earth/chapter-8-regenerative-landscape Section 8: The regenerative landscape] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823122401/http://www.bfi.org/about-bucky/resources/books/operating-manual-spaceship-earth/chapter-8-regenerative-landscape |date=2010-08-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This quotation, referring to [[fossil fuel]]s, reflects his approach: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;…we can make all of humanity successful through science's world-engulfing industrial evolution provided that we are not so foolish as to continue to exhaust in a split second of astronomical history the orderly energy savings of billions of years' energy conservation aboard our Spaceship Earth.  These energy savings have been put into our Spaceship's life-regeneration-guaranteeing bank account for use only in self-starter functions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[United Nations]] [[Secretary-General]] [[U Thant]] spoke of Spaceship Earth on [[Earth Day]] March 21, 1971 at the ceremony of the ringing of the [[Japanese Peace Bell]]: "May there only be peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful Spaceship Earth as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wowzone.com/mc-lee.htm|title=Earth Day: Past, Present, Future|first=Lee|last=Lawrence|author2=John McConnell |date=July 3, 1999|publisher=Wish Only Well|accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spaceship Earth 2.jpg|thumb|Epcot's Spaceship Earth]]

Spaceship Earth is the name given to the 50&amp;nbsp;m diameter [[geodesic dome|geodesic sphere]] that greets visitors at the entrance of [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Epcot]] theme park. Housed within the sphere is [[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|a dark ride]] that serves to explore the history of [[communications]] and promote Epcot's founding principles, "[a] belief and pride in man's ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Korkis|first1=Jim|title=WDW Chronicles: 1982 Opening of Epcot Center|website=http://allears.net/ae/issue678.htm|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous incarnation of the ride, narrated by actor [[Jeremy Irons]] and revised in 2008, was explicit in its message:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like a grand and miraculous spaceship, our planet has sailed through the universe of time, and for a brief moment, we have been among its many passengers….We now have the ability and the responsibility to build new bridges of acceptance and co-operation between us, to create a better world for ourselves and our children as we continue our amazing journey aboard Spaceship Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irons|first1=Jeremy|title=SE Script - Irons Version|website=http://www.intercot.com/edc/SpaceshipEarth/spscript.html|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Deutsch]] has pointed out that the picture of Earth as a friendly "spaceship" habitat is difficult to defend even in metaphorical sense. The Earth environment is harsh and survival is constant struggle for life, including whole species [[extinction]]. Humans wouldn't be able to live in most of the areas where they are living now without knowledge necessary to build life-support systems such as houses, heating, water supply, etc.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-14-196969-5 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |author=David Deutsch |author-link=David Deutsch |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Spaceship Earth" is frequently used on the labels of [[Emanuel Bronner]]'s products to refer to the Earth.

The '''Stark effect''' is the shifting and splitting of [[spectral line]]s of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external [[electric field]]. It is the electric-field analogue of the [[Zeeman effect]], where a spectral line is split into several components due to the presence of the [[magnetic field]]. Although initially coined for the static case, it is also used in the wider context to describe effect of time-dependent electric fields. In particular, the Stark effect is responsible for the [[Spectral_line#Pressure_broadening|pressure broadening]] (Stark broadening) of spectral lines by charged particles in [[Plasma_(physics)|plasma]]s. For majority of spectral lines, the Stark effect is either linear (proportional to the applied electric field) or quadratic with a high accuracy.

The Stark effect can be observed both for emission and absorption lines. The latter is sometimes called the '''inverse Stark effect''', but this term is no longer used in the modern literature.

Note that energy levels cannot cross due to the ionic core (and resulting quantum defect) breaking symmetries of dynamical motion.&lt;ref name=Courtney1995 /&gt;]]

==History==
The effect is named after the German physicist [[Johannes Stark]], who discovered it in 1913. It was independently discovered in the same year by the Italian physicist [[Antonino Lo Surdo]], and in Italy it is thus sometimes called the '''Stark–Lo Surdo effect'''. The discovery of this effect contributed importantly to the development of quantum theory and was rewarded with the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for [[Johannes Stark]] in the year 1919.

Inspired by the magnetic [[Zeeman effect]], and especially by Lorentz's explanation of it, [[Woldemar Voigt]]&lt;ref&gt;W. Voigt, ''Ueber das Elektrische Analogon des Zeemaneffectes'' (On the electric analogue of the Zeeman effect), Annalen der Physik,  vol. '''309''',
pp. 197–208 (1901).&lt;/ref&gt; performed classical mechanical calculations of quasi-elastically bound electrons in an electric field. By using experimental indices of refraction he gave an estimate of the Stark splittings. This estimate was a few orders of magnitude too low. Not deterred by this prediction, Stark&lt;ref&gt;J. Stark, ''Beobachtungen über den Effekt des elektrischen Feldes auf Spektrallinien I. Quereffekt'' (Observations of the effect of the electric field on spectral lines I. Transverse effect), Annalen der Physik,  vol. '''43''', pp. 965–983 (1914). Published earlier (1913) in Sitzungsberichten der Kgl. Preuss. Akad. d. Wiss.&lt;/ref&gt; undertook measurements on excited states of the hydrogen atom and succeeded in observing splittings.

By the use of the Bohr–Sommerfeld ("old") quantum theory, [[Paul Sophus Epstein|Paul Epstein]]&lt;ref&gt;P. S. Epstein, ''Zur Theorie des Starkeffektes'', Annalen der Physik, vol.

April 1916, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; were independently able to derive equations for the linear and quadratic Stark effect in [[hydrogen]]. Four years later, [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers|Hendrik Kramers]]&lt;ref&gt;H. A. Kramers, Roy. Danish Academy, ''Intensities of Spectral Lines. On the Application of the Quantum Theory to the Problem of Relative Intensities of the Components of the Fine Structure and of the Stark Effect of the Lines of the Hydrogen Spectrum'', p. 287 (1919);''Über den Einfluß eines elektrischen Feldes auf die Feinstruktur der Wasserstofflinien'' (On the influence of an electric field on the fine structure of hydrogen lines), Zeitschrift für Physik, vol. '''3''', pp. 199–223  (1920)&lt;/ref&gt; derived formulas for intensities of spectral transitions. Kramers also included the effect of [[fine structure]], which includes corrections for relativistic kinetic energy and coupling between electron spin and orbital motion. The first quantum mechanical treatment (in the framework of Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]]) was by Wolfgang Pauli.&lt;ref&gt;W. Pauli, ''Über dass Wasserstoffspektrum vom Standpunkt der neuen Quantenmechanik'' (On the hydrogen spectrum from the point of view of the new quantum mechanics). Zeitschrift für Physik, vol. '''36''' p. 336 (1926)&lt;/ref&gt; Erwin Schrödinger discussed at length the Stark effect in his  third paper&lt;ref&gt;E. Schrödinger, ''Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem'', Annalen der Physik, vol. '''385''' Issue 13, 437–490 (1926)&lt;/ref&gt; on quantum theory (in which he introduced his perturbation theory), once in the manner of the 1916 work of Epstein (but generalized from the old to the new quantum theory) and once by his (first-order) perturbation approach.
Finally, Epstein&lt;ref&gt;P. S. Epstein, ''The Stark Effect from the Point of View of Schroedinger's Quantum Theory'', Physical Review, vol '''28''', pp. 695–710 (1926)&lt;/ref&gt; reconsidered the linear and quadratic Stark effect from the point of view of the new quantum theory. He derived equations for the line intensities which were a decided improvement over Kramers' results obtained by the old quantum theory.

While first-order perturbation effects for the Stark effect in hydrogen are in agreement for the Bohr–Sommerfeld  model and the [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] theory of the atom, higher-order effects are not.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Measurements of the Stark effect under high field strengths confirmed the correctness of the quantum theory over the Bohr model.

== Mechanism ==

===Overview===
An electric field pointing from left to right, for example, tends to pull nuclei to the right and electrons to the left. In another way of viewing it, if an electronic state has its electron disproportionately to the left, its energy is lowered, while if it has the electron disproportionately to the right, its energy is raised.

Other things being equal, the effect of the electric field is greater for outer [[electron shell]]s, because the electron is more distant from the nucleus, so it travels farther left and farther right.

The Stark effect can lead to splitting of [[degenerate energy level]]s. For example, in the [[Bohr model]], an electron has the same energy whether it is in the [[electron shell|2s]] state or any of the [[electron shell|2p]] states. However, in an electric field, there will be [[Orbital hybridisation|hybrid orbitals]] (also called [[quantum superposition]]s) of the 2s and 2p states where the electron tends to be to the left, which will acquire a lower energy, and other hybrid orbitals where the electron tends to be to the right, which will acquire a higher energy. Therefore, the formerly degenerate energy levels will split into slightly lower and slightly higher energy levels.

===Classical electrostatics===
The Stark effect originates from the interaction between a charge distribution (atom or molecule) and an external [[electric field]].  Before turning to quantum mechanics we describe the interaction
classically and consider a continuous charge distribution ρ('''r''').
If this charge distribution  is non-polarizable its interaction energy with an external [[Electrostatic#Electrostatic potential|electrostatic potential]] ''V''('''r''') is 
:&lt;math&gt; E_{\mathrm{int}} = \int \rho(\mathbf{r}) V(\mathbf{r}) d\mathbf{r}^3&lt;/math&gt;.
If the electric field is of macroscopic origin and the charge distribution is microscopic, it is reasonable to assume that the electric field is uniform over the charge distribution. That is, ''V'' is given by a two-term [[Taylor expansion]],
:&lt;math&gt;
V(\mathbf{r}) = V(\mathbf{0}) - \sum_{i=1}^3 r_i F_i &lt;/math&gt;, with the electric field: &lt;math&gt;F_i \equiv  -\left. \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial r_i} \right)\right|_{\mathbf{0}}&lt;/math&gt;,
where we took the origin '''0''' somewhere within ρ.
Setting ''V''(0) as the zero energy, the interaction becomes
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{int}} = - \sum_{i=1}^3 F_i  \int \rho(\mathbf{r}) r_i d\mathbf{r} \equiv
- \sum_{i=1}^3 F_i  \mu_i = - \mathbf{F}\cdot \boldsymbol{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;.
Here we have introduced the [[dipole|dipole moment]]  '''μ''' of ρ as an integral over the charge distribution. In case ρ consists of ''N'' point charges ''q''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; this definition becomes a sum
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu} \equiv \sum_{j=1}^N  q_j \mathbf{r}_j&lt;/math&gt;.

===Perturbation theory===
Electric-field perturbation applied to a classical hydrogen atom produces a distortion of the electron orbit in a direction perpendicular to the applied field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solem|first=J. C.|year=1987|title=The strange polarization of the classical atom|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=55|issue=10|pages=906–909|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp/55/10/10.1119/1.14951|bibcode = 1987AmJPh..55..906S |doi = 10.1119/1.14951 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Anchor|perpendicular2016-01-29}}This effect can be shown without perturbation theory using the relation between the angular momentum and the [[Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biedenharn|first=L.

C.|year=1989|title=Reconciling the ‘strange’ and ‘ordinary’ polarizations of the classical atom|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=57|issue=3|pages=278–279|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp/57/3/10.1119/1.16055|bibcode = 1989AmJPh..57..278S |doi = 10.1119/1.16055 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transverse distortion is not mentioned in most textbooks.  This approach can also lead to an ''exactly solvable'' approximate model Hamiltonian for an atom in a strong oscillatory field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biedenharn|first=L. C.|last2=Rinker|first2=G. A.|last3=Solem|first3=J.

C.|year=1997|title=Variations on the Kepler problem|journal=Foundations of Physics|volume=27|issue=9|pages=1291–1306|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02551529|bibcode = 1997FoPh...27.1291S |doi = 10.1007/BF02551529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turning now to quantum mechanics an atom or a molecule can be thought of as a collection of point charges (electrons and nuclei), so that the second definition of the dipole applies. The interaction of atom or molecule with a uniform external field is described by the operator
:&lt;math&gt; V_{\mathrm{int}} = - \mathbf{F}\cdot \boldsymbol{\mu}.
&lt;/math&gt;
This operator is used as a perturbation in first- and second-order [[perturbation theory]] to account for the first- and second-order Stark effect.

====First order====
Let the unperturbed atom or molecule be in a ''g''-fold degenerate state with orthonormal zeroth-order state functions &lt;math&gt; \psi^0_1, \ldots, \psi^0_g &lt;/math&gt;. (Non-degeneracy is the special case ''g'' = 1). According to perturbation theory the first-order energies are the eigenvalues of the ''g'' x ''g''  matrix with general element 
:&lt;math&gt;
(\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{int}})_{kl} = \langle \psi^0_k |  V_{\mathrm{int}} | \psi^0_l \rangle =
-\mathbf{F}\cdot \langle \psi^0_k | \boldsymbol{\mu} | \psi^0_l \rangle,
\qquad k,l=1,\ldots, g.
&lt;/math&gt;
If ''g'' = 1 (as is often the case for electronic states of molecules)  the first-order energy becomes proportional to the expectation (average) value of the dipole operator &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
E^{(1)} = -\mathbf{F}\cdot \langle \psi^0_1 | \boldsymbol{\mu} | \psi^0_1 \rangle =
-\mathbf{F}\cdot \langle  \boldsymbol{\mu} \rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;

Because a dipole moment is a [[Polar and axial vectors|polar vector]], the diagonal elements of the perturbation  matrix '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; vanish for systems with an [[parity (physics)|inversion center]] (such as atoms). Molecules with an inversion center in a non-degenerate electronic state do not have a (permanent) dipole and hence do not show a linear Stark effect.

In order to obtain a non-zero matrix '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; for systems with an inversion center it is necessary that some of the unperturbed functions &lt;math&gt; \psi^0_i&lt;/math&gt; have opposite parity (obtain plus and minus under inversion), because only functions of opposite parity give non-vanishing matrix elements. Degenerate zeroth-order states of opposite parity occur for excited hydrogen-like (one-electron) atoms or Rydberg states. Neglecting [[fine structure|fine-structure]] effects, such a state with the principal quantum number ''n'' is ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-fold degenerate and
:&lt;math&gt;
n^2 = \sum_{\ell=0}^{n-1} (2 \ell + 1),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\ell &lt;/math&gt; is the azimuthal (angular momentum) quantum number. For instance, the excited ''n'' = 4 state contains the following &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; states,
:&lt;math&gt;
16 = 1 + 3 + 5 +7 \;\; \Longrightarrow\;\;  n=4\;\hbox{contains}\; s\oplus p\oplus d\oplus f.
&lt;/math&gt;
The one-electron states with even &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; are even under parity, while those with odd &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; are odd under parity. Hence hydrogen-like atoms with ''n''&gt;1 show first-order Stark effect.

The first-order Stark effect occurs in rotational transitions of [[Rotational spectroscopy#Classification of molecules based on rotational behavior|symmetric top molecules]] (but not for linear and asymmetric molecules). In first approximation a molecule may be seen as a rigid rotor. A symmetric top [[rigid rotor]] has the unperturbed eigenstates
:&lt;math&gt;
|JKM \rangle = (D^J_{MK})^* \quad\mathrm{with}\quad M,K= -J,-J+1,\dots,J
&lt;/math&gt;
with 2(2''J''+1)-fold degenerate energy for |K| &gt; 0 and (2''J''+1)-fold degenerate energy for K=0.
Here ''D''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''MK''&lt;/sub&gt; is an element of the [[Wigner D-matrix]]. The first-order perturbation matrix  on basis of the unperturbed rigid rotor function is non-zero and can be diagonalized. This gives shifts and splittings
in  the rotational spectrum. Quantitative analysis of these Stark shift yields the permanent [[electric dipole moment]] of the symmetric top molecule.

====Second order====
As stated, the quadratic Stark effect is described by second-order perturbation theory.
The zeroth-order [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenproblem]]
:&lt;math&gt;
H^{(0)} \psi^0_k = E^{(0)}_k \psi^0_k, \quad k=0,1, \ldots, \quad E^{(0)}_0 &lt; E^{(0)}_1 \le E^{(0)}_2, \dots 
&lt;/math&gt;
is assumed to be solved. The perturbation theory gives
:&lt;math&gt;
E^{(2)}_k = \sum_{k^\prime \neq k} \frac{\langle \psi^0_k | V_\mathrm{int} | \psi^0_{k^\prime} \rangle \langle \psi^0_{k^\prime} | V_\mathrm{int} | \psi^0_k \rangle}{E^{(0)}_k - E^{(0)}_{k^\prime}} \equiv -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j=1}^3 \alpha_{ij} F_i F_j
&lt;/math&gt;
with the components of the [[polarizability|polarizability tensor]] α defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{ij} = -2\sum_{k^\prime \neq k} \frac{\langle \psi^0_k | \mu_i | \psi^0_{k^\prime} \rangle \langle \psi^0_{k^\prime} | \mu_j | \psi^0_k \rangle}{E^{(0)}_k - E^{(0)}_{k^\prime}}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The energy ''E''&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt; gives the quadratic Stark effect.

Neglecting the [[hyperfine structure]] (which is often justified — unless extremely weak electric fields are considered), the polarizability tensor of atoms is isotropic,
:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{ij} \equiv \alpha_0 \delta_{ij} \Longrightarrow E^{(2)} = -\frac{1}{2} \alpha_0 F^2.
&lt;/math&gt;
For some molecules this expression is a reasonable approximation, too.

It is important to note that for the ground state &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0&lt;/math&gt; is ''always'' positive, i.e., the quadratic Stark shift is always negative.

====Problems====
The perturbative treatment of the Stark effect has some problems. In the presence of an electric field, states of atoms and molecules that were previously bound ([[square-integrable]]), become formally (non-square-integrable) [[resonance]]s of finite width.
These resonances may decay in finite time via field ionization. For low lying states and not too strong fields the decay times are so long, however, that for all practical purposes the system can be regarded as bound. For highly excited states and/or very strong fields ionization may have to be accounted for. (See also the article on the [[Rydberg atom]]).

== Quantum-confined Stark effect ==
{{main article|Quantum-confined Stark effect}}
In a semiconductor heterostructure, where a small bandgap material is sandwiched between two layers of a larger bandgap material, the Stark effect can be dramatically enhanced by bound [[excitons]]. This is because the [[electron]] and [[Electron hole|hole]] which form the exciton are pulled in opposite directions by the applied electric field, but they remain confined in the smaller bandgap material, so the exciton is not merely pulled apart by the field. The quantum-confined Stark effect is widely used for semiconductor-based optical modulators, particularly for [[optical fiber]] communications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7196">[[Image:Suction cup pressure from collisions.svg|thumb|right|350px|alt=A figure showing that the pressure exerted outside the suction cup exceeds the pressure inside. This pressure difference holds the suction cup in contact with the surface.|The pressure on a suction cup as exerted by collisions of gas molecules holds the suction cup in contact with the surface.]]
[[File:Suction-lifter-one-cup.jpg|thumb|right|One cup suction lifter.]]

A '''suction cup''', also known as a '''sucker''', is a device or object that uses the negative [[Pressure#Fluid pressure|fluid pressure]] of air or water to adhere to [[Porosity|nonporous]] surfaces, creating a [[Vacuum|partial vacuum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/suction%20cup|title="Suction Cup" m-w.com |publisher=Merriam Webster: An Encyclopædia Britannica Company |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suction cups are peripherial traits of some animals such as [[octopus]]es and [[squid]]s, and have been reproduced artificially for numerous purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/48054-octopus-inspired-technology.html|title=Well-Armed Design: 8 Octopus-Inspired Technologies |publisher=livescience.com |accessdate= July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==

The working face of the suction cup is made of elastic, flexible material and has a curved surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US2055397|title="Suction Cup" google.com |publisher=[[Google Patents]] |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the center of the suction cup is pressed against a flat, non-porous surface, the volume of the space between the suction cup and the flat surface is reduced, which causes the air or water between the cup and the surface to be expelled past the rim of the circular cup. The cavity which develops between the cup and the flat surface has little to no air or water in it because most of the fluid has already been forced out of the inside of the cup, causing a lack of pressure. The pressure difference between the atmosphere on the outside of the cup and the low-pressure cavity on the inside of the cup keeps the cup adhered to the surface.

When the user ceases to apply physical pressure to the outside of the cup, the elastic substance of which the cup is made tends to resume its original, curved shape. The length of time for which the suction effect can be maintained depends mainly on how long it takes for air or water to leak back into the cavity between the cup and the surface, equalizing the pressure with the surrounding atmosphere. This depends on the porosity and flatness of the surface and the properties of the cup's rim.

== Calculations ==
The force required to detach an ideal suction cup by pulling it directly away from the surface is given by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;F = AP&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''F'' is the [[force]],
:''A'' is the area of the surface covered by the cup,
:''P'' is the pressure outside the cup (typically [[atmospheric pressure]])

This is derived from the definition of pressure, which is:
:&lt;math&gt;P = F/A&lt;/math&gt;
For example, a suction cup of radius 2.0&amp;nbsp;cm has an area of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;(0.020 m)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0013 square meters. Using the force formula (''F'' = ''AP''), the result is
''F'' = (0.0013 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(100,000 Pa) = about 130 [[newton (unit)|newtons]].

The above formula relies on several assumptions:
# The outer diameter of the cup does not change when the cup is pulled.
# No air leaks into the gap between the cup and the surface.
# The pulling force is applied perpendicular to the surface so that the cup does not slide sideways or peel off.

== Artificial use ==
[[File:Mobiles Navigationsgeraet Navigon im Einsatz.JPG|thumb|right|[[SatNav]] devices often ship with suction cup holders for mounting on windscreens.]]
[[File:GoPro camera mounted on car.jpg|thumb|GoPro camera attached to car with suction cup]]

Artificial suction cups are believed to have first been used in the third century, [[Anno Domini|B.C.]], and were made out of [[gourd]]s. They were used to suction "bad blood" from internal organs to the surface. [[Hippocrates]] is believed to have invented this procedure.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The first modern suction cup patents were issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office during the 1860s. TC Roche was awarded U.S. Patent No. 52,748 in 1866 for a "Photographic Developer Dipping Stick"; the patent discloses a primitive suction cup means for handling photographic plates during developing procedures. In 1868, Orwell Needham patented a more refined suction cup design, U.S. Patent No. 82,629, calling his invention an "Atmospheric Knob" purposed for general use as a handle and drawer opening means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US52748 |title=United States Patent 52,748}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US82629 |title=United States Patent 82,629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suction cups have a number of commercial and industrial applications:

==Content==

''The Genius of Birds'' highlights new findings and discoveries in the field of [[bird intelligence]]. The book explores birds as thinkers (contrary to the cliché "[[wikt:birdbrain|bird brain]]") in the context of observed behavior in the wild and brings to it the scientific findings from lab and field research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ackerman |first=Jennifer |date=12 April 2016 |title=The Genius of Birds |url= |location= |publisher=Penguin Press |page= |isbn=1594205213 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New research suggests that some birds, such as those in the family [[Corvidae#Intelligence|corvidae]], can rival primates and even [[human intelligence|humans]] in forms of [[intelligence]]. Much like humans, birds have [[Brain size|enormous brains]] relative to the rest of their bodies.

Ackerman highlights the complex social structures of avian society. They are capable of [[Abstraction|abstract thinking]], problem solving, recognizing faces, gift giving, sharing, grieving, and meaningful communication with humans. Ackerman goes in depth to highlight scientific studies that uncover behavior such as [[Bird_intelligence#Tool_use|tool usage]], speaking in regional accents, navigation, and [[theory of mind]].

==Reception==
The book is a [[New York Times Bestseller]],&lt;ref&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}
The '''theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology''' are the general and specific scientific theories that explain the ultimate origins of psychological traits in terms of [[evolution]]. These theories originated with [[Charles Darwin]]'s work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humans. Modern [[evolutionary psychology]], however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th century.

Evolutionary psychologists say that [[natural selection]] has provided humans with many [[psychological adaptation]]s, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, or EEA.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also "Environment of evolutionary adaptation," a variation of the term used in Economics, e.g., in Rubin, Paul H., 2003, ''"Folk economics"'' Southern Economic Journal, 70:1, July 2003, 157-171.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual selection]] provides organisms with adaptations related to mating.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For male [[mammal]]s, which have a relatively fast reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For female mammals, with a relatively slow reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, but he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of self-sacrificing behavior. Group selection is a weak explanation because in any group the less self-sacrificing animals will be more likely to survive and the group will become less self-sacrificing.

In 1964, [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]] proposed [[inclusive fitness]] theory, emphasizing a "[[gene-centered view of evolution|gene's-eye]]" view of evolution. Hamilton noted that individuals can increase the replication of their genes into the next generation by helping close relatives with whom they share genes survive and reproduce. According to "[[Hamilton's rule]]", a self-sacrificing behavior can evolve if it helps close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice. Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how "altruism" evolved. Other theories also help explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, including [[evolutionary game theory]], [[tit-for-tat]] reciprocity, and generalized reciprocity. These theories not only help explain the development of altruistic behavior but also account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism).&lt;ref name = "moralanimal"/&gt;

Several mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The [[r/K selection]] theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. [[Parental investment]] theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the [[Trivers-Willard hypothesis]], parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to [[life history theory]], animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring. [[Dual inheritance theory]] posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the [[Baldwin effect]]).

[[Criticism of evolutionary psychology|Critics of evolutionary psychology]] have sometimes challenged its theoretical underpinnings, saying that humans never developed powerful social instincts through natural selection and that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychologists are merely just-so-stories.

==General evolutionary theory==
{{Main|Evolution}}
Evolutionary psychology primarily uses the theories of natural selection, sexual selection, and inclusive fitness to explain the evolution of psychological adaptations.

Evolutionary psychology is sometimes seen not simply as a subdiscipline of psychology but as a metatheoretical framework in which ''the entire field of psychology can be examined.''&lt;ref name="Cosmides"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cosmides |first=L |authorlink=Leda Cosmides |author2=Tooby J |authorlink2=John Tooby  |date=1997-01-13 |url=http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html |title= Evolutionary Psychology: A Primer |accessdate=2008-02-16 |publisher=Center for Evolutionary Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural selection===
{{Main|Natural selection}}
Evolutionary psychologists consider Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection to be important to an understanding of psychology.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 2, “Natural Selection,” p 25-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural selection occurs because individual organisms who are genetically better suited to the current environment leave more descendants, and their genes spread through the population, thus explaining why organisms fit their environments so closely.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; This process is slow and cumulative, with new traits layered over older traits.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; The advantages created by natural selection are known as adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists say that animals, just as they evolve physical adaptations, evolve psychological adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists emphasize that natural selection mostly generates specialized adaptations, which are more efficient than general adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; They point out that natural selection operates slowly, and that adaptations are sometimes out of date when the environment changes rapidly.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; In the case of humans, evolutionary psychologists say that much of human nature was shaped during the stone age and may not match the contemporary environment.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

===Sexual selection===
{{Main|Sexual selection}}
Sexual selection favors traits that provide mating advantages, such as the peacock's tail, even if these same traits are usually hindrances.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists point out that, unlike natural selection, sexual selection typically leads to the evolution of sex differences.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 2, “Natural Selection,” p 25-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex differences typically make reproduction faster for one sex and slower for the other, in which case mates are relatively scarce for the faster sex.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Sexual selection favors traits that increase the number of mates for the fast sex and the quality of mates for the slow sex.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For mammals, the female has the slower reproduction rate.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Males typically evolve either traits to help them fight other males or traits to impress females.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Females typically evolve greater abilities to discern the qualities of males, such as choosiness in mating.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

===Inclusive fitness===
[[Inclusive fitness]] theory, proposed by [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]], emphasized a "[[Gene-centered view of evolution|gene's-eye]]" view of evolution.  Hamilton noted that what evolution ultimately selects are genes, not groups or species.  From this perspective, individuals can increase the replication of their genes into the next generation not only directly via reproduction, by also indirectly helping close relatives with whom they share genes survive and reproduce.   General evolutionary theory, in its modern form, ''is'' essentially inclusive fitness theory.

Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how "altruism" evolved. The dominant, pre-Hamiltonian view was that altruism evolved via [[group selection]]: the notion that altruism evolved for the benefit of the group. The problem with this was that if one organism in a group incurred any fitness costs on itself for the benefit of others in the group, (i.e. acted "altruistically"), then that organism would reduce its own ability to survive and/or reproduce, therefore reducing its chances of passing on its altruistic traits.

Furthermore, the organism that benefited from that altruistic act and only acted on behalf of its own fitness would increase its own chance of survival and/or reproduction, thus increasing its chances of passing on its "selfish" traits.
Inclusive fitness resolved "the problem of altruism" by demonstrating that altruism can evolve via kin selection as expressed in [[Hamilton's rule]]:
&lt;center&gt;cost &amp;lt; relatedness × benefit&lt;/center&gt;
In other words, altruism can evolve as long as the fitness ''cost'' of the altruistic act on the part of the actor is less than the ''degree of genetic relatedness'' of the recipient times the fitness ''benefit'' to that recipient.
This perspective reflects what is referred to as the [[gene-centered view of evolution]] and demonstrates that group selection is a very weak selective force.

| '''''[[Sexual selection]]'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

Organisms can evolve physical and mental traits designed specifically to attract mates (e.g., the Peacock's tail) or to compete with members of one's own sex for access to the opposite sex (e.g., antlers).

Selection occurs most robustly at the level of the gene, not the individual, group, or species. Reproductive success can thus be indirect, via shared genes in kin. Being altruistic toward kin can thus have genetic payoffs. (Also see [[Gene-centered view of evolution]])
Also, Hamilton argued that sexual reproduction evolved primarily as a defense against pathogens (bacteria and viruses) to "shuffle genes" to create greater diversity, especially immunological variability, in offspring.

| [[Robert Trivers]] (1972)
| '''''[[Parental Investment]] Theory / Parent - Offspring Conflict / Reproductive Value'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

The two sexes often have conflicting strategies regarding how much to invest in offspring, and how many offspring to have. Parents allocate more resources to their offspring with higher reproductive value (e.g., "mom always liked you best"). Parents and offspring may have conflicting interests (e.g., when to wean, allocation of resources among offspring, etc.)

| '''''Game Theory / [[Evolutionary Game Theory]]'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

Organisms adapt, or respond, to competitors depending on the strategies used by competitors. Strategies are evaluated by the probable payoffs of alternatives. In a population, this typically results in an "evolutionary stable strategy," or "evolutionary stable equilibrium"—strategies that, on average, cannot be bettered by alternative strategies.

A specific game strategy (see above) that has been shown to be optimal in achieving an evolutionary stable equilibrium in situations of repeated social interactions. One plays nice with non-kin if a mutually beneficially reciprocal relationship is maintained across multiple interactions, while cheating is punished.

| [[Herbert Gintis]] (2000, 2003) and others

(Also called "strong reciprocity"). One can play nice with non-kin strangers even in single interactions if social rules against cheating are maintained by neutral third parties (e.g., other individuals, governments, institutions, etc.), a majority group members cooperate by generally adhering to social rules, and social interactions create a positive sum game (i.e., a bigger overall "pie" results from group cooperation).

Generalized reciprocity may be a set of adaptations that were designed for small in-group cohesion during times of high intertribal warfare with out-groups.

Today the capacity to be altruistic to in-group strangers may result from a serendipitous generalization (or "mismatch") between ancestral tribal living in small groups and today's large societies that entail many single interactions with strangers. (The dark side of generalized reciprocity may be that these adaptations may also underlie aggression toward out-groups.)

==Middle-level evolutionary theories==
Middle-level evolutionary theories are consistent with general evolutionary theory, but focus on certain domains of functioning (Buss, 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M. (2011). Evolutionary Psychology. NY: Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specific evolutionary psychology hypotheses may be derivative from a mid-level theory (Buss, 2011).   Three very important middle-level evolutionary theories were contributed by [[Robert Trivers]] as well as [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson]]&lt;ref name="Pianka, E.R 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|date=March 1971|doi=10.1086/406755|jstor=2822435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|chapter=Parental investment and sexual selection|editor=Bernard Campbell|title=Sexual selection and the descent of man, 1871-1971|pages=136–179|publisher=Aldine Transaction (Chicago)|date=1972|isbn=0-202-02005-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=Parent-offspring conflict|volume=14|issue=1|pages=249–264|date=1974|doi=10.1093/icb/14.1.249|publisher=The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology|journal=American Zoologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The theory of '''[[parent-offspring conflict]]''' rests on the fact that even though a parent and his/her offspring are 50% genetically related, they are also 50% genetically different. All things being equal, a parent would want to allocate their resources equally amongst their offspring, while each offspring may want a little more for themselves. Furthermore, an offspring may want a little more resources from the parent than the parent is willing to give. In essence, parent-offspring conflict refers to ''a conflict of adaptive interests'' between parent and offspring. However, if all things are not equal, a parent may engage in discriminative investment towards one sex or the other, depending on the ''parent's'' condition.
*The '''[[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]]''', which proposes that parents will invest more in the sex that gives them the greatest reproductive payoff (grandchildren) with increasing or marginal investment. Females are the heavier parental investors in our species. Because of that, females have a better chance of reproducing at least once in comparison to males, but males in good condition have a better chance of producing high numbers of offspring than do females in good condition. Thus, according to the [[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]], parents in good condition are predicted to favor investment in sons, and parents in poor condition are predicted to favor investment in daughters.
*'''[[r/K selection theory]]''',&lt;ref name="Pianka, E.R 1970"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pianka | first1 = E.R. | authorlink = Eric Pianka | date = 1970 | title = On r and K selection | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 104 | issue = 940| pages = 592–597 | doi = 10.1086/282697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, in [[ecology]], relates to the selection of traits in organisms that allow success in particular environments. [[r-selected]] species, i.e., species in unstable or unpredictable environments, produce many offspring, each of which is unlikely to survive to adulthood. By contrast, [[K-selected]] species, i.e., species in stable or predictable environments, invest more heavily in fewer offspring, each of which has a better chance of surviving to adulthood.
*'''[[Life history theory]]''' posits that the schedule and duration of key events in an organism's lifetime are shaped by natural selection to produce the largest possible number of surviving offspring.  For any given individual, available resources in any particular environment are finite. Time, effort, and energy used for one purpose diminishes the time, effort, and energy available for another. Examples of some major life history characteristics include: age at first reproductive event, reproductive lifespan and aging, and number and size of offspring. Variations in these characteristics reflect different allocations of an individual's resources (i.e., time, effort, and energy expenditure) to competing life functions. For example, [[attachment theory]] proposes that caregiver attentiveness in early childhood can determine later [[Attachment in adults|adult attachment style]]. Also, [[Jay Belsky]] and others have found evidence that if the father is absent from the home, girls reach first menstruation earlier and also have more short term sexual relationships as women.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. (2011).  Evolutionary Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trabecular cartilages''' ('''trabeculae cranii''', sometimes simply '''trabeculae''', '''prechordal cartilages''') are paired, rod-shaped cartilages, which develop in the [[head]] of the [[vertebrate]] [[embryo]]. They are the primordia of the anterior part of the [[Base of skull|cranial base]], and are derived from the [[cranial neural crest|cranial neural crest cells]].

==Structure==
[[File:Shark Lacerta deBeer1937.jpg|thumb|330px|Morphogenesis of neurocranium (shark and lizard).]]
The trabecular cartilages generally appear as a paired, rod-shaped cartilages at the ventral side of the [[forebrain]] and lateral side of the [[adenohypophysis]] in the vertebrate embryo. During development, their anterior ends fuse and form the ''trabecula communis''. Their posterior ends fuse with the caudal-most [[parachordal cartilages]].

===Development===
Most [[skeletons]] are of [[mesodermal]] origin in vertebrates. Especially axial skeletal elements, such as the vertebrae, are derived from the paraxial mesoderm (e.g., [[somites]]), which is regulated by molecular signals from the [[notochord]]. Trabecular cartilages, however, originate from the neural crest, and since they are located anterior to the rostral tip of the notochord,&lt;ref&gt;their derivatives are called the ''prechordal cranium'' (Couly et al., 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; they cannot receive signals from the notochord. Due to these specialisations, and their essential role in cranial development, many comparative morphologists and embryologists have argued their developmental or evolutionary origins. The general theory is that the trabecular cartilage is derived from the neural crest mesenchyme which fills anterior to the mandibular arch (premandibular domain).

==Other animals==
===Lamprey===
As clearly seen in the [[lamprey]], [[Cyclostome]] also has a pair of cartilaginous rods in the embryonic head which is similar to the trabecular cartilages in jawed vertebrates.
However, in 1916, [[Alexej Nikolajevich Sewertzoff]] pointed out that the cranial base of the lamprey is exclusively originated from the paraxial mesoderm. Then in 1948, [[:de:Alf Johnels|Alf Johnels]] reported the detail of the skeletogenesis of the lamprey, and showed that the “trabecular cartilages” in lamprey appear just beside the notochord, in a similar position to the parachordal cartilages in jawed vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Johnels AG (1948) On the development and morphology of the skeleton of the head of Petromyzon. Acta Zool 29: 139-279&lt;/ref&gt; Recent experimental studies also showed that the cartilages are derived from the head mesoderm.&lt;ref&gt;Kuratani S ''et al''., (2004) Developmental fate of the mandibular mesoderm in the lamprey, Lethenteron japonicum: comparative morphology and development of the gnathostome jaw with special reference to the nature of trabecula cranii. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.). 302B, 458-468&lt;/ref&gt; The “trabecular cartilages” in the Cyclostome is no longer considered to be the homologue of the trabecular in the jawed vertebrates: the (true) trabecular cartilages were firstly acquired in the Gnathostome lineage.

==History==
{{refimprove-section|date=August 2017}}
The trabecular cartilages were first described in the [[grass snake]] by [[:de:Martin Heinrich Rathke|Martin Heinrich Rathke]] at 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Entwicklungsgeschichte der Natter. Konigsberg (1839)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] suggested that the trabecular cartilages are a modified part of the [[splanchnocranium]]: they arose as the serial homologues of the [[pharyngeal arches]].{{fact|date=August 2017}}

The vertebrate [[jaw]] is generally thought to be the modification of the [[mandibular arch]] (1st pharyngeal arch). Since the trabecular cartilages appear anterior to the mandibular arch, if the trabecular cartilages are serial homologues of the pharyngeal arches, ancestral vertebrates should possess more than one pharyngeal arch (so-called "premandibular arches") anterior to the mandibular arch. The existence of premandibular arch(es) has been accepted by many comparative embryologists and morphologists (e.g., [[Edwin Stephen Goodrich]], [[Gavin de Beer]]). Moreover, [[:de: Erik Stensio|Erik Stensio]] reported premandibular arches and the corresponding branchiomeric nerves by the reconstruction of the [[Osteostraci|Osteostracans]] (e.g., ''[[Cephalaspis]]''; recently this arch was reinterpreted as the mandibular arch)

However, the existence of the premandibular arch(es) has been rejected, and the trabecular cartilages are no longer assumed to be one of the pharyngeal arches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16152">'''Ultra-high vacuum''' ('''UHV''') is the [[vacuum]] regime characterised by [[pressure]]s lower than about 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] or 100 nanopascals (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[milli|m]][[Bar (unit)|bar]], ~10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]]). UHV conditions are created by pumping the gas out of a UHV chamber. At these low pressures the [[mean free path]] of a gas molecule is greater than approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km, so the gas is in [[free molecular flow]], and gas molecules will collide with the chamber walls many times before colliding with each other. Almost all molecular interactions therefore take place on various surfaces in the chamber.

UHV conditions are integral to scientific research. [[Surface science]] experiments often require a chemically clean sample surface with the absence of any unwanted [[Adsorption|adsorbates]]. Surface analysis tools such as [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] and [[low energy ion scattering]] require UHV conditions for the transmission of electron or ion beams. For the same reason, beam pipes in particle accelerators such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]] are kept at UHV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Concepts involved ==
* [[Sorption]] of gases
* [[Kinetic theory of gases|Kinetic theory]] of gases
* Gas transport and pumping
* [[Vacuum pump]]s and [[vacuum system|system]]s
* [[Vapour pressure]]

== Material limitations ==
Maintaining UHV conditions requires the use of unusual materials for equipment. Heating of the entire system above 100&amp;nbsp;°C for many hours ("baking") to remove water and other trace gases which [[adsorption|adsorb]] on the surfaces of the chamber is required upon "cycling" the equipment to atmosphere. To save time, energy, and integrity of the UHV volume an "interlock" is often used. The interlock volume has one door or valve facing the UHV side of the volume, and another door against atmospheric pressure through which samples or workpieces are initially introduced. After sample introduction and assuring that the door against atmosphere is closed, the interlock volume is typically pumped down to a medium-high vacuum. In some cases the workpiece itself is baked out or otherwise pre-cleaned under this medium-high vacuum. The gateway to the UHV chamber is then opened, the workpiece transferred to the UHV by robotic means or by other contrivance if necessary, and the UHV valve re-closed. While the initial workpiece is being processed under UHV, a subsequent sample can be introduced into the interlock volume, pre-cleaned, and so-on and so-forth, saving much time. Although a "puff" of gas is generally released into the UHV system when the valve to the interlock volume is opened, the UHV system pumps can generally snatch this gas away before it has time to adsorb onto the UHV surfaces. In a system well designed with suitable interlocks, the UHV components seldom need bakeout and the UHV may improve over time even as workpieces are introduced and removed.

Many common materials are used sparingly if at all due to high vapor pressure, high adsorptivity or absorptivity resulting in subsequent troublesome outgassing, or high permeability in the face of differential pressure (i.e.: "through-gassing"):
* Majority of [[organic compounds]] cannot be used:
** [[Plastics]], other than [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] and [[Polyether ether ketone|PEEK]]: [[gasket]]s are made of copper, and are single-use; plastics in other uses are replaced with [[ceramic materials|ceramics]] or metals.  Limited use of fluoroelastomers (such as [[Viton]]) and perfluoroelastomers (such as [[Kalrez]]) as gasket materials can be considered if metal gaskets are inconvenient, though these polymers can be expensive.
** [[Glue]]s: special glues for high vacuum must be used.
* Some [[steels]]: due to oxidization of [[carbon steel]], which greatly increases adsorption area, only [[stainless steel]] is used.  Particularly, non-leaded and low-sulfur [[austenitic stainless steel|austenitic]] grades such as [[304 stainless steel|304]] and [[316 stainless steel|316]] are preferred.  These steels include at least 18% chromium and 8% nickel.  Variants of stainless steel include low-carbon grades (such as [[304L]] and [[316L]]), and grades with additives such as [[niobium]] and [[molybdenum]] to reduce the formation of [[chromium carbide]] (which provides no corrosion resistance).  Common designations include 316L (low carbon), and 316LN (low carbon with nitrogen).  Chromium carbide precipitation at the [[grain boundaries]] can render a stainless steel less resistant to oxidation.  
* [[Lead]]: Soldering is performed using [[Solder#Lead-free solder|lead-free solder]].
* [[Indium]]: Indium is sometimes used as a deformable gasket material for vacuum seals, especially in cryogenic apparatus, but its low melting point prevents use in baked systems.
* [[Zinc]], [[cadmium]]: High vapor pressures during system bake-out.
* Cleaning is very important for UHV.  Common cleaning procedures include degreasing with detergents, [[organic solvents]], or [[chlorinated hydrocarbons]].  [[Electropolishing]] is often used to reduce the surface area from which adsorbed gases can be emitted. Etching of stainless steel using hydrofluoric and nitric acid forms a chromium rich surface, followed by a nitric acid [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] step, which forms a chromium oxide rich surface.  This surface retards the diffusion of hydrogen into the chamber.

Technical limitations: 
* [[Screws]]: Threads have a high surface area and tend to "trap" gases, and therefore, are avoided.  Blind holes are especially avoided, due to the trapped gas at the base of the screw and slow venting through the threads, which is commonly known as a "virtual leak".  This can be mitigated by designing components to include through-holes for all threaded connections, or by using vented screws (which have a hole drilled through their central axis or a notch along the threads). Vented Screws allow trapped gases to flow freely from the base of the screw, eliminating virtual leaks and speeding up the pump-down process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vented Screws - AccuGroup|url=https://www.accu.co.uk/en/971-vented-screws|publisher=accu.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Welding]]: Processes such as [[gas metal arc welding]] and [[shielded metal arc welding]] cannot be used, due to the deposition of [[slag|impure material]] and potential introduction of voids or porosity. [[Gas tungsten arc welding]] (with an appropriate heat profile and properly selected filler material) is necessary. Other clean processes, such as [[electron beam welding]] or [[laser beam welding]], are also acceptable; however, those that involve potential [[slag]] inclusions (such as [[submerged arc welding]] and [[flux-cored arc welding]]) are obviously not. To avoid trapping gas or high vapor pressure molecules, welds must fully penetrate the joint or be made from the interior surface.

== Typical uses ==

Ultra-high vacuum is necessary for many surface analytic techniques such as:
* [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS)
* [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] (AES)
* [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS)
* [[Thermal desorption spectroscopy]] (TPD)
* [[Thin film]] growth and preparation techniques with stringent requirements for purity, such as [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE), UHV [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), [[atomic layer deposition]] (ALD) and UHV [[pulsed laser deposition]] (PLD)
* [[Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy]] (ARPES)
* [[Field emission microscopy]] and [[Field ion microscopy]]
* [[Atom Probe|Atom Probe Tomography]] (APT)

UHV is necessary for these applications to reduce surface contamination, by reducing the number of molecules reaching the sample over a given time period.  At 0.1 mPa (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; Torr), it only takes 1 second to cover a surface with a contaminant, so much lower pressures are needed for long experiments.

UHV is also required for:
* [[Particle accelerator]]s The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has three UH vacuum systems. The lowest pressure is found in the pipes the proton beam speeds through near the interaction (collision) points. Here helium cooling pipes also act as cryopumps. The maximum allowable pressure is 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; Pa (10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; mbar) 
* [[Gravitational wave detector]]s such as [[LIGO]], [[Virgo interferometer|VIRGO]], [[GEO 600]], and [[TAMA 300]]. The [[LIGO]] experimental apparatus is housed in a 10,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (353,000 cu.ft.) vacuum chamber at 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; Pa (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; mbar) in order to eliminate temperature fluctuations and sound waves which would jostle the mirrors far too much for gravity waves to be sensed. 
* [[Atomic physics]] experiments which use cold atoms, such as [[ion trap]]ping or making [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s
and, while not compulsory, can prove beneficial in applications such as:
* [[Molecular beam epitaxy]], [[Electron beam evaporation|E-beam evaporation]], [[sputtering]] and other deposition techniques.   
* [[Atomic force microscopy]]. High vacuum enables high [[Q factor]]s on the cantilever oscillation.
* [[Scanning tunneling microscopy]]. High vacuum reduces oxidation and contamination, hence enables imaging and the achievement of atomic resolution on clean metal and [[semiconductor]] surfaces, e.g. imaging the [[surface reconstruction]] of the unoxidized [[silicon]] surface.
* [[Electron-beam lithography]]

== Achievement ==
Typically, UHV requires:
*High pumping speed &amp;mdash; possibly multiple [[vacuum pump]]s in series and/or parallel
*Minimize surface area in the chamber
*High conductance tubing to pumps &amp;mdash; short and fat, without obstruction
*Use low-[[outgassing]] materials such as certain stainless steels
*Avoid creating pits of trapped gas behind bolts, welding voids, etc.
*[[Electropolishing|Electropolish]] all metal parts after machining or welding
*Use low vapor pressure materials (ceramics, glass, metals, teflon if unbaked)
*Bake the system to remove water or hydrocarbons [[adsorbed]] to the walls
*Chill chamber walls to [[cryogenic]] temperatures during use
*Avoid all traces of hydrocarbons, including skin oils in a fingerprint &amp;mdash; always use gloves

[[Outgassing]] is a problem for UHV systems. Outgassing can occur from two sources: surfaces and bulk materials. Outgassing from bulk materials is minimized by selection of materials with low vapor pressures (such as glass, [[stainless steel]], and [[ceramic]]s) for everything inside the system. Materials which are not generally considered absorbent can outgas, including most plastics and some metals. For example, vessels lined with a highly gas-permeable material such as [[palladium]] (which is a high-capacity [[hydrogen]] sponge) create special outgassing problems.

Outgassing from surfaces is a subtler problem. At extremely low pressures, more gas molecules are adsorbed on the walls than are floating in the chamber, so the total surface area inside a chamber is more important than its volume for reaching UHV. Water is a significant source of outgassing because a thin layer of water vapor rapidly adsorbs to everything whenever the chamber is opened to air. Water evaporates from surfaces too slowly to be fully removed at room temperature, but just fast enough to present a continuous level of background contamination. Removal of water and similar gases generally requires baking the UHV system at 200 to 400&amp;nbsp;°C while vacuum pumps are running. During chamber use, the walls of the chamber may be chilled using [[liquid nitrogen]] to reduce outgassing further.

[[Hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]] are the most common background gases in a well-designed, well-baked UHV system. Both Hydrogen and CO diffuse out from the [[grain boundaries]] in stainless steel. Helium could diffuse through the steel and glass from the outside air, but this effect is usually negligible due to the low abundance of He in the atmosphere.

There is no single [[vacuum pump]] that can operate all the way from atmospheric pressure to ultra-high vacuum. Instead, a series of different pumps is used, according to the appropriate pressure range for each pump. Pumps commonly used to achieve UHV include:
*[[Turbomolecular pump]]s (especially compound and/or [[magnetic bearing]] types)
*[[Ion pump]]s
*[[Titanium sublimation pump]]s
*[[Non-Evaporable Getter|Non-evaporable getter (NEG) pumps]]
*[[Cryopump]]s

UHV pressures are measured with an [[ion gauge]], either a hot filament or an inverted magnetron type.

Metal seals, with knife edges on both sides cutting into a soft, copper gasket. This all-metal seal can maintain pressures down to 100 pPa (~10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; Torr).

== UHV manipulator ==
A '''UHV manipulator''' allows an object which is inside a vacuum chamber and under vacuum to be mechanically positioned.  It may provide rotary
motion, linear motion, or a combination of both.  The most complex devices give motion in three axes and rotations around two of those axes.  To generate the mechanical movement inside the chamber, two basic mechanisms are commonly employed: a mechanical coupling through the vacuum wall (using a vacuum-tight seal around the coupling), or a magnetic coupling that transfers motion from air-side to vacuum-side.  Various forms of motion control are available for manipulators, such as knobs, handwheels, motors, [[stepping motor]]s, [[piezoelectric motor]]s, and [[pneumatics]].

The manipulator or sample holder may include features that allow additional control and testing of a sample, such as the ability to apply heat, cooling, voltage, or a magnetic field.  Sample heating can be accomplished by electron bombardment or thermal radiation. For electron bombardment, the sample holder is equipped with a filament which emits electrons when biased at a high negative potential. The impact of the
electrons bombarding the sample at high energy causes it to heat.  For thermal radiation, a filament is mounted close to the sample and resistively heated to high temperature. The infrared energy from the filament heats the sample.

[[File:Joukowsky-Pressure-Shock-01.jpg|thumbnail|300px|Effect of a pressure surge on a float gauge]]
'''Water hammer''' (or, more generally, '''fluid hammer''', also called '''hydraulic shock''') is a [[pressure]] surge or wave caused  when a [[fluid]], usually a liquid but sometimes also a gas, in motion is forced to stop or change direction suddenly, a momentum change. A water hammer commonly occurs when a valve closes suddenly at an end of a [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] system, and a pressure wave propagates in the pipe.

This pressure wave can cause major problems, from noise and vibration to pipe collapse. It is possible to reduce the effects of the water hammer pulses with [[Hydraulic accumulator|accumulators]], [[expansion tank]]s, [[surge tank]]s, [[blowoff valve]]s, and other features.

Rough calculations can be made either using the [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Zhukovsky]] (Joukowsky) equation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Practical Hydraulics |author=Kay, Melvyn |year=2008 |edition=2nd |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=0-415-35115-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0415351154&amp;pg=PA120}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more accurate ones using the method of characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Modelling vaporous cavitation on fluid transients | journal = International Journal of Pressure Vessels and Piping | year = 2003 | first = Jian-Jun | last = Shu | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 187–195 | doi = 10.1016/S0308-0161(03)00025-5 | arxiv = 1409.8042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In the 1st century B.C., [[Vitruv|Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]] described the effect of water hammer in lead pipes and stone tubes of the Roman public water supply.&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius Pollio with Morris Hicky Morgan, trans. ''The Ten Books on Architecture'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts:  Harvard University Press, 1914) ; Book 8, Chapter 6, sections 5-8 , [https://archive.org/stream/vitruviustenbook00vitruoft#page/n281/mode/2up pp. 245-246.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711025315/http://archive.org/stream/vitruviustenbook00vitruoft |date=2012-07-11 }}  Vitruvius states that when a water pipe crosses a wide valley, it must sometimes be constructed as an inverted siphon.  He states that cavities ("venters") must be constructed periodically along the pipe "and in the venter, water cushions must be constructed to relieve the pressure of the air." "But if there is no such venter made in the valleys, nor any substructure built on a level, but merely an elbow, the water will break out, and burst the joints of the pipes."  Swiss engineer Martin Schwarz — Martin Schwarz, "Neue Forschungsergebnisse zu Vitruvs ''colliviaria''" [New research results on Vitruvius' ''colliviaria''], pp.  353-357,  in:  Christoph Ohlig, ed., ''Cura Aquarum in Jordanien'' (Siegburg, Germany:  Deutschen Wasserhistorischen Gesellschaft, 2008) — argues that Vitruvius' phrase ''vis spiritus'' referred not to air pressure, but to pressure transients (water hammer) in the water pipes.  He found stone plugs (''colliviaria'') in Roman water pipes, which could be expelled by water hammer, allowing water in the pipe to flood the air chamber above the pipe, instead of rupturing the pipe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Andreas |last=Ismaier |title=Untersuchung der fluiddynamischen Wechselwirkung zwischen Druckstößen und Anlagenkomponenten in Kreiselpumpensystemen |language=German |trans-title=Investigation of the fluid dynamic interaction between pressure surges and system components in centrifugal pumping systems |year=2011 |publisher=Shaker |volume=11 |series=Schriftenreihe des Lehrstuhls für Prozessmaschinen und Anlagentechnik, Universität Erlangen; Nürnberg Lehrstuhl für Prozessmaschinen und Anlagentechnik |isbn=978-3-8322-9779-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Water hammer was exploited before there was even a word for it; in 1772, Englishman [[John Whitehurst]] built a [[hydraulic ram]] for a home in Cheshire, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Whitehurst |first=John |year=1775 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nXg1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA277#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Account of a machine for raising water, executed at Oulton, in Cheshire, in 1772 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=65 |issue= |pages=277–279 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1775.0026 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328203126/https://books.google.com/books?id=nXg1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA277#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2017-03-28 |df= }} See also plate preceding page 277.&lt;/ref&gt; In  1796, French inventor [[Joseph Michel Montgolfier]] (1740–1810) built a hydraulic ram for his paper mill in [[Voiron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Montgolfier |first=J.

==Cause and effect==
When a pipe is suddenly closed at the outlet (downstream), the mass of water before the closure is still moving, thereby building up high pressure and a resulting [[shock wave]]. In domestic [[plumbing]] this is experienced as a loud banging resembling a hammering noise. Water hammer can cause pipelines to break if the pressure is high enough. Air traps or stand pipes (open at the top) are sometimes added as [[Wiktionary:damper|dampers]] to water systems to absorb the potentially damaging forces caused by the moving water.

In [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric generating stations]], the water traveling along the tunnel or pipeline may be prevented from entering a turbine by closing a valve. For example, if there is 14&amp;nbsp;km of tunnel of 7.7 m diameter full of water travelling at 3.75&amp;nbsp;m/s,&lt;ref&gt;http://communities.bentley.com/products/hydraulics___hydrology/f/5925/p/60896/147250.aspx#147250&lt;/ref&gt; that represents approximately 8000 megajoules of kinetic energy that must be arrested. This arresting is frequently achieved by a surge shaft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cr4.globalspec.com/thread/73646 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220023940/http://cr4.globalspec.com/thread/73646 |archivedate=2011-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; open at the top, into which the water flows. As the water rises up the shaft its kinetic energy is converted into potential energy, which causes the water in the tunnel to decelerate. At some HEP stations, such as the Saxon Falls Hydro [[List of power stations in Michigan#Hydropower|Power Plant In Michigan]], what looks like a [[water tower]] is actually one of these devices, known in these cases as a [[surge tank|surge drum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.xcelenergy.com/energy_portfolio/electricity/power_plants/saxon|title=Saxon Falls Hydro Generating Station {{!}} Xcel Energy|website=www.xcelenergy.com|access-date=2017-08-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816195209/https://www.xcelenergy.com/energy_portfolio/electricity/power_plants/saxon|archivedate=2017-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the home, a water hammer may occur when a [[dishwasher]], [[washing machine]] or [[toilet]] shuts off water flow. The result may be heard as a loud bang, repetitive banging (as the shock wave travels back and forth in the plumbing system), or as some shuddering.

On the other hand, when an upstream [[valve]] in a pipe closes, water downstream of the valve attempts to continue flowing creating a vacuum that may cause the pipe to collapse or [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implode]]. This problem can be particularly acute if the pipe is on a downhill slope. To prevent this, air and vacuum [[relief valve]]s or air vents are installed just downstream of the valve to allow air to enter the line to prevent this vacuum from occurring.

Other causes of water hammer are pump failure and [[check valve]] slam (due to sudden deceleration, a check valve may slam shut rapidly, depending on the dynamic characteristic of the check valve and the mass of the water between a check valve and tank). To alleviate this situation, it is recommended to install non-slam check valves as they do not rely on gravity or fluid flow for their closure. For vertical pipes, other suggestions include installing new piping that can be designed to include air chambers to alleviate the possible shockwave of water due to excess water flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dft-valves.com/preventing-water-hammer/|title=How To Prevent Water Hammer {{!}} DFT Valves|work=DFT Valves|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816193649/http://www.dft-valves.com/preventing-water-hammer/|archivedate=2017-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Blown expansion joint.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Expansion joints on a steam line that have been destroyed by steam hammer]]

Steam distribution systems may also be vulnerable to a situation similar to water hammer, known as ''steam hammer''. In a steam system, a water hammer most often occurs when some of the steam condenses into water in a horizontal section of the piping.  Steam picks up the water, forming a "[[slug (projectile)|slug]]", and hurls this at high velocity into a pipe fitting, creating a loud hammering noise and greatly stressing the pipe.  This condition is usually caused by a poor condensate drainage strategy.

Where air filled traps are used, these eventually become depleted of their trapped air over a long period through absorption into the water. This can be cured by shutting off the supply, opening taps at the highest and lowest locations to drain the system (thereby restoring air to the traps), and then closing the taps and re-opening the supply.

On [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[internal combustion engine]]s, a fluid hammer can take place when the throttle is closed while the turbocharger is forcing air into the engine. A [[pressure relief valve]] placed before the throttle prevents the air from surging against the throttle body by diverting it elsewhere, thus protecting the turbocharger from pressure damage. This valve can either recirculate the air into the turbocharger's intake (recirculation valve), or it can blow the air into the atmosphere and produce the distinctive hiss-flutter of an aftermarket turbocharger ([[blowoff valve]]).

==Water hammer from a jet of water==
If a stream of high pressure water impinges on a surface, water hammer can quickly [[erosion|erode]] and destroy it. In the [[2009 Sayano–Shushenskaya hydroelectric power station accident]], the lid to a 640 MW turbine was ejected upwards, hitting the ceiling above. During the accident, the rotor was seen flying through the air, still spinning, about 3 meters  above the floor. Unrestrained, {{convert|256|m3|gal|sigfig=3}} per second of water began to spray all over the generator hall.&lt;ref name=pm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/gonzo/4344681 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213154304/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/gonzo/4344681 |archivedate=2011-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The geyser caused the structural failure of steel ceiling joists, precipitating a roof collapse around the failed turbine.

==Water hammer during an explosion==
When an explosion happens in an enclosed space, water hammer can cause the walls of the container to deform. However, it can also impart momentum to the enclosure if it is free to move. An underwater explosion in the [[SL-1]] [[nuclear reactor]] vessel caused the water to accelerate upwards through {{convert|2.5|ft}} of air before it struck the vessel head at {{convert|160|ft/s}} with a pressure of {{convert|10000|psi}}. This pressure wave caused the {{convert|26000|lb}} steel vessel to jump 9 feet 1 inch (2.77 m) into the air before it dropped into its prior location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.id.doe.gov/foia/PDF/IDO-19313.pdf |id=IDO-19313 |title=Additional Analysis of the SL-1 Excursion: Final Report of Progress July through October 1962 |date=November 21, 1962 |author=Flight Propulsion Laboratory Department, General Electric Company, Idaho Falls, Idaho |publisher=U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Division of Technical Information |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927065809/http://www.id.doe.gov/foia/PDF/IDO-19313.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df= }}; also TM-62-11-707&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative to perform ongoing preventative maintenance to avoid water hammer as the results of these powerful explosions have resulted in fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/07/nyregion/us-blames-con-ed-error-for-fatal-plant-explosion.html|title=U.S. Blames Con Ed Error For Fatal Plant Explosion|last=Wald|first=Matthew L.|date=1993-05-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816194725/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/07/nyregion/us-blames-con-ed-error-for-fatal-plant-explosion.html|archivedate=2017-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigating measures==
Water hammer has caused accidents and fatalities, but usually damage is limited to breakage of pipes or appendages. An engineer should always assess the risk of a pipeline burst. Pipelines transporting hazardous liquids or gases warrant special care in design, construction, and operation. Hydroelectric power plants especially must be carefully designed and maintained because the water hammer can cause water pipes to fail catastrophically.

The following characteristics may reduce or eliminate water hammer:
* Reduce the pressure of the water supply to the building by fitting a regulator.
* Lower fluid velocities. To keep water hammer low, pipe-sizing charts for some applications recommend flow velocity at or below {{convert|1.5|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}
* Fit slowly closing valves. Toilet fill valves are available in a quiet fill type that closes quietly.
* High pipeline pressure rating (expensive).
* Good pipeline control (start-up and shut-down procedures).
* [[Water tower]]s (used in many [[drinking water]] systems) help maintain steady flow rates and trap large pressure fluctuations.
* Air vessels work in much the same way as water towers, but are pressurized. They typically have an air cushion above the fluid level in the vessel, which may be regulated or separated by a bladder. Sizes of air vessels may be up to hundreds of cubic meters on large pipelines. They come in many shapes, sizes and configurations. Such vessels often are called accumulators or expansion tanks.
* A [[hydropneumatic device]] similar in principle to a [[shock absorber]] called a 'Water Hammer Arrestor' can be installed between the water pipe and the machine, to absorb the shock and stop the banging.
* Air valves often remediate low pressures at high points in the pipeline. Though effective, sometimes large numbers of air valves need be installed. These valves also allow air into the system, which is often unwanted.
* Shorter branch pipe lengths.
* Shorter lengths of straight pipe, i.e. add elbows, expansion loops. Water hammer is related to the speed of sound in the fluid, and elbows reduce the influences of pressure waves.
* Arranging the larger piping in loops that supply shorter smaller run-out pipe branches. With looped piping, lower velocity flows from both sides of a loop can serve a branch.
* [[Flywheel]] on a pump.
* Pumping station bypass.

==The magnitude of the pulse==
[[Image:Water hammer pressure.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Typical pressure wave caused by closing a valve in a pipeline]]

One of the first to successfully investigate the water hammer problem was the Italian engineer [[Lorenzo Allievi]].

Water hammer can be analyzed by two different approaches—''rigid column theory'', which ignores compressibility of the fluid and elasticity of the walls of the pipe, or by a full analysis that includes elasticity.  When the time it takes a valve to close is long compared to the propagation time for a pressure wave to travel the  length of the pipe, then rigid column theory is appropriate; otherwise considering elasticity may be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Bruce |first1=S. |last2=Larock |first2=E. |last3=Jeppson |first3=R. W. |last4=Watters |first4=G. Z. |title=Hydraulics of Pipeline Systems |location= |publisher=CRC Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-8493-1806-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Below are two approximations for the peak pressure, one that considers elasticity, but assumes the valve closes instantaneously, and a second that neglects elasticity but includes a finite time for the valve to close.

===Instant valve closure; compressible fluid===
The pressure profile of the water hammer pulse can be calculated from the [[Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Joukowsky]] equation&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Thorley |first=A. R. D. |title=Fluid Transients in Pipelines |edition=2nd |publisher=Professional Engineering Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=0-79180210-8 |doi= }}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} =\rho a \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

So for a valve closing instantaneously, the maximum magnitude of the water hammer pulse is:

::&lt;math&gt;\Delta P =\rho a_0 \Delta v &lt;/math&gt;

where Δ''P'' is the magnitude of the pressure wave (Pa), ''&amp;rho;'' is the density of the fluid (kg m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;), ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the speed of sound in the fluid (ms&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and Δ''v'' is the change in the fluid's velocity (ms&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The pulse comes about due to [[Newton's second law of motion|Newton's laws of motion]] and the [[continuity equation]] applied to the deceleration of a fluid element.&lt;ref name=SW&gt;{{Citation |last=Streeter |first=V. L. |last2=Wylie |first2=E. B. |title=Fluid Mechanics |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |edition=International 9th Revised |year=1998 |isbn= |doi= }}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Equation for wave speed====
As the speed of sound in a fluid is &lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{\frac B \rho}&lt;/math&gt;, the peak pressure depends on the fluid compressibility if the valve is closed abruptly.

::&lt;math&gt;B = \frac K {(1+V/a)[1+c(K/E)(D/t)]}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* ''a'' = wave speed
* ''B'' = equivalent bulk modulus of elasticity of the system fluid-pipe
* ''&amp;rho;'' = density of the fluid
* ''K'' = bulk modulus of elasticity of the fluid
* ''E'' = [[elastic modulus]] of the pipe
* ''D'' = internal pipe diameter
* ''t'' = pipe wall thickness
* ''c'' = dimensionless parameter due to system pipe-constraint condition on wave speed&lt;ref name="SW"/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2012}}

===Slow valve closure; incompressible fluid===
When the valve is closed slowly compared to the transit time for a pressure wave to travel the length of the pipe, the elasticity can be neglected, and the phenomenon can be described in terms of [[inertance]] or rigid column theory:
:&lt;math&gt;F = m a = P A = \rho L A {dv \over dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming constant deceleration of the water column (''dv''/''dt'' = ''v''/''t''), gives:
:&lt;math&gt;P = \rho L v/t.&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''F'' = force, N
* ''m'' = mass of the fluid column, kg
* ''a'' = acceleration, m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''P'' = pressure, Pa
* ''A'' = pipe cross section, m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* &amp;rho; = fluid density, kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''L'' = pipe length, m
* ''v'' = [[flow velocity]], m/s
* ''t'' = valve closure time, s

The above formula becomes, for water and with imperial unit: P = 0.0135 V L/t.
For practical application, a safety factor of about 5 is recommended:

:&lt;math&gt;P =0.07 V L/t +P_1&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the inlet pressure in psi, ''V'' is the flow velocity in ft/sec, ''t'' is the valve closing time in seconds and ''L'' is the upstream pipe length in feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plastomatic.com/water-hammer.html "Water Hammer &amp; Pulsation"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701193833/http://www.plastomatic.com/water-hammer.html |date=2008-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expression for the excess pressure due to water hammer==

When a valve with a volumetric flow rate Q is closed, an excess pressure &amp;Delta;P is created upstream of the valve, whose value is given by the [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Joukowsky]] equation:

::&lt;math&gt;\Delta P = Z \, Q&lt;/math&gt;

In this expression:&lt;ref&gt;Faisandier, J., Hydraulic and Pneumatic Mechanisms, 8th edition, Dunod, Paris, 1999 ({{ISBN|2100499483}})
&lt;/ref&gt;
* overpressurization &amp;Delta;P is expressed in Pa;
* ''Q'' is the volumetric flow in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s;
* ''Z'' is the hydraulic impedance, expressed in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/s.
The hydraulic impedance ''Z'' of the pipeline determines the magnitude of the water hammer pulse. It is itself defined by:

::&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{\sqrt{\rho \, B}}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

with:
* ''ρ'' the density of the liquid, expressed in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;;
* ''A'' cross sectional area of the pipe, m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;;
* ''B'' equivalent modulus of compressibility of the liquid in the pipe, expressed in Pa.

The latter follows from a series of hydraulic concepts: 
*compressibility of the liquid, defined by its adiabatic compressibility modulus ''B''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting from the equation of state of the liquid generally available from thermodynamic tables;
*the elasticity of the walls of the pipe, which defines an equivalent bulk modulus of compressibility for the solid ''B''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. In the case of a pipe of circular cross section whose thickness ''t'' is small compared to the diameter ''D'', the equivalent modulus of compressibility is given by the following formula: &lt;math&gt;B = \frac{t}{D} E &lt;/math&gt;; in which ''E'' is the Young's modulus (in Pa) of the material of the pipe;
*possibly compressibility ''B''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; of gas dissolved in the liquid, defined by: &lt;math&gt;B_g = \frac{\gamma}{\alpha} P&lt;/math&gt;
** γ being the [[specific heat ratio]] of the gas
** α the rate of ventilation (the volume fraction of undissolved gas)
** and ''P'' the pressure (in Pa).

Thus, the equivalent elasticity is the sum of the original elasticities:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{B} = \frac{1}{B_l} + \frac{1}{B_{s}} + \frac{1}{B_g}&lt;/math&gt;

As a result, we see that we can reduce the water hammer by:
*increasing the pipe diameter at constant flow, which reduces the flow velocity and hence the deceleration of the liquid column;
* employing the solid material as tight as possible with respect to the internal fluid bulk (solid Young modulus low with respect to fluid bulk modulus);
*introducing a device that increases the flexibility of the entire hydraulic system, such as a hydraulic accumulator;
*where possible, increasing the percentage of undissolved gases in the liquid.

==Dynamic equations==
The water hammer effect can be simulated by solving the following partial differential equations.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}+ \frac{1}{B}\frac{dP}{dt}=0\, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dt}+ \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}+\frac{f}{2D}V|V|=0\, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is the fluid velocity inside pipe, ''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;'' is the fluid density and ''B'' is the '''equivalent''' bulk modulus, ''f'' is the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation|Darcy-Weisbach friction factor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chaudhry |first1=Hanif |title=Applied Hydraulic Transients |date=1979 |publisher=New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Column separation==
Column separation is a phenomenon that can occur during a water-hammer event.  If the pressure in a pipeline drops below the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid, [[cavitation]] will occur (some of the liquid vaporizes, forming a bubble in the pipeline, keeping the pressure close to the vapor pressure).  This is most likely to occur at specific locations such as closed ends, high points or knees (changes in pipe slope).  When subcooled liquid flows into the space previously occupied by vapor the area of contact between the vapor and the liquid increases.  This causes the vapor to condense into the liquid reducing the pressure in the vapor space.  The liquid on either side of the vapor space is then accelerated into this space by the pressure difference.  The collision of the two columns of liquid (or of one liquid column if at a closed end) causes a large and nearly instantaneous rise in pressure.  This pressure rise can damage [[hydraulic machinery]], individual pipes and supporting structures.  Many repetitions of cavity formation and collapse may occur in a single water-hammer event.&lt;ref&gt;Bergeron, L., 1950. Du Coup de Bélier en Hydraulique - Au Coup de Foudre en Electricité. (Waterhammer in hydraulics and wave surges in electricity.) Paris: Dunod (in French). (English translation by ASME Committee, New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1961.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simulation software==
Most water hammer [[software]] packages use the [[method of characteristics]]&lt;ref name=SW/&gt; to solve the [[differential equation]]s involved. This method works well if the wave speed does not vary in time due to either air or gas entrainment in a pipeline. The Wave Method (WM) is also used in various software packages. WM lets operators analyze large networks efficiently. Many commercial and non commercial packages are available.

Software packages vary in complexity, dependent on the processes modeled. The more sophisticated packages may have any of the following features:

:* Multiphase flow capabilities
:* An [[algorithm]] for [[cavitation]] growth and collapse
:* Unsteady friction: the pressure waves dampens as turbulence is generated and due to variations in the flow velocity distribution
:* Varying bulk modulus for higher pressures (water becomes less compressible)
:* Fluid structure interaction: the pipeline reacts on the varying pressures and causes pressure waves itself

==Applications==
* The water hammer principle can be used to create a simple water [[pump]] called a [[hydraulic ram]].
* Leaks can sometimes be detected using water hammer.
* Enclosed air pockets can be detected in pipelines.

The program simulates the view of Earth as seen from a window aboard the ISS, in high-resolution, photographically accurate colors and 3D animations. The views include cloud cover, day and night cycles, night time lights, and other features that help make the exhibit realistic and interactive.&lt;ref name="terc5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://winearth.terc.edu/how_works/ |title=How Windows on Earth Works |accessdate=October 12, 2008 |publisher=TERC |date=2008 |author=TERC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003013414/http://winearth.terc.edu/how_works/ |archivedate=October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earth Visualization Software ==
[[Image:WinEarth screen Peru coast.png|thumb|Screen capture from Windows on Earth showing the coast of Peru with three marked targets, orbital track, and the 10-minute look-ahead.]]

Windows on Earth provides the user a view of Earth from an astronaut's viewpoint, with interactive photorealistic views of Earth as if seen from an altitude of 360&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="terc5"/&gt; The program uses [http://www.geofusion.com GeoFusion's] digital Earth visualization system, which renders accurate views of Earth with terrain, satellite imagery, clouds, and other layers. The system is programmed for user interaction, allowing users to "fly" anywhere they wish to see, and zoom in or out to see details. The system's imagery is derived from [[Landsat program|Landsat]], and features 3D perspective views. Former astronaut [[Jay Apt]] assisted with the color-correction of the images, to help get the most realistic colors as seen from space.&lt;ref name="terc5"/&gt; The program is updated daily to include accurate cloud cover information.&lt;ref name="terc5"/&gt;

== Garriott Mission ==
Windows on Earth flew on board the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). On October 12, 2008, [[Richard Garriott]] launched aboard [[Soyuz TMA-13]] to the ISS as a [[Spaceflight participant]].&lt;ref name="Chron"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/6052360.html|title=$30 million buys Austin resident a ride on Soyuz mission|accessdate=October 12, 2008|publisher=[[The Houston Chronicle]]|date=2008|author=Mark Carreau}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="garriottinspace"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.space.com/news/070928_garriott_spacetourist.html | title = Former Astronaut's Son Signs on as Next Space Tourist|author=Tariq Malik|publisher= SPACE.com | accessdate = 2007-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garriott remained on board the station for 10 days, conducting educational and scientific programs and experiments. Earth observation was one of his prime tasks on this mission, and he used the Windows on Earth system to help him take pictures of specific targets.&lt;ref name="wbz"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://multimedia.wbz.com/m/audio/21089728/visit-outer-space-without-leaving-earth.htm?q=Windows+on+Earth|title=Visit outer space without leaving Earth|accessdate=October 3, 2008|publisher=WBZ Radio|date=2008|author=WBZ Radio}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="terc2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://winearth.terc.edu/garriott_mission/ |title=Richard Garriott’s Mission in October, 2008 |accessdate=October 12, 2008 |publisher=TERC |date=2008 |author=TERC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003021017/http://winearth.terc.edu/garriott_mission/ |archivedate=October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the mission, Richard's photographs, along with ones taken by his astronaut father [[Owen Garriott]], who flew on [[Skylab 3]] (1973) and [[STS-9]] (1983), were made available to the public through Windows on Earth. This provides a unique opportunity for comparing areas of Earth photographed by two generations of space explorers, showing how Earth's surface (and the technology of Earth observation) has changed over 35 years, from 1973 to 2008.&lt;ref name="terc2"/&gt;

== Tool for the ISS ==
In May 2012, [[NASA]] selected Windows on Earth as the new tool to help astronauts identify targets for photography from the ISS.&lt;ref name="Windows on Earth Website"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CASIS Press Release"/&gt;
